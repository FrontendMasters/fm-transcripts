00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.400
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: This is my fifth
workshop for Frontend Masters and I am so

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.350
excited to be doing this.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.910
Yeah, Advanced React Patterns stuff.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.250
So this first slide is just
bunch of little emoji and stuff.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.736
These are all links to things of interest.

6
00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:24.120
So I am somebody who lives in Utah,
works for PayPal.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.710
I have a family and a dog.

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.830
This is links to a picture
of my cute puppy.

9
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.250
My oldest is not even six yet.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.760
So I don’t know why we got a dog.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.900
But we did and she's adorable.

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.409
Yeah, a whole bunch of other things.

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.160
So, just to set expectations for
the workshop.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.584
This is extremely hands-on.

15
00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:53.216
So, I'm actually trying something little
bit different from one I've done before.

16
00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:58.720
Before, I've had these exercises
that I will demo something for

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.850
you and then you'll do something
almost identical to what I did.

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.520
And then I'll do that again what
you did to go through the solution.

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.710
This time, I'm actually just
showing you the general like,

20
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
this is what the end result should
look like from a usability standpoint.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510
This is a problem that we're solving.

22
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.631
And then I just unleash you to that and

23
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:25.976
there are really laid out comments and
stuff to help you along.

24
00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.073
And then I'll be walking
around to help with stuff and

25
00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:30.150
then I'll work through the solution.

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.780
So, it is very, very hands on.

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.130
This is definitely advanced content so
if you are inexperienced with reactor or

28
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.440
java script, you might have
a little bit of trouble here.

29
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.590
And so, for
those of you who are experienced,

30
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.260
if you can help out in the chat or
here, in person,

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.820
that will solidify your understanding
of these concepts really well.

32
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700
So take advantage of that opportunity.

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.840
And then somebody actually answered my
pre-event survey with exactly this.

34
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.110
They wanted to learn patterns
that put a smile on your face

35
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.560
when you're implementing
components with them.

36
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.220
And that's what these things do for me!

37
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.620
So I thought, well, I'll just add that.

38
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.141
Cuz that's what this is all about.

39
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:16.580
Yeah, this is what it's not.

40
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.210
So pretty much the whole
thing is a toggle component.

41
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.240
It's a component that just
manages one piece of state.

42
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.980
So, how many times do you need
to build a toggle component?

43
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.880
Maybe once.

44
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.160
And how often does that toggle
component need to be as flexible and

45
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.590
advanced as this one?

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.650
Probably never.

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.120
But at the end, we'll convert that into
something that's highly practical.

48
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.850
And you'll see how the patterns that we
have learned with this simple example

49
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.290
can be applied to these
more practical examples.

50
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.790
So, don't be too concerned with that.

51
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.388
And there's a wealth of things
that you can do with react.

52
00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:01.490
We definitely don't have
time to cover them all.

53
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.790
So just prepare yourself for that.

54
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.600
So here is what we are going to cover.

55
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.090
Compound components, render props,
state initalizers, state reducers, control

56
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.376
props, provider pattern, higher order
components and then our bonus Rendux.

57
00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:24.074
So, there you go.

58
00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:26.910
I should´ve made that smaller.

59
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.200
So this is the setup, just go to
the repo and follow the instructions.

60
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.205
Everybody said they set up beforehand, it
should be actually be really, really easy,

61
00:03:36.205 --> 00:03:43.140
especially considering the fact that you
can run the whole thing in code sandbox.

62
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.660
And you don't have to
actually install anything.

63
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.790
So you can do this whole thing
in the browser if you want to

64
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.490
which I think is so cool.

65
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.750
But yeah, if you wanna do it in your own
editor, just follow the instructions.

66
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.830
It should work on any machine.

67
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.840
So as far as logistics, sorry more
boring stuff, if you have questions,

68
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.430
raise your hand.

69
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.520
That's why we do it in
this workshop format.

70
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.200
I love this.

71
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.150
When I do my screencast for Egghead,
that's one thing I really miss out on.

72
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.840
I can set up this whole thing so
the environment is pristine and

73
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.510
there are no weird errors and
stuff, but I don't get any

74
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.690
feedback from anybody watching my videos
until after they're already published.

75
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.940
So your job here is to ask
me the questions that people

76
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.870
two months from now are going to want
to ask when they're watching this.

77
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.730
So please if you have any questions,
please do ask those.

78
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.609
And make any relevant
comments that you like.

79
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.310
That would be really appreciated.

80
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.520
We do have the workshop chatroom for
those of you who are remote or

81
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.230
even those of you who are here in person.

82
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.890
Again, some people may not
get things right away and

83
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.550
they maybe asking questions in the chat.

84
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.310
It's totally cool if you
wanna answer those questions.

85
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.160
That's part of your workshop experience
is helping other people get this.

86
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.860
So definitely take advantage
of that opportunity.

87
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.440
At the end of all of our exercises
we’ll have, so all of our exercises

88
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.200
have tests to validate that you’ve
implemented things correctly.

89
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.340
And for each one of those test files,

90
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.830
there’s an extra test that has
a link to a feedback form.

91
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.170
That's not just a feedback form,
it's an elaboration form.

92
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.600
Scientifically proven,
you reiterate what you've just learned,

93
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.780
you'll retain it better.

94
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.840
And so this is for you.

95
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.920
It's also for me, but it's mostly for
you to reiterate what you've learned so

96
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.640
that you retain this.

97
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.240
And so
please fill that out when you're finished.

98
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.170
If you have any questions from me,
I say anything that is not really relevant

99
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.920
to today's discussion, feel free to ask
those on my ask me anything on GitHub.

100
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.220
And then feel free to follow me on Twitter
cuz I sometimes tweet interesting things,

101
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.210
at least some people think so.

102
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.969
Okay, so this is our routine for today.

103
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.250
I’m gonna start out with explaining why,
and give an intro to the exercise.

104
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.880
And then we’ll do exercises.

105
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.630
And if you are able to and interested
in pair programming with somebody,

106
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.100
that actually can be a really
effective tool at understanding.

107
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.390
And so if you can, then yeah, definitely,

108
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.080
you’re welcome to chat and talk and
invited to do that during the exercise.

109
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.176
And then fill out that form.

110
00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:47.459
Some of the exercises have
a bonus that you can do

111
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:50.682
in addition to the other material.

112
00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:54.381
You can expound on the solution and
make changes so

113
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.816
if you finish early,
see what you can break and

114
00:06:57.816 --> 00:07:02.860
prepare yourself with questions to ask me,
would be really great.

115
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.580
And then try to find opportunities
to help other people.

116
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.080
And if you find like typos and

117
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.500
stuff like that you can also
make pull requests to the repo.

118
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.770
I should actually mention that I have had
two people who have made pull requests,

119
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.140
several pull requests to help
make this workshop even better.

120
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.260
So a huge shout out to these two folks.
