00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.250
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Alrighty, cool.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.540
So, lets go ahead and work through this
and we'll swap out those implementations,

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.120
run the tests, and take a look at this.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.180
So, we're not passing the right
props to the switch component

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.170
because toggler props doesn't exist.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.980
So, lets add toggler props to our

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.820
state and helpers so toggle is a helper,
this togglerProps is also a helper.

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.840
So, what do we normally
need to pass to buttons and

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.630
the switch which is gonna pass
that onto a button onto the hood.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.840
But what a buttons normally need to take?

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.530
Well they'll need an on click.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.280
And also here in my notes I add
we also want an already expanded.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.770
And so we'll just add that already
expanded is this.state.on.

14
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.550
And on click will be this.toggle.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.120
And that actually is all we need to do.

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.550
So this is a prop collection for
anybody who is using this component,

17
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.170
if they want to render a toggler,
whatever that means for

18
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.420
them, these are probably
the props that they need to apply.

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140
Now they could do these
themselves just fine but

20
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.850
it's a common enough case that we're
gonna provide a prop collection for them.

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.753
So does anybody have
questions about this pattern?

22
00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:25.329
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Kind of used in
combination with the rendered props that,

23
00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.187
I don't think that there's any other,
like,

24
00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:31.560
I suppose there could be use
cases with other patterns.

25
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.300
But generally, this, yeah, makes the most
sense as part of the render prop pattern.

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there any downside, or

27
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.610
should any other pattern be used if
it's like a ton of common props?

28
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.990
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: You mean like if
this toggler props is a big object?

29
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.660
Yes, actually and that's prop getters and
we'll talk about that in a sec.

30
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.005
Even with this many props, prop getters
is actually a step up from this.

31
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.198
Good question.
