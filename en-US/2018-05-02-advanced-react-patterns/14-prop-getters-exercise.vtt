00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.530
Actually that's really quick we'll
just look at exercise five's usage and

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.680
see the problem that prop getter solves.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.780
So why is this not enough?

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.010
Well what would happen if I were to say,
all right, so

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.260
this button, I wanted to be a toggle
button but I also have like analytics.

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.480
And I wanna track whenever
the user clicks on this button.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.520
So I'm gonna add an onClick or

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.510
here we'll do just console log click.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.720
Okay we'll save that, we'll go over here,
and we're getting that.

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.220
Wait what?

11
00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.350
It's because I'm not
clicking the right one.

12
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.550
It was like doing the opposite of
what I thought it was going to do.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.870
So, we're getting the click, awesome,
but it's not toggling anymore.

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.780
So who wants to volunteer to
answer why did this happen?

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.250
&gt;&gt; You're overriding that.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah I'm overriding the prop
that I'm getting from toggle props.

17
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.190
Okay simple fix.

18
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.140
We'll just move that down,
and there we go.

19
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.430
I'm toggling sweet.

20
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.640
Wait but
my analytics aren't working anymore.

21
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.480
I did the opposite problem.

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.020
So, this is why prop collection or
prop collections are great but

23
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.920
this is why prop getters are a thing.

24
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.680
So, here's how I would solve that or
here's one way that I can solve that.

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.440
So, I could say okay on click we are going
to be that below and override it and

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.900
then we'll call toggler
props to on click and

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.390
lets just forward all the arge's,
wherever they are I don't care.

28
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.260
Toggler props.

29
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.820
And, there's my solution.

30
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.875
This actually will work.

31
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.740
Ta-da.

32
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.230
So I'm getting both of
my things happening.

33
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.840
But as a user of this component,
I don't like that.

34
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.230
That's like super annoying, and

35
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.060
it almost makes me think, well why
do I even need the toggler process?

36
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.760
What value is that thing giving me anyway?

37
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.830
Well prop getter allows us to have our
cake and eat it too sort of speak.

38
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.250
Where instead of Instead
of spreading an object,

39
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.590
we actually call a function and
that returns an object and we spread that.

40
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.500
And the function accepts all the props
that we want applied to the button.

41
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.150
And then that function's job is
to compose those props together.

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.700
So that at the end results what
we're spreading across the button

43
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.560
are the props should be applied.

44
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.080
And so

45
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.800
the function can be in charge of applying
the onClick both the custom onClick or

46
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.820
onButtonClick as well as a onClick or
the toggle function that it needs.

47
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.470
And what's nice about this is let say that
in the future we change from onClick to on

48
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.800
key press or something like that then
like this will continue to work.

49
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.670
And the consumer of the API doesn't
need to know the implementation details

50
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.930
of what's happening under the hood.

51
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.350
Whereas In this case,
if we change it from onClick to

52
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.220
onKeyPress now they have to go
update our code to make that work.

53
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.570
So that is togglerProps or
that is a prop getters.

54
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.410
And let's go ahead and do that Exercise.

55
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.040
So to do this we're gonna run,
I've got tests all over the place,

56
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.560
let's reset --hard, and
just clean myself up here.

57
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.269
And we'll run, we'll comment this out,
comment this in, run MTMT to run the test.

58
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.930
And let's by the way, sometimes you'll
see this giant red wall of text.

59
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.390
And I'm sorry, blame JS dome.

60
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.530
But yeah,

61
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.630
we're getting a type error because
get toggle props is not a function.

62
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.380
You're supposed to make it.

63
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.620
Okay, let's do that.
