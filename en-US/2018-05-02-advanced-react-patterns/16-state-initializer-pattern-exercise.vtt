00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay, so
this one is state initializers.

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.590
It's actually a pretty simple one.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.140
So there are some situations, and
this isn't render prop-specific.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.840
This could apply to any components, but
it fits nicely in our render props, so

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.170
we're just building on
top of what we have.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.570
But there are some situations where
you might want to have a- Hehre,

7
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.230
let's go to-
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah,

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.720
state initializers.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.700
You get your component
in some sort of state.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.420
You wanna reset that state.

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.630
We've got this reset button.

12
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.826
Set everything back to the initial state.

13
00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:46.290
And in general, you not only want to be
able to reset things back to an initial

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.746
state, but you also want to start
things up in an initial state.

15
00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:55.366
So here we could have our
initial-on be true and

16
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.543
then when this reloads it'll start out.

17
00:00:58.543 --> 00:01:02.914
Well, it should start out and
what the junk?

18
00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:05.150
Right, we haven't implemented that yet.

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.140
Let's go back to the finished example.

20
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.600
Change this to true.

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.610
And that will initialize our
state to a certain spot.

22
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.340
And so, in downshift we have an initial,
a state initializer for

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.182
every piece of state.

24
00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:27.780
There are only actually four pieces
of state and considering the size of

25
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.580
downshift and the utility of it, it's
kinda surprising that that's all you need.

26
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.320
But yeah, we allow you to
pass in the initial value for

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140
any of those pieces of state.

28
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.374
So when it renders, the menu starts
is open, or whatever else you want.

29
00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:49.355
And then we also provide, I'm pretty
sure we provide a reset mechanism.

30
00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:54.000
So, that is the problem that we're
trying to solve is allowing people to

31
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.200
initialize things and
also reset stuff to their original state.

32
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.070
And to do that,
we need to make a couple of changes.

33
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.859
So with that,
feel free to jump into the exercise.

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.220
And I will also do it.

35
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.728
So we'll go into our test number seven.

36
00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:19.946
Swap these.

37
00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.540
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And
run npm t to start up the test.

38
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:31.491
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And we'll get bunch of
errors, because reset is not a function.
