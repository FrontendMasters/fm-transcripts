&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay,
so let's move on and

2
00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:08.210
try to integrate this
with our existing toggle.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.440
So here we've got our internal set state.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.620
We're doing our state reducer thing.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.780
This one is, there's a fair
amount of work you have to do,

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.870
because now it's not only when on toggle
happens, it's when any state changes.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.980
And this is a toggle component we're only
managing the state of a single Boolean.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.070
And so we could probably get away with
skipping this on state change prop.

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.330
But we're using simple examples
to teach practical patterns.

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.110
And so
we're going to over-engineer the simple

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.220
example slightly so that you can apply
this to more practical scenarios.

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.420
And so in practical scenarios, you're
managing more than just one item of state.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.640
And so having a general,
some state changed.

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.620
And here's what it was, prop is useful.

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.690
So yeah, you'll be mostly working
in this internal set state.

16
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.580
You'll also be spending a little
bit of time in default props.

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.300
You'll create a more
generic is controlled.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.120
So rather than is on controlled, you'll
have a is controlled that accepts a prop.

19
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.520
And then the getState as well.

20
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.707
And then you'll just have to,
everywhere that's using this.state,

21
00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:29.530
you'll use this.getState instead.

22
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.440
And when it's all finished.

23
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.146
Yeah, it's much the same
thing that we had before, so.
