00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Let's just
go over the last example,

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.820
where we combine all of
these patterns together.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.261
So let me reset, get us in a good state.

4
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:16.549
And pop open 13 exercise.

5
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.350
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And
then let's go to the Bonus Round.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.020
Rendux.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.350
So this is Redux as a render prop.

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.150
That's what we're implementing.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.680
And we're swapping out all of our toggle,
like,

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.370
boring one property stuff
to our application state.

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.360
So now we can manage our entire
application state using all the same

12
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.560
patterns that we have been using all day.

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.196
So this is what it can do.

14
00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:51.635
It's not very interesting.

15
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.010
But you can control that.

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.720
It's kind of fun, right?

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.238
Woohoo.

18
00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:02.620
So, cool let's take a look
at what the exercise is.

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.963
As far the usage example,

20
00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:13.103
we have this Rendux component now,
not toggle.

21
00:01:13.103 --> 00:01:15.603
And we can provide some initial state for
it.

22
00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:17.220
We can provide a reducer.

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.560
And this is actually just plugged
right into the createStore from Redux.

24
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.020
And based off of all the types,
you return different state and whatever.

25
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.461
From this point on,
it's all just regular Redux stuff.

26
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:34.140
You create a reducer,
all that stuff from Redux.

27
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.480
And then here we have our render prop.

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.110
We're just here accepting a reset.

29
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.640
So we can have that reset button.

30
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.280
But we're also.

31
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.230
You're gonna use the provider
pattern in here as well so

32
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.150
that elsewhere we can use the Rendux
consumer to pull out state.

33
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.727
And that state is gonna
be what we call rendux.

34
00:01:56.727 --> 00:02:00.776
And rendux will have rendux.state,
it'll have rendux.dispatch,

35
00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:04.180
which just points to
the redux store dispatch.

36
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.210
And so on and so forth.

37
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.333
Then we have this special input
that when you type in on,

38
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:14.127
it's gonna update the value
of the toggle to true.

39
00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:15.794
And off and so on and so forth.

40
00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:19.116
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay?

41
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.470
So what I have given you already,
I gave you some,

42
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.790
like, just grunt work stuff so
you don't have to do all of that.

43
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.120
I also did as much of the Redux
specific stuff as possible,

44
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.135
because this isn't a Redux workshop,
so I don't care if you know Redux.

45
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.720
It's totally cool if you don't.

46
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.140
So I did lots of that stuff for you.

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.152
So the render function is your job.

48
00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:53.674
And there are a couple other
things that you'll need to do.

49
00:02:53.674 --> 00:03:00.458
But Cody the Koala took the day off and
will not be helping you with this one.

50
00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.718
So that's tough.

51
00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:11.740
And then there's also the withRendux,
which is actually is just used once here.

52
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.042
Mostly just here to help you have a chance
to implement to a higher-order component.

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.390
So yeah, we can start the test here with,
let's see, npm t to start up the test.

54
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.516
We'll go to these tests and
swap these out.

55
00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:33.260
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And
get started on this exercise.
