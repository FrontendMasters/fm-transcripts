1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.230
We are going to begin our
second exercise of the day,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.830
which is to take an app that
already has some data in it.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.820
And we're going to add some
Facebook Open Graph meta tags.

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.870
Then we're gonna deploy
this website to Heroku.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.580
Just doing another git push Heroku master.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.120
And we're gonna use Facebook's tool to see
the data that's available on our new site.

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.253
So I'm gonna begin by
showing you the data.

8
00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:35.826
I'm gonna show you how to switch Heroku to
this new like little mini app that we're

9
00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:37.390
working on.

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.680
And I'm gonna show you this Facebook
tool that you can use to kind of

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.130
see how your URL looks from
the perspective of Facebook.

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.230
So we'll go in that order.

13
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.830
First off, the data that
you're using looks like this.

14
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.710
And if you installed the JSON-
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.527
&gt;&gt; Thank you,

16
00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:57.960
if you installed the JSON
view Chrome extension,

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.810
you may end up with nice formatting
like I have here on the right.

18
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.190
Otherwise, it might be a bunch of
the same characters all on one line.

19
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.200
But here's what I want you to see
that we've got a list of things.

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.560
And these things have an object
called attributes and

21
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.440
then lots of stuff on those attributes.

22
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.300
All of this data is free for
you to use in your HTML.

23
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.980
So if we look at what we have in our
Open Graph folder here, we've got an index

24
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.560
page and that's gonna represent the list
of courses that we're showing here.

25
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760
These are different courses I teach, and

26
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.850
then a page that represents sort of
the view of an individual course.

27
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.340
So let me run this and
I'll show you the HTML and

28
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.705
then you can kind of see how
everything lines up, run- e opengraph.

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.573
And we'll look at localhost 3000.

30
00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:56.381
And we'll see that it changes from
the deploy instructions to this list you

31
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:57.450
see here.

32
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.618
And each one of these has a URL and when
you click on this, you end up at a page

33
00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:05.065
here that has the description and
the larger image and so on.

34
00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:08.070
And we can go back and and it's fine.

35
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.290
So if you're curious is how this works,
there's a router js file that just

36
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.530
involves fetching data from a URL and
then rendering one of these two HBS files.

37
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.450
You don't need to touch it just in case
you're curious as to how it works.

38
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.054
And the mid of this is in index.hbs and
course.hbs.

39
00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:30.170
Index.hbs is where we're
building this course list.

40
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.490
And you can see here
like this is the h1 tag.

41
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.380
Here's the UL and
then these are the items for each course.

42
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.263
And you can see we do
course.attributes.slug for example.

43
00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:48.745
That we can find in the data,
sorry, like right here.

44
00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:50.854
So that's what we're
using to build our links.

45
00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:54.656
So any of these things that are available
in the attribute section or

46
00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:58.938
these JSON objects themselves, there
are available to you in order to use.

47
00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:03.780
In particular I want you to pay attention
to image info because you'll need to

48
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.340
kind of pick the appropriate one for
Facebook.

49
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.370
Just a hint, one of these images
begins with the letters fb.

50
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.930
I don't know maybe that's
a hint of some sort.

51
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.050
So here's what we wanna do.

52
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.360
So here's the API endpoint and
it's in this slide.

53
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.150
You can click the link.

54
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.990
You can see it in your browser.

55
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.100
I advise that JSON view Chrome extension.

56
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.030
Hopefully you can kind of understand
that this is HTML with extras,

57
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.535
this hbs file here.

58
00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:38.920
And you don't have to touch the each,
but just understand that this L-I thing,

59
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.370
this is repeated over and
over again for the list of courses.

60
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.860
So if you change something
in here like if I did this,

61
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.560
if I did like three tildes before it,
we would see when we

62
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.690
refresh the page there are three
tildes in front of everything.

63
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.500
So it's sort of just,
it's almost like looping over it.

64
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.220
It is looping over it.

65
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.940
So anything you change here would end
up changing and then in course.hbs,

66
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.300
we end up using just the variable course
in these little expressions here.

67
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.400
So that's where we get course colon and

68
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.530
then the name of the course
that's coming from this tag here.

69
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.980
So just look at the data,
look at that section called attributes,

70
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.590
make reasonable assumptions
about what you can use.

71
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.966
Like if we copy this and
paste it elsewhere.

72
00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.460
We'll paste it twice,
we'd end up with the course title twice.

73
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.248
So it kinda works the way
you would expect it to work.

74
00:04:36.248 --> 00:04:39.373
And if you wanna learn
more about handlebars,

75
00:04:39.373 --> 00:04:42.264
check out the Intro to Ember 2.x series.

76
00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:46.556
The first couple sections of that course
will give you a little bit more depth

77
00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:49.040
into how templates like this work.

78
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.730
You shouldn't need to
go all that deep today.

79
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.533
So, the last thing I wanna show you
is the Facebook open graph debugger.

80
00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:04.666
So you have a link to this in the slide
in the deck that had all of my favorite

81
00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:05.170
tools.

82
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.590
It was the first slide in the SEOO,
or in the social metadata section.

83
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.730
And this is what the tool looks like,
right?

84
00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:20.470
It basically starts with a single field,
and you paste a URL in that.

85
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.970
So we can do that with,
I'll pick one of my courses here.

86
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.960
Or we can just do it like this, yeah.

87
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.360
So do embercli Basics,
grab this URL, paste.

88
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.984
So you can see here I have,

89
00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:45.600
I'm missing my OG type property which
means I'm falling back to a website.

90
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.100
So that's a warning, that's not an error.

91
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.920
But you can see here's my canonical URL.

92
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.280
Here's my link preview.

93
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.400
You see I've got a description here,
I've got a title.

94
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.520
And then here we can see the different
meta tags that it's found.

95
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.180
And it's sort of resolve to so
here I left out OG type but

96
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.450
it's falling back to website.

97
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.310
So I see the value for website here.

98
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.660
You can actually open this up and

99
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.040
see all of the different metadata
that was available on this type.

100
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.980
And you can even see, we're gonna start
dealing with Twitter later on and

101
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.740
I have some more stuff there.

102
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.830
So you're gonna use this Open Graph
tool and put your Heroku URLs in here.

103
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.740
Both for the Index page and each course
and we should see like the thumbnail come

104
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.170
up really nicely,
we should see a nice description.

105
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.411
You should help Facebook figure out how
to make it so that when we share links

106
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:40.510
from the site, you have a nice
rich tile instead of just a URL.

107
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:48.589
And then I will go through my solution
to this in about 20 minutes and

108
00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.490
we'll see where we're at.

109
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.620
But all of the meta tags that you need to
use are things we've already discussed.

110
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.040
So just remember, look at the JSON,
look at the Open Graph debugger.

111
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.400
And if you have any questions about
handlebars, or like what you're allowed

112
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.030
to do in there, just shout out and I will
come and make sure you have what you need.

113
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.230
See you in 20 minutes.
