00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.010
Let's talk a little bit about a specific
niche of businesses, and those

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.595
are ones that have a physical location
like Frontend Masters does, right?

3
00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:12.860
Frontend Masters is interesting in
that it has a physical location for

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.830
in person workshops, right?

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.780
But they also target customers who
are interested in buying up membership for

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.120
video courses globally.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.150
So, when you have a physical location and
can take advantage of that, you want

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.325
to make sure that first and foremost you
complete your Google My Business page.

9
00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.520
And they'll actually mail you a postcard

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.720
with a code on it that
you have to type in.

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.260
That's their way of verifying that
you actually are at that address and

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.810
that it is factual information there.

13
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.390
What you're doing is you're establishing
your presence in Google's Knowledge Graph.

14
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.721
So if you ever searched for a business
name or potentially like a movie, and

15
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:57.501
you see that rich tile show up on
the right side of search results,

16
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.461
that's a Knowledge Graph tile.

17
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.311
And that's not relevant information,

18
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:07.030
that is factual,
verified information about that entity.

19
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.310
And so when you can fill in
your My Business page and

20
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.475
put your hours of operation and
your phone number and your address,

21
00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:17.370
like this is a great way to show up for
high intent users that are saying,

22
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.170
I already know I want to search for this
particular business, or this product, or

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.120
this app, now like show it to me, and

24
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.860
that you have a lot of control over how
you're presented, in search results.

25
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.570
And you have to be above a certain
threshold of relevance to get

26
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.190
these Knowledge Graph tiles,
but it doesn't hurt.

27
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.310
All of the approaches I'm taking today,
we'll see that I advocate for

28
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.410
like doing everything that you can and
that way in the future,

29
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.000
if you do cross some of
these these thresholds.

30
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.170
And we do see that social networks and
search engines evolve

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.240
in the way that they're indicating they're
evolving, like you will already have

32
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.169
the data all over your important content
to take advantage of tomorrow's features.

33
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.970
So, make sure that you are set to
receive reviews for your business.

34
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.360
The big places to look for reviews, for
sort of generic businesses are Google.

35
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.180
So these are the reviews that
are integrated with Google Maps,

36
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.800
you have star ratings.

37
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.700
Facebook is also a place where you'll
get a good star rating coming back.

38
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.730
Those will both show up in
search results as ratings.

39
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.090
So you'll see a star rating show
up right next to your business and

40
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.950
that is that is social proof, right?

41
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.552
That is you presenting to your
customers that you do a good job.

42
00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:43.220
Often times people try to incentivize
like leaving a review and

43
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.250
you'll get a coupon and
something like that.

44
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.285
So you want to just motivate as many
people to leave positive feedback as

45
00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:48.880
possible.

46
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.230
&gt;&gt; I'll just add that as we enable
the reviews on Facebook and

47
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.670
it was actually surprising how many
people reviewed it like right away cuz

48
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.650
Facebook actually sends them a message or
whatever pops it up like, hey,

49
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.260
what do you think of Frontend Masters,
like leave a review or whatever and

50
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.030
people have been saying some really
cool stuff, so it's a good thing to do.

51
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.890
I didn't even know that existed
until like two weeks ago,

52
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.848
&gt;&gt; You would have known today,

53
00:03:13.848 --> 00:03:15.405
I would have told you.

54
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:16.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

55
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.170
&gt;&gt; And so

56
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.690
one thing that Frontend Masters
does that is effective

57
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.710
is you have these live events on Facebook.

58
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.580
And I believe at attendees of those live
events will be prompted after the fact

59
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.510
to review their experience
of attending that event.

60
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.380
So anytime that you can sort of loop
users in to having accountability

61
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.150
from the networks to sort of leave some
feedback, right, that's not your business

62
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.700
saying, please leave us a review but it's
Facebook saying like we saw you're here.

63
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.560
With one tap, give them a star rating.

64
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.250
Do you have anything else to say?

65
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.330
And building that kind of history and

66
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.370
that kind of social proof behind
your brand is really important.

67
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.690
So, local business
directories are a really easy

68
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.730
first step to building links
referring back to your site.

69
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.140
So if you have a chamber of commerce or

70
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.780
equivalent entity in your
area that is a really easy,

71
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.680
like highly trusted, highly influential
source that can refer back to your site.

72
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.040
They often keep a listing of all of
the members of their business so like,

73
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.090
if it's a couple hundred bucks to make
a donation to the Chamber of Commerce.

74
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.040
Like you will actually get proportionally
like more SEO value out of that,

75
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.980
then you're likely to get from
spending that same amount of money

76
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.630
on ads to try to show up to
customers again and again, right?

77
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.870
You start to look like a local authority.

78
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.610
And by the way,
mobile search indices oftentimes will bias

79
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.780
local results as well,
particularly if you're like a brick and

80
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.540
mortar business where you have
customers coming in like,

81
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.620
search engines identify that kind
of search and will favor like,

82
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.088
you're looking for Thai food and
here's a restaurant down the street.

83
00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:12.260
So you wanna make sure that
whenever you move offices,

84
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.810
that you update your address
everywhere possible,

85
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.920
because what will happen is customers will
potentially find wrong information and

86
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.240
they'll flag it as incorrect and
that will suppress your SEO a little bit.

87
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.550
And at the very least,
it'll start to erode some of that

88
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.490
subtle trust you get from knowing like,
this is the address, these are the hours,

89
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.070
here's the phone number,
this is an established company.

90
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.270
If it's sort of like, we're not sure
where this place actually is, and

91
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.060
I see this one address over here and
this other one over here,

92
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.510
that is a less positive and
concrete face to put forward.

93
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.270
So if you have other
businesses that you work with,

94
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.290
like vendors, partners, so,
for example, I work with

95
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.810
a couple consultancies who don't offer
training services in and of themselves.

96
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.180
They refer back to my training site, so

97
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.570
that you can indicate that like,
these people like they trust my site and

98
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.760
they're referring to me as
their authority on training.

99
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.270
That's an easy one to get.

100
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.108
Just make sure that you are tasteful in
the way that you link back and forth.

101
00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:24.610
You don't wanna be doing like link
trading, which we'll get into later as

102
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.120
sort of one of the negative, like black
hat things that search engines pick up on.

103
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.650
And then finally in the Google Search
Console, which is a free tool that pretty

104
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.500
much everyone should should put their URLs
through to see how they appear online.

105
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.720
There are ways you can indicate that
you are in fact a local business and

106
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.450
you're opting into showing up in
relevant local search results.

107
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.540
So, these are some great tips
if you have a physical location,

108
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.000
if you have walk-in customers, or
even vendors that visit you on sight,

109
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.190
definitely worth filling
this kind of thing out.

110
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.250
My business in particular, my training
business is sort of, its virtual so

111
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.960
I'm not at my address to receive
a customer if they come and visit me.

112
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.310
So this kind of thing would not
apply to that type of business.
