00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.960
So with that,

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.640
let's build on the exact same example
we were working on with Twitter.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.820
Except this time,
sorry we were working on it for Facebook.

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.310
Now we are going to add
the extra Twitter metadata.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.320
Don't worry about adding it to
the index at HBS page, you would add

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.600
a bunch of the same stuff that that would
pertain to, like it's not as interesting

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.162
as the course page where we have the image
and the name of the course and so on.

8
00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:26.980
I wanna show you how you can validate it.

9
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.935
Twitter has its own validator and
we will take a look at it presently.

10
00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:43.357
So It's

11
00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:48.550
another link in that nice,
big list of links.

12
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.170
The list of, I think it was six links and
we're going to look at five or

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.690
it was five links and
we're going to look at four.

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.040
But it's cards-dev.twitter.com/validator.

15
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.030
And this is what it looks like.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.130
So, we give it a URL.

17
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.191
And so if we give it our heroku URL,
for example,

18
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:12.075
we can see what it looks like as is.

19
00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:16.350
Might be smart enough to
pluck some things out.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.850
Let's see.

21
00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:21.840
Interesting.

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.550
So we only have one image on there,

23
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.430
this is it trying to make
reasonable assumptions.

24
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.760
I've done I've worked really hard
to make my image thumbnails so

25
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.440
that they're wide but
also cropped down really well.

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.560
It turns out that this is a square image,
right?

27
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.990
So it's like eliminating,
it's basically finding this square here.

28
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.520
I'm sure they have an algorithm in
there that's figuring out that like,

29
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.250
This is all colored background area.

30
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.960
So it looks pretty good but what I
want is to have that nice wide image.

31
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.295
I want something that looks like this.

32
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.094
Here's where we find out
if I did my SEO properly.

33
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.268
So if I grab this, and pass it in.

34
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:14.210
Better.

35
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.300
So that's the summary large image so
much better.

36
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.270
Like this is gone from like
a little icon decorating your link

37
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.710
to like the picture being the main thing.

38
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.520
You're gonna see way more engagement for

39
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.720
stuff like this when they get shared
compared to the little cards.

40
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.540
So what I want us to do is make it so

41
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.590
that our app looks just like this using
the summary large image card type.

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.310
Does that make sense?

43
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.830
Here's an indication that I've been
whitelisted on this page here.

44
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.854
I can show you what
the Player Card looks like, and

45
00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:54.325
it'll indicate that I have been
whitelisted there as well, hopefully.

46
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.510
See I am whitelisted for Player Card.

47
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.034
It would just say I am not whitelisted and
give you a link to a form you can

48
00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:08.578
fill in which just says why should
we grant you access to Player Cards?

49
00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:13.250
And then you just, because the whole
world is concerned with bridging

50
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.841
the [COUGH] gap between native apps,
[LAUGH] you know, React Native and

51
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:22.530
writing extensions and swift and
connecting it to JavaScript.

52
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.840
You see here I've done a much
better job of my keyframe.

53
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.931
This was the the first slide of a deck
that I was going through in my talk and

54
00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:32.563
like this is how you can
expect it will show up.

55
00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:37.477
If I was really slick I would have
made something that would get

56
00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:41.458
cropped nicely,
even in this scenario, right.

57
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:45.170
And I would have on YouTube said like,
this is my cover slide.
