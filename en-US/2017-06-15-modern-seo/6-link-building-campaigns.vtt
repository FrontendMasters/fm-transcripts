00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.304
Once we've found some keywords and

2
00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:05.667
we've potentially identified
using those keywords.

3
00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.273
A collection of relevant sites,

4
00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:14.321
we're ready to build our to start what's
called a link building campaign and

5
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:20.470
this is a concerted effort to get
people to start referring to your app.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.950
So the first tip I have for you there
is build a handful of relevant URLs.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.040
These should be like pages that
you spend a lot of time on and

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.348
that you curate carefully.

9
00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:35.500
And you're gonna want to never change
these URLs because over time, like over

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.590
a matter of years, you want to build a lot
of references pointing to these things.

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740
You don't want to,

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.230
you want to make sure that these are what
we call canonical URLs, canonical URLs.

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.740
And that means you're gonna strip
off the query params from these,

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.010
strip any like session ID stuff from them,
take off any like hash portion of the URL.

15
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.878
And the reason is when search engines
start trying to create like, counts as to

16
00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:08.071
who's referring to what those are regarded
as completely separate URLs, right?

17
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:12.955
And so you want to focus your efforts on
a small number of targets because your

18
00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:16.616
goal is not to just get a whole
bunch of like you don't want

19
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.560
a whole bunch of pennies
you want $100 bill, right?

20
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.976
You want a couple high-value things
that are gonna consistently show up and

21
00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:29.806
you're gonna be deliberate about the way
you place these things relevant to topics

22
00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:31.050
that you care about.

23
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.914
So, front end masters might have,
I know they have one page per course, but

24
00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:39.794
it would not be a terrible idea
to have tracks where you have.

25
00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:43.604
The JavaScript track where you start
out with intro to web development, and

26
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.050
then you move on to more advanced topics.

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.020
And then finally, we have advanced
functional JavaScript at the end.

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.280
Because now anything that relates to that,

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.410
even as new courses land,
they could update that track.

30
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.320
And that's sort of a permanent
entity that lives even when my

31
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.630
ember one point x course, I don't even
have an ember two point x course but

32
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.320
like ten years from now.

33
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.600
When we're on Ember 17 like my
contents not going to be relevant, but

34
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.250
JavaScript still will be.

35
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.820
So you wanna make sure that these
are things that have a long lifetime and

36
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.060
you wanna use the same
collection of links.

37
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.450
Just a handful of them.

38
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.030
Over and over.
&gt;&gt; They call those topic pages.

39
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.610
I think that's the word
people started calling them.

40
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.340
&gt;&gt; That sounds right topic pages.

41
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.040
So, there is a term you may come
across called link velocity and

42
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.280
this is just the rate at which inbound
links to your presence grow over time.

43
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.320
Generally, this is weighted by PageRank or
the equivalent, so link velocity is

44
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.800
sort of the rate at which you're
gaining credibility amongst your peers.

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.690
An easy way to get some of this
link building started is to do

46
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.060
guest blog posts.

47
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.340
So if none of you have ever run
sort of a content oriented site,

48
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.580
you're always looking for
your next post like it is.

49
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.870
It is a lot of effort to write blog posts.

50
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.460
And if someone comes to you with like a
really high quality piece of content, and

51
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.540
they say, hi, I'm in your space,
I'm not necessarily competitor.

52
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.980
But maybe this is like
a trade organization.

53
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.230
Like, here you go.

54
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.090
Here's some content.

55
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.660
I wrote this.

56
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.620
I was thinking that you might
post this like you will,

57
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.290
you will get a favorable
response more often than not.

58
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.350
Another thing that I'm, I'd like to
demonstrate to you is a way to like look

59
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.960
at your competitors and to figure out
which keywords they're targeting and

60
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.070
what aspect of SEO
they're oriented towards.

61
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.650
SpyFu is my preferred tool for this.

62
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.290
So unlike some of the SEO tools,

63
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.830
a SpyFu actually gives you some valuable
stuff without you having to pay for it.

64
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.670
So we're gonna take
a look at that briefly.

65
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.710
&gt;&gt; So
this strategy wouldn't quite work for

66
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.050
a single page application maybe
where you set up a link campaign.

67
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.670
&gt;&gt; Good question about
single page apps versus SEO.

68
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.030
So I'm going to choose to dive
into that topic in general.

69
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.480
I like rather than try to answer
that question specifically so

70
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.970
modern web crawlers,
they will actually run JavaScript.

71
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.350
And so single page apps will
very often get picked up.

72
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.570
However, with the people
who designed crawlers,

73
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.650
it's sort of an efficiency game, right?

74
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.880
So the faster they can chew through
a set of URLs and completely crawl them,

75
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.380
the more often they'll get to like refresh
their content, and they'll be up to date.

76
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.140
So there's a constant drive to be more and
more efficient.

77
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.250
Rumor has it that many
crawlers will give up

78
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.620
executing JavaScript at a particular time.

79
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.620
So if you're relying on
client side rendering,

80
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.310
what can happen is if the thresholds
that two and a half seconds, and

81
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.000
you're still downloading your
client side JavaScript, and

82
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.730
you have a loading spinner on the page,
like the clock is gonna stop.

83
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.410
And whatever your HTML is at that moment,
that may be what ends up getting indexed.

84
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.330
What I would advise, instead is to look
at server side rendering solutions.

85
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.500
Which are available for
most of the single page app frameworks.

86
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.080
So when I build Ember apps,
I use fast boot, which will serve up

87
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.980
like SEO ready HTML with
the actual HTTP response.

88
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.520
And then sort of the client side app kicks
in when the the JavaScript app downloads

89
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.540
a second later.

90
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.630
But single page apps should work with SEO,

91
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.500
sync server side rendering is a way
that you can make sure you get it right.

92
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.130
There are contexts where your JavaScript
is not run on the client side,

93
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.450
sorry when it's not run by a crawler, but

94
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.690
these would be like sharing your link
on Facebook or Twitter or iMessage.

95
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.120
These are sort of the non search engine

96
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.680
in richmonds that require
those meta tags to be present.

97
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.640
So they don't, they won't even
download that JavaScript resource.

98
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.670
They'll just go with whatever
the HTML is that comes back.

99
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.500
So here, we have SpyFu.

100
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.550
And let's let me blow
this up a little bit.

101
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.390
So it starts with,
enter your competitors website.

102
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.300
So just to keep things relevant here.

103
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.530
We'll look at front end masters,
since we all know what that's about.

104
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.956
So it's kind of chewing through
its data on front end masters and

105
00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:44.830
what we're going to see is that
it has 207 organic keywords here.

106
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.418
You could create an account
to see more results and

107
00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:53.350
pay to see even more results,
but we're starting to see that.

108
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.180
Here are the highly ranked keywords
that relate to front end masters.

109
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.170
So here,
a number nine rank like this is sort of

110
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.620
extremely relevant to this
business whose URL we typed in.

111
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.440
So front end is that a scene is like,
right on target for

112
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.730
what this content is all about,
which seems right.

113
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.442
And we can also see that, if we look at
other sites, so I'm just gonna look at

114
00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:24.910
LinkedIn.com because they're
gonna have some other data here.

115
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.670
So you can see here they have a ton
of keywords, a lot of clicks, and

116
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.890
they can even attempt to guess
like what the AdWords budget is.

117
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.830
Based on how often those ads show up and
the estimated cost of those

118
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.910
keywords so this like,
this is an invaluable tool.

119
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.150
If you come up with
a list of competitors and

120
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.030
run through Spyfu, you can figure
out like where basically build

121
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.650
on top of the research they've
already done and try to hone in on.

122
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.810
The same little pockets that
they're honing in on and

123
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.300
probably add a couple more of your own.

124
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.099
So I love using this tool.

125
00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:04.802
Frankly, I don't pay for it.

126
00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:11.694
But if I were building a business
where SEO was like a huge driver for

127
00:08:11.694 --> 00:08:16.720
new business, this would definitely be.

128
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.480
Probably a good place to invest
some money in actual membership.
