1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.080
Let's move on to the next social network,
which is Twitter.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.540
So Twitter will, once we start doing a
very similar exercise in the same folder,

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.300
we're gonna build on the Open Graph
folder again for the next exercise.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.990
You'll see that we have to do
only a little bit of extra work

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.630
to make things look great for Twitter.

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.340
For one, they are now officially
honoring Open Graph tags.

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910
So for title and description,
you can put that in there once, and

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.990
you make both of these parties happy.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.910
There are a couple different
tags that we do have to add, and

10
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.985
there's a little bit different
treatment of images,

11
00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:46.040
because they want a different
size than what we give Facebook.

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.106
So we're gonna cover all of that ground
that you need to layer on top of this

13
00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:54.303
thing that we've already built to make it
show up on Twitter in as rich a way as

14
00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:55.510
possible.

15
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.730
But first,
let's talk about these three tags.

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.350
So we've got card, site, and creator.

17
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.140
When we think about card,
this is almost like the equivalent of

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.530
the og:type meta tag that we use for
Open Graph.

19
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.800
And this really has a strong effect.

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.010
It has a big effect on how
your card is rendered.

21
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.750
So this is what you get if you have
a twitter:card of type summary.

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.288
You provide an image of the right size,
right?

23
00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:30.371
You get something that looks like this.

24
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:35.360
If we go with a summary_large_image card,
you get a much larger image,

25
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.394
like a more widescreen orientation,
instead of a square.

26
00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:42.353
And the title and
description are placed underneath it.

27
00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:47.170
So whenever possible, large images
are gonna get way more engagement.

28
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.222
So you want to, unless you have some
constraint where you've only got tiny

29
00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:57.370
little images, and they look like crap
when you size them up, aim for this.

30
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.410
People will want to click on it much more.

31
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.563
In addition, so
those two work on any site.

32
00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:09.333
We're gonna be able to
get those working today.

33
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.563
There is another type
that you have to ask for

34
00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:17.992
permission to be whitelisted for,
and that is a player card.

35
00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:23.720
And so is one that I use for my talks, my
conference talks that I put on my website,

36
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.580
where you get a video player
that's embedded right in the tile.

37
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.570
And you see you can click that
Play button, and it will work.

38
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.520
There are ways to get your
keyframe to show up properly.

39
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.000
So that's a good video tip here,
by the way.

40
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.604
Make sure that the keyframe of your
video is, which is sort of like this,

41
00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:45.388
the image that is there before
you start playing the video.

42
00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:49.368
Oftentimes, you can upload an image
that's not an actual frame of the video.

43
00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:53.152
And you can have the title across it,
and a little picture of yourself, or

44
00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:56.270
whatever is appropriate there,
but you can use it.

45
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.190
Almost like the cover of a DVD, where it's
an opportunity to sort of decorate things,

46
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.370
and brand them a little bit.

47
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.270
In this case, I have screwed that up.

48
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.670
It is still screwed up, right?

49
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.540
I don't claim to be someone that
practices what I preach, but

50
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.890
all of these things I'm describing
to you are on my to-do list.

51
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.600
So it is nice though that I can share
a conference talk, and then someone

52
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.770
right within the Twitter app can start
playing it, and it'll start playing.

53
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.470
I'm not hosting my own videos.

54
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.530
So part of what you have to provide
when you use the player card is

55
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.340
the URL of a video, right,
the actual source of the video file.

56
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.590
And then you can say here is the URL
of the webpage containing that video.

57
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.060
So I found a middle ground here
where I shared a YouTube video.

58
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.579
And I figured out from a YouTube video ID
the form of that URL for the source video.

59
00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.555
So I'm pointing to YouTube for that.

60
00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:57.842
But I'm pointing to my own site for
if you clicked on the body of this card,

61
00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.910
you would go there, not to YouTube.

62
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.512
So you can find a nice little medium
there where you sort of hedge between I

63
00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:09.355
don't wanna host my own video,
cuz that's not my business.

64
00:04:09.355 --> 00:04:13.950
Frontend Masters would certainly
host our own video, right, yes?

65
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.282
&gt;&gt; If you were doing this kind of thing,
would you have

66
00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:25.487
the impulse to put your video
as a two minute preview thing?

67
00:04:25.487 --> 00:04:31.244
Or would you actually want the player to
have your full however many hours video?

68
00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:32.810
&gt;&gt; That is a great question.

69
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.580
So if we go back to being
objective driven, sir, and

70
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.080
I'm sorry, I'm not picking on you.

71
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.320
I know it's the second time I've
used that as the response here.

72
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.850
You want people to eventually
end up on your site, right?

73
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.530
So maybe you've got intercom,
or some embedded chat, and

74
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.600
you wanna try to engage with them.

75
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.230
Maybe you have a call to action that
you're ultimately trying to get

76
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.090
people to sign up.

77
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.780
Oftentimes, it's useful to have a public
video that's available that you're

78
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.730
sharing.

79
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.288
And then at the end, you can have some
of these little hot zones where you

80
00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:10.204
can click right within the video surface
where they can pick up from there, and

81
00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:11.234
see the full thing.

82
00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:16.680
But that'll be a link to your site where
you might have if you're using YouTube,

83
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.940
you'd have a an unlisted video
that's embedded in your site.

84
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.010
So people couldn't come across
that via organic search, but

85
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.120
they will be able to see
the whole thing on your site.

86
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.470
The downside there is that's two
videos with two sets of ratings.

87
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.656
And so if someone shares this,
or they like it,

88
00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:40.929
you don't know if they're gonna like it
in the preview, or like both of them.

89
00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:44.064
And so it's sort of a judgment call.

90
00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:47.210
This would be a good thing to split test,
for sure.

91
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.793
I think if your primary product is videos,

92
00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:56.771
I wouldn't hesitate to
show the whole thing.

93
00:05:56.771 --> 00:06:01.595
If your primary product is videos,
I would do a teaser, and

94
00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.305
then the full thing on your site.

95
00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:08.278
In my case,
my primary thing is training people.

96
00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:14.389
And so if I give a talk fluent about web
security, I'm fine with that being public.

97
00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.340
I've already given it
out in a public setting.

98
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.300
And in fact, the conference has
probably already published it.

99
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.830
So at least here though, I will tend to,
sorry conference organizers,

100
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.020
I will tend to post it on my own site and
share that, rather than sharing it from

101
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.730
their site, because I want
the traffic to come into me.

102
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.810
&gt;&gt; So it'd be the question between if
it's more interesting to the objective to

103
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.430
get people into your actual website,
versus I want a view on this video.

104
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.310
&gt;&gt; If you wanna view on the video,
put the video out there.

105
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.330
If you want people to
come to your website,

106
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.520
give them a delicious little breadcrumb.

107
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.434
And then they'll follow you into their
site, but then carefully craft that

108
00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:02.449
thing to where that video is
wrapping up with more available.

109
00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.106
Here are the things we're gonna cover.

110
00:07:04.106 --> 00:07:09.021
And make it a proper call to action at
the end, rather than just for more,

111
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:09.919
click here.

112
00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.674
Make it enticing, and
put that in the video, right?

113
00:07:12.674 --> 00:07:16.420
Make the pitch to them with a person,
right?

114
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.180
But a great card here, it's not hard.

115
00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:25.520
There are no qualifications to having
to put the player card in here,

116
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.960
except that you must have already
put the metadata in place.

117
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.980
And then submit it to Twitter, and

118
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.100
they just wanna see that you
have set your stuff up properly.

119
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.425
My suspicion is it may be just
a bandwidth concern on their end,

120
00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:44.915
where they don't want tons of
people putting themselves forward

121
00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:49.011
as we have these player cards,
and here are tons of videos.

122
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:52.024
And it's just an attempt to
get people to engage more.

123
00:07:52.024 --> 00:07:56.474
But really, it's not real content,
if that makes sense,

124
00:07:56.474 --> 00:08:00.837
cuz it's a heavier file to
download than an image, yeah?

125
00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:03.680
&gt;&gt; When you say you're asking for
permission, are you asking for

126
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.188
permission per page-
&gt;&gt; Per domain.

127
00:08:05.188 --> 00:08:05.813
&gt;&gt; Per source?

128
00:08:05.813 --> 00:08:06.701
&gt;&gt; Per domain.

129
00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:07.276
&gt;&gt; Per domain.

130
00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:08.946
&gt;&gt; So your domain has to be whitelisted.

131
00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:09.514
&gt;&gt; Okay.

132
00:08:09.514 --> 00:08:13.830
&gt;&gt; So I'll show you an example of
the rejection notice we get from

133
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.078
the Heroku URLs.

134
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.964
They probably want it to be like,
it's nice for it to be an HTTPS domain,

135
00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:22.840
cuz then they can see this person
bought an SSL certificate.

136
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.930
Maybe they're an extended
validation thing that

137
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.110
I don't know what
the verification process is.

138
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.524
All I know is I haven't really heard
of people getting rejected from it.

139
00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:36.780
And it took me about two days for
them to come back, right?

140
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.920
And I just have conference talks on there.

141
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.949
I'm not a huge moneymaker,
in terms of people watching these things.

142
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.300
There's another kind of Twitter
card called an app card, and

143
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.030
this links to an app store of some sorts.

144
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.600
If you look closely at this,
you can see that we see a rating at

145
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.030
the bottom of the description that tells
us how many reviews there are, and

146
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.607
what the average review was.

147
00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:08.377
In this, you'll want to use one
of these services that will,

148
00:09:08.377 --> 00:09:13.718
based on user agent, send people
to the appropriate app store link.

149
00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:18.220
You get one URL to use here
as what you're sharing.

150
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.350
And obviously,
some people need the iPhone app.

151
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.310
Some people need the Android app,
and there are plenty of services.

152
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.450
And people sometimes build their
own services where you hit them.

153
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.520
And then if it looks like an Android
device, you go here, and iOS goes there.

154
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.620
So there were two meta tags that I
showed you when we first started doing,

155
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.220
going through Twitter, and
they were site and creator.

156
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.431
These are not visible currently, but
I wanted to show you the 2013 API.

157
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:53.740
The look and feel of Twitter, because at
any time, Twitter could change their UI.

158
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.206
And you want your metadata to be in place,
so that if they start to resurface some of

159
00:09:58.206 --> 00:10:02.511
these things, which by the way, these
are things they still ask people to do.

160
00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:07.250
They still recommend that you place
these meta tags in your HTML.

161
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.540
They may elect to surface these again.

162
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:16.010
So what we're seeing
here is it is a tweet, or

163
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.120
a link that was shared that is associated
with a Twitter account called the WebMate.

164
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.920
So that would be the site.

165
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.640
That's the site, the WebMate, right?

166
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.744
And you can see they get a link and
their Twitter avatar next to that,

167
00:10:30.744 --> 00:10:34.571
because we basically say this
is the site's Twitter account.

168
00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:36.696
This corresponds with
this Twitter account.

169
00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:37.373
Below that,

170
00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:41.507
the second arrow points to the actual
author who has their own Twitter account.

171
00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:45.026
So they get credit for
writing this article as well, so

172
00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:49.080
that is the disambiguation
between a creator and a site.

173
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.112
Usually it will be a business, and then
an individual person that is the author.

174
00:10:53.112 --> 00:10:58.893
And again, you will not see
these pieces of data showing

175
00:10:58.893 --> 00:11:03.814
up in April 2017 Twitter UI
that I can tell.

176
00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:10.491
And I've only checked Windows and web,
or I've checked the Windows native app,

177
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:15.410
the OSX native app, and
the web experience and the iOS app.

178
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.180
So maybe it's on Android.

179
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.780
But at some point, it looked like this.

180
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.680
And at any time, it could go back.

181
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.190
So strongly advise you put it
in there if it's pertinent.

182
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.260
This would be for The New York Times
Fine Arts page, and here's the author.

183
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.340
That's the appropriate context for this.

184
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.140
&gt;&gt; As a note on that, for a while,

185
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.310
they were actually using that as
a permission into Twitter analytics.

186
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.250
&gt;&gt; Yes, so this is still definitely
used in Twitter analytics.

187
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.834
It's just not surface to users.

188
00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:50.630
So that's a good benchmarking tool,
right, for which of my authors

189
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.930
are writing about the hottest things
that are getting the most engagement?

190
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.040
But it's not visible in user land,
as far as I know.

191
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.970
So the image requirements for Twitter
are a little different than Facebook.

192
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.480
So for the summary image, right, that was
the first card that I showed you with

193
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:15.800
the small square image to the left of
the textual part of the little rich card.

194
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.250
So that's 150 by 150 pixels square.

195
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:24.110
And then you need 560 by 300
to use summary large image you

196
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.700
need to cover that area,
exceed both dimensions, right?

197
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.735
If you provide an insufficiently
large image for

198
00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:38.420
summary_large_image, you'll fall
back to the summary card style.

199
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.040
And you may note that one
is a square image, and

200
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.750
one is almost a two to one aspect ratio.

201
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.240
So the crop job, it looks awful.

202
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.710
I mean, it's just gonna take the middle.

203
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:56.550
It's gonna turn into a durance
course on social optimum,

204
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.840
which is now what I'm teaching here.

205
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.480
We're not learning about durance here.
