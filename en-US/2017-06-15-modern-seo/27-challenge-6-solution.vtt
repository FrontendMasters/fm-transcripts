00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.580
We're gonna go through the solution
to the last exercise of this course,

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.960
where we're building our own AMP page.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.540
So the first thing I'm gonna do is because
this is a new exercise a new folder in our

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.376
exercises folder, I'm gonna start by
making sure I set my Heroku up so

5
00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:17.670
that it's serving from the right place.

6
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.450
This one is just called AMP.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.060
So it's restarting and in fact,

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.454
we can just take a look at
what we're seeing by default.

9
00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:35.094
Thank you.

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.760
And it's pretty fugly here because
we've got images but they're huge.

11
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.080
And if you look at our console here,
so we do see powered by AMP.

12
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.290
So that's a good sign.

13
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.403
Let's try to validate this
HTML see what's going on.

14
00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:08.668
So we're gonna go to the AMP validator,
just paste it in there, and

15
00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:12.430
well the first thing I'm
getting yelled out here for

16
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.990
is that image tags are not allowed here
unless there descendant tag of no script.

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.280
Did I mean AMP image?

18
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.598
So in this case,
I'm going to convert to AMP image.

19
00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:29.399
I don't know what the descendant
of no script case is.

20
00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.530
We won't worry about that.

21
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.000
So here,
I'm just gonna change image to AMP image.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030
And here's my source.

23
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.200
And I'm actually gonna define
the size of this image as being

24
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.330
a little smaller than what the database
says the original size of the image is.

25
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.829
So we're just gonna do like 64 pixels.

26
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.180
Let's run this locally.

27
00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:06.196
On localhost 3000 and
see where this gets us.

28
00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:18.704
Looks like it didn't take,

29
00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:22.662
refresh, few source.

30
00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:29.458
So there's my image tag interesting,
I'm in the wrong project, fantastic.

31
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:36.180
[LAUGH]
All right, here we go.

32
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.679
AMP image, Source equals that.

33
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.720
The alt is what it should be.

34
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.560
We have this course image class although
of course we can't bring in a style sheet.

35
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.670
We'll have to do some inline styles later.

36
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.814
With equals 64,

37
00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:57.320
save, refresh.

38
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.800
And now we can see we've got AMP image.

39
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.300
Let's see if our results are better.

40
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.550
Pass, interesting.

41
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.690
So now we've got our first
qualifying AMP page.

42
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.930
However, it looks like awful.

43
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.220
So let's make it better.

44
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.190
So we'll do style and we have to
add AMP custom to this style tag.

45
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.682
And here we can just say course,

46
00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:33.700
course image is 64 pixels.

47
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.156
Interesting that it chose to render it, so

48
00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:42.924
huge maybe it's not reading these
attributes because their numbers.

49
00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.220
Wonder what's going on there.

50
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.480
There we go.

51
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.584
So I don't know let's,
let's take the style away and

52
00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:49.784
see if that changed anything.

53
00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.650
It did.

54
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.990
All right, so that was the issue there.

55
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.050
I should have had those values in quotes.

56
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.480
Not as regular numbers
now it's honoring those.

57
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.011
I can just clean it up a tiny bit

58
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:10.734
just to put some styling here.

59
00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:17.060
Style none, save and
get rid of our bullet points.

60
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.230
And let's leave it at that.

61
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.300
So just so we can have some style and
we should see that some style and

62
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.770
we should also see that
this passes our test, copy,

63
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.860
paste and pass, you got to pass.

64
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.139
So, that is those are the very
basics of an AMP page.

65
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.470
It is, to be determined how well this
intersects with the other directions that

66
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.430
modern web technology is going
like progressive web apps.

67
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.890
There are some ideas about how you can
have an AMP page that is progressively

68
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.960
enhanced.

69
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.120
Into a PWA, which is it's the more
rich app like experience.

70
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.430
Obviously, we have no client
side JavaScript here.

71
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.350
And so this is sort of a couple steps
back in terms of our capability of

72
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.790
providing, the rich
features that users expect.

73
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.820
However, it is really really
fast in terms of single articles

74
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.330
being loaded from search results.

75
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.270
Some people end up building sort of
an AMP version of their articles and

76
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.150
then they have their main application,
that is sort of a more rich web experience

77
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.410
as a fully independent app,
maybe on its own separate domain now.

78
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.860
So that's AMP and congratulations
on building your first AMP page.
