1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.090
Now we've got some links coming back to us
and we've sort of gone through the basics.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.160
Let's talk a little bit about how
search engines work internally.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.010
So at least at a basic level,

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.910
the underlying assumption of how search
engines work is that your quality and

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.660
your importance is proportional to
the number of sites linking to you.

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.580
And if you're an important site,

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.340
your links are worth more in terms of
boosting the importance of other sites.

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.100
And the corollary to this is also,
if you frequently link to other sites,

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.818
your links are worth less
as influenced boosters,

10
00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:47.065
compared to important sites
that hardly ever link at all.

11
00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:50.329
So a good example here
is we'll talk about,

12
00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.488
one way you can use Wikipedia
is to kind of submit edits.

13
00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:59.051
Appropriate edits that will link back to
your business if you're the authoritative

14
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.930
source on a particular
piece of information.

15
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.250
That's a very important site, Wikipedia
shows up as the first result for many,

16
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.250
many search queries, however,
it links out to other sites like crazy.

17
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.900
A counter example to this would be,

18
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.460
if whitehouse.gov links to your site.

19
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.350
They may hardly ever link to sites
outside of their own domain.

20
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.800
And so that rare occurrence,
it's almost like an endorsement.

21
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.650
And that could boost your SEO
ranking tremendously overnight

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.870
when that sort of rare event happens.

23
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.810
So you sort of end up having
some amount of importance and

24
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.459
then diluting the effect of
your ability to link outwards

25
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.210
proportional to the number
of outgoing links you have.

26
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.960
So over here, we have a diagram
that relates to Google's Page Rank

27
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.580
algorithm, which was sort of
Larry Page's big idea that helped

28
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.800
Google start its path to
emerging as a search giant here.

29
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.579
And what I want you to see is that.

30
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.020
If we look at the red circle here, which
is B, a lot of things linked to it, and

31
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.840
that's what's driving its importance.

32
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.000
The purple circles at the bottom,
like almost nothing links to that or

33
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.760
nothing in this case.

34
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.160
So they're very sort of
unimportant low quality pages.

35
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.300
But they serve to sort of
collectively inflate B's importance.

36
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.790
And then as a consequence of B being
important, it only takes the one link to C

37
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.930
to elevate C up to being
a very important site, right?

38
00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:46.420
Because it's not linking out much,
it only has one outgoing link.

39
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.775
And it's giving all of that influence
to C and so C gets inflated a lot.

40
00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:55.062
So in terms of when we
talk about link building,

41
00:02:55.062 --> 00:02:59.670
the really sweet opportunities
would be people who

42
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.851
very infrequently lend
their social proof and

43
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.051
lend their credibility
to other businesses.

44
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:14.240
If you can tap into that, that will
boost your reputation up substantially.

45
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.830
And you can see here, there's an equation
that goes along with PageRank.

46
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.710
So these numbers represent some math that,
at least at the time that Google was

47
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.190
founded was correct and
it's evolved since then.

48
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.580
But you can see that it's
like a 30x difference here,

49
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.760
it is not a subtle difference,
it's not like it's twice as good.

50
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.460
It is dramatically better
to have these high impact

51
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.491
sites that infrequently
lend their credibility out,

52
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:45.333
citing you, that's a sweet spot, yes.

53
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:50.102
&gt;&gt; So is it better then for
your own business to

54
00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:54.212
sort of hoard the links you send out?

55
00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:57.918
Is it better to be like B and
just give out one link

56
00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:02.471
to one person as opposed to
sharing with multiple people?

57
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.038
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

58
00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:09.526
So if we think of ourselves
as being B here, right?

59
00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:13.494
And we're really only caring
about our radius here.

60
00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:17.375
Unless your business is offering
your influence to people,

61
00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:21.850
that's not the main focus of
what you're trying to do there.

62
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.980
So you could hoard it and then you have
something that's worth something and

63
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.591
you could share it out.

64
00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:32.651
However, if B didn't link out or
if it linked out all the time,

65
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.575
that doesn't diminish its own importance.

66
00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.570
That just diminishes its ability to
transfer its credibility to someone else.

67
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.220
Does that make sense?

68
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.862
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense?

69
00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:47.980
Yep, so it doesn't necessarily inflate
your own power to not link out.

70
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.440
It's how valuable you are to others.

71
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.340
&gt;&gt; It is how valuable to others,
which I guess in some senses,

72
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.250
that sort of is, in some ways,
your own power, right?

73
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.180
So I know that there
are some tech bloggers that

74
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.510
sort of infrequently endorse
another person's idea.

75
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.040
And when you come across an endorsement,
you look at that and you say,

76
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.590
wow, I don't see that often.

77
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.890
I'm gonna listen to this.

78
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.010
&gt;&gt; It's also surprising on large
sites in particular, if they link

79
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.019
to their own pages, their own resources,
they're passing SEO between pages, right?

80
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.750
The link text,

81
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.660
the search engines really like the link
text used to link to internal pages.

82
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.190
&gt;&gt; So linking to your own pages helps make
your topology a little bit more enriched.

83
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.895
I don't know,
specifically talking about PageRank.

84
00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:42.245
I don't think internal
links are even evaluated.

85
00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:47.046
However, if you had two businesses, so
I do consulting with LinkedIn, if LinkedIn

86
00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:51.865
and Lynda are linking to each other, those
are two separate entities in the eyes,-

87
00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:52.836
&gt;&gt; And Microsoft.

88
00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:53.606
&gt;&gt; And Microsoft, right?

89
00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:57.400
&gt;&gt; They can share between each others
domains by linking to each other.

90
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.117
&gt;&gt; Yes, right, and

91
00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:02.690
they all actually have,-
&gt;&gt; And Microsoft has a ton of

92
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.838
different domains and different products
and they can interlink between those.

93
00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:12.563
&gt;&gt; They can, but they're effectively
in doing so spreading out their value,

94
00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:17.125
and it's better to have one huge
single point of influence on

95
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:21.345
a really nice topic than to
spread everything out over.

96
00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:25.636
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why we moved Frontend and
.com under frontendmasters.com, so.

97
00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:26.867
&gt;&gt; Good move.

98
00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:28.324
We have a question online.

99
00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:34.185
&gt;&gt; Yep, Nikita Kay asked,
if there's a way to see PageRank,

100
00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:38.650
maybe you'll talk about
this at some point.

101
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.590
She's asking about tools for
seeing something like that.

102
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.310
&gt;&gt; So you can see your PageRank by
installing some Chrome extensions.

103
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.650
And if you search for PageRank,
there will be a bunch of them that,

104
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.460
I think Google has one, they used to
have something called Google Toolbar.

105
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.970
I'm not sure if that's still maintained.

106
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.020
The thing that I would
caution people on is,

107
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.100
it's like watching your stocks every hour.

108
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.340
You just wanna focus on things that
are known to drive PageRank up and

109
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.020
watching it every day and
keeping tabs on it.

110
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.590
That's not really gonna help
you move your mobile forward,

111
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.710
especially if you're a new startup, and

112
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.830
there are other established players in the
space, they're going to be ahead of you.

113
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.450
And there's really nothing you
can do except let time pass and

114
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.400
let people start visiting your site.

115
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.700
It's a long term effort.

116
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.190
So you can see your Page Rank.

117
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.180
But I don't find that that is
something that I frequently focus on.

118
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.600
I just know that this is
the theory of how things work.

119
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.710
And this is why you want
people to link to your site.

120
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.220
The thing I'm more
focused on is looking at

121
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.100
the inbound versus outbound links
on sites that can refer to me.

122
00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.820
So I wanna be able to tell A versus B and
C.

123
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.500
So I can know, well,
let's go out to lunch with B and

124
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.900
see if I can write a guest
blog post on their site.

125
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.560
Cuz I want that 30x multiplier.

126
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.500
&gt;&gt; So
just if I can focus that in a little bit.

127
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.980
&gt;&gt; Yep.

128
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.140
&gt;&gt; So
the algorithm is a black box essentially.

129
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.191
So you don't necessarily know
how to weigh different measures.

130
00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:24.835
&gt;&gt; Yes.

131
00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:30.239
&gt;&gt; You're just trying to take
a scan of the field of what sites

132
00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:35.910
are influential and
measure that against your PageRank.

133
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.590
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so
the algorithm is a blackbox.

134
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.022
We do know with certainty that certain
factors have a proportional versus

135
00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:49.030
an exponential effect on how you
show up in organic search results.

136
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.336
And this is actually not a blackbox.

137
00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:55.960
This was Larry Page's,
I think it was his PhD thesis.

138
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.490
And so this was published, and

139
00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.110
it represented the first
iteration of the search algorithm.

140
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.020
And since then, we don't really know
what direction it's evolved in.

141
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.610
But the same principles have
served that business well.
