00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:03.708
The last session that we're
going to talk about today and

2
00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:08.432
we're not going to do an exercise on it
just because Pinterest does not open this

3
00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:10.068
up to everyone by default.

4
00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:11.527
You have to ask for

5
00:00:11.527 --> 00:00:17.180
your domain to be whitelisted to
use any of their rich cards, right?

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.260
Which is their equivalent of the Open
Graph cards and the Twitter cards.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.930
I've heard that it takes
about three business days.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.000
And I don't think that
they scrutinize heavily.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.010
They just wanna know that you're
an established business and

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.600
that it's not just junk that
you're throwing up there to try

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
to add more data to the Pinterest domain.

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.780
Sometimes people try to use metadata like
this, like what we're going to show you,

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.530
as a way of building more links
that refer back to other sites.

14
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.660
So this is why sites tend to want to
request a validation step there so

15
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.410
that at least they can make sure
that you're a reputable site.

16
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.710
But it's not like your business
has to be big enough to

17
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.120
get special accommodation
from Pinterest here.

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.800
It's like a legitimacy check.

19
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.994
And that's it.

20
00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:12.157
So the first type of special Pinterest
card that we get is an article and

21
00:01:12.157 --> 00:01:17.864
there's nothing too interesting about
this except you get a read it button.

22
00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:22.490
And it indicates next to CNN, CNN's little

23
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.249
logo down there,
that this is a CNN article.

24
00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.052
Otherwise, it's just the typical
picture card that you get.

25
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.202
One of their more popular cards, and
this is one that's live today, and

26
00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:42.330
very oriented towards Pinterest, right?

27
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.110
Is recipe cards.

28
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.761
So here we get a picture on the top, and
if we scroll all the way to the bottom,

29
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:53.512
you see that you can provide some really
complicated metadata at the bottom.

30
00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.660
It's not trivial to get
all of this straight,

31
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.480
broken out into sections with
the correct names and things.

32
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.000
But ultimately, you end up making
a list of ingredients, right?

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.270
And here you even have like a gluten
free indication next to this recipe.

34
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.100
And so this is great because it enriches
this pin with this extra information.

35
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.399
And if you had a collection of recipes,
it's right there at the users fingertips.

36
00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.832
I didn't plan this out in advance,
but if we had a movie card here, so

37
00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:30.432
this was removed in January of 2017,
it was available until then.

38
00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:34.360
So this is what an IMDB
card might look like.

39
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.210
And I apologize to the people in the room,
it might be difficult to see.

40
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.480
But at least you can see it's PG 13,
there's its rating on IMDB.

41
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.620
People online and
on the video can see that there

42
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.400
is a listing of the director and
all of the actors that are in this movie.

43
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.920
So it's sort of the highest
level of metadata

44
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.090
that you might care about if
you were looking at this movie.

45
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.570
And then finally, we have the place pin,
which was one of the more popular pins.

46
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.178
It was also removed in a UI
refresh this January, but

47
00:03:06.178 --> 00:03:08.916
word has it, it may come back.

48
00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:17.070
I don't have authoritative information
on that topic, but I would still advise.

49
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.878
If Pinterest is an important platform for
your business,

50
00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:23.610
don't assume that this is gone forever.

51
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.720
They're still advising that people put
this place-based metadata in there.

52
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.270
Here's an example of how you
might build this metadata.

53
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.620
It's just another set of meta tags.

54
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.000
One difference here compared to
what we've been working with so

55
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.800
far today,
is that you see the property names.

56
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.460
Those are not fixed.

57
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.800
They have been with Twitter cards and
with the Open Graph tags.

58
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.170
And the reason here is because
Pinterest is looking for

59
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.450
an additional level of richness.

60
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.810
You might be able to define multiple
different entities in terms of metadata

61
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.400
on the same HTML document.

62
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.301
So that's what they're giving
themselves the flexibility for.

63
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:05.995
And I don't know if that is to build for
the future or what.

64
00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:10.015
But that would be the reason
to make these property keys,

65
00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.710
the names of the properties dynamic.

66
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.997
And with that, that rounds out
our talk about social metadata.
