00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.290
So this is gonna be a new
folder we're working on today.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.190
So remember, you're gonna have to do
Heroku config set exercise equals

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.470
mobile to switch Heroku over to
serving from a different folder.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.110
The reason it's new is cuz I've left all
of the icons in place generated for you.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.180
All of the meta tags for
icons just need to be commented out.

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.770
The Add to Home screen library
is in place it's loading.

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.310
You'll you'll need to use it by putting
a little JavaScript at the bottom

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.870
of the body right inside
the body at the very bottom.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.800
And so the tasks here are I want
a viewport meta tag, I want the Add

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.110
to Home screen, JavaScript library working
with appropriate Home Screen icons.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.028
Create a manifest.json in
the mobile/projects public folder,

12
00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:54.100
just a file called manifest.json.

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.190
And remember there's a meta tag you
have to add with the manifest.json.

14
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.820
So if you go back to my
slide on that topic,

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.800
you'll see the meta tag
is right up on top.

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.890
And then deploy it.

17
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.990
And just for fun, send it to your phone or
something to see if it works.

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260
You don't even have to
send it to your phone now.

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.610
I will show you what you can do
in Chrome to make to test it out.

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.830
So if you open up your developer tools,

21
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.010
there's a tiny little
mobile device button here.

22
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.410
And when you open it, you basically
get to simulate a mobile device and

23
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.320
because it also simulates a user agent,
you will be able to test

24
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.520
out whether this
addToHomescreen thing works.

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.830
Now keep in mind after you see it once
you're gonna get that little flag and

26
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.010
local storage that will prevent
it from showing up again.

27
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.991
You can always go into Application,
Local Storage, and

28
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:59.020
delete stuff in here that pertains
to your Heroku app or local host.

29
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.090
It'll look like,
let's see if I can get it to work here.

30
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.300
I'm gonna need to switch it.

31
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.320
But it would be like org.cubic.addtoHome,
and then there would be some value.

32
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.564
So if you blow that away and
refresh, it'll start up.

33
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:27.416
And with that I have added,
definitely try on your mobile device cuz

34
00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:31.092
that's the easiest way to
see the home screen icon and

35
00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:36.660
to ensure that your title is what it
should be on that home screen bookmark.

36
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.281
So send yourself a link on your phone and
see how this works once we're all done
