1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.910
This is great.

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.690
So now we know like we want these
influential sites linking to us.

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.900
And we wanna build rich content.

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.190
And it's gonna come time for

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.740
us to try to figure out, which keywords
are important to our business.

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.410
And this tells us, what kind of
content we should be writing about.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.190
When we start talking about advertising.

8
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.600
Keywords are very important in terms of
knowing, where to invest some money and

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.370
where to kind of steer clear.

10
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.480
So there's this sort
of new way of thinking

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.510
about which keywords are the highest
value, to invest in.

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.260
And it has to do with this graph here.

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.040
So what we can see is that very rich
keywords like very important keywords,

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.630
that are highly competitive and
highly sought after.

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.910
They account for
a little less than 20% of total searches.

16
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.250
So here's an example of a very
competitive keyword a Yahoo,

17
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.140
one of our top search
terms was car donation.

18
00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:08.569
So can anyone guess why car donation
might be like a really hard search term?

19
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.462
So.

20
00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:12.170
&gt;&gt; Are you looking for like a tax break?

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.300
&gt;&gt; You're looking for tax break?

22
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

23
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.280
&gt;&gt; Right.
So, A you're looking for a tax break B,

24
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.870
there's high intent,
you're not gonna just search for

25
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.220
car donation without really having a car
on hand that you're ready to let go off.

26
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
You don't really, you want to get it done
fast and you're just gonna Google for

27
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.590
it, who will take my car and
give me a tax break?

28
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.520
The third factor here is,
whoever gets that conversion,

29
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.140
whoever gets the click and you see their
address and you drive your car there,

30
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.650
you're gonna leave a car with them.

31
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.840
Right?
So we were seeing even like nonprofits,

32
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.700
were competing for that search keyword
at like $70 a click something like that.

33
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.800
Which would be maybe a couple
hundred dollars per conversion.

34
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.660
They were willing to pay that much
because what they're getting is for

35
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.410
every conversion, a car that on
average is worth $1200, right?

36
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.670
So that's a really competitive keyword
that people are edging each other out on.

37
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.770
Other competitive ones are like
credit card, mortgage, diamond,

38
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.110
diamond is a really like hot keyword.

39
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.310
Like debt consolidation
is a really hot keyword.

40
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.870
Anytime you have sort
of a commodity business

41
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.312
where there's a lot of profit to be made
by any player in the space like that.

42
00:02:28.312 --> 00:02:32.170
You wanna stay away from that because
they're all trying to edge each other out

43
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.320
and they're just throwing tons of cash
down to pay high dollars for those clicks.

44
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.500
So moving down this graph to the right,
we've got the chunky middle and

45
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.815
that's where we start to put
a little bit more intent

46
00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:51.380
into what people are searching for
and what people are talking about.

47
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.050
Moving further to the right,
we get high intent and so

48
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.230
in terms of like,
tying it back to front end masters.

49
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.820
This would be the difference between
investing in ads that target like, learn

50
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.360
JavaScript or just the word JavaScript
verses like an SEO metadata video course.

51
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.460
If you're searching for
SEO metadata video course,

52
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.970
front end masters has something
relevant that they can offer and

53
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.020
they're looking for a video course and
that is what front end masters sells.

54
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.120
And metadata is one of
the topics that we're covering.

55
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.490
It's so high intent, and there's a lot
less competition over that right all of

56
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.480
the React JS courses will fall away and
you

57
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.520
have a much smaller Haystack and they have
a giant needle sitting right on top of it.

58
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.660
Yes,
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

59
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.680
I just, another follow up comment to that.

60
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.030
I mean, a lot of our stuff is like very,
very specific courses.

61
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.490
So when people search
those specific terms,

62
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.245
like that is how we get like
the majority of our customers actually,

63
00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:55.425
I mean over 30% of our customer,
new customers come in through search.

64
00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:57.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's a really, really big deal.

65
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.170
&gt;&gt; I'm not surprised.

66
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.100
&gt;&gt; With high intent keywords.

67
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.310
&gt;&gt; High intent keywords and by the way
you'll notice so that long tail that is

68
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.880
thick, like all the way out out the window
across the to the next building here,

69
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.050
so that accounts for
70% of all searches, these high intent,

70
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.280
multi word phrases that are very targeted
towards the product you have to offer.

71
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.310
And these could be like if you're selling
shoes you might be like, you might say,

72
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.240
men size 12 Dina's something, and
yeah, you'd have to generate a lot

73
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.770
of permutations of these things to like,
build 1000 keywords that you can then

74
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.060
target but
fewer people are fighting over those.

75
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.827
And so you end up paying less,

76
00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:43.942
you end up getting more conversions
like front end masters the same.

77
00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:50.210
So and when someone's high intent,
they're inherently more likely to convert.

78
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.800
Right, if someone's just looking.

79
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.660
They heard the word JavaScript that like
some, your grandmother heard you talking

80
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.070
about JavaScript and they typed
the word and they're what's this thing?

81
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.160
That's not something that's not
a front end masters customer, so

82
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.330
you filter out all of those
general knowledge searchers and

83
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.790
get people that like
they know what they want.

84
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.670
These two apps here SEMrush and
Wordtracker.

85
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.630
They are great for starting with
some general keywords and figuring

86
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.110
out some great like high opportunity
phrases that you can use

87
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.600
not only in the content that you write,
but in your advertising strategy, right?

88
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.110
And so this would help you understand,
what are the words that are relevant to my

89
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.840
business that few people
are fighting over.

90
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.660
And that's where like the ROI for
that is very high.
