00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.740
We're gonna build our first AMP,

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.920
project, this is a new exercise in
your exercises folder It's called AMP.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.840
There's an AMP validator
that I can show you,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.220
it'll ask you to paste in chunk of HTML.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.795
So you're gonna go like view
source I'll just show it to you.

6
00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:25.880
So you paste your HTML in here, thank you.

7
00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:33.941
And it'll let you know any rules that you
break, you also get a lot of good feedback

8
00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:37.799
in your developer console,
this is part of what the AMP runtime does.

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.459
It'll yell at you if you use any tags it
didn't like, so builds the AMP, app out.

10
00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:51.668
I think the starting point
involves the same list of courses,

11
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.880
let me just double check.

12
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.710
It does but

13
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.640
you'll see that I've already included
like some of this AMP project stuff.

14
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.322
So there's a schema.org stuff.

15
00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:10.540
Here's amp-boilerplate CSS up there, so
you don't have to go and fetch that.

16
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.580
But just see what you can do try to make
this reasonable, make something that you

17
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.290
can deploy to Heroku and
then also passes the AMP validator.
