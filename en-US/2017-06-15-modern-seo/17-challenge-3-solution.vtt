1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.960
Let's say it was really important that
I'm here in the root directory and

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.900
I really wanted to make that high folder.

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.610
How would I do it?

4
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.710
Well, the owner user that
can do it is the super user.

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.617
The super user is also the other name for
the root user.

6
00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:16.778
So you'll hear me use
those two interchangeably.

7
00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:28.380
So the way that I could do
that is I could come in and

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.220
say sudo, which is basically
doing super user, do mkdir hi.

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.240
So now because I ran sudo, this basically
which means like temporarily for

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.450
one command switch me into super user,
do something and then come back.

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.180
So now you can see in here
I have this high directory.

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.739
And you can see the user that did it
was wherever that went here, root.

13
00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.290
So just to kind of prove my point,
if I say sudo, who am I.

14
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.380
What do you think it's going to say root,
right.

15
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.890
Because for that one command, I'm root,
but now if I run, who am I Again,

16
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.970
I'm going to be Ubuntu.

17
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.070
So that's what sudo does is it switches
use quickly into root You do one thing and

18
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.560
then you're out.

19
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.570
That's because Ubuntu has
super user privileges.

20
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.750
That means that Ubuntu
can run things as root.

21
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.970
But not everything is run as root by
default, which is kind of that safeguard.

22
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.640
When I tried that RM dash RF it wouldn't
have let me do that because Ubuntu was not

23
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.580
privileged to do despite the fact that
Ubuntu could if I had done it as sudo does

24
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.240
that make sense?

25
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.640
Cool.

26
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.910
So that's why you don't just always run
as root, don't just hang out as root.

27
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.970
That's a terrible idea because you're
gonna make mistakes, and not being

28
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.010
the root user will save you from some of
those dumb mistakes that you're gonna do.

29
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.290
Cuz it is possible, I can say sudo
switch users, and look who I am now.

30
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.655
I am the root user now.

31
00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:18.870
I have all power.

32
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.662
That's a terrible idea.

33
00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.330
So don't hang out as the super user.

34
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.910
So in order to do that,
you can just say exit.

35
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.816
And that will get you out of
your session as the root user

36
00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:36.025
I would also like to point out
that Sudo is a very adorable dog.

37
00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:40.007
That's actually Sarah Dresner is doc.

38
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:42.875
[LAUGH] I asked her if I could
put a picture of Sudo in here.

39
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.100
Because the dog is hilarious, and
it also if you go over to her house,

40
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.760
it's funny to hear her say sudo sit
because like tons, like super user,

41
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.150
tell the dog to sit out makes me laugh.

42
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.070
And that's from Yes, Sara dresner
who's another teacher in front of

43
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.199
masters she does the view courses and
she's really awesome.

44
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.530
This is another one makes me laugh,
make me a sandwich.

45
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.780
What make it yourself Sudo?

46
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.210
Make me a sandwich, okay?

47
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.450
That's another XKCD that's
another famous one.

48
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.820
Okay, so Let's go ahead and

49
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.730
yeah, it's a bit like Simon says, right?

50
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.050
It won't do until you tell it's Simon
says, delete the root directory, right?

51
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.170
Let's make a new user just to
show you kind of how it's done.

52
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.370
Like, the reason why I would
create a new user is like I said,

53
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.790
if I was gonna do like.

54
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.380
A some sort of like job, or like a task
that was gonna run like every day.

55
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.760
And that task was very scoped to
like it works on this one folder and

56
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.430
does this one thing and then it finishes.

57
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.980
I would make a new user just for that task
that could only accomplish that task and

58
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.600
can do literally nothing else.

59
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.391
That would be a good
reason to make a new user.

60
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.150
So Ubuntu can't make any

61
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.450
new users but
root cans we have to switch to root.

62
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.160
The other thing I was gonna mention about
Ubuntu is normally when you do sudo.

63
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.650
So if I say sudo echo hi.

64
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.430
Which there's no reason to do sudo there,
right?

65
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.030
Normally it asks you to enter your
password when you enter sudo.

66
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.810
Multipass is a password list root user so
it actually doesn't make you do it.

67
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.910
But normally you have to enter it.

68
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.470
So I'll show you that
here in just a second.

69
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.352
But if that's why ,that's why that
feels weird if that feels weird to you.

70
00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:41.390
All right, so
we're going to do sudo user add brian or

71
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.350
you can put whatever you want there.

72
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.210
I'm just going to put brian.

73
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.233
Okay, and that created a brand new
user and I'm going to do sudo passwd,

74
00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:57.200
which is gonna allow me to set the user
for the, the password for Brian.

75
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.386
And it's gonna make me enter a new
password I'm going to put something very

76
00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:03.979
simple that you need to remember asdf,
asdf,

77
00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.350
which is the only
password that I ever use.

78
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.600
Now I'm gonna say switch users
which is what su does to brian,

79
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.133
is gonna make me enter my password.

80
00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:18.903
And now I am brian,

81
00:05:18.903 --> 00:05:21.794
who am I?

82
00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:23.589
Brian.

83
00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.408
So, that's about it that all you need
to do to enter as brian actually

84
00:05:28.408 --> 00:05:31.995
don't I think I'm in
a different shell right now.

85
00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.636
No, I don't know.

86
00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:42.285
But the reason why the prompt
there is something like that.

87
00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:44.825
We haven't set up a bunch of
stuff like the login shell and

88
00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:45.525
all that kind of stuff.

89
00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:47.355
But that's how you create a new user.

90
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.415
And then you would go about adding like
them to be in the right permission,

91
00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:53.065
still this kind of stuff.

92
00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:55.925
And actually, if I say sudo echo hi.

93
00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:59.630
If I say asdf it's gonna say,

94
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.330
brian is not authorized to do sudo
this incident will be reported.

95
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.230
That's the line that always made me laugh.

96
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.643
And then I actually
found an XKCD about it.

97
00:06:13.232 --> 00:06:15.800
It says right there,
Rob is not in the sudos file.

98
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.610
This incident will be reported.

99
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.660
Hey, who does the sudos
report incidents to is like?

100
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.822
I never looked, and
it's reporting it to Santa Claus.

101
00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:31.000
[LAUGH] I don't know made me laugh So
I actually looked it up where it goes.

102
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.880
There's actually like a mailbox because
there's like a, Internal mail system on

103
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.770
Linux and it gets reported to like
an admin in their mailbox and

104
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.620
someone tried to do a sudo
that they could do.

105
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.230
I've literally in the history of all of my
schooling, and all of my learning to code,

106
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.880
and all my production work at companies,
no one has ever mentioned

107
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.160
this file at all so don't worry if it
says that this incident will be reported.

108
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.400
That was very intimidating the first
time I saw in the computer lab though.

109
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.220
Okay so, brian can't suit up but what if
we want to make it so brian could sudo?

110
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.910
Well that can be done so I'm going to
exit out of this session with brian.

111
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.300
So I'm gonna go back to Ubuntu because
a boon to does have sudo privileges but

112
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.460
it's just that brian doesn't.

113
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.506
So we have to.

114
00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:33.616
Use groups.

115
00:07:33.616 --> 00:07:38.388
So groups are another
construct within Linux that

116
00:07:38.388 --> 00:07:43.620
allow you to add privileges
to entire groups of users.

117
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.560
This is useful because like
imagine you run a server and

118
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.049
that server has 100 users on it.

119
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.740
And you have 50 admins and 50 non admins.

120
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.780
And let's say you wanted to add a new
privilege to the admins that they are now

121
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.860
able to read to this one directory.

122
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.700
You would either have to go.

123
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.720
And now that privilege individually 50
times each user, or if you use groups,

124
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.980
you could just add at once to
one set of group or one group.

125
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.850
And then everyone inside of that
group would get all the privileges.

126
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.870
So it just makes it easier to add and
manage all those people.

127
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.070
So, there's a bunch of reasons.

128
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.090
Like you could create like a readers group
and the readers group has access to read

129
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.550
all the files, but I can't write to it and
they could have another writers group.

130
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.170
And they can write to it that maybe
not read from it, I don't know.

131
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.126
But you can kind of manage all
the privileges individually that way.

132
00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:41.647
So, If you wanna add brian to that group,

133
00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:45.470
what we can do is we can run
this command right here.

134
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.020
User mode.

135
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:54.523
And let's actually just
put it in right here, And

136
00:08:54.523 --> 00:08:58.213
so you do sudo, User mod and

137
00:08:58.213 --> 00:09:04.940
you can do dash dash
append dash dash groups.

138
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.510
Or you can just do dash a capital G for
the shorthand, sudo Brian.

139
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:16.010
So what this is going to do this s
going to add a new group to brian.

140
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.623
And he's going to be added
to the pseudo group and

141
00:09:18.623 --> 00:09:20.487
the sudo group is allowed to sudo.

142
00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:27.679
So now if I say sudos or
if I say switch users to brian,

143
00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:31.170
I enter that password and so now Who am I?

144
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.070
Here and I say sudo.

145
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.570
Who am I?

146
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.550
I have to enter my password.

147
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.770
So by adding brian to that sudo group,
brian is now able to do sudo things.

148
00:09:50.538 --> 00:09:52.810
That makes sense.

149
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.360
So you can create your own groups.

150
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.760
Honestly, if you ask me,
how often do I create my own groups?

151
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.390
The answer that question would be never,
like I almost never do it

152
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.090
because I don't manage flocks of
Ubuntu servers or anything like that.

153
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.610
But I have had to add people
to the sudo users before.

154
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.140
So that is why I show you how to do that.
