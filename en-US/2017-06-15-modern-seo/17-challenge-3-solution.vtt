1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.600
All right, welcome back,
so we're going to go over

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.950
adding Twitter meta tags to the same
app that we've been working with today.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.692
So I'm just gonna kinda
close out everything so

4
00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:12.823
you get a fresh starting point here.

5
00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:17.792
We're looking at localhost again instead
of looking at our Heroku version of

6
00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.400
the solution.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.910
Let me clear it out so
people in the room can see.

8
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.490
And I'm just gonna go back into
our Open Graph exercise here.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.500
And we're gonna just focus on
the course HBS file today.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290
I can actually get rid of this here.

11
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.040
So I'll begin by going to
my little cheat sheet here.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.919
Let me maximize this.

13
00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:50.120
And pulling off some of the metatags we
need to worry about, we'll do these first.

14
00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:57.861
So begin Twitter.

15
00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.768
End twitter, I just like to keep things
nice and separated so that you don't

16
00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:12.735
end up with this huge stack of things
that you have difficulty sorting through.

17
00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:20.885
So, this example used summary
as the type of card here.

18
00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:27.710
One thing that got me that it was like,
I swear it was a bug in Twitter,

19
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.770
just because of the response that I
got was if you misspell the card type,

20
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.490
you will get a notice that
involves requesting approval.

21
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.126
So some view if you misspelled the card
type this content attribute here.

22
00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:46.353
You could have said,
this is not whitelisted,

23
00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.620
your domain is not whitelisted.

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.110
And please click here to request access.

25
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.540
Everyone has access to the large
image card type, right?

26
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.040
But the response you'll
get from the validator,

27
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.370
it acts like it is something
you have to seek approval from.

28
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.080
So just be aware of the only thing you
need approval for is the player card type.

29
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.790
That's the only legitimate needs
approval thing that's left.

30
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.970
At one time, large image of something that
you also needed to be whitelisted for but

31
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.030
they've since opened it up to everyone.

32
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.264
So here we had one person here that did
something like this summary large card,

33
00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:28.240
and something was wrong and
you think it's a bug.

34
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.898
There's an open item in the developer
forms, from me, saying, I swear look at

35
00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:37.710
this metadata, it's supposed to work,
and it's just a misspelling on my part.

36
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.990
So, here I'm just gonna use,
I'll keep these as the site and

37
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.750
creator just for fun.

38
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.750
And then we need to worry about our image.

39
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.620
So, for
images with Twitter the large image,

40
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.290
that's where I have this
thumb size in my JSON.

41
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.080
If we go back and look, you'll notice
that the thumb 2x is 560 by 300.

42
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.340
It's no coincidence that it's that size.

43
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.020
That is the size that I need for

44
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.230
this image on this social media platform,
right?

45
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.590
So, just to double check
with my slides here,

46
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.170
cuz I can't keep all of this in my brain,
sorry, it's Twitter image.

47
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.090
That's what we want Twitter image.

48
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.410
And then here, I'm going to use handlebars
to find an appropriate value here.

49
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.664
So we're gonna just use a very
similar trick that we used for

50
00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:41.300
Facebook except here,
it's going to be thumb 2x.

51
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.090
Now, if you ended up using square here,

52
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.090
you would default to a really nice,
appropriately cropped square image for

53
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.040
the smaller card cuz that's
a 250 by 250 pixel square.

54
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.130
So if you're going to, I would at least
say get the aspect ratio correctly cuz

55
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.060
Twitter will try to do its best
with the appropriate aspect ratio.

56
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.860
All right, so now we've got our image and
we can actually leave it there.

57
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.330
We don't have to provide it a width and
a height.

58
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.150
Because Twitter images are,
they're the same aspect ratio,

59
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.590
it differs on device exactly
how big it is, right?

60
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.180
But it will scale that thing up and
down as appropriate.

61
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.970
So you'll notice like if you use the iOS
app for Twitter and you rotate your

62
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.030
device and think there was at least at
some point, it worked in landscape mode.

63
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.830
I'm not sure it does anymore.

64
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.020
You can see that the images get wider and
smaller but you don't need to tell it like

65
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.060
you need to tell Facebook because
Facebook supports a varying size.

66
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.365
And with that,
I'm just gonna go ahead and deploy this.

67
00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:55.894
The way we add this, the way we
deployed this first we go git add- A.

68
00:04:55.894 --> 00:05:00.652
That says, take off the changed files,
stage them so that the next time I

69
00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:05.410
make a commit, which is like a code
change across a collection of files,

70
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.624
we're going to include everything
that we've changed so far.

71
00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:15.827
Now we're gonna make the change, And give
it a name so that if we look back later

72
00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:19.950
in the history, we'll see that this is
the one where we added Twitter metadata.

73
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.230
And then finally,
send that new change up to Heroku.

74
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.595
And I have to do something
slightly different

75
00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:33.264
here because I'm a non master branch.

76
00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:39.790
You would have just done
git push Heroku master.

77
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.410
My different syntax there had to do
with solution being my local branch, but

78
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.118
I still want it to end up on master in
Heroku, cuz that's what it solves off of.

79
00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:52.555
I'm so
used to type in Heroku master though,

80
00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:56.560
cuz that's more often than
not what you're going to use.

81
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.070
And here's our Heroku app.

82
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.600
So if I do a hard refresh here to make
sure everything is loaded and go to

83
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.720
the Twitter validator, let's see if I did
everything the way I was supposed to.

84
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.810
So we may run into a caching issue here.

85
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.070
We do not, there it is.

86
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.351
And it's telling me with no warnings down
here it got 15 meta tags card was loaded

87
00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:20.630
successfully.

88
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.210
So this is a great time,
let me pop this out so

89
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.520
that people in the room can
see a little bit more easily.

90
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.850
This is a great time to start looking at

91
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.020
this SEO Chrome extension
I had you install.

92
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.400
So if we open that up,
you can see the description is missing.

93
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.882
Remember, we only added that meta
description tag to our first exercise

94
00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:42.919
the deploy one.

95
00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.880
We never ended up adding
that to these URLs here.

96
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.780
Here is,
I'm looking at Twitter's app there.

97
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.330
They don't have a description either,
interesting.

98
00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:02.079
So here's my canonical URL,
where it says it's not defined.

99
00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:05.330
So there's probably a meta
tag I'm missing that

100
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.690
is a generic way of
specifying a canonical URL.

101
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.320
So this is telling me,
it's giving me a Google URL to read.

102
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.110
So we may get into that as we look
at the web app manifest stuff.

103
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.830
But in the social tab,

104
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.190
we can see that all of my metadata
is showing up really nicely.

105
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.810
There's my Facebook canonical URL, the
Open Graph type, the title I'm using for

106
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.900
Open Graph, here's my description.

107
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.730
Here's a nice image and I could right
click and download that if I wanted to.

108
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.290
The width and the height, and then
here's all my stuff for Twitter as well.

109
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.110
So, I like using this cuz it is easier
to look through this than to skim

110
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.140
through a bunch of almost identical
meta tags to try to scan through and

111
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.740
find what's going wrong.

112
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.404
And as you see here, it will
highlight problems that you run into.

113
00:07:56.404 --> 00:08:01.960
So here I haven't specified a title
attribute, this image to the left.

114
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.682
So it gives you, you basically swat
at it until the red goes away.

115
00:08:05.682 --> 00:08:10.789
And that gives you a baseline for making
sure there is machine-readable metadata

116
00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:15.905
available for all of your images and all
of your videos and all of your meta-tags.

117
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.202
So, and hitting most titles on links,

118
00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:26.320
right, give you even more
hints to feed the indexers.
