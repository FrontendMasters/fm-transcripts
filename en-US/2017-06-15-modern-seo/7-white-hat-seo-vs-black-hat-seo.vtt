00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.530
So White Hat SEO is generally
seen as making content

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.140
that is as good as it possibly can be for
human beings, for your customers.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.006
Black Hat SEO differs
from White Hat SEO and

4
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.314
that it attempts to to please the bots,
right?

5
00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:21.118
So we talked about how common words
are shut away from your content and

6
00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:25.511
all that's left to like the specific rare
words that only appear on your site and

7
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:27.590
a handful of others.

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.790
If you just try to stuff a bunch of
that junk into your blog posts and

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.220
they're hardly readable and
it's just gibberish,

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.960
that will be detected very quickly and
your search ranking will plummet.

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.110
In fact, it would probably be difficult
to find examples of this because it's

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.990
detected so
early that you can't even search for

13
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.730
it like these people just think really,
really quick.

14
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.420
JC Penney had an incident a couple years
ago where they hired a contractor who

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.030
did a lot of Black Hat stuff and
they ended up for 90 days being in like,

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.480
they went from like being the first result
for terms like dresses, which is huge.

17
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.060
That's a really competitive keyword,
to being on like the eighth

18
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.738
page of Google search results because
they were penalized so heavily.

19
00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:20.560
So you wanted definitely be
on the White Hat side, it is

20
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.040
a lot of effort to try to outsmart the the
people who designed the search engines.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.386
One thing I would say is
if you hire a consultant or

22
00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:33.469
a contractor to do SEO work with them,
make it very, very,

23
00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.322
very clear that you are not
okay with Black Hat efforts.

24
00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:40.189
Not everybody knows that
this stuff is cut easily and

25
00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.097
sometimes what you can see is like
very briefly, you get an uptick, and

26
00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:48.410
it looks like really impressive cuz
you're showing up on the first page.

27
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.980
And then like at the end of the week,

28
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.250
you're just gonna crater and this is not
good for your business for that to happen.

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.520
So when you're setting goals, if someone's
promising to get you on the first page,

30
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760
that's not what you're aiming for.

31
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.720
You're aiming for sustainable and

32
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.120
organic growth that falls completely
on the White Hat side of the picture.
