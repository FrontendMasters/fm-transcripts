1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.170
The next topic we're going to
jump into is structured data.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.620
So structured data is,
I know it's a generic term here, but

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.620
in this context,
stuff that you add to your

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.400
HTML body usually so
that you can get a machine readable

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.490
equivalent of some complex
items that you have there.

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.950
So this is information that
crawlers are already seeking out,

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.300
like the name of an organization or
who owns a company.

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.872
What Twitter accounts
are associated with the company?

9
00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:38.190
Where's their Facebook account?

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.550
What's their phone number?

11
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.910
So we're already trying to like,
there's a need to build this information.

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.200
And this is a way to make sure that
everything ends up being correct.

13
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.460
There are a couple different
ways of defining this metadata.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.720
And so, some of them involve
setting special HTML attributes

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.470
on the HTML that represents
this item itself and your UI.

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.220
Some of them involve little microformats,

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.800
where you have to really get
familiar with some new schema.

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.010
It seems like the way forward is
to use this syntax called JSON-LD.

19
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.461
So it is a specific schema of
JSON it will look like JSON, and

20
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.586
it ends up going in
a script tag like this.

21
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.253
So in terms of what this gets us,
quite a few things and it's really up

22
00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:38.280
to the developer of the app consuming
this HTML to decide what to do with it.

23
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.353
So an example is you can
specify details about

24
00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:46.329
a calendar event in
an HTML email to Google.

25
00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.250
And this is where this RSVP opportunity
happens, right in your email.

26
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.620
So this is not something that
Google Calendar has like a monopoly on.

27
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.410
You can add metadata right in the HTML
email and you'll get stuff like this.

28
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.820
If you've been using GitHub a lot, you
might see that when you get a notification

29
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.410
about a pull request,
there's a little view pull request item.

30
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.960
So this all comes from additional
metadata and schema.org stuff,

31
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.170
which is this flavor of
metadata I'm talking about.

32
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.090
This is the way to go.

33
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060
And the main advantage you get here, so

34
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.900
we've gone past like trying to
crawl up the search results and

35
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.460
make sure that links are shared
in its rich away as possible.

36
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.410
This this issue here has to do with
kind of getting things as correct

37
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.190
as they possibly could be, so

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.480
that things are spelled the way
they're supposed to be spelled.

39
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.910
If front end masters, maybe some people
don't know whether it's one word or

40
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.032
two words or the E and and is capitalized,
but it's all smushed together.

41
00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:49.790
And then,
you can have a consistent brand image

42
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.780
by being the one that specifies these
values in this structured data.

43
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.349
So that's why I say you have more
control over the way you look

44
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.460
in these applications.

45
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.970
So it does similar to the social metadata
we've been working with, it does end up

46
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.700
enriching the way your search result
comes up, primarily on mobile devices.

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.420
So I took some screenshots of the a search
result that involves events data.

48
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.446
And you can see, you've got the name
of the event, the date, and the venue.

49
00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:27.857
And you can tap in each of those,
those are each sort of addressable items,

50
00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:31.180
each with their own URL, so that would
be the way that you build this out.

51
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.280
On the products example here,
you can see we have a rating and

52
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.310
a price, and an indication of
whether it's in stock or not.

53
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.250
And I would,

54
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.720
part of me wants to figure out whether
how often that's updated, right?

55
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.500
That might be a fluctuating value there.

56
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.667
Yes, Mark,
&gt;&gt; With the ratings,

57
00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:56.468
how does Google verify that
those are not just a 100

58
00:03:56.468 --> 00:04:01.390
people rated this five stars and
nobody actually did?

59
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.920
&gt;&gt; So you have to point to
an authoritative authoritative source for

60
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.830
ratings.

61
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.250
So you don't just state that your rating
is five stars, but you would rather say,

62
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.260
I wish to,
like this is my official business name.

63
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.420
And I'm connecting to this
Platform of record for ratings and

64
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.850
it could be like Google or Facebook's
reviews or the Better Business Bureau.

65
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.120
I'm not sure which ones are whitelisted,
but there is a whitelist.

66
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.403
So that only true like community
source ratings are there.

67
00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:42.537
And for that matter,
you need to be able to tap on that and

68
00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:44.960
to see the ratings themselves.

69
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.930
So if you really care about Google and
search results, I would make sure that you

70
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.890
try to make sure your Google ratings
are as good as they possibly could be,

71
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.860
because that is going to be
the easiest one to wire up to.

72
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.720
But you can't simply just say like,
yeah, five out of five stars, trust me.

73
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.310
And down here for reviews,
we can see that we've again got ratings.

74
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.120
And this one comes from
within the app itself.

75
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.674
And so, this has probably gone through
some sort of approval process where you

76
00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:24.815
can tap on that and
see 160,000 reads or 160,000 votes.

77
00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:29.018
I mean, that's quite a lot.

78
00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:34.690
But this is an excerpt of one
review you get to see down there.

79
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.100
And I think part of this is also that
you wanna be able to invite customers

80
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.250
to click on their views or tap on their
views, and see what what's this all about.

81
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.475
And it's sort of a sign that something's
off if it's a non-interactive thing.

82
00:05:49.475 --> 00:05:54.000
Almost the same way that like an SSL
seal that's just an image like, or

83
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.832
a Better Business Bureau badge on your
site that's like not linking to your

84
00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:01.850
actual Better Business Bureau record.

85
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.740
When I see that I immediately check
to see if I'm on HTTPS or not.

86
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.110
I realized that I'm gonna trap and
start looking around for other signs.

87
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.151
So tomorrow I want to show to you recipes
just like Pinterest we get a little

88
00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:16.826
bit of that.

89
00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:21.931
You see it's far less rich because
Google's trying to be more generalized

90
00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:27.361
than Pinterest, which is very much
oriented towards particular community and

91
00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:33.360
recipes are a big part of, where that
community has gravitated towards.

92
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.283
And then finally,

93
00:06:34.283 --> 00:06:37.929
sorry I miss titled this here shouldn't
be products it should be courses.

94
00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:42.213
Courses is one of the things
that Google has provided,

95
00:06:42.213 --> 00:06:44.644
like first class support for.

96
00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:49.036
And you can see here like these are the
Arduino courses that are available on

97
00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:50.210
Coursera.

98
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.960
And we've got a couple different

99
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.970
items here that have to do
with this particular query.

100
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.010
You see, they haven't done a very
good job with their breadcrumbs.

101
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.660
That's one thing.

102
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.021
But you can see that the producer
of each course is listed here,

103
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:10.228
at least the first part of a description
and of course, the title is there.

104
00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:15.031
And again, these arrows to the right
indicate they're each addressable items,

105
00:07:15.031 --> 00:07:19.710
meaning they each have a URL, you could
visit a page and it is about that course.

106
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.788
So these are all things they will
typically only show up if you're on

107
00:07:25.788 --> 00:07:27.177
a mobile device, right?

108
00:07:27.177 --> 00:07:29.703
Because they're trying to make it so

109
00:07:29.703 --> 00:07:34.200
that mobile search results
are as engaging as possible.

110
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.030
And that's why all of these look
sort of like mobile things.

111
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.960
So one that everyone should be
implementing is breadcrumbs.

112
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:52.390
And you notice that Coursera had
like a query pram in their little

113
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:57.070
breadcrumb link over here that query
equals Arduino, that's not human readable.

114
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.780
That's not nice.

115
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.000
That's like code surfacing in the UI for
the user, which is bad.

116
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.600
So here with metadata, we have the ability
to control the way we look here.

117
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.670
And so
you see I've got like three levels here.

118
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.400
One is the root of my web application,
and then a section for courses and

119
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.220
then an individual course.

120
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.870
That's a nice human readable breadcrumb
there that helps Google understand

121
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.610
how my site is structured.

122
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.930
And I've given them hints as to like
the hierarchy of things that I've built.

123
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.080
So this is not an enriched card except for
the breadcrumb here.

124
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.491
This is not a course card.

125
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:42.307
So you may wonder like,
so this is the JSON,

126
00:08:42.307 --> 00:08:45.360
this is the first time you're seeing it.

127
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.590
Where can I look to see
what is required for

128
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.520
all of these different entities,
and it's not simple.

129
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.810
What you're looking at here
is just breadcrumbs and

130
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.460
it's a lot, like it goes way
below this bottom of the slide.

131
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.230
It is pretty verbose as JSON
of this type tends to be.

132
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.050
So there is a source of truth for where
you can look to see like exactly how these

133
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:13.300
objects should appear,
and it is schema.org.

134
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.038
So if we go down this huge
list of schemas they provide,

135
00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:21.129
provide like a standard shape for.

136
00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:25.000
And shape, you can think of that as
like the names of the properties and

137
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.690
the types expected in
the values of those properties.

138
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:35.110
You can see here we've got like, there's
course, there's a creative work series.

139
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.290
So if you had a series of movies, like
Star Wars would be a series of movies that

140
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.430
has a bunch of individual
movies associated with it.

141
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.510
We've got further down
a software application.

142
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.830
We've got a movie up top there.

143
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.900
We've got a publication issue and
a publication volume.

144
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.810
So lots and
lots of different things, events.

145
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.320
And you can see there are even
subtypes of these events.

146
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.470
They have a schema for a festival
versus a literary and music event.

147
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.180
So it is a really granular and deep.

148
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.150
You won't find things that can read
all of these different schemas.

149
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.660
Even Google has a main contributor
to this community effort to define

150
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.450
what all of these objects look like.

151
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.950
They only support like 10 or
12 of them for now.

152
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.687
But they sort of,
it's good to have the definition

153
00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:36.076
initiative out ahead of like
what we need the standard to be.

154
00:10:36.076 --> 00:10:39.839
So we've got reservations,
which that's used in Gmail for

155
00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.030
a restaurant reservation,
something like that.

156
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.600
So they can see like it is at
this time at this location.

157
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.410
And so on and so on and so on.

158
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.178
Place of worship, taxi stand,

159
00:10:52.178 --> 00:10:59.070
I bet you didn't know that they
needed to be standardized and so on.

160
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.270
So if we look at one of
these individual schemas,

161
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.280
this is the name of the property
on the left, the expected type.

162
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.800
So everything that is not just text as
you see some of these are our text here.

163
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.930
Those are expected to be
other schema.org objects.

164
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.960
So when we see,
if we go down a little bit more,

165
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.720
if we see like founder is supposed
to be an organization or person.

166
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.480
That's gonna be a nested
object inside your

167
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.000
JSON with a complete
description of that thing.

168
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.200
Now you'll look at organization and

169
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.540
you might see that like that even goes
deeper in their sub-nested items there.

170
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.850
You can just use your discretion
as to when you should stop.

171
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:45.540
I don't see really any value in going,
unless it's a really important

172
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.100
piece of information that I'm trying to
proliferate as far as I possibly can.

173
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.370
I don't go more than
one nested level deep.
