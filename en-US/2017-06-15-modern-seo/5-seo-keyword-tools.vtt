1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.730
Two more tools I want you to know
about are Google Keyword Planner, and

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.170
Google Trends.

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.700
So Google Keyword Planner is great for
expanding out from

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.580
a basic set of keywords, finding relevant
related phrases that you should also hit.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.040
Google Trends,
I'm sure many of you have heard of it.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.550
If you haven't taken a look at it
recently, it has gotten a lot better.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.340
It used to be like two years ago,

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.530
it would consider computer programming
to be one unsplittable topic and

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.550
we would see like, the trend of
computer programming is going up.

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.810
And now, when I demonstrate it, how it
works, which is what I'm gonna do next,

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.910
you'll see that things get
quite a bit more granular.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.660
So with that,
I'm just gonna give you a quick

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.510
walkthrough as to how these tools work,
the two Google tools.

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.940
So what we have here is, we have a couple
sort of things you can do in this tool.

15
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.810
We can sort of examine with
the richness of a set of keywords.

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.820
So looking at the volume data that's,

17
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.260
you're getting to see Google
search volume on these keywords.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.470
And this is my favorite tool of the three,
because naming things is hard,

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.950
coming up with expanded name for
these are comprehensive lists is hard.

20
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.720
So we're gonna look at search for
new keywords using a phrase website or

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720
category.

22
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.730
And finally, this last one,
which is sort of the the expander, and

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.100
I'm gonna just use frontend
masters as an example here.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.730
So let's use frontendmasters.com.

25
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.130
And let's see if they have our
modern SEO workshop page as

26
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.160
one of the things that Google
has indexed thoroughly.

27
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.180
We're gonna constrain our
search to English, and

28
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.690
we're already set up for
the United States.

29
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.337
Let me cancel this, so
I was trying the SAS course last night.

30
00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:58.110
And now, we can just hit Get Ideas,
and what it's doing is,

31
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.853
it's kind of looking through the content,
and

32
00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:06.923
it looks like we've got a lot of
general information about SEO.

33
00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:11.159
It's a course for frontend developer,
learn to be a frontend developer,

34
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.053
responsive design with emails.

35
00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:17.938
So this stuff doesn't really relate
to the SEO course specifically, but

36
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:22.449
you can see that it is really,
really focused on frontend masters.

37
00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:26.420
And typically, what I do here is,
I wanna look at the suggested bid.

38
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.180
And I skip over, like anything that's in
the $40 range, screw that, no, thank you.

39
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.445
Web developers online,
that's also a low intent keyword.

40
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:40.430
That's someone that's looking for
a contractor.

41
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.036
That's not someone that's looking for
a video course.

42
00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:45.790
Here, email design course.

43
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.305
Now, if we had something that was on
HTML emails, and we were sure that

44
00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:52.145
we would get a conversion on that-
&gt;&gt; Which we do.

45
00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:56.065
&gt;&gt; We do, so
the subscription price of frontend

46
00:02:56.065 --> 00:03:00.915
masters per month might not
justify spending $28 for

47
00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:05.160
a bid on that keyword,
that's one bid, right?

48
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.440
So going down here,
the less than $10 range,

49
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.204
that is where I think that
you can get a lot more value.

50
00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.045
So learn web development.

51
00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:22.435
This looks good, there's high competition,
so that might turn me off there.

52
00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.433
But APIs with Node JS, that's a good one.

53
00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:31.599
We have a great Node JS API design course,
which that the Express course, right?

54
00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.805
Express and node.

55
00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:37.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have several API
design with node Express course,

56
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.980
and then we have a production
node with AWS deploying the APIs.

57
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.620
&gt;&gt; So what we can also do is, I can
say that I don't want anything that is

58
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.110
greater than $10 here, and I only want
medium and low competition keywords.

59
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.490
So if I'm gonna show up, and there's
a bunch of other highly competitive people

60
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.390
trying to edge me out, I will opt out,
I don't wanna spend money on that, right?

61
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.390
You might have a different strategy for
that group, if I have a bakery and

62
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.370
I'm trying to compete with Panera,
maybe I just wanna say, look,

63
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.990
if you're looking for Panera,
you're not my customer, right?

64
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.470
They sell these mass produced baked goods,
and

65
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.502
I'm trying to sell these gluten free
special things that they don't even offer.

66
00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:30.080
But here, now we're in business where
we see some of these low competition.

67
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.410
So you want low competition,

68
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.020
high number of average monthly searches,
high relevant to you and your business.

69
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.652
And then what we can do is, we can
actually add some of these to effectively

70
00:04:40.652 --> 00:04:44.912
a shopping cart, which then they make it,
of course really easy for

71
00:04:44.912 --> 00:04:48.225
you to convert that into
a Google AdWords campaign.

72
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:51.897
But you can also use this,
if you take the frontend masters,

73
00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:55.425
some of the basic Web development
courses and use jQuery,

74
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:59.541
you could even scrape this and
just get the keywords out of their UI.

75
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:03.340
And use it elsewhere, just as a big
like text file containing all of these.

76
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.110
&gt;&gt; So we originally did
all the keyword research.

77
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.654
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We used aid tools,

78
00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:09.830
acting like we're gonna pay.

79
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.988
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But then take those keywords and

80
00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:16.843
place it in the title tags, in the
descriptions, in the page, in the links,

81
00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:21.575
get link, inbound links, using those
keywords, and then show up first-

82
00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:22.094
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

83
00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:23.765
&gt;&gt; In the organic search.

84
00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:27.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are using your your
frontend development skills to have

85
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.740
an advantage over people that don't know
they can extract this stuff really easily.

86
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.652
So that's Google AdWords, sorry,
that is the keyword planner.

87
00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:39.640
I wanna show you this other aspect
of it that expands keywords.

88
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.690
And we will see if we can come up
with an interesting result there.

89
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.200
So if I wanna put in here,
let me put Ember,

90
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.487
Angular, view, react, polymer,

91
00:05:55.487 --> 00:06:00.960
others like smelt glimmer for react.

92
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.219
All right, so let's see what happens.

93
00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.305
So please, enter keywords and
at least two list.

94
00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:09.780
So these are,

95
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.944
See what has changed a little bit, let's
see, one more line separated by commas.

96
00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:28.092
Okay, And

97
00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:33.516
over here, we can do Promise, JavaScript,

98
00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:38.244
Async function, and let's try this.

99
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.534
This might be a little bit specific here.

100
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.360
Okay, so we found a very small
intersection between these two things.

101
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.670
Google Trends is really interesting here,

102
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.245
in terms of how it has
developed over time.

103
00:06:57.245 --> 00:07:02.420
And I'll show you what I expect will be
surprising to some of you in terms of

104
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.490
the granularity that we can have react js.

105
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.740
So it is identified,
React as a JavaScript library.

106
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.620
Yeah, this is hugely more
granular than it used to be.

107
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.230
We've gone from like,
computer programming,

108
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.510
a profession, to react js,
it is a JavaScript library.

109
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.335
They don't even call it a framework,
correctly so [LAUGH].

110
00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:30.090
&gt;&gt; Where were you typing that?

111
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.880
&gt;&gt; Sorry,

112
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.830
we're at Google Trends here, and I'm right
here at, we're a little cut off here.

113
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.820
Let me see if I can grow things up,

114
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.210
let me just shrink my window,
so it's not fullscreen.

115
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.910
We have a little projector issue here.

116
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.720
There we go, so we've got explorer
topics up at the top, and

117
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.350
I can just type reactjs.

118
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.110
Well, let's see if I can do,
I'll be really impressed if they do this.

119
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.883
Okay, they don't get preact, sorry, Jason.

120
00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:07.580
All right, react apparently
meets with the criteria here.

121
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.050
And boy, it is increasing in popularity.

122
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.360
I wonder, this must have been like the f8
conference or something like that.

123
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.460
And apparently, super popular in China.

124
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.640
This doesn't surprise me, a lot of Chinese
software development is consulting and

125
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.680
contracting to support American companies,
this is the most popular framework.

126
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.380
Freelancers always wanna
gravitate towards the thing that

127
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.040
there's the largest number of jobs for, so

128
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.250
that's why we're seeing a lot of interest
there, a lot of interest in the States.

129
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.820
And you can see that related topics
are also pretty like granular here.

130
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.390
We've got Node.js, we've got ECMAScript,
git, TypeScript, Meteor is coming up,

131
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.720
Sass, that's what we taught yesterday,
and so on.

132
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.220
So I just want this to pop back up on your
radar as not just a tool that you can use

133
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.210
for keeping a pulse on the trends
of the world, but you can see,

134
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.600
what are the up and coming things
that relate to your technology.

135
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.380
If you were looking for

136
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.210
a list of blog posts, this would
not be a terrible place to start,

137
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.750
to get inspiration for topics to write
about that relate to your specialization.

138
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.750
Here's an interesting one that
I was playing with last night.

139
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.210
It's, if we remove this,
and we search for elixir.

140
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.955
So we found that this was elixir
as a programming language,

141
00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:34.911
it's identified that,
which is surprising again.

142
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:42.263
So steadily increasing, so
it is doubled in popularity since 2014,

143
00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:47.490
2015 until now,
which that seems about right.

144
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.593
But look at how we have a concentration in
Scandinavia and Poland on this language,

145
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:58.127
which totally makes sense because
Sweden is where Erling is,

146
00:09:58.127 --> 00:10:01.130
and elixir is really popular there.

147
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.780
But you can see that we have sort of
a hotbed of that in this particular area.

148
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.565
So in terms of like,
when I do Alexa workshops, I know,

149
00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:15.227
I'm doing one in Berlin later this month
because this is where that's happening.

150
00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:18.838
So Google Trends is hugely more
useful than it has been in the past,

151
00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:23.372
just because, either they have more data
or their algorithms have gotten better.

152
00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:29.354
But the end result is like, you can really
see, with a high degree of granularity,

153
00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:33.383
where things are going and
clusters of related topics.

154
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:37.027
&gt;&gt; The whole debate around it is,
are they searching for it because they're

155
00:10:37.027 --> 00:10:40.580
interested in it or because they're
having problems with it, right?

156
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.324
So like angular versus react,
is angular actually more popular or

157
00:10:45.324 --> 00:10:49.998
is it that they're having more errors and
searching [INAUDIBLE].

158
00:10:49.998 --> 00:10:54.179
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't have any advice there,
that's a problem unique to you and

159
00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:54.724
me Mark.

160
00:10:54.724 --> 00:10:55.301
&gt;&gt; It is true.

161
00:10:55.301 --> 00:10:58.637
&gt;&gt; Where the meta people in the room
that are actually targeting programming

162
00:10:58.637 --> 00:10:59.240
languages.

163
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:05.730
With that, so I hope you play with
Google Trends a little bit on your own.

164
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.309
It's like some of the best free data
you can get for trends and topics.

165
00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:16.123
And my favorite section is at the bottom,
these related topics and

166
00:11:16.123 --> 00:11:18.914
related queries where you can just,
like here,

167
00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:23.835
if you didn't know that Ecto is something
you should target if you're using elixir.

168
00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:27.997
So that's their persistence library,
you should absolutely use that

169
00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:31.680
Phoenix framework,
is like the rails equivalent there.

170
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.480
So we're already seeing, these are amazing
keywords to hone in on, that might not

171
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.090
be as competitive as the word elixir which
by the way, I don't target because I get

172
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.400
a bunch of pharmacy related competition
there, for just the general word elixir.

173
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.070
And rails would be the same problem,
rails for what?

174
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.230
Rails for your garage door, so and

175
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.230
this would let you kind of hone
in on something more relevant.
