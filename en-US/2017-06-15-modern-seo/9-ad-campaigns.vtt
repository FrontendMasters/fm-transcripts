1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.020
So let's move on from sort of
the organic side of SEO and

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.350
talk a little bit about Ads.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.020
So Ads have gotten better and
better and better over time.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.020
This is a huge business, online Ads.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.409
And the reason it's a huge
business is because by and large,

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.200
it's pretty effective when
used in certain ways.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.991
The thing that makes it most effective is
targeting for Ads is getting better and

8
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:30.215
better and better.

9
00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:34.976
So when I was working at Yahoo,
we would be able to kind of take all of

10
00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:39.672
this audience that was coming to
like Yahoo related properties.

11
00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:45.571
And we could allow people to market
to a 25 to 35 year old male or

12
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.127
female in the Minneapolis metro area.

13
00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:53.750
Who's likely to have a college
education and own a Mercedes Benz.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.233
Like we could get that specific and
come up with 40,000 people,

15
00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.860
that statistically meet that criteria.

16
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.520
They have some likelihood
of meeting that criteria.

17
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.840
And this has to do with
all of the data that is

18
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.630
used in your free apps like Gmail and
Yahoo mail in all of your searches.

19
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.526
All of that is sort of anonymously
aggregated over time, right?

20
00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:25.850
So, it's not associated with your name,
it's associated with a unique ID.

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.830
And all of these companies
are very careful to keep a wall

22
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.490
between the personal data, and sort of
the advertising, tracking stuff, right?

23
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.050
So even as like someone that
could deploy a version of Yahoo's

24
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.330
ad platform on my own wholesale, I could
never get access to the personal data.

25
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.500
If there was just,
I would need like a hand scan access and

26
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.570
to be like inside the data center.

27
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.010
Just the security there is crazy, for
good reason to keep customers safe.

28
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.140
But more and more targeting is really,
really powerful

29
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
in terms of interests, in terms of
demographic, in terms of location.

30
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130
So, for example,
when I have public workshops,

31
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.520
in person workshops, I want it to
be near an international airport.

32
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.900
In a place where there is
a pretty vibrant tech community,

33
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.240
where English is a reasonably
prominent language there.

34
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.386
And I can really target
my advertising dollars,

35
00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:32.033
in little tiny islands all over the world.

36
00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:37.865
Skip over countries where maybe
the average income of a developer,

37
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:43.608
is a little bit lower than what I
would be asking for a ticket price.

38
00:02:43.608 --> 00:02:48.520
It makes it not sort of a feasible
cost for them to pay, and so on.

39
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.420
So this is getting better and
better and better year over year.

40
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.400
Advertising it's
reasonably cost effective,

41
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.060
it depends what your business is, But
if you can get your keywords right.

42
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.766
There's sort of a, it's one of these
things where there's an expert can do much

43
00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:10.500
better than someone who
puts no effort into it.

44
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.433
Meaning, if you do your research and you
find your keywords, and we go and look for

45
00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:16.680
those longtail keyword phrases.

46
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.753
You will be able to deploy
your advertising dollars,

47
00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:25.107
twice as well as you would if
you just tried to have asset.

48
00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:27.800
You can deploy a marketing
budget when it matters.

49
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.640
So if you're gearing up for
an acquisition, or

50
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.100
maybe you have a holiday sale and you
wanna just drive a whole bunch of traffic.

51
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.150
Because it's important to get a certain
number of customers at a particular time.

52
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.890
Or if you have an in person event,
if you're running a trade show and

53
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.200
you wanna like.

54
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.880
Get out there and advertising dollars
leading up to that matter a lot and

55
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.924
the day after we can just
not advertise at all.

56
00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:56.235
So, it's a spigot that you can turn on and
off, really easily compared to.

57
00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.728
If you bought a billboard they don't
wanna put your billboard up for

58
00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:01.450
three days and then take it down.

59
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.200
No other business works that
way where you can sort of,

60
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.680
have that really fast on off
switch that's totally up to you.

61
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.694
You get a really short feedback loop.

62
00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:15.328
So when we think about advertising,
oftentimes you'll have a campaign.

63
00:04:15.328 --> 00:04:19.288
Which is that is your overall effort
towards this goal of bringing in new

64
00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:20.450
customers.

65
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.780
And within the campaign
you'll have line items.

66
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.650
And line items are usually picking
out particular segments of people,

67
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.300
they might be particular sets of keywords.

68
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.530
And you'll buy like X number of dollars
targeted towards these keywords,

69
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.310
and some targeted towards these keywords.

70
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.480
Oftentimes, you'll have experimental
line items that you'll put in there and

71
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.730
you'll say, I don't,
I teach functional JavaScript.

72
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.650
And I know I don't teach Elm, But

73
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.410
people who use Elm might find my
functional JavaScript course useful.

74
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.410
Because Elm is a functional language, and
ultimately it ends up being JavaScript.

75
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.780
So let's just try taking $50 out of my
ad budget and targeted towards Elm.

76
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.780
And let's see if maybe these
people respond or they don't.

77
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.000
But you're gonna know
within a couple of days,

78
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.408
just because the volume of searching is so
high.

79
00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:23.220
And you're gonna get a signal,
one way or the other, it'll wash out and

80
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.920
then you've spent $50 to get your answer.

81
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.380
Or you'll figure out that hey,

82
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.890
this is really doing well,
let's put some more budget in here.

83
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.500
And nowhere else,
do I see a short feedback loop like this.

84
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.100
Not even Google analytics where
you're writing, a nice blog post and

85
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.690
then seeing who hits it.

86
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.480
Then you have to wait for all the readers
to find your link, you have to wait for

87
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.440
that to spread.

88
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.208
That might be on the scale of
a month that it takes, for

89
00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:51.434
you to look at your traffic and
to see like.

90
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:57.425
All right, this is really resonating
with this new group, let's act on that.

91
00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:01.964
You have control over risk, which in
the next slide when we talk about pricing,

92
00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:03.062
we can talk about.

93
00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:08.292
How they're different options for
paying for Ads, ranging from

94
00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:14.676
taking on all the risk that someone who
sees your message, sees your business.

95
00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:17.897
You have taken on all the risk
that they might not act,

96
00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:21.771
versus asking the advertising
platform to take on all the risk.

97
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:25.547
And you only pay when someone acts.

98
00:06:25.547 --> 00:06:30.423
And I'd like to run this out by saying,
despite the fact that,

99
00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:36.317
it is cost effective most of the time,
that the short feedback loop exists.

100
00:06:36.317 --> 00:06:42.106
You have to really stay on it, and this
doesn't work for every business, right?

101
00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:46.738
And in fact, I have turned my
advertising budget down quite a bit,

102
00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:50.562
because I found that for
in person trainings, right?

103
00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:56.316
Which is my business, going to conferences
and meeting people face to face there.

104
00:06:56.316 --> 00:07:02.116
That is by large the best way for
me to get new customers, right?

105
00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:05.124
Online Ads just people don't search and

106
00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:09.913
they don't engage with a trainer
by searching for them online.

107
00:07:09.913 --> 00:07:13.824
So I would say if it turns out to not
work, and maybe you've tried two or

108
00:07:13.824 --> 00:07:15.565
three different approaches.

109
00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:18.375
Don't keep pumping money
into this blindly,

110
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:21.842
assuming that this is a part
of every business strategy.

111
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.973
For some businesses, it's just not.

112
00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:29.843
So let's look at the way Ad
campaigns are typically priced.

113
00:07:29.843 --> 00:07:34.596
This is ranging from taking on
all of the risks that someone

114
00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:38.481
might not convert and
having the cheapest Ads.

115
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:44.099
Ranging towards only paying for guaranteed
conversion for the most expensive Ads.

116
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.020
So we begin with CPM pricing.

117
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.070
So this is cost per 1000 impressions, and

118
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.755
ad platforms are happy to sell as much
of this as you're willing to buy, right?

119
00:07:56.755 --> 00:08:00.080
Cuz this is just like if they think that

120
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.710
this is someone that matches
the criteria you've specified.

121
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.620
They'll put your ad on the screen, they'll
actually hook into the some of the browser

122
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.920
functions that monitor whether that image
actually gets painted on the screen.

123
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.090
So as you scroll the page up,
this actually makes sure that

124
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.690
your ad was in the viewport, and
is counted as an impression.

125
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.830
Oftentimes, it has to get like fully
into the viewport above the fold.

126
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.330
And you get 1000 of those for
a fixed amount of money, right?

127
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:33.250
And this can also be done by bidding,
where you know there's gonna when

128
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.110
people that match your criteria,
their browsing may need to fill in an ad.

129
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.220
There will be a little mini bidding war,
to see who gets it and

130
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.295
then after 10 milliseconds, someone's won
the bidding war and your ad gets served.

131
00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:52.940
So but again, you could show
your Ads to 100,000 people and

132
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.925
none of them could click,
and you'll still get built.

133
00:08:55.925 --> 00:09:00.450
So if you wanna offset some of that risk,
pay a little more for

134
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.370
a little more certainty.

135
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.770
You would go to cost per click,
and here you're paying for

136
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.490
someone to actually follow that ad,
click on it and land on your site, right?

137
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.810
And this is where, it's on you
with to have a great landing page,

138
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.944
that has a clear call to action.

139
00:09:17.944 --> 00:09:22.737
And it's really, totally clear how
you should proceed from there on

140
00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:26.962
because this is sort of your
first signal of intent, right?

141
00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:31.431
They've clicked on it,
they're interested, go for it.

142
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:34.409
You have to be careful
with cost per click,

143
00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:38.972
because the ad platforms goal is
to make as much money as they can.

144
00:09:38.972 --> 00:09:43.400
And if it turns out that no one's clicking
on your ad, at the end of the month.

145
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.571
You'll have said like,
I'm willing to spend $1,000 on this ad and

146
00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:49.468
they'll say, very good, sir.

147
00:09:49.468 --> 00:09:52.320
You ended up spending $3
of your advertising budget.

148
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.400
We showed it to a bunch of people,
no one bit on the hook.

149
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.560
And so
we decided to show other people's Ads, so

150
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.030
that we could make money
off of their clicks.

151
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.287
So, bidding too low on cost per click,

152
00:10:06.287 --> 00:10:11.833
will result in not all of your
advertising budget being deployed.

153
00:10:13.548 --> 00:10:18.288
So this is the kind of thing that you
wanna tune properly and typically,

154
00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:22.700
it's almost like this price
is right rules or something?

155
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.900
No, it's not prices right rule?

156
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.460
So you ended up paying it's eBay rules,
that's it.

157
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.663
So you can bid $10,
maximum bid of $10 for cost per click.

158
00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.328
And more often than not,

159
00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:38.760
the policy is like you will pay one cent
more than the person you barely edged out.

160
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.850
So if your competitor was only willing to
pay $2, you'll pay 201 for that click.

161
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.420
So you don't end up like your maximum bid
is not what you're paying on a per click

162
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.510
basis, but
it's where you're out of the running.

163
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.741
You say like that's,
it's too rich for my blood.

164
00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:57.774
So going one step deeper, like let's say,

165
00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:01.922
okay, well, I wanna offset even more risk.

166
00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:04.170
People are clicking,
they're not converting.

167
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.160
They're not filling in my sign up form.

168
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.850
So then we'd have what's
called cost per action.

169
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.090
Some people call this cost per conversion,
don't be confused,

170
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.258
CPC always means cost per click.

171
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:20.186
And the idea here,
this is more common when you're dealing

172
00:11:20.186 --> 00:11:23.451
with a referral kind of relationship.

173
00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:27.507
So, if there's a business that
sort of upstream from yours,

174
00:11:27.507 --> 00:11:32.044
maybe like Mark, would have
a relationship with a coding bootcamp.

175
00:11:32.044 --> 00:11:36.598
Where like after they complete the coding
bootcamp, they get like a coupon code and

176
00:11:36.598 --> 00:11:38.626
a signup form for front end masters.

177
00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:43.357
And that is a directed path where
it's like highly qualified people

178
00:11:43.357 --> 00:11:45.354
that are likely to convert.

179
00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:46.792
What would happen is Mark,

180
00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:50.114
would put what's called a pixel
at the end of some signup flow.

181
00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:55.890
And loading that pixel represents having
reached the end of the signup flow.

182
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.910
This is literally a one pixel
by one pixel transparent image.

183
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.770
And it just serves to be proof that
someone reached that location,

184
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.300
and they had this cookie in their browser.

185
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:13.090
And that constitutes them having gone
from one site through the other flow and

186
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.530
reaching the end, and
that would be a conversion.

187
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.859
So you'll pay pretty dearly for this.

188
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.429
Definitely, on the order of $15 to $100,
something like this.

189
00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:29.787
But the idea is now you've got someone
that's actually filled something in,

190
00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:31.580
they're on your mailing list.

191
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.397
And you would look at this,

192
00:12:33.397 --> 00:12:39.100
this would be a big part of your customer
acquisition cost in business terms, right?

193
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.348
There's a variant of this
that exists in Ad platforms,

194
00:12:42.348 --> 00:12:45.540
called cost per install that
is unique to mobile apps.

195
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.040
And this is where you're trying to get
someone to install this game and whatnot.

196
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.050
And when the install completes,
there's a little callback URL,

197
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.790
you can place in the App Store link.

198
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.970
Which will kind of serve
the same purpose of the pixel,

199
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:05.290
in that it'll notify the party
who is paying for this.

200
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.890
That the install has completed and

201
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.450
you have one more install and
we're billing you for one more
