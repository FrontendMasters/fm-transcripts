00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.330
So we're gonna build on top of the same
Open Graph example, we've done Facebook,

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.292
we've done Twitter, now we're
going to add some Open Graph data.

3
00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:12.660
You're gonna do this by way of adding that
special script block with the JSON LD

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.110
type to it in the body of your HTML.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.670
You don't need to be in the head for this,

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.830
although you could be,
it would still work as far as I know.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.580
And I want you to just on the course page,
the course.HBS page,

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.580
add the proper metadata for
courses for that course.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.990
And also add breadcrumbs because
it's only one breadcrumb deep.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.700
So it's gonna be like, list of courses and
then the name of the course, yes.

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.740
&gt;&gt; There's a question online
about the breadcrumbs.

12
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.894
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Does that script tag go in the head or

13
00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:47.820
in the body?

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.530
&gt;&gt; In the body is fine.

15
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.960
&gt;&gt; In the body is fine.

16
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.710
&gt;&gt; Yep,
which by the way makes it well suited for

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.050
single page apps and things like React and
Ember and Angular Tube.

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.770
Because, as you're defining the way
the visible stuff looks to your user,

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.969
side by side within the same component,
you could define the JSON

20
00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:16.810
using either JSX or handlebars,
or whatever you end up using.

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.820
So there is yet
another tool I want to show you,

22
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.280
this one is the Google
structured data testing tool.

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.960
And it's also in your list of important
tools, so you can do this in two ways.

24
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
You can either paste
a snippet of the special

25
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
formatted JSON into this area here.

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.260
Or you can have it hit a URL and validate,
like reading the appropriate script tags,

27
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.935
what would this,
what would Google see here.

28
00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:51.620
So you'll do, if we grab, let's see,

29
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.400
let me see if I can find my course again.

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.914
Here we go do, I'll this one, see if I've
done my job properly here, hit that URL.

31
00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:13.079
All right, this is a good result here,
so my breadcrumb list looks like this.

32
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.290
Here's, this is the equivalent
of the JSON in table form, so

33
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.440
you see we've got a type of list item and
ID, IDs don't have to be numbers.

34
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.931
Using URLs is fine, particularly if
they're addressable items, that's

35
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:34.780
as good a unique string to use as any, and
if we look at what the course looks like.

36
00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.751
Here's the name and
the description and the provider and

37
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:45.644
etc, this is new, preview,
I wonder what that does.

38
00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:48.903
Interesting.

39
00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.671
So this is trying to preview
what the course would look like,

40
00:02:54.671 --> 00:03:00.260
if I narrow this down a bit, well I guess,
let's see, maybe I'm zoomed out, yep.

41
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.660
If I narrow this down, so this is, if we
think about what the Coursera course looks

42
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.340
like, here and
bring my Chrome back up front.

43
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.500
Here you go, that is a preview
of exactly what we're seeing

44
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.910
as one of the items in
the course list there.

45
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.460
So you see here's the name of my
organization, here's the description, and

46
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.920
here's the name of the course itself.

47
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.670
So, Google structured data testing tool,
it's available in that same list of tools,

48
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.150
our course and our breadcrumbs, push to
Heroku, make sure URL works, 20 minutes.
