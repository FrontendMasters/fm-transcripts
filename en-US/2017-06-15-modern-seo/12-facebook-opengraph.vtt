1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.260
So, the next thing we're gonna be
talking about here is, social metadata.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.368
So we've got the very
basic level of metadata.

3
00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:11.680
This is the same, this is not modern yet.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.155
These are the same practices you
would have employed to boost

5
00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:22.426
your SEO in 2003, this is really,
really old stuff.

6
00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:25.190
And now we're gonna get
into the newer stuff.

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.222
So, these are some of my favorite tools.

8
00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:35.593
We're gonna be using at least
four of the five today.

9
00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:41.994
The one we won't do an exercise with is
Pinterest, because you need to ask for

10
00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:48.104
permission from Pinterest to be allowed
to create rich Pinterest tiles,

11
00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:52.260
and we can't do that in
the context of a workshop.

12
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.380
But we're gonna use all of the other four,
we're gonna use Twitter, Facebook.

13
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.516
I hope you have this SEO META Chrome
extension installed, because it's a great

14
00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:03.909
way of, kind of, without having
to view the source of your HTML,

15
00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.193
seeing what are your keywords, what's
your description, what's your title.

16
00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:12.320
It'll give you a little alerts if things
are too short or too long, and so on.

17
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.420
And then
Google Structured Data Testing Tool,

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.820
which we will use pretty
extensively later on.

19
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.050
So, we're just gonna go through
some of the most important and

20
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.010
popular social networks one by one, and
talk about the kinds of structured data

21
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.990
we can provide, and what that will do for
the way your links show up.

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.658
The first one we're gonna talk about is,
Facebook OpenGraph.

23
00:01:36.658 --> 00:01:39.700
So Facebook OpenGraph,
it's a broad concept,

24
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.700
and it has an even deeper meaning
than we're gonna discuss today,

25
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.700
in the context of building
apps on the Facebook platform.

26
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.790
We can use a limited subset of the same
OpenGraph data, and the same concepts,

27
00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.790
when we are trying to give Facebook
hints as to what our URL means.

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.090
So here are some of the meta tags we can

29
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.230
put inside of our head in our HTML,
that relate to Facebook.

30
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.500
So you'll see, first off,
that they all begin with og:, right?

31
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.420
Og stands for OpenGraph.

32
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.293
And, we've got property and content,

33
00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:24.841
a little bit different than the name and
content,

34
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:29.930
which is what we were using before for
the description and the keyword.

35
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.800
So let's go through one by one and
talk about what these mean.

36
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.020
So first we've got this URL.

37
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.700
So this is what's known as the canonical
URL, we mentioned this earlier.

38
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.700
The idea here is that, you might have
a mobile specific URL that our users hit,

39
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.670
and then share that link on Facebook.

40
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.790
You might have an English and Spanish
version of your site, and the locale

41
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.570
is a subdomain on your app, so you've got
different URLs for different languages.

42
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.946
But you want to pile all of your
credibility, and all of that SEO goodness,

43
00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:04.180
and all of that activity in one place.

44
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.550
So you're gonna pick the one true URL for
each piece of content.

45
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.730
Oftentimes this is the desktop
version of this content.

46
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.930
And you want, regardless of language,
or form factor,

47
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.320
or variant of your app, for that
canonical URL to be the same everywhere.

48
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.740
That's what makes sure that,
when you get likes, or

49
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.600
when you get shares,
all of that credit is in one pile.

50
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.490
So you want to strip any query params,
any session variables.

51
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.310
All of that stuff should
be removed from the URL.

52
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.940
And it should be built with
the intent that it will never change.

53
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.720
So here's an example from,
I took a book from Amazon and

54
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.500
figured out what the canonical
URL would be for that.

55
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.080
You'll see that,
they have a human readable URL for

56
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.950
what you'd see in your address bar.

57
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.790
The canonical URL is just like an ID.

58
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.270
And the reasoning here might be that,
they might revise the name of

59
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.720
this book's title, or they might
release a second or third edition.

60
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.370
And they want to make sure that, even
if there is a need to change the human

61
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.270
readable URL,
the canonical URL remains constant.

62
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.110
They're never going to have to change it.

63
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.535
If it's like a unique ID, and

64
00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:29.196
it is immutable, we do not mess with it.

65
00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:33.770
They have an equal sign here in the URL,
that is not a query param related thing,

66
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.020
there is no question mark here, so
that's all part of the path of the URL.

67
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.163
So that's the canonical URL.

68
00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:45.600
We've also got something called a type.

69
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.480
And, by default, this will default to a
website, but this helps inform Facebook as

70
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.260
to what the concept is
that this URL is about.

71
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.320
And we've got lots of
different types here.

72
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.850
I scraped this off of
Facebook's documentation here.

73
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.145
So we've got lots of
different things we can use.

74
00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:04.886
If you don't provide this,
of course, we default to a website.

75
00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:10.660
So in terms of how this might
look a little bit different.

76
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.032
If we go back here and we look at this
New York Times card, I just want you to

77
00:05:15.032 --> 00:05:20.150
look to the right of the title and
the description, there's nothing.

78
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.610
So we're gonna look at different types.

79
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.040
This would be just an article.

80
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.040
And if we look at a song that
I shared from SoundCloud,

81
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.640
you can see we've got a Save button here.

82
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.990
So Facebook has, for media types
like books, and movies, and songs,

83
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.087
they kind of let you have
collections of bookmark-like things,

84
00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:45.230
where someone shares a song and
you wanna come back to it later.

85
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.175
You can save it, and then you can
revisit your list of saved songs,

86
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:54.039
which will basically just resurface this
list of cards again, but you're sort of

87
00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.218
earmarking it as like, this is a song and
I wanna come back to it later.

88
00:05:58.218 --> 00:06:01.370
It may seem like a subtle difference.

89
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.770
Over time, you should assume
that everyone's going to enrich

90
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.980
their social network UIs to make
even better and better, and

91
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.720
better use of this structured data.

92
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.310
So, even if you think, well,
that's not such a big deal.

93
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.480
In the future it might be that,

94
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.910
they expose a player directly in the card,
instead of just a thumbnail here.

95
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.898
And, so the point is, take it seriously,

96
00:06:25.898 --> 00:06:30.880
don't fall back to website if a more
appropriate option is available.

97
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.690
Even if you don't see that
it makes a difference,

98
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.210
in the future it might make a difference.

99
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.385
And then, all of Facebook's cached
information about your URLs,

100
00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:43.146
you'll be able to position where you can
take advantage of that new feature as

101
00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:44.330
soon as it's out.

102
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.860
We've also got another
OpenGraph tag called the title,

103
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.210
that's where that ends up.

104
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.516
If you don't provide a title,
we'll use what's in the title tag,

105
00:06:54.516 --> 00:06:56.667
the one we just filled in for
our basic site.

106
00:06:56.667 --> 00:07:01.494
Keep in mind that,
the length of a title, you can put a lot

107
00:07:01.494 --> 00:07:06.935
of information in your title
to show up in search results.

108
00:07:06.935 --> 00:07:12.050
Here, you may end up seeing that
your default title gets truncated.

109
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.700
That's the reason that you might want
an alternate field to put stuff in.

110
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.500
So you could tack your company's
name onto your title, for

111
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.910
the title tag that we've already
filled in and pushed up to Heroku.

112
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.012
But for this OpenGraph tag,
maybe you just want to.

113
00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:31.594
Your URL's already at the bottom here,
it might be redundant for

114
00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:35.890
you to say, soundcloud.com,
Wake Me Up remix.

115
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.671
So that's why we have two separate places
for this, one might be shorter and

116
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:41.398
more abbreviated than the other.

117
00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:44.350
Description goes here.

118
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.890
Keep in mind that,
usually this text is not enriched.

119
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.735
So this whole thing is a clickable link,
the whole tile.

120
00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:53.804
You'll see that here, SoundCloud, or

121
00:07:53.804 --> 00:07:58.240
I guess this artist,
has put two URLs in his description.

122
00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.650
They're not underlined.

123
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.890
It's just sort of adding
noise to his description.

124
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:09.490
And what's more, it sort of interferes
with your ability to read it nicely.

125
00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:15.080
So, that's missing an opportunity
to put some really

126
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.760
enticing first sentence that would
get you to click on this link.

127
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.820
Finally, we have an image, and
you may also see it as og:image:url.

128
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:35.020
So, images are interesting when it comes
to Facebook, for the following reason.

129
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.140
So, once Facebook sees an image at a URL,
it will never retrieve data for

130
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.423
that URL again.

131
00:08:41.423 --> 00:08:45.240
So you need to make sure
you get it the first time.

132
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.272
And if you miss some secondary data
that has to do with that image,

133
00:08:50.272 --> 00:08:56.494
you're gonna need a new image URL, you're
gonna need to create a new picture for

134
00:08:56.494 --> 00:09:01.550
that piece of HTML, so that it will go and
fetch that image again.

135
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.910
So, and
I am providing a best practice here,

136
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.390
not a must, but it's like a soft must.

137
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.241
Facebook doesn't know the width and height
of your image until it downloads the file,

138
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.720
and so you may end up with
a strange looking layout for

139
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.870
the first time a link is shared.

140
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.680
The first time a link is shared,
the image gets downloaded in.

141
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.650
It will calculate the width and height,
and it will know that moving on.

142
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.208
But the best practice is,
to specify it right in your HTML as,

143
00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:36.505
image:type, image:width,
and then image:height,

144
00:09:36.505 --> 00:09:41.280
which unfortunately is cut off for
people in the room.

145
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.500
But it looks just like image:width.

146
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.937
So this ensures that the first time
each image on your site is shared,

147
00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:56.610
it is formatted exactly as you intended,
no part of it is clipped off, and so on.

148
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.480
So Facebook would rather clip
your image off than reflow

149
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.280
the feed because your image
is bigger than it assumed.

150
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.790
Yes?
&gt;&gt; A quick question.

151
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.705
You're talking about Facebook OpenGraph.

152
00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:13.600
And OpenGraph is shared with LinkedIn,
and Reddit, and that stuff too.

153
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.162
Or is that different,
are you getting to that, sorry?

154
00:10:17.162 --> 00:10:21.350
&gt;&gt; So, they started the initiative,
Facebook did.

155
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.150
It is becoming more and
more of a standard, and

156
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.540
they've gotten buy-in from
other social networks.

157
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.830
So this is why I'm starting with Facebook,
because what we'll see is that,

158
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.070
Twitter will honor certain OpenGraph tags.

159
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.020
And, this is a great place
to start with the baseline.

160
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.329
Or if you get some
OpenGraph tags in there,

161
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:45.640
LinkedIn will start to read some of them.

162
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.102
I don't know the other people who
are buying into the standard, but,

163
00:10:49.102 --> 00:10:51.110
I know Pinterest reads a couple of them.

164
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.531
LinkedIn works slightly differently,

165
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:59.340
they use a third party
service to enrich their URLs.

166
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:06.241
And, not all OpenGraph links will work on
them currently, or at least very recently.

167
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.690
I don't know if they've
deployed something recently.

168
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.810
A lot of changes going on there recently,
they've totally redone their UI.

169
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.869
But good question.

170
00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:21.593
And it is becoming more and more of
a standard, which is great because,

171
00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:25.845
when things were more fragmented,
we had to kind of have tons and

172
00:11:25.845 --> 00:11:28.084
tons of redundant information.

173
00:11:28.084 --> 00:11:33.094
Every social network had their own
little description tag, everyone had

174
00:11:33.094 --> 00:11:38.441
their own title, and there is no value
in us defining that over and over again.

175
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:41.840
In terms of image sizes.

176
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.660
So I've told you how to
specify your image size.

177
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.360
The size of your image
will affect the way your

178
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.780
tiles are rendered in
someone's Facebook feed.

179
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.290
And every social network gets to sort of
decide how to handle this differently.

180
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:03.507
But, if your image does
not cover a 600 x 315 box,

181
00:12:03.507 --> 00:12:09.725
meaning both dimensions,
meet or exceed that width and

182
00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:14.240
height, you'll get a worse tile here.

183
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:21.700
So you just should aim to have at
least covering a 600 x 315 pixel box.

184
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.002
It is advised that you double both
of these dimensions, so that when

185
00:12:26.002 --> 00:12:30.833
this is shared on high resolution
mobile devices, like any recent iPhone,

186
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:36.350
when you think about like Retina Displays,
or the high resolution Android displays.

187
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.911
You want the opportunity to render
that at double the pixel ratio for

188
00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:42.359
that image content.

189
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:49.976
But you'll still get the wide image
as long as you break 600 x 315.

190
00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:57.780
With that, let's look at
the Exercises OpenGraph folder.

191
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.835
And I'd like everyone to open that up, and
to look at a couple of the files in there.

192
00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:07.162
So I'm gonna go look with you, and
then we'll come back to the instructions.

193
00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:10.578
But, the main idea here is that,

194
00:13:10.578 --> 00:13:16.320
we want to add OpenGraph data
to some pages on this site.
