1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.520
So we're gonna go through the exercise
where we add structured data to

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.620
the app we've built in
our Open Graph folder, so

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.460
that we can start to get search engine,
like results showing up in a richer way.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.970
So, what I've done in advance
is open up the structured

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.880
data documentation for
both breadcrumbs and courses.

6
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.040
And you may note that if you look in
data types here, there are only a couple

7
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.386
types of things that Google
provides first class,

8
00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:43.642
structured data support for.

9
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.560
They used to have a nice little list here
which apparently they've gotten rid of.

10
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.310
The search gallery, that's where it is.

11
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.480
So you see we've got recipes, events,
products, reviews and courses.

12
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.260
Those are the same ones I believe I showed
an example of each in the tiles before.

13
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.100
But having looked through
that whole schema.org list,

14
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.860
they only support five of these things.

15
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.290
Hopefully, more coming in the future,
but we can make use of these today.

16
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.120
So I'm going to just copy the markup for
the schema.org example.

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.620
And I'm gonna place it directly in
my body of the course.hbs file.

18
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.589
Again, still working in
the Open Graph exercise here.

19
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.060
Building on everything we
have been working on so far.

20
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.890
And what we ended up with is
this list of elements here.

21
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.520
Now we have got four items deep.

22
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.440
I only want two, so
am gonna get rid of these two here.

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.640
And let us just go down line by line and
explain what all this means.

24
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.910
So first we've got this context property,
this add context property and

25
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.010
its value is the schema.org URL.

26
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.860
Don't change this.

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.580
This is basically telling you, or it's
telling anything that parses this that you

28
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.830
are attempting to conform to something
in the schema.org library of entities.

29
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.798
It's almost like a, you can adhere
to particular XML namespaces and

30
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.410
provide a URL for that.

31
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.240
Same idea here.

32
00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:20.090
BreadcrumbList is the type of
object we're working with here.

33
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.630
So it is the top level entity.

34
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.840
And then we've got item list element,
that is an array,

35
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.900
each of which represent a segment of our
Breadcrumb going from left to right.

36
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.320
So the first thing we're gonna do
here is update this to Courses and

37
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.760
we can change this ID, which is
the URL that breadcrumb conforms to,

38
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.760
to the base URL of my herokuapp.

39
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.530
So I'll just put that in place here.

40
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.038
And the image attribute is I believe,
optional.

41
00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:59.680
So I'm gonna just go ahead and
remove that we might get a warning, but

42
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.500
I don't think it will block us entirely.

43
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.610
And then here, what I'm gonna wanna
do is use the base URL of our app.

44
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.290
Actually, I'm just gonna build on
the work that we've already done for

45
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.420
the canonical URLs that we have
already built using this slug.

46
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.488
So we're gonna use the exact same
thing for the schema.org stuff.

47
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:29.465
So going down here to this id of
the second item in our Breadcrumb,

48
00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:33.055
just like apparently I didn't grab it.

49
00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:41.170
Copy, I think it's trying to
direct me to the URL when I click.

50
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.550
Yeah, we'll just do it again.

51
00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:49.041
All right,

52
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:53.415
also keep in mind that we still wanna be
putting everything inside quotes here.

53
00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:56.975
So when handlebars is processing
these files, it's gonna go find and

54
00:03:56.975 --> 00:04:01.325
replace things that are inside
those pairs of braces.

55
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:03.515
And if there are no quotes around it,

56
00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:06.459
there will be no quotes around
the value that is put in its place.

57
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.445
So in particular here,
what we wanna do the course title,

58
00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:13.755
we're gonna wanna make sure that
it's all contained within a string.

59
00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:21.500
And this should do it.

60
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.918
I'm actually gonna push this up.

61
00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:27.930
I'm just gonna copy the snippet here, and
we're gonna use the Open Graph tester

62
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.750
in like snippet form.

63
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.280
And I'll just build on top of
the thing that I pasted from,

64
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370
which should be somewhere around here.

65
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.600
There we go.

66
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.330
Paste it in here, or we can keep
the script tag that was there for us.

67
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.150
And let's see what the parser
interprets this as.

68
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.350
So I got no errors, no warnings,
this looks good, right?

69
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.980
So we can consider this piece done.

70
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.705
Now let's go ahead and
move on to the course data.

71
00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:08.830
So I can collapse this,
get it out of the way.

72
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:18.890
And of course data should be I'll
just go back to my slides here.

73
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.390
There it is.

74
00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:23.360
So we're just gonna grab their example.

75
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.031
Paste it into our code,
make similar modifications.

76
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:40.159
All right, so
we leave schema.org in place.

77
00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.900
We leave type as course in place.

78
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.826
Here's the name of the course, so
we're gonna put the title here.

79
00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:49.900
And the description.

80
00:05:56.504 --> 00:06:03.094
And then we have a provider here and
I'm just gonna put Frontend Masters.

81
00:06:03.094 --> 00:06:09.833
And we'll link that to
frontendmasters.com.

82
00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.200
So grab that URL.

83
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.140
Paste it there.

84
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.080
Let's see how this looks.

85
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:25.690
So basically what I'm doing is I'm
letting our app get rendered locally.

86
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.950
And I can view source and
grab that little chunk here.

87
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.599
We're gonna go back to our tester,
see what this looks like.

88
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.790
Paste, show me.

89
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.820
Looks good.

90
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.520
Let's preview it.

91
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.450
Looks great.

92
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.640
So you see here frontend masters showed up
underneath that's the organization, right?

93
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.720
And there's a description and
there's the title.

94
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.310
So this, this looks fine to me.

95
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.402
Let's commit it.

96
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:08.356
And Push it to a Roku.

97
00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:16.702
And GitHub.

98
00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:22.300
Oops I tried to do too much here,
in one command.

99
00:07:23.332 --> 00:07:27.616
All right, so while that's deploying
anyone have any questions about structured

100
00:07:27.616 --> 00:07:28.851
data before we move on?

101
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:36.168
So this should be like,
this should be a compulsory thing,

102
00:07:36.168 --> 00:07:41.830
especially if Google supports something
that is related to your entity.

103
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.060
If you have recipes,
like get that marinated in there.

104
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.000
Because it'll just make your
search result much more rich, and

105
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.290
that makes people much more
likely to engage with them.

106
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.500
So I just wanna prove that this
works in our deployed app.

107
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.330
So if we go back here.

108
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.647
Go to Modern SEO, click it, test the URL.

109
00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:09.686
Let's see what this looks like.

110
00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:13.864
There's our course preview.

111
00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:17.480
And there it is.
