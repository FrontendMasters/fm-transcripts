1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.226
Let's talk about what happens in the event
that maybe you do hire a contractor.

2
00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:09.270
And you find out that some
of this stuff has been done.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.524
So what you'll end up with
is in Google Search Console,

4
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:14.544
you'll see very visible alerts.

5
00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:18.071
That you have basically bad links.

6
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:22.595
And what these often look like
they're like rings of sights that just

7
00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:24.788
contain pages full of keywords.

8
00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.167
And cloned copies of blog posts, and

9
00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:32.640
in the comment section of sites they'll
just be like links to various places.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.709
And it basically is a tangled web of
an attempt to gain the SEO system.

11
00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:40.070
It's all of these sites
linking to each other.

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.476
Some of these like Black Hat companies
they'll just own a bunch of domains, and

13
00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:46.463
deploy a bunch of WordPress sites.

14
00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.611
And that they will look like
there's sort of content there.

15
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:53.680
But the only purpose they serve is to
try to build a little credibility and

16
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.010
then lend it out.

17
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.158
Or to try to be like
those 100 purple circles

18
00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:07.421
that all point to a single entity
to try to boost its credibility.

19
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:13.580
Oftentimes, very often,
these these nests will be identified.

20
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.818
And they will be penalized, and
anything they'll link to what we penalize.

21
00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:21.037
So you are responsible,
like when Black Hat efforts happen and

22
00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:22.730
they refer to your site.

23
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.907
The assumption is,
that the business owner or

24
00:01:25.907 --> 00:01:29.094
someone associated with
that made it happen.

25
00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:33.892
So you need to take responsibility,
for cleaning up these bad links.

26
00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:38.590
The first thing you should try to do,
is reach out to the owners of these sites.

27
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.366
And see if you can get
your link taken down.

28
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:45.245
If you get no response or
if this strategy doesn't play out,

29
00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:47.610
you can use Google's Disavow Tool.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.818
Which is where you basically formally say,
when you're building

31
00:01:52.818 --> 00:01:57.851
the edges in this graph that
connects all of our sites like this.

32
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.511
This is not an intentional edge,
this was not something that I wanted,

33
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:02.980
something that I asked for.

34
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.340
And please remove it from consideration
when evaluating the weight of my site.

35
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.021
Otherwise when these
circles of self linking

36
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:18.078
Black Hat SEO sites,
when that gets taken down.

37
00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:21.921
Your site's gonna get
dragged down with it.

38
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:25.977
I mentioned earlier about trading
links with vendors and stuff.

39
00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:31.347
So when we talk about referring
to a vendor, one link is fine.

40
00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:35.870
Setting up an arrangement where you all
like make 100 links to each other site.

41
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.530
That will be detected quickly.

42
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.048
And you will be penalized in
the same way as these self linking

43
00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:45.380
Black Hat SEO sites will be penalized.

44
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.504
So the idea is you can't, lending a whole
bunch of credibility back and forth.

45
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.470
That's, that is not going to be effective.

46
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.887
If you do need to link to
someone's site very very often,

47
00:02:56.887 --> 00:03:01.596
make sure that in your a tag
you add &lt;rel= "nofollow''.

48
00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:06.232
And this is an instruction to the web
crawlers that they should basically

49
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:09.502
disregard as you lending
credibility other site.

50
00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.912
So site will still get crawled, right?

51
00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:16.444
They'll still traverse it,
you'll alert if link ends up being broken.

52
00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:19.804
But you're basically saying,
this is not endorsement, right?

53
00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:23.740
This is just like don't read this,
when you're calculating the PageRank.

54
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.507
And dead links are easier than ever to
remove from your site, they show up in.

55
00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:35.961
If you set Google Webmaster Tools up to
send you periodic reports of any kind.

56
00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:39.249
This is the kind of alert that
you can't even turn off, right?

57
00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:43.946
It'll tell you that here are broken links,
we discovered these.

58
00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.444
And you should fix those
as soon as possible,

59
00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:50.604
because letting those linger indicates
that your site is not maintained.

60
00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:52.242
And up to date and you will,

61
00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:56.895
other people will leapfrog you due to
the recency bias we discussed earlier.

62
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.853
So let's talk a little bit about ads.

63
00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:09.151
So this is an area I have
very direct experience with,

64
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:15.650
having built several products for
Yahoo that are in the ad space.

65
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.820
Ads are a tool that pretty much
every business should use.

66
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.730
Yes,
&gt;&gt; Just before

67
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.296
we get to,
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

68
00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:24.286
&gt;&gt; Far ahead.

69
00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:31.527
Makita asks why Google says to use
Disavow only if everything else fails.

70
00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:36.500
&gt;&gt; So Google says use Disavow
only if everything else fails.

71
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.634
Because they don't want their system
to be choked in all likelihood, right?

72
00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:48.220
And and oftentimes when you end up with
these links, there are a lot of them.

73
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.478
And they're the result of some
consultant who owns this,

74
00:04:53.478 --> 00:04:56.922
like spam ring of placing them there.

75
00:04:56.922 --> 00:05:01.688
And they basically want you to
take it up with them first, and

76
00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:03.936
to use them as a last resort.

77
00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:08.443
It's not easy to submit
a disavow requests,

78
00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:13.435
you have to basically affirm
that this was not me.

79
00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:15.300
I do not own the site.

80
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.725
And they make it a last
resort kind of process there.

81
00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:23.980
It's not a really easy automated tool.

82
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.050
It is sending a list for submission and
they'll get approved later on.

83
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.619
So their hope is you
don't have to do that.

84
00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:38.280
&gt;&gt; Is that method of, [COUGH] Could
you use it to tank a competitor?

85
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.897
Is it used in bad sense?

86
00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:46.981
Everywhere if the domain owner
is responsible, then you could

87
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:52.168
set up bad links to their, [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; You totally could.

88
00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:55.412
I mean, that's like a, [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; I did figure it.

89
00:05:55.412 --> 00:05:58.603
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You think about this?

90
00:05:58.603 --> 00:05:59.715
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Conferences and

91
00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:02.653
they would share stories about
all this Black Hat stuff.

92
00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:05.594
Or they get sites taken down and
blacklisted, and

93
00:06:05.594 --> 00:06:08.195
it would be like months
before they come up.

94
00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:11.144
And running as they appeal to Google and,
&gt;&gt; Yep.

95
00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:15.046
&gt;&gt; I mean it's a constant
battle out there.

96
00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:16.459
&gt;&gt; It is, and the same goes for

97
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.930
reviews by the way,
&gt;&gt; Right

98
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.771
&gt;&gt; Like all the time I mean,

99
00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:22.326
you see app reviews that come out.

100
00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:26.845
If you wanna see some interesting reviews,
go look at the the mobile app for

101
00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.680
any cable news site.

102
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.760
And you've got big spikes at one star and
five star from.

103
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.435
So, there is bias and
there is sort of behavior,

104
00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:42.439
that is sort of coming from competitors.

105
00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:46.440
The thing you can do about that,
is to pay attention to it.

106
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.726
And to try to hide it
off as soon as you can.

107
00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:55.516
There are firms that exist for
the purpose of repairing reputation.

108
00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:57.156
I haven't worked with
any of them personally.

109
00:06:57.156 --> 00:06:59.254
So I'm not going to name them or

110
00:06:59.254 --> 00:07:03.260
say that it's a good idea
to hire one in particular.

111
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.125
But it's a thing, right?

112
00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:10.530
It is the online equivalent of throwing
a brick through your competitors window.

113
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.305
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

114
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:16.294
&gt;&gt; So, also not a good idea, [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Just like security you

115
00:07:16.294 --> 00:07:19.910
have to kind of understand
the attack trajectories.

116
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.610
And then try to figure out how you
can mitigate them if they do happen.

117
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.589
It's the same one.

118
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:25.957
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

119
00:07:25.957 --> 00:07:28.570
&gt;&gt; And reviews and stuff like that.

120
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.610
&gt;&gt; The hope is that by the time
you're on your competitors radar,

121
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.288
you've built up enough of a reputation.

122
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:39.024
That hit is not gonna
take you completely out.

123
00:07:39.024 --> 00:07:42.430
And this is why, this is a good
reason to start early, right?

124
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.072
So before you're even on the radar of
people you've already reached out,

125
00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:49.516
their customers have heard about you.

126
00:07:49.516 --> 00:07:51.960
Before their competitors
have heard about you.

127
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.617
&gt;&gt; One thing to add with that
is transparency as well.

128
00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:58.877
I mean a lot of case studies were, if your
competitors are attacking your website and

129
00:07:58.877 --> 00:08:00.410
writing false reviews.

130
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.058
Then to actually respond to that,
you have that feature even on Google Maps.

131
00:08:04.058 --> 00:08:06.450
Where you can respond and
say, this was not accurate,

132
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.530
or we've tried to locate this customer.

133
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.900
But they never shopped and
they weren't on our record.

134
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.038
And I think a lot of the,
it's about that communication as well.

135
00:08:14.038 --> 00:08:18.920
So that when others see it, they can
note you have responded correctly to it.

136
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.971
&gt;&gt; That's a great point.

137
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:25.090
Yeah, there's nothing that more
easily diffuses an angry customer.

138
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.640
Than that calm, helpful, and
polite response saying like,

139
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.836
here's our support number.

140
00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:34.239
I'm waiting by the phone right now to.

141
00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:35.746
Even if you think it's malicious,

142
00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:38.876
that's a good thing you can,
&gt;&gt; Couldn't make the other way though I

143
00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:42.158
mean, if you've got like a psychopath on,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

144
00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:44.223
&gt;&gt; Whose like they didn't serve me.

145
00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:47.530
Again it's like, are you really
gonna bother responding to that?

146
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.328
&gt;&gt; I would.

147
00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:48.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

148
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.440
&gt;&gt; I would, I think the thing.

149
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.288
So what you have to remember there
is you have to be objective driven.

150
00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:56.338
And you have to,

151
00:08:56.338 --> 00:09:01.950
it's not really about the the principle of
whether this person was correct or not.

152
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.777
It's about whether your
response to that person,

153
00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:09.521
will take the sharp edge
off of the way that looks.

154
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:11.793
If a stranger came by and
saw it on the side,

155
00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:12.730
&gt;&gt; That doesn't makes sense.

156
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.479
&gt;&gt; Right?
&gt;&gt; You're not responded to him you're

157
00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:16.350
respond to this first whose
coming later to read.

158
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.618
&gt;&gt; It's about your business's reputation,
and that is a quantifiable thing.

159
00:09:20.618 --> 00:09:23.370
And what you do should be
oriented towards that.

160
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.785
So go, scream into a pillow.

161
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:27.770
And then write the,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

162
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.684
&gt;&gt; Write the response because just,

163
00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:31.405
that's what it's all about.

164
00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:36.010
A new customer comes by, they can either
see that with no response whatsoever.

165
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.910
And Gosh,
maybe responses to other feedback and

166
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.031
they feel,
they responded to the thing about.

167
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:46.240
I found a fly in my soup, but
not this one here, and like.

168
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.470
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; It would look odd to their eyes.

169
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.212
&gt;&gt; Sure yes.
&gt;&gt; There is a way that they could,

170
00:09:50.212 --> 00:09:53.303
a lens through which they could see
that they would make them not do

171
00:09:53.303 --> 00:09:54.272
business with you.

172
00:09:54.272 --> 00:09:57.130
So you just wanna diffuse that,
and that's the only objective.
