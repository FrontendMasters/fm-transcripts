00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.380
When we get down to it traditional
SEO is more than anything about

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.430
making it easy for
crawlers to do their job.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.440
Crawlers are the automated like
bots software programs that

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.290
they will open a webpage and they'll crawl
out they'll like read through it and

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.730
they'll follow all of the links
to all of the pages you link to.

6
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.986
And they basically try to
understand your content,

7
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.354
understand what it's all about, and

8
00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:35.534
then traverse anything that you're linking
to and anyone that links to you in order

9
00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:40.570
to figure out the topology of the internet
right, how everything is connected.

10
00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:48.125
And at the very least you want to make
sure you don't interfere with their

11
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:54.241
ability to do that, that's like, that
is the easiest way to mess your SEO up.

12
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.380
While we're making it easy for
crawlers to do their job.

13
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.460
We wanna make sure that we're also paying
attention to our content in particular,

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.890
and you'll often read about
this concept of quality.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.320
The thing you wanna aim for

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.340
is stuff that is of true interest
to your users and your clientele.

17
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.310
If you aimed for things that
are appealing to like programs,

18
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.760
if you try to just stuff a bunch
of key words into things,

19
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.780
search engines have been wise to that for
about a decade or more and

20
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.070
you'll in fact be sort of flagged as
someone who's trying to game the system.

21
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.370
So just the focus should be on
providing good content for your users.

22
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.970
And, this means that oftentimes
you're gonna want to find out what is

23
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.300
the niche of your business, right?

24
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.970
So in the case of front end masters, that
wouldn't just be like learn stuff online,

25
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.350
but it would be the JavaScript and

26
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.480
front end topics that nobody else offers
training on, right or we offer it deeper?

27
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.600
And here are the subject areas using
keywords, like we're gonna talk about

28
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.320
service workers and we're gonna talk about
how to write your own SAS functions and

29
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.340
just nobody else is able
to address these topics.

30
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.330
And this concept of being targeted and

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.930
unique is what helps you stand
out from the rest of the crowd.

32
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.236
When indexers which are part of
how this crawling technology,

33
00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:28.066
ingests your content and
understand what it's about.

34
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:32.223
When they process your site, they're
gonna throw out all of the common words,

35
00:02:32.223 --> 00:02:35.350
all of the terminology that
everybody else is using.

36
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.470
And if you have some unique
specific terminology leftover, you

37
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.320
can think of that as being the defining
characteristic of like the topic and

38
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.240
the level of depth that
your content is all about.

39
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.740
So when we talk about quality, we mean
that there should definitely be something

40
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.270
left after we shed away like the generic
boilerplate, verbiage, and material.

41
00:02:58.408 --> 00:03:03.090
You also wanna focus on richness of
content, but there's a caveat here.

42
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.954
So when I talk about rich richness of
content, I mean including videos, and

43
00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:11.754
imagery and making sure things
are styled appropriately so

44
00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.037
that it's easy for people to read.

45
00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:19.431
For one because as you as you may assume,
like people who these companies

46
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:24.120
who are built around search,
they have trackers everywhere,

47
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.240
and they can monitor how long
people spend on particular pages.

48
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.430
And so the actual human behavior
that your customers and

49
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.280
your readers carry out,
that influences your SEO writing, right?

50
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.610
How likely they are to come in?

51
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.180
How likely they are to share it?

52
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.280
How much time they spend
there versus bouncing out and

53
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.210
deciding like, yes I arrived here but
no, this isn't what I was interested in.

54
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.840
Or you just hit me with
a plain wall of text and

55
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.280
like I'm now about to read all of that.

56
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.060
The caveat is, images and
videos cannot be sort of ingested and

57
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.820
distilled down to their core content,
like text can.

58
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.430
So if you have a great video there,
there's no way for for

59
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.860
a search engine to really
know what it's about.

60
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.820
Or we're starting to move in that
direction and you can see that YouTube

61
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.390
with its automated translation
services and it's automated.

62
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.770
What do you call it, like,
gives you the transcript of what was said,

63
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.900
this is a step forward, but anytime that
you can supplement media with text, while

64
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.830
providing that richness that will boost
sort of the quality level of your content.

65
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.170
So search indices have a recency bias,
meaning they

66
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.010
favor content that is new over content
that's been around for a while.

67
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.580
For one, it's content that is new
is of interest to users, right?

68
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.550
So if you are, you have a top ten list of
the best Chrome extensions to download,

69
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.170
and you're updating that every week.

70
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.422
That's something that is current,
it's likely to be fresh, it's likely to

71
00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:09.587
still be accurate, rather than a list
from 2013, that's four years old.

72
00:05:09.587 --> 00:05:14.934
That the assumption is that someone
who's written an equivalent article,

73
00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:17.774
but is constantly keeping it up to date,

74
00:05:17.774 --> 00:05:22.635
every time your site is crawled,
we noticed that there's a change.

75
00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:26.450
This will play favorably in
terms of how you end up ranking.

76
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.520
And this it also goes to show that like
you wanna eliminate dead links, you wanna

77
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.500
maintain things, because as soon as things
start to fall into an unmaintained state

78
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.030
where things are a little bit broken, or
maybe the page doesn't render correctly.

79
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.171
That will be taken as,
it's sort of not getting

80
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:49.045
the love that it needs and
you will fall in the rankings.

81
00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:54.610
We're gonna talk today about
the concept of link building.

82
00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.610
This is to say you want influential
sites to refer to your URLs and

83
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.590
this is the driving factor that determines
where you show up in search results.

84
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.290
This is equated with quality and
importance in the SEO world.

85
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.390
So we will get into some specific link
building strategies, things you can do

86
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.200
to accomplish this because, it's one
thing to say get people to link to you,

87
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.080
but I wanna leave you with some concrete

88
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.950
advice later on as to tactically how
you can go about making that happen.

89
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.700
Finally, there's this thing
called keyword stuffing.

90
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.220
So we have a meta tag and it's called
keywords that you can put in your HTML.

91
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.540
Things that fall into this category,
they were so over used and

92
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.020
it's such a polluted landscape,
in terms of all

93
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.550
of the various WordPress SEO plugins like,
taking this approach and

94
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.699
abusing it, that things like this
are just ignored completely.

95
00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.380
And the same category is white
text on white background,

96
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.770
with a bunch of keywords that is also,
like that trick is known,

97
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.490
and it sort of just washes out,
it's not worth doing.

98
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.030
Yes, we have a question.

99
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.690
&gt;&gt; I was actually gonna just comment on
that because like Gary Vaynerchuk always

100
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.350
says like marketers ruin everything.

101
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.294
You can assume that, anytime there's
something that can be exploited,

102
00:07:21.294 --> 00:07:22.510
it will be exploited.

103
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.650
And that's why the field
of SEO continues to evolve.

104
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.960
And that's why we're talking about
modern SEOs today instead of the tactics

105
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.920
of five years ago or ten years ago solely
because marketers ruin everything and

106
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.110
exploit every possible tactic.

107
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.340
&gt;&gt; No offence to the marketers in
the room or watching the video.

108
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.115
Mark doesn't mean he doesn't mean you,
he means the other marketers.

109
00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:51.050
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, but it is, as Mark points out it

110
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.050
is a moving target that we're aiming for
here where they're sort of escalation

111
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.610
as people find out a strategy that helps
them stand out about their competitors.

112
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.090
And then they'll write about it or they'll
form a consultancy that will implement it

113
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.960
for people,
then sort of everyone starts using it.

114
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.200
And then in order to find
new people that stand out,

115
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.910
the search engines have to kind of
escalate and find new strategies for this.

116
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:21.180
And for this reason, by the way,
it is a protected secret of

117
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.840
the various search engine companies
like exactly the algorithm that they use

118
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.335
in order to define, whose showing up
as a higher search ranking than others?

119
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:33.890
The reason is if people knew it,
they would explain it.

120
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.971
And then, we would, everyone would
have a maximal search rating and

121
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:42.305
like it would be pointless.

122
00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:45.465
It would not be the search engine would
not be valuable to users anymore.
