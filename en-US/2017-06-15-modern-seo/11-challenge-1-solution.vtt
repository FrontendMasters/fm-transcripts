1
00:00:01.527 --> 00:00:05.197
So I'm actually gonna remove
my existing Heroku app so

2
00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:07.599
that I can be in sync with all of you.

3
00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:17.058
Clear, Heroku apps destroy,

4
00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.849
I forgot the name of that app.

5
00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.334
There it is, good old history.

6
00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:43.990
All right, so I don't have an app anymore.

7
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.331
And if I look at git remote, so

8
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:51.400
creating a git remote is the way
that Heroku receives your app.

9
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.770
You push to Heroku,
the same way you push to GitHub and

10
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.680
making that git commit, and
like pushing it up to Heroku,

11
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.650
that is the whole deploy process
is connected to that action.

12
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.090
So if we look at git remote, and

13
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.270
we see all we have here is origin,
we would expect

14
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.160
to see that there would be one there
called Heroku if we had an app wired up.

15
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.710
So we're here at a starting point where
we don't have anything set up, yet.

16
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.930
Now I've already installed the tool belt,
and

17
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.370
I've already gone through
the Heroku login step.

18
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.570
Some people were a little bit surprised
that you don't see your password as you

19
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.390
type it in.

20
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.940
This is for your safety, because you might
notice that as soon as you hit Enter,

21
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.590
your email is left there
in the terminal and

22
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.870
there's a file that has the history
of all of your terminal commands.

23
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.860
You wouldn't want your password to be
in plain text in that log file for

24
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.820
someone to find.

25
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.380
That would be a super easy way
to mess with someone's machine.

26
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.450
So I'm already logged in,
I'm gonna begin by creating an app.

27
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.401
So run Heroku.

28
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:01.530
Let me do something to get
rid of some prompt here.

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.935
Ln -s training/seo/project,

30
00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:10.853
we'll just call it seo.

31
00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:14.530
Much better.

32
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.320
So now I can type and you can see.

33
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.450
So Heroku apps create,
we can optionally give it a name.

34
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.814
If you don't,
it'll take two dictionary words and

35
00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:28.948
smash them together with dash and
put a random number next to it.

36
00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:35.010
I'm just going to call mine, mike-seo.

37
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.370
So this is creating the app.

38
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.935
And if you were to visit this
URL there's no app deployed yet.

39
00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.720
It's sort of in its
an empty initialized state.

40
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.180
It's not being nice to me here.

41
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.000
All right, so it's gonna say, welcome.

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.810
So this is not an error page.

43
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.641
This indicates that like the app has
been created but there's no code there.

44
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.610
This is sort of just a placeholder.

45
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.600
So what we need to do
is now set the app up.

46
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.740
And we're gonna do that
with Heroku config set.

47
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.930
So what we're doing here is we're setting
environment variables on our Heroku app.

48
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.420
This is a very common way of being able
to sort of toggle things at runtime.

49
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.677
So when our app is running and
we can even change an environment variable

50
00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:32.245
using the same command config set and
our app will be stopped.

51
00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.930
The environment variable will be set and
it will quickly restart again.

52
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.650
What this is gonna let us do is
change from exercise to exercise.

53
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.980
So what we see on Heroku, it's gonna start
with the stuff in the deploy folder.

54
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.090
Later we'll have it using this opengraph
folder and this mobile folder and

55
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.900
we can kind of alternate through
them in just a couple seconds.

56
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.780
And then give Facebook a URL and
see what metadata it can find off of.

57
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.822
So that's this first one,
the second one is use HTTPS.

58
00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:09.257
This basically means that when we're on
Heroku, if non secure requests come in,

59
00:04:09.257 --> 00:04:13.170
we redirect them to the secure
version of our URL.

60
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.260
And Google is starting to more and
more have a bias towards secure URLs and

61
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.040
then the latest like performance
testing tools like lighthouse,

62
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.010
which we'll look at later.

63
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.040
Which is used to evaluate the fitness of
your web application for mobile devices.

64
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.583
Redirecting from insecure
to secure HTTP is one of

65
00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:39.494
the checks that you'll get a pass or
fail on.

66
00:04:39.494 --> 00:04:43.147
So we're gonna set this equal to true,
it's worth noting,

67
00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:46.443
we wouldn't want to set this
equal to true, locally,

68
00:04:46.443 --> 00:04:50.540
because we're not serving with
the SSL certificate, right?

69
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.250
And what's more we're using
a permanent redirect, so

70
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.620
I actually screwed up my own dev
environment a couple days ago,

71
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.270
where I had this local host,
with the permanent redirect.

72
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.950
And I had to go through and delete history
items cuz forever, Chrome was remembering

73
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.580
that, when the user types in this URL,
we could use the secure one instead.

74
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.540
And there is no way for
me to get back to the insecure one.

75
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.610
So this is why it's
an environment variable.

76
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.880
Our environment variables are set if we
wanted to see the current state of things.

77
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.067
We could just run Heroku config and

78
00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:33.019
it'll show us the current
environment variables at play here.

79
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:37.975
They have some great documentation too,
Heroku help config will tell

80
00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:43.060
you we can just use this to display
the config variables for an app.

81
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.150
You can get a value,
you can set a value, pretty, easy.

82
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.940
The one that you can't see there is
config unset, which is sort of like,

83
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.470
null it out remove the environment
variable entirely.

84
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.360
All right, so now we're ready to deploy.

85
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.930
The way we deploy to Heroku is
it's set up a new git remote for

86
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.640
us as part of the apps create command.

87
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.765
No, git remote.

88
00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:13.260
So you see now we have a new one here.

89
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.940
Origin is gonna send me to GitHub, right?

90
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.163
That's where we checked our code out from.

91
00:06:18.163 --> 00:06:23.708
Heroku is gonna deploy whatever this
current version of our code is up to them.

92
00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:31.434
We're basically saying,
send the master branch to Heroku,

93
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:37.966
his master branch and what it's doing
here in addition to the Git stuff itself,

94
00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:41.981
you can see that if I widen
this a little bit I can.

95
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:46.414
It's going through the process of
installing all of our dependencies,

96
00:06:46.414 --> 00:06:48.303
you see that it's using yarn,

97
00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:52.390
which is like a new package manager
that you can use instead of NPM.

98
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.320
It is discovering different process
types and now just finished creating

99
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.880
this version of the app and
it's available on that particular URL.

100
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.735
Now we could just visit this
URL if we wanted to and

101
00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:09.903
our app should be there and running.

102
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.470
So we can go ahead and
add some metadata to this app.

103
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.525
So if we were to view source here, and
see what this HTML actually looks like.

104
00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:32.309
So there's really nothing in the head tag
except for links to CSS style sheets.

105
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:33.870
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

106
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.630
There's not much I can do for
this projector unfortunately.

107
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.976
But take my word for it, those links,
that's actually all we see.

108
00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:48.189
You're just missing
the open head tag up there.

109
00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:51.550
So, what we need to do is update this so

110
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.542
that we have like at least
the bare minimum for

111
00:07:55.542 --> 00:08:00.710
making it so
that this result shows up the way we want.

112
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.472
So first let's add a title tag and
we could say,

113
00:08:07.804 --> 00:08:12.192
I'm just gonna move this down and

114
00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:17.206
get rid of this temporarily and that so

115
00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:23.786
we can say title is,
deployment instructions and

116
00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:27.244
then we can add a meta tag.

117
00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:31.280
And I'm just gonna copy
it from my slides here.

118
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.360
So the name, we've got name and content.

119
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.930
Those are the two things you need to
remember, name is a description and

120
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:44.080
this is gonna be how to
deploy our first step.

121
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.234
And then we could add keywords here for
like, comma separated,

122
00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:57.570
deployment Heroku, git,
shell commands, seo.

123
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.808
So we can save that and

124
00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:06.966
then do another,
&gt;&gt; You have two description tags.

125
00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:08.360
&gt;&gt; I've have to description tags, thanks.

126
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.079
We can first do git commit.

127
00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:15.060
This is how we save this
version of our file.

128
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.274
So git add, so we're basically saying
I want to take all of the files that

129
00:09:21.274 --> 00:09:26.162
are changed, stage them to be saved
in this next version of our app.

130
00:09:26.162 --> 00:09:30.620
This is like the action of
making a save git commit.

131
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.890
Add basic seo data, right?

132
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.297
And so now we've like, updated our app and
we're ready to push it up to Heroku.

133
00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:47.320
And you see it's gonna go through
basically the same steps.

134
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.120
Once it's done, it will refresh

135
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.910
this view source thing over here and
we should see the title and stuff up here.

136
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.740
So this is pretty fast,
deploying to Heroku,

137
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.680
it could be even faster except I've
had to disable some caching that was

138
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.160
getting in my way that
had to do with SaaS.

139
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.490
So it can be like one second and
your new app is ready.

140
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.660
So if we refresh this, sometimes it
takes a second for things to show up.

141
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.980
Here we go.
We've got deployment instructions, and

142
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.779
here are two meta tags showing up.

143
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.750
So there we go,
that's the solution to this exercise.

144
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.450
I will note that the one one
thing that people found, for

145
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.327
some Heroku commands,
you have to add something like this

146
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.180
Like dash dash app and
then the name of your app here.

147
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.820
This is useful because sometimes
you have multiple apps.

148
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.928
Sometimes for my apps,
I'll have like a staging environment and

149
00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:48.350
a production environment,
both of which are hosted on Heroku.

150
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.620
And it kind of needs to know which
thing are you talking about?

151
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.240
Which machine do you want to
see the config variables on.

152
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.250
So that was the only
thing that seemed to be

153
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.400
missing an explicit way
from the instructions.
