WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.930
We're going to go through adding some
mobile optimizations to this, this

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.770
mobile app, or the exercises slash mobile
app that we've been working on here.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.200
So we're going to begin, and
get rid of my structured data notes here.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.640
And all of this.

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.170
We're going to begin by.

6
00:00:23.052 --> 00:00:27.806
Killing our Open Graph exercise here,

7
00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:30.980
and doing run- e mobile.

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.680
So we've started up this
next example here, and

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.640
if we go to local host,
we can see that it resembles the same app.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.090
The only thing that's different
is I've included a lot of icons,

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.890
and you had a sort of different
starting point here, so

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.970
that you didn't have to figure out all
of the different special icons for

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.140
making all of the different
mobile devices happy.

14
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.060
So here are all of your meta tags.

15
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.440
And, you could put them in
your list of courses as well.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.640
One thing to keep in mind when you have
an add to homescreen bookmark is that,

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.020
once that's on the user's home screen,

18
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.580
that's their entry point into
that into your app forever.

19
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
Right, so if they were looking at this
particular course, and they bookmarked it,

20
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.450
they're always going to see Phoenix
Fundamentals, when they hit that bookmark.

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.930
So, some people like to put it just
on the root page of their domain, so

22
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.940
that's a good starting point,
and an entry point.

23
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.140
There's an attempt to add
stuff to this manifest Jason.

24
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.380
It's a property called-
Route Underscore URL

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.370
where you can define the entry point for
your app.

26
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.290
And, mobile browsers will hopefully
adopt this, and respect it.

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.340
As, part of what makes an app experience
right you always when you launch

28
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760
a native app like Facebook or LinkedIn,

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.000
you expect to start out by looking at
like the feed and then go to the profile,

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.930
regardless of where you
left off 6 months ago.

31
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.235
So let's get rid of course we're gonna
just be working at index.hbs here.

32
00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:16.870
I'm gonna start by getting rid of
the comments here just because I

33
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.015
wanna enable all of these different icons.

34
00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.045
And there are a lot of them.

35
00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:27.425
And you see some of them have
these sizes attributes here.

36
00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.495
It's a complicated world mobile app icon.

37
00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:34.800
So I end up having to
refer to like the same.

38
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.210
Just send the same cheat sheets over,
and over again.

39
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.030
So, maybe this is your cheat sheet.

40
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.860
In addition, I wanna make sure
that I add the viewport meta tag.

41
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.510
So I'm just gonna go
back to my slides here,

42
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.980
and grab that one that was early on here.

43
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.539
And just for fun, well,
no, we'll keep it as is

44
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.542
Then we can add all three of these on two,
sorry for

45
00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:09.600
all the back and
forth everyone, and three.

46
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.480
So this is gonna take care of
making our iOS experience.

47
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.710
Fullscreen when launched
from the homescreen.

48
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.040
Finally, let's worry about
our web app manifest.

49
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.190
So we're gonna put that here, and we have
to create a new file in this project

50
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.610
in the public folder called manifest.JSON.

51
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.360
I'm just gonna copy the HTML I had
over here as a starting point.

52
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.980
Now you get to see some of my animation
tricks, make this little more difficult

53
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.685
than it otherwise would
be right when I wanted.

54
00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:52.244
[SOUND] Okay, so icons are gonna go here,

55
00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:56.947
comma and then we can get the bottom half,

56
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.960
There we go.

57
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.040
So we're gonna go with
standalone display mode.

58
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.560
We can put some icons in here now.

59
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.780
So someone pointed out that in the PDF I
sent out some icons were missing,

60
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.430
because I used some keynote
acrobatics to slide them in.

61
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.148
And sorry about that.

62
00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:26.912
There somewhere, wow,

63
00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:31.090
where the heck did they go?

64
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.240
I think that's one.

65
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.620
Okay, grab one, there we go 192 pixels,
so well, we'll grab that.

66
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.370
Let me just make sure that
file actually exists in here.

67
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.710
Android, chrome 192 by
192 that looks correct.

68
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.780
So we'll just leave that in here,
we're missing out on the 512 pixel.

69
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.170
Nice image there,
because I don't think we have a 512, yeah,

70
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.890
we do not, so that's fine.

71
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.290
So now we've got our web app manifest.

72
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.040
The last thing I wanna do here is,
right at the bottom of my body,

73
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.940
I wanna put a script tab, that makes
use of this Add to Home screen Library.

74
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.930
We're just gonna use it with the defaults,
which means it's gonna generate

75
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.790
the message on the fly, it's gonna
go grab the icon from the metadata,

76
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.870
you could pass it an image
URL to use instead.

77
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.800
But this library does a really good job
of making reasonable default assumptions.

78
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.724
So just for fun,

79
00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:39.690
let's see what this looks like in
our sort of simulated mobile device.

80
00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.380
I wanna see a little
drop down thing happen.

81
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.990
Come on, drop down.

82
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.033
I may have, in all likelihood I do
have the local storage variable set,

83
00:05:58.033 --> 00:05:59.250
of course I do.

84
00:06:07.438 --> 00:06:10.165
There we go, so
there's our little drop down thing here,

85
00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:11.924
here's another way to simulate it.

86
00:06:11.924 --> 00:06:17.021
[SOUND] So if you're a iOS developer
of some sort, you probably

87
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:23.110
have Xcode installed, and there is
something called the iOS simulator.

88
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.229
This is sort of a fake iOS device
that runs on your it's virtualized,

89
00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.924
so we can use mobile Safari on
this device, hit our Hero's URL,

90
00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:38.740
and we can all see how
this ends up working.

91
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.010
So I'm gonna end up deploying this.

92
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.388
[SOUND]
All right,

93
00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:57.042
and it's gonna go and

94
00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:02.150
do its thing.

95
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.850
And while I wait,
let me just grab the URL here.

96
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.710
All right, so it is allegedly deployed,
looks like the refresh worked.

97
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.700
Now let's go to our mobile device,
and see what happens.

98
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.580
So we're gonna fire it up,
paste something in there, nope, guess not.

99
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.289
I cannot scale that at all,
that's interesting.

100
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.911
Did viewport tag network
the way we thought it would?

101
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:58.307
&gt;&gt; Mean the Euro emulator.

102
00:07:58.307 --> 00:08:05.690
&gt;&gt; Scale, Wrong direction.

103
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.151
This is as good as I can
get unfortunately, and

104
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.670
I don't see the little
drop down happening.

105
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.200
Interestingly, let me hook up Safari and
see what's going on.

106
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:24.600
So this is a pro tip for, if you want to
use the simulator for web development,

107
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.060
you can actually use this develop menu
which sorry, you can't see in the room.

108
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:34.210
There is a simulator menu there,
and you can actually connect to it.

109
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.620
Your mobile environment there.

110
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.670
So now I have dev tools here.

111
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.150
&gt;&gt; I don't think you deployed to Heroku
&gt;&gt; I might not have let's see.

112
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.390
This looks like it did though, right?

113
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.475
You know what I didn't do.

114
00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:52.312
[SOUND] There we go.

115
00:08:52.312 --> 00:08:53.842
This will fix it.

116
00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:59.077
I will pick up that debugging thread

117
00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:03.970
as soon as we see that this works.

118
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.620
Look how much better that viewport is.

119
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.220
And look at that nice
little like drop down thing

120
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.590
that is pointing directly to my share
button, and I can hit that button.

121
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:20.030
Add to homescreen, we had a nice meta
tag there that that puts this here.

122
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.850
And now when we add it to the homescreen,
and launch it,

123
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.745
we have a full screen experience here, all
of the browser, Chrome Boom has gone away.

124
00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:31.885
And it kind of behaves like a native app.

125
00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:35.215
Now obviously, you would want to style
this, so it looks like a native app,

126
00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:38.125
fixed navbar, and
maybe something along the bottom.

127
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:40.255
So it's a nice familiar experience.

128
00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:45.555
But this is now you've created
a experience that sort of is

129
00:09:45.555 --> 00:09:49.370
elevated a step above
what the browser offers.

130
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.820
Now in terms of what Safari does now that
I have it connected to my iOS simulator,

131
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.180
I can actually hover over.

132
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.320
Let me make sure I'm still connected here,
simulator, okay.

133
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.198
Apparently I wasn't, I can use it the same
way we would use Chrome dev tools.

134
00:10:08.198 --> 00:10:16.170
In that, I should be able to
inspect element, stuff like that.

135
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.890
Where's my little inspector here it is?

136
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.615
So here's Phoenix fundamentals, see how I
get that little rectangle hovering around,

137
00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:29.947
you used to this view fused
inspect element before,

138
00:10:29.947 --> 00:10:31.490
I can even run JavaScript in here.

139
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.010
And you get the expected result.

140
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.640
So I love this trick.

141
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.010
I love debugging in the simulator, because
it's this much more closely resembles

142
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.660
a true mobile device,
compared to like mobile mode in Chrome,

143
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.190
because it's emulating all
of the stuff around it.

144
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.590
Stuff like seeing what the home screen
icons actually gonna look like.

145
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:04.060
In this case we'd say,
it's low resolution here.

146
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.830
Another point standalone mode.

147
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.410
You'll notice we've got safari,
and front end masters.

148
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.590
There has independent frames here.

149
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.980
So they're regarded as sort of
independent running entities.

150
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.230
So we could like.

151
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.710
We can kill Safari, and

152
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.400
like front end masters is there,as
sort of its own thing its own thread.

153
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.240
&gt;&gt; So we are clicking to a course.

154
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.560
&gt;&gt; Good question clicking to a course.

155
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.270
The weakness revealed.

156
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:39.180
So here what's happened is you
have to be careful about, when

157
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.980
only putting this full screen experience
in place when you're ready for it.

158
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.880
So this works really well for
single page apps, because they intercept,

159
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.000
the default behavior of links, right?

160
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.250
So instead of like links,
which typically tell the browser, go and

161
00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.990
make a new request to this URL,
and bring back some HTML and

162
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.430
show it to me, they will typically
tell it something called a router

163
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.070
to take you to another like virtual page.

164
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.040
But it's still one page view and you're,

165
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.940
it's just a lot of sophisticated hiding
and showing of divice on the screen.

166
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.260
That looks like a multi page experience.

167
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.220
In this case,

168
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.550
we wouldn't have found ourselves
kicked out of the full screen mode.

169
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:30.720
And we would have sort of stayed in
this world of seeming like a mobile app.

170
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.420
If you put this full screen
experience in too soon, like this,

171
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.190
this feels silly, right?

172
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.380
Like the first thing we tried to do.

173
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.490
We ended up leaving getting
kicked back out to a browser,

174
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.590
at which point, what's the point.

175
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.430
But it's still useful to know
what these meta tags do,

176
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.940
how the web app manifest works, and so on.

177
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.330
So, I do wanna show you one last thing.

178
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.720
So I mentioned the idea of Google's index.

179
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.670
Splitting between mobile,
and non mobile, flavours,

180
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:10.540
and I did want to show you the new sort
of best in class benchmarking tool for

181
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:17.140
seeing how fit is your app for,
a mobile friendly world.

182
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.578
Specifically, this deals with like
progressive web app technologies.

183
00:13:20.578 --> 00:13:23.680
And we're gonna have a course on front
end masters later this year that

184
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.230
relates to that.

185
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.350
But I'm gonna use a Chrome
extension called lighthouse.

186
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.420
And it runs in your browser, right?

187
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.460
So it'll work on localhost.

188
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:38.310
And when you run the report, what it's
gonna do is throttle your CPU down to 10%.

189
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:44.290
Throttle your network down to,
like a good 2G signal,

190
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.920
and make sure that you still
have a presentable experience.

191
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.910
And then we're gonna get
a score from 0 to 100.

192
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:57.850
And I, yeah, so we're at a 48, in terms
of things that we're missing here,

193
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.700
it's saying that great web
applications work offline,

194
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.630
they at least provide some sort
of response when they're offline.

195
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.840
Even if it is, sorry, this, this app
doesn't work while you're offline.

196
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.810
Our page load performance
is sufficiently fast.

197
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.630
This is what we get from a server
side rendered environment here.

198
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.370
We've got express js, right?

199
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:25.810
Serving up HTML, instead of a single page
app, which kind of slows things down.

200
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.900
So you typically have to
do a single page app,

201
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.340
plus server side rendering
to get the whole picture.

202
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.560
The site to the network
connection is secure.

203
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.250
This is what we got by way of that https.

204
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.630
Is true, you know that meta or sorry,
that environment variable we pass for

205
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.160
Roku switch that on, which is part of
this project that you guys have here.

206
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.980
It's just a little logic in the server
js file, down here in the source folder.

207
00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.240
That you can take a look
at later if you care to.

208
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.530
The user being prompted
to add to homescreen.

209
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.330
It requires a couple
different things here.

210
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.910
It looks like I have an error in
my web app manifest, in fact, so

211
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.600
I have an error in my JSON at position 32.

212
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.050
Let me investigate that really quick.

213
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.150
Because that might boost
the score up considerably.

214
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.130
And I want us to be able to
see like what that looks like.

215
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:28.870
So, line position 32,
I wish it would tell me a line.

216
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.350
You know what it is now part of JSON.

217
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.690
Thanks.

218
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.351
Thanks, editor for
thinking it's JavaScript.

219
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.330
So if we get rid of our comments,
then we'll have the benefit

220
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.760
of this web app manifest,
should boost that score up considerably.

221
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.209
[SOUND] All right, so

222
00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:56.707
while that's going over

223
00:15:56.707 --> 00:16:01.680
the wire, here's our

224
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.932
custom splash screen.

225
00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:09.740
We're gonna get credit for
a lot of this stuff.

226
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.990
Once it deploys, we'll just wait for
it and rerun the test.

227
00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:22.115
All right refresh, to get that extra
long page load as it boots up for

228
00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.260
the first time.

229
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.150
Now let's see how we do.

230
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.586
So is it 48 without the web app manifest,

231
00:16:32.586 --> 00:16:37.450
this accident lets us see how much of a
difference this makes in terms of scoring.

232
00:16:48.603 --> 00:16:53.180
A lot better, we're at a lot 80.

233
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.370
So I don't.

234
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:01.070
I don't believe that this has that
much of a correlation to SEO.

235
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.120
But Google is building tools to
help us test mobile fitness.

236
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.770
And they built an index that takes
mobile fitness into account.

237
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.609
I would listen to what they have to say.

238
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.480
But see here now we get a lot
of web app manifest stuff.

239
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.830
We don't have a service worker yet.

240
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:22.940
There's a meta tag we could have added for
theme color here that matches, that sort

241
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.790
of an alternate placement for the same
theme color that's in our manifest, JSON.

242
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.000
Here it wants us to use
h2 instead of HTTP 1.

243
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.900
But we're taking a lot of
boxes at this point, for

244
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:42.220
making really a nice modern app that
has all of this metadata in place.

245
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.720
Right?
