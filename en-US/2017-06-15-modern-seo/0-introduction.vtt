WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:05.222
I entered web development from
the desktop programming world as

2
00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:11.157
sort of a general contractor, and
I would step in as the tech co founder for

3
00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:15.500
entrepreneurs that maybe
didn't know a developer.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.610
They didn't swim in those circles.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.533
And oftentimes I would be the person
who would take their idea and

6
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.370
implement the first version
of their product for them.

7
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.017
And SEO is incredibly important
when you're just trying

8
00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:34.274
to sort of make your first,
impression on people and

9
00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:38.917
I went from there to after
a couple jobs working at Yahoo,

10
00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:43.878
where I was the UI architect for
their ads and data division.

11
00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:48.860
And there I saw SEO from a different
angle, the sort of the inorganic

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.405
side of things, as I helped them
build out their new ad platform.

13
00:00:54.405 --> 00:01:00.370
And, there, I got an inside view in terms
of how these different ad platforms,

14
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.973
slice up audiences so

15
00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:06.888
that they can help companies
target exactly who they're after.

16
00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:11.899
So I'm gonna share some of those first
insights I have from from the inside,

17
00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.239
about the ad world.

18
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.078
And then today I am a full
time developer trainer.

19
00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:24.699
I spend a lot of my time working with big
tech companies, one of which is LinkedIn,

20
00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:30.075
where I am responsible for training all
of their front end engineers of three or

21
00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:33.275
400 of them at this point and
ever growing.

22
00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:38.437
And and one of the areas that we're
very focused on there is how do

23
00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:43.790
we make sure that when people share
things, the the experience for

24
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.870
people that see that shared URL
is as rich as possible, right.

25
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.990
So I'm sure that some of you realize that
if you share links for some websites

26
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.270
on Facebook or on LinkedIn or on Twitter
or even on like Slack and iMessage now,

27
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.156
sometimes you get a very vanilla
experience, where it's just the URL.

28
00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:07.699
And sometimes you see some
nice imagery and a title and

29
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:11.208
a description pop up often
in like a rich tile.

30
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:16.512
So we're gonna talk about today
the most current best practices for

31
00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:21.721
doing that kind of thing and making it so
that when you do get seen and

32
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:26.583
when you are shared,
you are putting your best foot forward.

33
00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:32.380
So what I'm showing you today is recent as
of this January, so just a few months ago.

34
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.396
And it's gonna be the most.

35
00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:38.331
I've refreshed all my content just for
this class.

36
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:41.145
So it's gonna be the most up to date, SEO,

37
00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:45.460
crash course that I could possibly
give you at this point in time.

38
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.096
And with that, I will kick things off.

39
00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:53.082
So in terms of how the day
is going to be structured,

40
00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:56.535
we're going to divide it into four topics.

41
00:02:56.535 --> 00:03:00.570
We'll begin with an overview
of traditional SEO.

42
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.039
So this will, sort of be the the,

43
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:08.439
the softer side of SEO in terms of like
it being the less technical stuff.

44
00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.214
We'll talk about finding keywords.

45
00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:15.936
What you can do if you sort of run to
the equivalent of writer's block where you

46
00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:20.805
can't you might know what your business
is all about but you can't be wanna find

47
00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:25.530
like 300 keywords and you just you
blank out after a couple dozen.

48
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.149
How do you expand that?

49
00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.159
What are the tools?

50
00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.875
How do you identify which are the good
keywords that are that are valuable for

51
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:39.767
your business to invest in versus others
and we will cover in traditional SEO,

52
00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:43.803
the most basic metadata that
you can put in your HTML.

53
00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:48.293
And I lump it into traditional SEO
because this will cover the stuff

54
00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:51.670
that has been around for
about 10 years or more.

55
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.292
Then after that,
we will move on to structured data And

56
00:03:56.292 --> 00:04:00.758
this is the kind of thing that
enriches links when they're shared and

57
00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:05.618
enriches search results when they
show up as something that's relevant.

58
00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:10.784
So not only do we have things like
Facebook, Open Graph and Twitter cards,

59
00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:15.270
we're gonna touch on some
Pinterest rich tile metadata.

60
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.279
But Google is using schema.org
structured data to enrich

61
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.990
search results whenever they show up.

62
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.225
So more than ever,

63
00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:28.170
we have control over how our search
result is rendered in the search engine.

64
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.513
And it's not just Google.

65
00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:33.731
All of the search engines
are rallying around the same

66
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:38.043
community approach to doing this and
an investment and

67
00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:44.060
learning how to leverage this kind of
data pays dividends in multiple ways.

68
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.926
For example, even in HTML emails,
you might notice that if you use Gmail,

69
00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:54.179
some certain buttons show up on the right
side of those received emails that say,

70
00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:58.816
view this airline ticket or when you
get a calendar invite you can RSVP,

71
00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:01.317
like right in the header of the email.

72
00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:04.223
This is all schema.org structured data.

73
00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:08.236
So mastering this and
getting a handle on sort of what works and

74
00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:12.770
how far to go without spending
all day building metadata.

75
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.358
That is a great skill to have and
it is a great way to stand out as a,

76
00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:21.255
as a high tech, sort of modern and

77
00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:25.827
polished company among your competitors,
right.

78
00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:29.742
It's it's one of these things where you
might be sending the first email or

79
00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:32.390
your customer gets this fancy new button.

80
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.268
And they could assume this person
has a special relationship with

81
00:05:37.268 --> 00:05:40.558
Google in order to get
this enriched thing.

82
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:44.136
So we'll go over metadata and in depth and

83
00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:49.880
we will actually end up taking
sort of an optimized website.

84
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.081
And deploying it.

85
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:55.895
And we'll get some hands on experience
using some tools that can help

86
00:05:55.895 --> 00:06:00.550
you identify like how your metadata
is seen by the various people.

87
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.726
You should care about Facebook,
Twitter, Google, and so on.

88
00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:07.970
Then we'll move on to
mobile optimizations.

89
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.627
So being friendly to mobile devices having
a web presence that is a good experience

90
00:06:14.627 --> 00:06:19.754
on a mobile device is increasingly
important for two reasons.

91
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:26.860
One is that mobile traffic has long
ago eclipsed desktop, web traffic.

92
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.677
But also now you get penalized
in Google's mobile index if you

93
00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:34.770
offer a subpar mobile experience.

94
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.850
So you'll actually get dinged
if you don't at least adhere to

95
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.544
the minimum level of
an acceptable mobile experience.

96
00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:44.732
So it's not just.

97
00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:49.967
It's not just that, you could stand out,
you can actually suffer and you could

98
00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:55.610
suppress your organic search, ranking by
not following some of the best practices.

99
00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.685
So we'll make sure no one who watches
this class falls into that category.

100
00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:01.270
And in fact,

101
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.210
we'll do some things that might make
you stand out amongst your competitors.

102
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.455
In terms of being rated more highly for
mobile friendliness.

103
00:07:09.455 --> 00:07:13.820
Finally we're going to round out
the day doing some work with

104
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.070
accelerated mobile pages or AMP pages.

105
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.660
So this is a new open source
technology that allows you to render

106
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:30.054
articles In a way where search engines can
offer a really fast loading experience.

107
00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:34.548
So if you have used Google recently,
and you see news articles pop

108
00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:39.465
up at the very top of your feed,
that's prime real estate right there.

109
00:07:39.465 --> 00:07:41.265
You can tap these articles and

110
00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:46.480
it will be a nearly instant experience as
that article is loaded on your device.

111
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.084
So we're gonna build
one of these ourselves.

112
00:07:49.084 --> 00:07:53.335
There are some different rules we have to
play by that are important in terms of how

113
00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:55.974
they're able to get these
things to work so fast.

114
00:07:55.974 --> 00:08:00.939
But this is another way where if you
offer an AMP page as part of your

115
00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:05.725
web presence, now you're eligible
to be in that that Carousel

116
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:09.817
of The content right at
the top of the search results.

117
00:08:09.817 --> 00:08:11.844
Right?
So, this is something that,

118
00:08:11.844 --> 00:08:16.375
even amongst organic SEO search results,
you can stand out by being at the very,

119
00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:21.171
very top and being displayed as richly as
possible, and as prominently as possible,

120
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:22.990
which is what this is all about.
