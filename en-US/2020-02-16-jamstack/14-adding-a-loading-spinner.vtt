WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.490
Once we save that, if I set my status
to pending nothing will really change.

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.110
But we can see now that we've
got extra styles in here.

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.420
I guess we can't really, but
there are extra style showing up.

4
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.130
So I want to add my pending styles and

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.508
I'm gonna do that up above.

6
00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:40.603
And the way I want this to work is I
only want the form to have these pending

7
00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:41.160
styles.

8
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.960
So I'm just gonna set it to be position
relative, cuz we're gonna do some fun

9
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.837
stuff with overlays and
disabling the form with CSS only.

10
00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:54.259
I always love doing the CSS stuff, because
I feel like a lot of people who work

11
00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:58.650
in front-end dismiss CSS as being like,
it's just the decoration that sits on top.

12
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.610
But there's so
much you can do with it and there's so

13
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.670
many things that you can add like we're
going to build a loading spinner.

14
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.390
And we're not gonna use any JavaScript for
it.

15
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210
We're just gonna use CSS for that.

16
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.670
So let's check our form.pending and
we're gonna

17
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.670
use a pseudo element called before and
I'm gonna set the background to white.

18
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.582
I'm going to set the border
radius to match the form so

19
00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:30.057
that it doesn't overlay
outside of it to be 0.25 rem.

20
00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:35.412
And then I wanna set content because
it's a pseudo element needs to exist,

21
00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:37.885
so we just set empty content on it.

22
00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:42.520
I'm gonna give it a height of 100% and
a width of 100%.

23
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.460
Then I'm going to make it position
absolute so that we can control exactly

24
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.860
where it sits in relation to this form
which we just set up as relative.

25
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.390
And I just wanna make it top 0 and
left 0, and

26
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.470
what we should see here if I turn that
off is it just overlay the whole form.

27
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.210
And so that will be a little bit jarring,
it's like wait, did the site just break?

28
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.480
So instead what we can do is we can
mess with the opacity a little bit and

29
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.480
I'm just gonna stick the opacity down
here and make it let's say like 85%.

30
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.789
Okay, that's a little better
now it looks like it's

31
00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.443
intentionally disabled, not just hidden.

32
00:02:27.443 --> 00:02:30.834
And the nice thing about this is that it
makes it like I can't click on anything

33
00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:31.729
while I'm in here.

34
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.080
So with just CSS we've
just disabled the form.

35
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.080
There are some issues that you'd wanna
look at where I could keyboard now after

36
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.950
this and enable it, but
that's more for like production apps.

37
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.020
So you would wanna figure
out how to disable entirely.

38
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.440
So the next thing that I wanna do
is I wanna add some things for

39
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.750
when the form is pending,
we'll set the after state.

40
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
And I want to set the background
to be a radial gradient.

41
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.300
And we'll just use some RGBA values.

42
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.250
I'm gonna make it a kind
of blue-ish color.

43
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.020
And I'll make it start out transparent,
and

44
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.470
I'm going to have it fade
up to 75% transparency.

45
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.220
Then I'm going to set
the border radius to 50.

46
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.345
So we get a circle 50%,
I'm gonna set the content to empty,

47
00:03:38.358 --> 00:03:40.640
So that it actually shows up.

48
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.880
I want the height of it
to be about 6 rem and

49
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.050
we want it to be circular, so
the width is gonna be the same.

50
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.390
I want again, to go position absolute but
I want it to be centered.

51
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.008
So the way that we can center it is we can
go left and we can use the calc command.

52
00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:00.870
And I'm gonna say that I want
it to be 50% from the left, but

53
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.140
I want it to be minus half of its width.

54
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.710
So what we're doing is
we're basically saying,

55
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.890
be exactly centered based on your width.

56
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.480
I'm gonna do the same thing from the top.

57
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.464
Now we've got this kinda circle thing and
that's okay,

58
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:19.923
it's not really indicating loading though,
so let's make it do that.

59
00:04:19.923 --> 00:04:21.859
I'm gonna add some key frames.

60
00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:28.214
We'll call this key frame loading and
I'm gonna go from

61
00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:33.726
an opacity of 1 and
will transform it to be really teeny tiny.

62
00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:40.022
So we'll set scale of
like one-tenth of 1%.

63
00:04:40.022 --> 00:04:43.630
And then I wanna set the two
to an opacity of 0, so

64
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.629
it's going to fade out as it gets bigger
and we'll scale it up to its actual size.

65
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.770
And once we've saved that, I can come
up here and just add an animation.

66
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.100
And I want it to be the loading animation,
I want it to take one second.

67
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.660
I want it to continue for
as long as it's visible, and

68
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.300
we'll have it kind of slow down as it gets
bigger using the ease out transition.

69
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.330
Now we've got a loading state, right?

70
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.900
So it's pure CSS, it's disabled the form,
it kinda looks like it's I mean,

71
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.580
we've want a real designer to go in and
make this actually look nice,

72
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.300
but like this is pretty okay, right?

73
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.830
For five minutes worth of effort and we
didn't have to write any extra JavaScript.

74
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.630
So our app stayed lightweight.

75
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.430
We're not doing a bunch of extra heavy
JavaScript to stand up a spinning div or

76
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.300
a loading div or anything.

77
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.010
We're just using the platform for
what it's built for.

78
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.780
That then puts us in a position

79
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.970
that we were ready to actually start
transitioning between the states.

80
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.490
And so, let's make the form
submission change the state, right?

81
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.198
So to do that, I'm gonna create
a new helper function down here and

82
00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:55.755
we will call it setStatus, and
I'm gonna put it above this one.

83
00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:04.178
And what setStatus is gonna do is it's
going to take a status field value and

84
00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:08.620
then it's going to dispatch
a type of update status.

85
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.820
And it's going to send
the new status as its value.

86
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.960
To use this,
we can just call it somewhere.

87
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.670
So I want in my handle submit,

88
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.800
I want to set the status
depending as soon as we submit.

89
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.003
So let's reset this Idle.

90
00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:35.900
And now when I submit,
it goes into the pending state.

91
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.570
Cool, okay, get this good,
this is what we want.

92
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.400
And we haven't written our function yet so
we aren't gonna be able to get a response.

93
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.880
But let's kind of create
the illusion of this will work.

94
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:55.900
So I'm going to set time out down here,
so that we can kinda fake it.

95
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.606
So we'll set the status to,
let's try success

96
00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:06.751
at first and we'll do it after one second.

97
00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.084
So now, when I submit after a second
it transitions to the success state and

98
00:07:16.084 --> 00:07:18.180
we see our success thing.

99
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.330
If I change that to be error, submit,
and something went wrong, okay?

100
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.360
So, good,
we've got the functionality that we want.

101
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.885
Now, the one last thing that I
wanna show is in the success state,

102
00:07:33.984 --> 00:07:37.360
We don't have any way to get back
without refreshing the page, right?

103
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.890
So if I wanted to, for some reason,
use this form as my primary email client,

104
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.780
I needed to send more than one message,
then I need a way to reset this.

105
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.000
So let's also add a reset
capability in here.

106
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.090
So the reset is just going to
be the same as the default and

107
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.610
we'll just say if we wanna reset we just
send an action with a type of reset and

108
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.100
that'll give us back our initial state
which moves us to the idle state.

109
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.090
Which resets our forum, makes it visible
and resets all the form values so

110
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.760
that we're able to start typing fresh.

111
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.200
So in here, we can then

112
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.420
let's just add a button to our
success state that lets us reset.

113
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.240
So we've got our success state here and
I'm going to just add a button below

114
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:31.805
and we'll make it a type of reset and
add an onClick.

115
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.470
So whenever someone clicks this button,
what will happen is we're just gonna

116
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.790
dispatch an event of the type reset.

117
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:51.347
And let's give it a class name
of we're gonna use stylesButton.

118
00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:54.929
And then because I know that this
is also going to require centering,

119
00:08:54.929 --> 00:09:01.077
I'm gonna give it another class
called stylesCentered, And

120
00:09:01.077 --> 00:09:05.480
the text will say reset,
so that says reset.

121
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.960
Let's add a quick centered option here.

122
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.499
Under my button,
I can say button.centered,

123
00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:20.458
and we'll just say margin-left is auto,

124
00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:24.189
margin-right is auto, okay?

125
00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:29.720
And that's a little squishy up there,
so let's do margin top of like 1 rem.

126
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.290
Okay, perfect, and when I click this,
it resets our form.

127
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.130
So if I add some values in here,
and then I send it and

128
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.340
then I reset it it's gonna clear those for
us so that we can send multiple values.

129
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.995
And that is a functioning

130
00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:52.590
state-managed thingy that
will allow us to actually

131
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.080
send and submit and
track a visual state of this form.

132
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.740
So, now, let's save our work and
we can actually make this thing do stuff.
