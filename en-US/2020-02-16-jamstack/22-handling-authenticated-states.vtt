WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.159
So with that, we have a site,
that's up and running, okay?

2
00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.813
It's doing what we want,
we can navigate around, okay, perfect.

3
00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:09.124
So let's enable identity,
so I'm gonna come in here,

4
00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:11.692
I'm just gonna click this
identity button and click Enable.

5
00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:18.392
And we're done, that's it [LAUGH].

6
00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:24.423
So then, now that I've got that,
here in this layout, when this boots up,

7
00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:29.730
it's gonna find that and
use it as the context for logging in.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.470
That means that we can do
a couple other things.

9
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.580
So the first thing that I wanna do is,

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.120
I wanna get us to be
able to actually log in.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990
So let's go to this route login
component that we created.

12
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.380
And I'm going to pull up netlify
dev again so that we, netlify dev.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.415
And I wanna go to my login component.

14
00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:59.919
And then let's give ourselves some
screen real estate, And close that up.

15
00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:05.108
Okay, so now that we've got
the the netlify provider

16
00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:10.544
kind of in context showing
us what we're working with.

17
00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:13.790
Okay, so our app is wrapped
in that identity provider,

18
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.794
and we've got a valid instance of
our OAuth provider up in the cloud,

19
00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:22.780
which is a netlify right now, we can
start kinda making requests against it.

20
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.248
So what I'm gonna do is,
in our login component,

21
00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:33.079
I'm going to import useIdentityContext.

22
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.716
And we're gonna get that
from react-netlify-identity.

23
00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:41.488
And then I'm also going to
import navigate from gatsby.

24
00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:48.765
And what I wanna do is, I want to
check if we're already logged in.

25
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:53.829
And if so, we want to send
someone over to the dashboard,

26
00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.580
the actual logged-in dashboard.

27
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.265
So I'm gonna grab the identity by
just running useIdentityContext.

28
00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:05.705
And if someone has logged in,

29
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.275
this is gonna include all of
the details that we have about them.

30
00:02:08.275 --> 00:02:11.065
Their name, and whether or
not their login is valid, and

31
00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:13.405
some metadata if we wanted to set that.

32
00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:18.848
And so in here,
now that we've got that identity,

33
00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:22.530
I can say, if identity is set and,

34
00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:30.463
We're logged in,
then I don't wanna be on this page,

35
00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:35.529
so I'm gonna navigate
to /dashboard/secret.

36
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.404
And again, we're gonna replace true, cuz
we don't wanna end up in an infinite loop.

37
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:47.232
And that doesn't do anything yet,
because we're not logged in, but

38
00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:50.077
it didn't break anything,
so that's promising.

39
00:02:50.077 --> 00:02:54.423
So let's pull up our dashboard,
and add the ability to

40
00:02:54.423 --> 00:03:00.200
actually, Show a login modal.

41
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.410
And the nice thing about this is that
netlify just kinda shifts one of these for

42
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.560
us, so
we don't have to build it ourselves.

43
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.050
So I'm gonna grab IdentityModal out
from react-netlify-identity-widget.

44
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.840
And then down here, I'm just gonna stick
this thing in here, so IdentityModal.

45
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.834
And then we can decide whether or
not we wanna show the dialog, and

46
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:30.187
that needs to be true or false.

47
00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:34.120
And so, by default,
let's just look at it and,

48
00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.180
Yeah, let's just look at it to start.

49
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.480
Okay, so that doesn't look great, but

50
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.806
that's okay because we actually
get some styles for free.

51
00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:52.831
And I don't know, yeah,
I can include them here.

52
00:03:52.831 --> 00:04:00.321
Let's just import
react-netlify-identity-widget/styles.css,

53
00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:02.703
I believe is what it is.

54
00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:05.140
There we go, and so
it picks up those styles for us.

55
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.940
So we don't have to actually
deal with that, right?

56
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.177
We just get to have it work and
things are good.

57
00:04:13.177 --> 00:04:19.764
So if I want to log in, and
I think this might not work on a,

58
00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:27.617
Something I'll actually remember.

59
00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:34.918
Okay, so now I'm logged in and
now, okay, I can't hide that.

60
00:04:34.918 --> 00:04:37.060
So I need a way to close that dialog.

61
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.560
So let's actually add a toggle for
our login state.

62
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.261
I wanna be able to show and
hide this modal.

63
00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:44.149
So yeah, go ahead.

64
00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:47.822
&gt;&gt; Quick question, what is the Active
Directory for this authentication?

65
00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:53.001
&gt;&gt; The Active Directory, can you-
&gt;&gt; Where your username and

66
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.288
password's stored?

67
00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:58.100
&gt;&gt; The username and password are stored
in netlify as an OAuth provider.

68
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.910
And it's all backed by gotrue,
the library.

69
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.690
So it's kind of an OAuth
implementation that's open sourced and

70
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.260
then wrapped by netlify identity.

71
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.480
&gt;&gt; Could anyone with a netlify
account sign in like that?

72
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.413
&gt;&gt; Right now, yes, well,
sorry, let me rephrase.

73
00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:18.525
Right now, this is open registration,
anybody who wants to can sign up for this.

74
00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:24.090
But you do have controls in here to say
whether or not somebody's able to log in.

75
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.270
You can say whether or
not people can sign in,

76
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.880
whether you want to allow people to, if
they have to have a certain email address,

77
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.270
or if you have to create an account and
send it to them first.

78
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.395
Those settings are all figured out,
but by default, registration's open.

79
00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:41.691
So anyone who wants to can just put
in their username and email, and

80
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:42.600
they'll get an account.

81
00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:49.054
And you can add external providers, so
if you wanna be able to login with your

82
00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:52.599
GitHub or Google or something,
you can just check those boxes to do it.

83
00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:59.965
So I want to be able to show and
hide this thing.

84
00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:02.835
So I'm just gonna use a state for
the visibility toggle.

85
00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:08.330
And that is going to be,
we'll call it isVisible.

86
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.679
And then we'll say setVisibility
will be the setter for it.

87
00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:17.582
We're gonna do useState,
and we'll default to false.

88
00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:22.000
So I can say,
show dialog if it is visible.

89
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.930
And then the other thing that I want is,
when somebody hits that close button,

90
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.882
I wanna actually hide it.

91
00:06:29.882 --> 00:06:36.198
So onCloseDialog,
which is one of the settings here,

92
00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:40.743
I can just run setVisibility to false.

93
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:50.766
Okay, so now, when I go to my login,

94
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:58.020
And I want to show this window,
I think I need to make this do a thing.

95
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.240
Let's start by setting it to true so
that we can just see it work first.

96
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.758
Okay, so we've got our modal,
it's visible.

97
00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:12.460
I wanna close it, I click close,
hurray, [LAUGH] it did what we wanted.

98
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.600
So by default, we want this to be hidden.

99
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.670
And I want to go into my login route and
make it,

100
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.406
we wanna be able to toggle
this from somewhere else.

101
00:07:25.406 --> 00:07:28.286
So this little visibility
toggle that we made,

102
00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:32.188
let's make that into a helper
function that we can pass around.

103
00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:37.706
So I'm gonna call it showModal,
and we'll just set it like this.

104
00:07:37.706 --> 00:07:42.018
And then down here,
we can call it, showModal, and

105
00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:45.742
then I'm gonna also pass
it in to this login.

106
00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:52.750
And that way, we can control our state
from another component without having to

107
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.250
redeclare how it all works.

108
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.371
So that way,
if I pull up my login component,

109
00:07:59.371 --> 00:08:03.282
I'm now gonna get this showModal helper.

110
00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:10.511
And I can, on my button,
say onClick, let's show the modal.

111
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:13.799
So now I should be able to click this,
refresh the page.

112
00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:21.883
Click this, no, what did I screw up here,
am I missing a thing?

113
00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:27.040
Passing it in as showModal,
Passing that in as showModal.

114
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.950
Okay, here's what I did wrong.

115
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.400
I'm telling it to hide the modal, so

116
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.510
we were just setting it to false over and
over again.

117
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.160
Which means that I do want to
have this one down here, and

118
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.450
we'll just keep it as false.

119
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.838
And that's the only one that’s
gonna hide the modal, so

120
00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:44.497
we don’t need to write a helper for it.

121
00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:50.547
So let's try that again, okay,
we can show and hide, this is good deal.

122
00:08:50.547 --> 00:08:53.449
So then if I try to login,
let's see if it's gonna let me.

123
00:08:55.917 --> 00:09:01.720
It lets me login, and
it's auto redirected.

124
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.050
So if I make this a little bigger so
we can see it if I go to login,

125
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:11.120
now I am logged in, and so
it auto redirected us to the secret page.

126
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.659
Okay, so we've got authentication working,

127
00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:20.152
we are getting a user object, and
we can log that to see what it looks like.

128
00:09:20.152 --> 00:09:24.325
Let's just take in our,
where's a good place to show it?

129
00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:29.347
Let's maybe just look at our profile page,

130
00:09:29.347 --> 00:09:32.964
because we're gonna need
to update that anyways.

131
00:09:32.964 --> 00:09:38.748
And so in our profile page, we're gonna
get that useIdentityContext again,

132
00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:44.066
And that comes in from
react-netlify-identity.

133
00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:48.405
Where is it, up here.

134
00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:56.567
And I can just grab this out by saying
const identity = useIdentityContext.

135
00:09:58.386 --> 00:10:04.256
Okay, and then I can console.log that
identity, and we can see what's in here.

136
00:10:06.608 --> 00:10:10.590
So to look at what's coming out,
we've got a bunch of information.

137
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.250
So whether or not, let's see,

138
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.360
these are some functions, so
let's look at the user object.

139
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.913
In the user object,
I have app metadata, so

140
00:10:20.913 --> 00:10:24.281
that shows that I signed up with an email.

141
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:28.108
Then we can see,
we could set things like the audience.

142
00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:30.970
And this is all OAuth stuff that we're
not really gonna get into today.

143
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.390
But we can see my email if I need that,
and then we can see user metadata,

144
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.505
including my full name and
where I signed up from.

145
00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:43.055
So this gives us just the basics.

146
00:10:43.055 --> 00:10:45.831
We can say, hey, you are logged in, and

147
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:50.919
we can see that you've got user data,
so we can access it, we can show it.

148
00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:54.563
So let's make this a little
more manageable, and

149
00:10:54.563 --> 00:10:57.524
then let's just show some of this data.

150
00:10:57.524 --> 00:11:02.355
So what I wanna show first is,
I wanna figure out if we're logged in.

151
00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:06.328
And we can do that by saying isLoggedIn.

152
00:11:06.328 --> 00:11:11.031
And I'm just gonna say,
if the identity is set,

153
00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:14.599
and we have identity.isLoggedIn.

154
00:11:14.599 --> 00:11:20.703
So then using this, we can actually
just bail out of showing anything.

155
00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:27.270
Or let's see if we wanna do it like that,
yeah, that's fine.

156
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.631
So effectively, what we're doing here is,
we're just saying,

157
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:33.584
if we're not logged in,
don't show this profile at all.

158
00:11:33.584 --> 00:11:38.257
And that's good, because we're gonna try
to show login status here, go ahead.

159
00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:41.554
&gt;&gt; In the OAuth thing
that it's giving back,

160
00:11:41.554 --> 00:11:44.950
is there user details that you get for
free?

161
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.661
If somebody had, for example,
regional data in the OS, I mean,

162
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:53.960
do you just basically get,
yes, this is an actual person?

163
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.496
Or do you get any actual details about who
that person might be from previous logins?

164
00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:03.298
&gt;&gt; So there are services that
can give you additional insight

165
00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:06.320
into users when they log in.

166
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.070
I don't know if netlify will do that, but

167
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.240
I think OAuth has
the ability to support that.

168
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.280
Or sorry, Auth0, is what I meant to say.

169
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.310
And so you can put anything
you want into that token,

170
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.520
you could insert literally anything.

171
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.700
Are they an admin,
are they a regular user?

172
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.673
Do you want to try to get their IP, and

173
00:12:29.673 --> 00:12:32.550
then use the IP to try to
geolocate them or something?

174
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.880
There are a lot of things that you
could do as part of your login process.

175
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.420
When you send that token around,
you can kinda modify it and

176
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.160
put more things in it and send it back.

177
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.820
It's a little out of scope of
what we're talking about today,

178
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.540
but the short answer is,
yes, you can do that.

179
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.390
So the next thing that we wanna do is,
let's get the name out of this.

180
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.743
So the name is kinda buried and

181
00:12:56.743 --> 00:13:01.549
this is where I wish that something
like optional chaining was fully usable.

182
00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:07.213
I think we're so
close to it being possible, but for now,

183
00:13:07.213 --> 00:13:13.456
we're gonna do if identity is set,
and identity.user is set,

184
00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:18.082
and identity.user.user_metadata is set,

185
00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:22.141
and identity.user.user_metadata,

186
00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:32.503
metadata.full_name, so
that's what we need.

187
00:13:32.503 --> 00:13:37.639
So that will give us our name,
and then once we have that,

188
00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:42.355
we can rewrite this,
we can say logged in as, name.

189
00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:46.715
And then I also wanna have a log
out button, so let's add that.

190
00:13:46.715 --> 00:13:49.243
We'll say button and on Click,

191
00:13:49.243 --> 00:13:54.118
we just need to show that modal
cuz that's how you can log out.

192
00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:58.927
And I will say log out, and that means
that we're gonna need to pass this

193
00:13:58.927 --> 00:14:01.988
showModal in, so
we can just add it as a prop.

194
00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:06.938
And then let's go out
to our dashboard here.

195
00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:16.438
And on the profile, we're going to
include showModal as showModal.
