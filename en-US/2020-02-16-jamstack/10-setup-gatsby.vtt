00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.710
I want to build a little app that will
actually use serverless functions.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.260
And the app that I want to
build is a contact form.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.420
So we're going to build
a little react contact form and

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.440
that is going to submit to a serverless
function that will actually send an email.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.130
The actual email sending part is optional.

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.090
I'm going to use a service to show
it actually working top to bottom,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.460
but you can skip that part.

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.540
I'm going to use mailgun.

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.360
If you don't want to sign up for a mailgun
account, you can just skip it and

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.730
like console log the output.

11
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.530
So to start, let's build ourselves a form.

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.220
So I'm gonna use Gatsby, because

13
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.280
Gatsby gets a lot of the boilerplate
out of getting a react site going.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.300
So to do that,
I'm going to run yarn init -y,

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.500
which just sets up a package JSON for me.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.131
And then I'm going to yarn add
gatsby react, and react-dom

17
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.710
And to show you what this looks like,
here's the package JSON that got created.

18
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.220
It just uses the defaults that I have set.

19
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.910
And then it's going to momentarily
update with the dependencies.

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.540
Okay, all good.

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.640
And then for convenience,
I'm going to add a scripts key and

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
we'll just put develop is
going to be gatsby develop.

23
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.000
&gt;&gt; What was the command again?

24
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.570
&gt;&gt; I ran yarn init dash y which is for
yes.

25
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.830
So I'm basically answering
yes to all questions.

26
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.720
And then after running yarn init, I just
installed gatsby react and react dom.

27
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.570
&gt;&gt; And NPM version of that NPM install.

28
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.880
&gt;&gt; NPMI or install gatsby react and
react dom.

29
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.860
&gt;&gt; And react dom
&gt;&gt; React dash

30
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.510
dom
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

31
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

32
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.170
So, once we have that setup,
we're going to create a new file.

33
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.730
So we'll just start with an index page.

34
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.985
So I'm gonna go and
create source slash pages slash index.js.

35
00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:12.090
I'm not going to go deep
into how Gatsby works.

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.870
I have a workshop that's kind
of an introduction to Gatsby and

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.700
another one that's
an intermediate Gatsby course.

38
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.780
If you want to go deeper, you can.

39
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.540
But if you don't, don't worry,
I'm gonna try to avoid

40
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.936
any Gatsby specific stuff in favor
of just writing React apps today.

41
00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:34.323
The one thing that you'll need to know is
that Gatsby uses this pages directory as

42
00:02:34.323 --> 00:02:36.590
kind of like anything that I create here.

43
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.551
So index.js will become index.html.

44
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:42.500
If I created an about j s,
it would become about.

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.720
So that's how the site kind
of builds its routing.

46
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.400
So in my index.js,
I'm gonna import react from react.

47
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.000
And then I want to export default and
this is going to be our page structure.

48
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.650
And I'm just gonna use
a react fragment here, so

49
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.930
that I don't generate any kind
of useless divs or markup.

50
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.990
And I'm gonna put a heading
that says send a message.

51
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.510
And then down here We need to add a form.

52
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.490
And that form is going to be
a component that we'll import.

53
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.170
Let's start up,
the Gatsby development server so

54
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.890
that we can watch our progress here.

55
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.210
So I'm going to run yarn develop,
you can also run NPM run develop.

56
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.182
And this will start up our site, And

57
00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.920
once the site gets running,
it runs at local host 8000.

58
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.690
So let's boot that up.

59
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.380
Okay so
we've got our kind of simplified site.

60
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.120
It just shows a heading right now.

61
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.060
And I'm gonna add a couple
little things in the styles.

62
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.840
So let me add a, in the source
folder is where I'm meant to be.

63
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.899
I'm gonna add a global.css.

64
00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.500
And I'm gonna make some
site wide adjustments.

65
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.840
So the first thing that I wanna do is
I wanna set box sizing border box.

66
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.620
If you want to skip ahead on the CSS,
it's not required.

67
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.732
This will work fine being ugly,

68
00:04:29.732 --> 00:04:33.100
I just wanted to show how
to handle a couple things.

69
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.950
We're gonna do CSS only pending states and
stuff for

70
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.140
the form to show a couple
approaches that avoid lots and

71
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.510
lots of JavaScript to handle
things that CSS can do for us.

72
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.860
So I'm gonna set the box
sizing to border box.

73
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.700
I'm going to then set up
the HTML to use some visually

74
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.430
pleasing color so
it's not stark black and white,

75
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.831
will do font family Sans Serif and
set up font size of 18.

76
00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:09.050
I also want to set the heading to be
a little bit darker, so it stands out.

77
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.910
And I will set font size of the heading
to be a little bit smaller,

78
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.770
the-
&gt;&gt; Got the F there.

79
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.730
&gt;&gt; Boy, I'm typing like a pro today.

80
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.910
Margin top, we'll set it to REM and
we'll text align center.

81
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.795
Okay, so now that I've created this,
what I can do is head over into this

82
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:43.220
index.js and just import this directly and
Gatsby will pick up the styling for us.

83
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.003
So I'm going to import.

84
00:05:49.413 --> 00:05:53.020
Global.css.

85
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.200
And we can see that Gatsby
picked it up for us.

86
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.510
So what this means is that we
are able to just kind of edit styles.

87
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.535
Gatsby has some built in CSS handling.

88
00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:04.345
You can also use your preferred thing.

89
00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:09.007
What we're gonna use a lot of today is
called CSS modules, which is not CSS and

90
00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:13.480
JS, but it gives us some of the same
scoping flexibility, which is nice.
