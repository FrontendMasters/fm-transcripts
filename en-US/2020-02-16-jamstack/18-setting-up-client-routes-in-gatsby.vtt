00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.780
Now we've got the basics of an app setup,
right,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.280
we can go to a dashboard, but we need to
actually do something with this dashboard.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.650
In order to get the dashboard to respect
the client-side routes in Gatsby,

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.550
we need to use an API
hook called onCreatePage.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.180
So we're just gonna export a function,
exports.onCreatePage,

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.080
and Gatsby will run that.

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.529
So this is going to give us two things.

8
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.451
A page object, which is the page
that is being loaded, and

9
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.520
then actions that we can
perform on that page.

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.830
So, inside of this,
we're gonna check if the page

11
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.200
path matches, and we're gonna use
a regular expression for this.

12
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.940
So we're gonna check if
it matches dashboard.

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.730
And as long as it starts with dashboard,

14
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.470
then we know that we wanna rewrite
it to the dashboard component.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.182
So to make that happen,
we use page.matchPath.

16
00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:02.690
And we're gonna set that to equal
any extension of dashboard.

17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.127
So dashboard slash anything is gonna get
rerouted to the dashboard component.

18
00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:11.049
And once we've made this change,

19
00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.400
we're going to hit actions.createPage and
pass in our page.

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.825
So upon doing this,
we can stop and restart.

21
00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:28.579
And once this gets running for
us, We should

22
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.746
be able to see that over here,
now we hit our dashboard.

23
00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:38.130
Any route will bring us
back to the dashboard.

24
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.920
So this gives us the ability
now to actually build

25
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.808
a dashboard that will have
private routing in it.
