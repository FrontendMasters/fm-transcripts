00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
To deploy this,

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.780
what I'm actually gonna do is just
create another repo inside of here.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.020
This is not particularly good Git hygiene,
but we're all learning together, right?

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.052
So let me let me push
what I've done first.

5
00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.882
So that's now up on
the fem-progress branch,

6
00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.508
if you wanna check out where we are now.

7
00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:26.128
And then I'm in the sections/basic,

8
00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:30.328
and I'm just gonna run, git init.

9
00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:37.260
And what I'm doing with git init,
here, is I'm setting up a new repo.

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.987
So if I look at my git status,

11
00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:45.008
it's gonna show us these
three files as untracked.

12
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:50.431
And that's because I've just kind of
set up a whole new Git repo in here.

13
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:55.328
So what I wanna do is I
wanna create a new repo.

14
00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:59.850
And I'm gonna take a quick detour here to
show you one of my favorite tools that I

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.150
found in a long time.

16
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.820
It's called hub.

17
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.620
And what hub does is it gives you
a whole bunch of amazing CLI benefits.

18
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.660
So feel free to install this or
not, this is completely optional.

19
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.406
But if you work in GitHub often,

20
00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:21.103
this is a tool that legitimately
has improved my life.

21
00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:29.035
And so what it does is it gives us a set
of tools that we can create new repos.

22
00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:32.350
We can open the GitHub repository
right from the command line.

23
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.210
We can create pull requests,
and approve pull requests, and

24
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.710
check out pull requests.

25
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.220
All these things that take a lot of time,
if you do them through the UI,

26
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.480
you can do it all from the command line.

27
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.150
And so that's gonna help us as
we move through a lot of today.

28
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.802
And it'll help anyone who
works on a Git-based workflow.

29
00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:52.220
It should help you quite a bit.

30
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.663
And so what I've done is I've actually
gone in and created an alias for

31
00:01:56.663 --> 00:01:57.878
it in my dot files.

32
00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:03.228
So I ran the brew install hub to get it.

33
00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:08.221
And then if I open up, Where is it?

34
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:10.714
The my bash_profile.

35
00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.420
Boy, I'm really bad at this aren't I?

36
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.350
There it is.

37
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.037
So I have a lot of aliases to help me out.

38
00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:19.950
This is that git status one.

39
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.500
But the one that I'm specifically talking
about here is I've aliased git to hub.

40
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.061
So hub does all the things
that git does regularly, but

41
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.743
then it just adds that extra
layer of utility on top of it.

42
00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:33.560
So when I'm using git,
I don't notice that I'm using hub.

43
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.033
But then when I need those extra tools,
this really helps.

44
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.334
So what I can do now that I have this,
is I can just say,

45
00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:49.469
git create, and
I'm gonna call this jamstack-intro-basic.

46
00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.653
And so it's now created a repo for me.

47
00:02:55.653 --> 00:03:00.758
So, with that repo,
I can git add everything.

48
00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.151
We'll check it, good.

49
00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:10.436
Let's git commit that and
say, my first JAMstack site.

50
00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:13.430
And then I'm going to push that to master.

51
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.625
If you didn't want to install hub,
you can go to github.com.

52
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.835
Let me open this in a browser
where I'm logged in.

53
00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:31.410
Make that smaller, okay.

54
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.004
So if you don't wanna install hub,
you can go to GitHub, and

55
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:39.619
up here at the top,
you can hit New repository.

56
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.890
And you can call it whatever you want.

57
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.747
Well, you could say,
It can be Public or Private.

58
00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:53.113
I mean, I recommend going public by
default unless you've got a really

59
00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:53.793
good reason.

60
00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:57.782
And then I'm gonna leave everything
else empty, create my repository.

61
00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.630
And then,
Would follow these instructions here.

62
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.917
So we initialized the repo already.

63
00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:12.613
We would add our files, and then you
just follow these steps, git remote add.

64
00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:16.568
And you set up your origin and point it
to this new repo that you've created.

65
00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:20.654
And then you can git push origin
master to get the files up.

66
00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:24.533
&gt;&gt; You did the git init in
the basic folder or in the root?

67
00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:29.810
&gt;&gt; Well, so I want the basic folder to
be the root of this particular example.

68
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.547
So, yeah, you run git init in whatever
what you want the root of your site to be.

69
00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:40.831
So if I go back over here, and
I can say, git browse, and

70
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:47.038
this is a hub tool, it will open
up this repo that we just created.
