00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.752
First thing that I wanna do here is
let's get Netlify Dev running so

2
00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:05.587
that we can see our changes as we go.

3
00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.661
So I want to add.

4
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.732
A profile that is gonna show up at
the top to let us know whether or

5
00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:16.980
not we're logged in.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.040
So let's start by adding that,
create a component called profile.

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.410
And in profile,
I'm going to import React from react.

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.240
And then we will import
Link again from gatsby.

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.830
When we're linking in between pages Link
is kind of the preferred way to do that.

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.150
And we'll setup a profile.

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.980
That's not going to accept any arguments
for now.M And it will return a div

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.010
we're going to take advantage of that CSS,
we already wrote him a dashboard header.

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.560
I'm going to set up a nav, and
that'll pages on the dashboard.

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.160
And let's come up with the couple
pages that we're gonna create.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.270
So the first one is going to be for
secret stuff and

16
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.660
we're gonna give that
an active class name as well.

17
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.310
And this is a convenience method,
so that we're able to specify how

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.410
the links look when we're
visiting that particular link, so

19
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.070
we don't have to write
that logic ourselves.

20
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.450
And then inside of this,
I'm going to add a page name, so

21
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.560
we'll call this secret staff.

22
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.052
Then let's add another one, and
this one will go to our base.

23
00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:45.390
So those are our two links.,
export default Profile.

24
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.130
And then, we also wanna show whether or
not we're logged in.

25
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.040
But we're not quite ready to do that yet.

26
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.230
We don't have the ability to authenticate.

27
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.393
So we'll just start a to do for now and
we'll just say show login status.

28
00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.750
So let's save this, fix my typo,
and now we've got a valid thing.

29
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.995
So I'm gonna go back over here into my
dashboard, and I'm going to import this.

30
00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:22.189
/components/profile And
I can just drop this right at the top.

31
00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:30.400
Make sure that's doing what I want it to,
yep.

32
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.490
Okay, so this is good.

33
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.050
Now we can navigate around,
and we can see where we are.

34
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.020
And if you look at that URL at the top,
it is changing as we move around.

35
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.910
So the next thing we want to do is
actually control how we're seeing what's

36
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.190
on the screen and
make sure that that everyone is able to

37
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.410
actually navigate that we can
actually see those components.

38
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.530
So let's just create some simple
components to make this work.

39
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.880
And I'm going to go into the components.

40
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.820
And we'll create one called route-base.

41
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.480
The name here is entirely arbitrary.

42
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.760
I'm prefixing with route so
that I know what it's for.

43
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.770
But you can do that however you want.

44
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.000
You could do it with a folder name.

45
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.200
You could do it with whatever.

46
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.360
In here,
I'm going to import React from react.

47
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.700
And then I'm going to set up
a component called route base, and

48
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.150
we'll make that just a component.

49
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.727
And I'm just gonna have
it have a headline in it.

50
00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:38.690
Let's make that wrap so it's legible, and
then down here we're gonna export default.

51
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.990
Route base, okay.

52
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.860
So these are gonna be very simple, we're
not gonna actually be building out like

53
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.170
a full app,
we're just gonna have protective areas.

54
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.120
So if we start here, I'm gonna copy this,
because we're gonna build one more and

55
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.530
we want this one to be
called route-secret.

56
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.016
And inside of it, we're gonna change
these to be called RouteSecret.

57
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:10.540
And we will say this
is super secret stuff.

58
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.180
Okay.

59
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.490
So now that we've got that,
we can switch over to our dashboard.

60
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.920
And let's import those as well.

61
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.890
And so what I want to be able to do is
like, if I just bring these straight in,

62
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.022
so I'm going to get outeBase from

63
00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:33.870
components RouteBase,
then I'll duplicate it.

64
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.778
Get route secret from route-secret
if I just drop these in.

65
00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.940
What we'll see is that's
not what we wanted.

66
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.200
We want these to actually be
different based on what the URLs.

67
00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:01.100
So we're going to use Reach router,
which is kind of a standard react router.

68
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.600
And I'm just gonna pull that straight in.

69
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.070
So import router from reach router.

70
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.540
And reach router is a dependency of
Gatsby so it's already available to us,

71
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.090
we don't have to install it ourselves.

72
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.340
It's kinda under the hood
what makes gatsby go.

73
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.330
So, using that I can
then just create a router

74
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.450
and move these components inside of it.

75
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.840
And to make these actually work with
the routes, I have to give it a path.

76
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.490
So because we're wrapping these
components with a router.

77
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.730
They get a new crop of path.

78
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.770
And we can say that dashboard.

79
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.280
And then for this one,
we're gonna say base.

80
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.800
And for this one we're gonna say secret.

81
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.980
And now we've actually
got routing in our app.

82
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.530
And you know, this is one of the things
that is really pleasant about this

83
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.170
approaches like the work has been done
to make this relatively straightforward.

84
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.850
So we don't have to worry about actually
parsing the URL and doing that logic.

85
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.110
We just kinda follow the patterns that
are established, and things work.

86
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.920
So the other thing that we're gonna need,
though, is we need a way to log in.

87
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.570
So we need a login form, and
that'll allow us to actually

88
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.670
get people authenticated and then we'll
be able to use that authentication

89
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.330
to decide whether not someone
should be able to see these routes.

90
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.640
So, let's go back in here and
create a route login component.

91
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.400
And inside of it,
we're going to import React From react

92
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.920
and we will also see,
let's just define this component.

93
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.030
It's gonna be called login and
it will return

94
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.029
a heading that says, login or sign up.

95
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.140
And we'll add a button.

96
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.370
And that button is gonna say, login.

97
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.010
Then we're gonna export default login.

98
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.860
And to keep with my naming convention,
I'm gonna rename these to route login.

99
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.562
So then, in our dashboard,
we can just include this,

100
00:07:23.562 --> 00:07:28.773
will get import Browser login
from components route login.

101
00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:36.293
And we can include this one
down here as route login,

102
00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:40.641
and we'll make the URL for
that login as well.
