00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.700
Up to this point, we have built a simple
Jamstack site, we built a contact form.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.010
So the next thing that I wanna move into
is the idea of client-side authentication.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.000
And so
how do we protect things in Jamstack apps?

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.540
How do we make sure that somebody's
logged in before they can see something?

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.192
So we're gonna solve that
problem by using OAuth,

6
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:27.720
and we're gonna use React as
a way of setting this up.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.140
The principles will be the same
in whatever frontend library,

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.710
you'll just need to figure
out how the router works.

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.470
But the general approach should be
pretty similar across Angular view,

10
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.890
whatever you wanna use.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.760
So to start, we are going to
move into the Dashboard folder.

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.194
And that's gonna look
a little bit like this.

13
00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:51.610
It's effectively empty.

14
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.400
I just didn't wanna make y'all
watch me write more CSS,

15
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.070
so I left the CSS in there for us.

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.500
So the way that we're gonna start this
one, is we are going to make sure that we

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.250
can use it with nullified dev, because
we need to to able to write redirect.

18
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.713
So I'm just gonna create
a gatsby config in here.

19
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.860
And then I want to set
up my Netlify redirects.

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.820
So I'm gonna create a netlify.toml.

21
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.400
And we're also, let's see inside,
gonna set up a redirect.

22
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.550
So that's redirects plural inside
of double square brackets.

23
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.196
And we are going to redirect from

24
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:41.014
dashboard, any dashboard, and

25
00:01:41.014 --> 00:01:45.850
point to just dashboard itself.

26
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.202
And the reason that we're doing that is
that we're about to build an app that will

27
00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:51.812
have a dashboard component.

28
00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:54.966
But we wanna be able to visit
different sections of our dashboard,

29
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:57.360
dashboard/accounts/buildings/ whatever.

30
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
But we wanna handle all that
through a single component.

31
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.930
And that's how we're gonna be
able to manage authentication.

32
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.910
So we're gonna have Netlify
handle that redirect for us.

33
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.184
So that if somebody were to type in,
like /account/dashboard, or

34
00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:17.172
a /dashboard/account,
they would end up in the right place.

35
00:02:17.172 --> 00:02:24.520
Instead of getting a 404, because there's
no actual file at /dashboard/account.

36
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.660
And the status that we're gonna send this
200, because again, this is a rewrite.

37
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.590
And to get us started, let's go ahead and
run that yarn init-y for

38
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.250
yes to set up a package JSON for us.

39
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.340
And inside of it, I'm going to
add gatsby react and react dom.

40
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:53.412
And we're using gatsby because we
don't wanna have to set up a bunch

41
00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:54.050
of boilerplate.

42
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.034
We just wanna be able to get it up and
running.

43
00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:06.120
So once we have gatsby react and
react dom, we can set up our first page,

44
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.670
which, let's start by
creating just an index page.

45
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.873
And that's gonna live in pagesindex.js.

46
00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:21.100
So this one,
we're gonna import react from react.

47
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.740
We will import link from gatsby.

48
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.030
Link is a helper that allows
you to do local links without

49
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.100
fully refreshing the page.

50
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.126
It's just kinda a nice to have it,
it does some some background performance

51
00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:34.130
optimization, like
preloading things as well.

52
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.831
And then we're going to export default.

53
00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:47.170
And that's going to,
Be a fragment to start.

54
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.490
We'll send a H1, and
we'll say this app rules.

55
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.684
And we'll say log in to find out why.

56
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.903
And then we're gonna link to a dashboard,

57
00:04:04.903 --> 00:04:10.312
and also, let's go to a dashboard.

58
00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:13.895
Okay, so this is a basic app,
and we can actually go ahead and

59
00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:16.016
start it by running that with iDev.

60
00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:28.620
So let me get localhost 8888,
that's the Netlify dev port.

61
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.860
And this will give us
our kind of basic setup.

62
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.520
So the next thing that we wanna do is
let's add a little bit of a layout, so

63
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.770
we can apply these styles
that are prewritten.

64
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.315
So I'm gonna create a new
component called layout.js, and

65
00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.410
init will import react from react.

66
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.770
We're going to import
link from gatsby again.

67
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.939
And then I'm also going to
import this layout.css.

68
00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:03.990
Then I can define the layout,
component that is going to take children.

69
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.780
And that means that anything that we put
inside of the layout component will be

70
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.970
wrapped up into a children component,
so that we can stick that in there.

71
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.960
And then I'm going to
return a fragment again,

72
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.950
because we don't wanna add
a bunch of useless markup.

73
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.040
Set a header.

74
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.670
We're gonna link to the homepage, and
we'll just call this a Jamstack app.

75
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.260
And then we're gonna set
up a main component, and

76
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.050
that is going to contain our children.

77
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.760
And at the bottom here,
we're gonna export default layout, so

78
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.847
that we have access to
import that elsewhere.

79
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.780
So that's the full component there.

80
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.930
And just recapping,
we've got just a header and a main.

81
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.710
And then whatever we put
inside of our layout component

82
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.480
will show up here in
between this main tags.

83
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.385
So back in our page,
we can just import that way out.

84
00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:13.815
And that's up in our Components folder,
Layout, and then I can use it here.

85
00:06:17.014 --> 00:06:20.440
And because the styles were prewritten,
it picks all that up.

86
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.020
And we have just a nice simple overlay for
our Jamstack app.

87
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.740
When I click through to go
to the dashboard, it breaks,

88
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.900
because we haven't created that yet.

89
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.031
So let's create our dashboard page.

90
00:06:34.364 --> 00:06:38.760
And we do that by just
creating dashboard.js.

91
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.890
And we're gonna import react from react,
we'll import that layout again.

92
00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:54.194
And then we can set up
the dashboard as a component.

93
00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:58.859
That doesn't need any props yet, and
it's just gonna return our layout.

94
00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.615
And inside the layout,
we will return just a todo.

95
00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:09.180
Export that as our default.

96
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.025
And now we should be able
to visit our dashboard.

97
00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:18.984
There we go.
