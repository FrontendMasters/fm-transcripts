WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.470
So the first thing that we wanna do
here is we're going to just build

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.800
the simplest possible Jamstack site.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.710
And so it's gonna be no dependencies,
no frameworks,

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.300
we're not gonna use any anything.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.470
We're gonna write an HTML file, and
we're gonna put it in the browser.

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.330
So in this basic folder,
we can delete this gitkeep.

7
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.940
That's just you have to have a file and

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.670
a folder else get one
let you put it up there.

9
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.910
And then I'm gonna create a new file and
I'm gonna call this index.html.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.010
And in here, let me close this down.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.200
I'm gonna set up let's see,
we want to doc type and

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.610
then we need to set language of English.

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.900
When was the last time that you
actually wrote your own HTML page?

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.640
Like I never do this anymore
if you done one recently?

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.360
&gt;&gt; Yes.

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.410
Yeah I like this to me is so
it's so fun because I just never

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.630
really do the structural stuff anymore
because there's always a boilerplate.

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.100
There's always something
that sets this up for you.

20
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.040
So it's kind of fun to dive in and
look at what all this stuff means.

21
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.100
So then we're gonna add a meta tag,
we need to add a charset.

22
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.524
So we'll do UTF-8,

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.210
we need to set up the viewport so
that it works on smaller screens.

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.520
And we'll set the content to width,

25
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.890
device width and
then we'll set the initial

26
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.900
scale to 1.0.

27
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.070
After we've got that we're going to tell
it to try to use edge stuff if we can.

28
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.160
I'm not sure if this is still
a thing that is useful.

29
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.560
I haven't talked to anybody on the edge
team to know if this is still a meaningful

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.970
thing to do, but
just in case let's give it a shot.

31
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.660
And so we'll say ie=edge.

32
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.240
I've often wish that that would work,
that you could just like put something

33
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.250
in here and say, I wish my browser
worked like this and it would just work.

34
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.710
Then we're gonna add a title and
we can call this My First JAMstack Site.

35
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.170
We'll say website.

36
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.760
Okay, so once we've got the heading here,

37
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.340
we're going to add a body
tag will add a main tag.

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.297
And then let's set up a heading
will say Hello Frontend Masters and

39
00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:35.450
then down here.

40
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.940
Say like, I like to write codes sometimes

41
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.060
Now I'm excited to be here, so
let's use an exclamation point.

42
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.030
We can actually just open this in
the browser and what I'm gonna do

43
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.840
because I don't want to, we could just
open this in our file system, but

44
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.310
the problem is is that browsers have
like cross origin request stuff.

45
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.750
So instead,
I'm just gonna use a little utility.

46
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.600
So in the command line,
I can just run npx serve.

47
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.180
Let me move into the basic so we're
gonna move into basic first make sure

48
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.130
you're actually in this
jamstack-intro/sections/basic.

49
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.450
And once you're there,
you can run npx serve.

50
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.570
&gt;&gt; Does it have to npm install?

51
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.360
&gt;&gt; Nope, npx will kind of
manage all of that for you.

52
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.040
And so, once that is finished running,
this opened up on localhost:5000.

53
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.180
So I'm gonna open that over here and
there we go, we got a website.

54
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.970
It's now being served,
you've written a JAMstack Site but

55
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.040
let's take this a little bit further.

56
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.980
Let's actually get into what a more,
like what an app might look like.

57
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.020
Like what if we wrote a tiny little app?

58
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.480
So start, let's save our work.

59
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.910
And then I'm gonna check out a new branch,
and we'll call this fem-progress.

60
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.820
And I'm going to check things here,
so I have this.

61
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.740
This is like a little GIT hack.

62
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.290
If you run git status-sb, it simplifies

63
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.850
the diff to show you like what's new and
what's not tracked and all that it's way

64
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.640
easier to look at than git status,
which is like huge and hard to read.

65
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.230
So I've alias that.

66
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.890
So instead of having to type out
git status SP I can just type S.

67
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.950
And it does that I learned that trick from
Christmas Guardian it changed my life.

68
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.470
So I'm going to add all this and

69
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.145
we will get commit will say basic HTML.

70
00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:54.280
Okay, so now that we've got some HTML,

71
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.490
we can move on and
let's write some styles.

72
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.720
We'll keep our styles pretty simple
here but I'm gonna add a style sheet

73
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.115
in the basic folder,
we'll call it style.css.

74
00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:14.400
And let's just write some fairly
straight forward boiler plate,

75
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.120
we'll set the text color on the whole
side to a nice kind of dark grey,

76
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.570
we'll set the font family to sans- serif,
make the font size a little bit bigger,

77
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.000
we can make the margin 0, so

78
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.010
that, that just removes some
kind of like browser defaults.

79
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.010
Then, on our main tag, we want to give
it some breathing room on the top and

80
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.560
bottom and then centre it left and right.

81
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.300
We will set a max width of
90 viewport width units.

82
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.880
I need to look up what VW stands for.

83
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.710
That's what it means in my brain.

84
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.880
But I think the port width but

85
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.970
it effectively means that will
be 5% off the left and right.

86
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.490
And then we'll set the words to 50
characters, which is kind of a fun like,

87
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.560
it uses the text size for width, which is
cool, it's really helpful if you wanna get

88
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.710
your line length legibility, so
that depending on how big someone zooms

89
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.920
the window it will still not be like ultra
narrow, or way too much text per line.

90
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.840
And then because we want our headings
to be a little bit visually emphasized,

91
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.090
will make them just slightly darker.

92
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.270
So this is our style sheet.

93
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.570
And to actually use this in the site,
we need to include it.

94
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.670
And so
we're going to go into Our HTML again.

95
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.640
All right, so let's go into our HTML.

96
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.420
And now we're going to add a link tag.

97
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.080
So it's going to be
the relationship is a style sheet.

98
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.604
And that lives at style.css.

99
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.710
If I run npx serve again.

100
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.100
I can reload the page.

101
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.460
And now we got some basic styles in place.

102
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.650
Okay, good deal, right like we were
starting to see this come together.

103
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.080
It's starting to look very professional.

104
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.480
I could put this in my portfolio
right now let's save our work.

105
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.680
Well, you got to start shutting
down a little bit faster than that.

106
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.170
So I'm going to get at everything.

107
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.778
We will just check to make
sure that's all we updated.

108
00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:35.050
Git commit basic.

109
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.440
So I'm using the semantic release,

110
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.190
like git commit fashion, I think this
is the angular commit conventions.

111
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.890
I do it out of habit, not because it's
something that I think you should do,

112
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.410
but it does make like change logs really
easy, if that's something you're into.

113
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.930
Let's add styles, and then I'm gonna
push actually, let me get this setup so

114
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.520
that we can origin in progress okay.

115
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.510
So.

116
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.848
&gt;&gt; There's a typo and initial scale.

117
00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:08.029
&gt;&gt; There is.

118
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:25.970
Okay.
