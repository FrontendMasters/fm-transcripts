00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.750
Here is our JAMstack intro
basic upon the site.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.970
It's doing what we want.

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.120
So I want to deploy this,
I want to get it up on the Internet.

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.930
So let's add a tool.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.790
There are a lot of ways you can do this.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.410
The way that I've chosen to do it today is
to use nullify, because nullify free and

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.980
it's pretty painless.

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.510
So I'm gonna use, let's do, so
we're gonna yard global add netlify-cli.

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.660
And this gives us some command line tools
to quickly set up a new project and

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.750
all those things.

11
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
Again, you can do this manually, but
it's kind of nice to be able to do it,

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.180
just right from the command line.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.026
If you don't wanna use yarn,
you can use mm global or npm install -g.

14
00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:47.520
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; With the Netlify bit,

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.910
do you have to point it to your account
in Netlify, or just does the blank-

17
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.270
&gt;&gt; It'll actually handle that for

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.280
you when you first run it.

19
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.732
So with the Netlify CLI,
let me just open that up.

20
00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:09.906
So once you install it,

21
00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:14.880
it'll kind of pick this all up.

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.500
So you can run Netlify login.

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.610
So let me just step through this actually.

24
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.151
So I will run Netlify login.

25
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:31.030
And it shows me that
I'm already logged in.

26
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.100
If you are not logged in, it's just
going to step you through the process.

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.000
But what's really fun about this is now
that we've got this set up now that we've

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.830
got this site deployed and
hooked up to get and all of this.

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.810
Again, we are really kind of the masters
of our destiny when we look at

30
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.040
at JAMstack to play.

31
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.360
So as front end developers,
I wanna make a change and

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.090
I wanna let's say,
I wanna try something new.

33
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.360
I wanna see how this site looks.

34
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.270
If I make the background yellow.

35
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.050
So what I can do then is I can
check out a feature branch.

36
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.730
So let's check out a new branch dash b for
a new branch, and

37
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.840
I'll say background color.

38
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.203
And on this branch,
I'm going to make a change to my CSS.

39
00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:25.970
And I want the background color,
To be, let's go with yellow.

40
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
And I'm in a risky mood, so I don't
necessarily wanna check this locally.

41
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.730
I'm just gonna ship it.

42
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.883
So we've got our change here, and

43
00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:45.580
I'm not gonna even worry about
the the Netlify stuff just yet.

44
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.034
So then I'm going to commit

45
00:02:57.738 --> 00:03:04.345
Okay so then I'm gonna push this
branch up and that goes up to GitHub.

46
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.430
And then I wanna open up a pull request.

47
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.170
And so what I could do is I could go to
the GitHub UI, I could find that branch

48
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.540
and I could click the Create Pull Request
button and all that stuff.

49
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.190
But what I'd rather do is just
type in pull request using hub and

50
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.360
then it opens up them.

51
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.410
This, if you aren't familiar with sorry,
I just trapped you there forever.

52
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.080
If you are familiar with this is
the commit message that I just sent.

53
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.940
So I'm gonna :wq to save and exit.

54
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.120
And that will now create
a port request for us.

55
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.190
So, I'm gonna open this link, and our

56
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.850
poll request is open now and check this
out, Netlify's already doing stuff, right?

57
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.210
So Netlify is now doing a deploy.

58
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.107
So if I click this button,

59
00:03:57.107 --> 00:04:02.525
I can see that no it's done or
it's almost done.

60
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:09.784
It looks like it wants to let me preview,
so I can click Preview and

61
00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:12.690
maybe that wasn't my best move, right?

62
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.450
But what's really cool about this
is like now I have my actual site.

63
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.090
So this is the actual site
JAMstack intro basic.netlify.com.

64
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.400
But my pull request got this unique
address that I can share with someone so

65
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.210
that I could say, hey, team,
I have this great idea.

66
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.280
What if we made the site a lot uglier?

67
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.850
And they can look at this and give me
feedback on it and they can say, hey,

68
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.710
that's a terrible idea.

69
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.350
Don't do that [LAUGH]
but

70
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.620
let's say that I'm feeling
particularly evil, and

71
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.110
without asking for permission,
I just go ahead and merge this.

72
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.020
So I merge it, and

73
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.100
then in Netlify, we'll see.

74
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.700
As soon as it merges, it's going to
start rebuilding that master branch.

75
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.220
And we'll just go ahead and watch this
happen should happen nice and fast.

76
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.421
&gt;&gt; Where did you get that link for
the pull request?

77
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.528
&gt;&gt; The link for the pull request
gets generated by the [CROSSTALK]

78
00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.760
&gt;&gt; For the link for the pull request.

79
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.610
&gt;&gt; So in your, your list of deploys,
it gives you a deploy preview and

80
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.310
there's just a button right here.

81
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.700
It also gets added in your,

82
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.500
here once this is done, it'll show you
that the deploy previous ready and

83
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.960
you can click this button to see it.

84
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.960
So this is And it looks like it
actually gave me an even better,

85
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.410
like more human readable name for
that once the deploy preview is finished.

86
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.680
So there are a lot of really nice
options for getting this done.

87
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.640
But so okay, I've now gone ahead and
defaced our company website.

88
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.180
And so I was working over the weekend
I didn't ask for approval,

89
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.220
I just did this thing.

90
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.160
And so naturally the team came in and
they're like,

91
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.030
this is about you gotta
you gotta fix this.

92
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.870
Instead of me having to go and
make this change.

93
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.650
Somebody with permissions
can just go back in here and

94
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.970
say, let's just use this one,
like let's go back to the original one.

95
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.680
And then when I reload,
we're back to the fixed site.

96
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.030
And then they can reprimand me in private,
and

97
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.180
have me fix the push before
we put something up.

98
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.880
But the instant rollback, right?

99
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.720
So we've now kinda moved back
to what should be there.

100
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.160
So these are the reasons, to kinda go back
to your question about why I'm using this

101
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.250
over GitHub Pages, is that it just
gives us more flexibility and control.

102
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.280
We can kinda see, try out things, share
it with our team, see what they think.

103
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.540
But again, I was able to take my idea to
something that was up on the Internet and

104
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.140
reviewable by the team without having
to do anything other than write

105
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.840
down the code for the idea,
the rest of it just happens automatically.

106
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.600
And I think that really starts to
illustrate the power of this approach is

107
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.300
that I don't need permission for my team.

108
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.770
I don't need someone to
stand up a staging server.

109
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.530
I don't need to go through
a review process that has to get

110
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.460
vetted by whoever's coming back
from their lunch break in an hour.

111
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.820
Like, it's just a very quick,
I get to say,

112
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.980
what if we did it like this and
I put that up and it's good to go.

113
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.590
So that is the kind of a quick overview.

114
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.220
Basic JAMstack stuff,
getting it up on the Internet.

115
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.480
And it's still up there,
we've got to live on in perpetuity.
