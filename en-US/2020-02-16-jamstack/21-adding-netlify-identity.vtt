1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.472
Authentication in apps is
typically done using OAuth.

2
00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.950
OAuth 2.0, specifically.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.209
And there are a ton of
implementation of this.

4
00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.120
You can roll your own with
something like Node Passport.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.977
A lot of social services, like GitHub and
a bunch of other services,

6
00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:23.855
have an OAuth 2.0 implementation
that you can use for logging in.

7
00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:28.663
And then there are a lot
of providers like Okta and

8
00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.070
Auth0, and Amazon has Cognito.

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.770
There are a lot of way for
you to manage this.

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.515
But since we've been rolling with Netlify,
we can just use Netlify's built-in

11
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.999
identity, because they've made it,
again, nice and straightforward.

12
00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.113
So we don't have to think really
hard about making it work.

13
00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:48.477
So the way that we're gonna
do that is we're gonna

14
00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:52.335
install an identity widget
that is just provided for us.

15
00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:59.032
And we do that by getting, We're gonna,

16
00:00:59.032 --> 00:01:03.777
yarn add react-netlify-identity-widget.

17
00:01:03.777 --> 00:01:08.925
And then we're gonna get
react-netlify-identity.

18
00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:13.488
And these are React wrappers
around Netlify Identity, so

19
00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:17.409
that we don't have to write
a bunch of OAuth code.

20
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.064
Because, again,
we're here to build features.

21
00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:21.357
We're not here to reinvent wheels.

22
00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:25.128
So this stuff has already been done for
us, so we may as well use it.

23
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:26.960
And then there are a couple
dependencies that we need.

24
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.647
So under the hood,
this uses Reach UI's dialogue box,

25
00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:39.789
Reach UI's tabs, and
the visually-hidden accessibility helper.

26
00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:40.843
So we can install these.

27
00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:51.988
And once these are installed,
we're gonna start up netlify dev again, so

28
00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:54.044
that we can see our work as we go.

29
00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:00.752
There we go.

30
00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:08.098
So to make this actually go,
to make this do the things that we want,

31
00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:12.627
we are going to, first, make sure
that we have access to the whole,

32
00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:17.400
there we go, that we have access
to the whole identity context.

33
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.400
And context is just a way in

34
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.160
React apps to make sure that
something is available globally.

35
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.523
You could, in vanilla JavaScript, maybe
you would attach this to global state, or

36
00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:30.912
in other frameworks they've got
ways to make things available.

37
00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:34.119
It's just putting it into the state
in a way that your app can access.

38
00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:40.287
So I'm going to import
the IdentityContextProvider

39
00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.503
from react-netlify-identity-widget.

40
00:02:45.503 --> 00:02:47.205
Make that wrap.

41
00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.796
And then I'm gonna use it by just putting,

42
00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:57.517
This whole thing around our app.

43
00:03:00.578 --> 00:03:02.552
So we use that IdentityContextProvider.

44
00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:06.564
And then the thing that we have to do to
make this fully function is we need to

45
00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:10.211
make it point to a working Netlify
site that has Identity enabled.

46
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.950
So we're gonna have to deploy
this app to get it running.

47
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.244
So let's pick a name for it.

48
00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:19.062
I'm gonna call it https,

49
00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:23.230
we'll say fem-jamstack.

50
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.268
Or, sorry,
we'll call this jamstack-intro-, auth.

51
00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:35.141
And then it's gonna be at Netlify,
so we'll save that.

52
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:40.481
And then I'm just gonna go ahead and
create a new repo.

53
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.266
So we're gonna be using
the hub tools again.

54
00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:46.014
I'm gonna do git init
to get us a repo here.

55
00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:48.933
And I'm going to, git create.

56
00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:54.769
And we are gonna call
this jamstack-intro-auth.

57
00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:01.742
Okay, and we can check the status.

58
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:02.920
Okay, that looks right.

59
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.922
I'm going to add everything,
git commit, good.

60
00:04:12.848 --> 00:04:14.763
And then I can push this.

61
00:04:16.843 --> 00:04:19.706
I'm gonna set the origin, so I can just
write git push instead of having to write

62
00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:21.010
git push origin master every time.

63
00:04:24.203 --> 00:04:26.336
And then we want this
to be a Netlify site.

64
00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:29.050
So I've already got the Netlify CLI
installed from earlier, so

65
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.316
I'm gonna run netlify init.

66
00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:36.911
We're gonna create and configure a new
site, put it into my personal stuff,

67
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.318
jamstack-intro-auth.

68
00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:41.716
Okay, that's created.

69
00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:45.240
Our gatsby build command is yarn build.

70
00:04:47.073 --> 00:04:54.471
It's gonna deploy the public directory,
Okay,

71
00:04:54.471 --> 00:04:57.487
and then I have a command here
to actually see what's going on.

72
00:04:57.487 --> 00:04:59.454
So I'm just gonna run, netlify open.

73
00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.750
And that opens up the browser for
me, it takes me right in.

74
00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:11.182
And I wanna check here to make sure that
we actually defined that build command.

75
00:05:12.943 --> 00:05:16.883
We didn't, so
that's going to get us in trouble.

76
00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:20.172
So build is gonna be gatsby build.

77
00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:30.647
And I'll just commit that change.

78
00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:34.810
Call it add build command.

79
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:43.908
Push it up, and what we'll see is that
this will immediately pick up that change.

80
00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:49.699
And let's go back and
just cancel this other one, so

81
00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:55.123
that it doesn't,
You're done already, all right.

82
00:05:57.668 --> 00:06:01.210
So this one's gonna build, and it should
actually find our Gatsby command.

83
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.910
And we've already set up the redirects,

84
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.348
we've already set up
the client-side routing.

85
00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:08.312
So when this ships,
it actually should be functioning,

86
00:06:08.312 --> 00:06:10.856
we should be able to click
around our dashboard.

87
00:06:10.856 --> 00:06:13.374
Nothing will be authenticated yet,
but that's okay.

88
00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:14.147
We haven't gotten there.

89
00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:21.475
And yeah, this just kind of, again, points
to how much I like the jamstack workflow.

90
00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:24.773
It's like, okay,
if I had to stand up a server so

91
00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:29.761
that I could make sure that something
was accessible and then add some kind

92
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:34.040
of a text key to the domain name so
that I could verify my domain.

93
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.940
Which, I don't know if you've
ever done that for other services

94
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.435
where you have to validate ownership of
a domain first, but it's such a pain.

95
00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:43.979
So being able to just quickly say,
here, use this.

96
00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.984
It's really really, nice.

97
00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:49.804
And here, momentarily, here we go.

98
00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:51.044
We're running our gatsby build.
