00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.865
So this form is looking pretty bleak,
[LAUGH] right?

2
00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:08.230
Everything's shoved up against each other,
it's got some nice lines dividing it.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.394
Nice great looking controls, but
yeah, on the whole, pretty bleak.

4
00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:16.070
So, there's a million
ways to style a form.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.592
I'm sure many of you that are watching
this, both live and recorded later,

6
00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:26.870
have styled 10 million forms and
you will yet style 10 million more.

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.626
And I don't know if you're excited or
not excited about that,

8
00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.230
probably depends on your job
satisfaction to some degree.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.465
I'm not looking forward to styling any
more forms in my career despite the fact

10
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:37.920
that I will probably
be doing it next week.

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.286
The nice thing that Tailwind has,
it has a concept of a plugin.

12
00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:46.566
And so one of those plugins,
bless them, is forums.

13
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.005
That they just give you some
nice default looking forums.

14
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.535
So I'm gonna show you how to install and
use a plugin for Tailwind.

15
00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:00.829
So head back over to your page here.

16
00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.333
Let's go ahead and stop our parcel and

17
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.289
I want you to npm install -D

18
00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.148
@tailwindcss/forms@0.2.1.

19
00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:20.668
This will get you a nice
Tailwind CSS plugin for like,

20
00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:24.900
just really nice default
looking form controls.

21
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.180
&gt;&gt; Why are you use -D to install it?

22
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.460
&gt;&gt; Why did we use -D here?

23
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.086
This is a developer tool, so
it goes in the dev dependencies,

24
00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:36.610
not the production dependencies.

25
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.508
Yes, so if I look at my package.json,
there's the dependencies.

26
00:01:40.508 --> 00:01:44.253
These are the ones that actually
go out to my production, react,

27
00:01:44.253 --> 00:01:47.060
react-dom and react-router-dom.

28
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.552
And then you can see most of my things are
in the devDependencies, which is things I

29
00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:53.449
used to build the project but
don't actually go out to production.

30
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.450
That's what that is, cool.

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.412
Okay, so one of my favorite other plugins
that we're not gonna use today is

32
00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:06.290
something called aspect ratio.

33
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.194
So there's a Tailwind plugin for,
I want this to be 16 by 9 or

34
00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:11.756
I want this to be 1 by 2.

35
00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:16.824
And if you've ever had to keep images
consistent sizes or I've ever had to

36
00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:22.480
have YouTube videos remain constant in
aspect ratio, it's a blessing, right?

37
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.385
Because otherwise you're doing this like
weird padding bottom trick to do it.

38
00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:28.616
If you've never had to
do it then lucky you.

39
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:32.115
If you've ever had to do it,
you know exactly what I'm talking about.

40
00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:36.377
So anyway, we're not doing that one
today but just know that exists and

41
00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:38.405
that I'm so happy that it exists.

42
00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:41.911
So we installed our dependency.

43
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.363
We're gonna go in here to plugins and

44
00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:53.121
we're just gonna add
require@tailwindcss/forms.

45
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.633
So this is using common js here,
that's why it's using module exports and

46
00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:04.530
requires, just the way it works,
it's totally fine.

47
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.253
You could probably have
parcel build your config.

48
00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.587
I wouldn't suggest that.

49
00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.627
I suggest just doing it how
they tell you to do it.

50
00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:19.012
All right, so
now we have this new fancy plugin and

51
00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:24.926
we should be able to just start
back up our server, npm run dev.

52
00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:28.885
This is going to basically apply
a bunch of default styles to your

53
00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:31.465
forms without you having to do anything.

54
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:40.210
So now if I refresh this, you can see
these look a bit nicer now, right?

55
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.039
They have nice down arrows,
all that kinda stuff and

56
00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.910
then we'll style them a little bit
more to make them more appropriate.

57
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.570
But we got all this styling for
free from that Tailwind forms plugin.

58
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.220
If you go look at the the docs for it,

59
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.340
they actually have several different
kinds of styles that you can apply.

60
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.048
We're just gonna stick with
the default ones for now, but

61
00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:02.491
there are more in that plugin.

62
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.872
So I'm sure you can imagine you
can install entire like design

63
00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:08.876
systems with this.

64
00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:11.660
You can make your own plugin
that applies like the,

65
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.751
my company design styles and it just
comes all with it which is pretty cool.

66
00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:24.721
Okay, so
let's go to our inputs on SearchParams,

67
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:33.848
SearchParams and
these inputs and we just wanna

68
00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:40.655
put a class name of width 60 just
to give them some nice width.

69
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:45.086
So all the selects, I'm gonna go do that
as well as the input up here as well,

70
00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:47.183
just so they're of uniform width.

71
00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:54.303
And there we go.

72
00:04:54.303 --> 00:04:57.348
Now if I save that and
come back over here,

73
00:04:57.348 --> 00:05:01.361
getting better by the minute,
still not quite there.

74
00:05:07.756 --> 00:05:16.041
I think the other thing that we should
do here, Probably gives these some.

75
00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:22.671
I think I missed a class here.

76
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:24.723
There's supposed to be some
spacing between these.

77
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.768
On the forum pb, mb rounded, background
gray, shadow flex, flex justice.

78
00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.436
Well, something we can always do here
is like margin 10 or margin bottom 10.

79
00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:02.351
Maybe some margin top two, so maybe just
instead of mb, we can just put my, right.

80
00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:03.291
So my 10.

81
00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:12.811
Maybe a little too spacious but.

82
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.400
There you go, there's some more
spacing there on that as well.
