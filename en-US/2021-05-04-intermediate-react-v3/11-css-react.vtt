1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.765
Let's go talk about CSS.

2
00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:07.250
So we're gonna go back to our project
page now, we just did the Hooks in Depth.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.767
And now we're gonna get into something
that I'm actually pretty excited to tell

4
00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.090
you about, which is TailwindCSS.

5
00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:22.663
Let's wax poetic about the history
of CSS and React together.

6
00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:23.910
It has been a journey.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.942
In just this course, in the course
of teaching six versions of various

8
00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:33.654
React courses here with Frontend Masters,
I have taught no CSS.

9
00:00:33.654 --> 00:00:39.300
I've taught styled-components, I've taught
CSS modules, and I've taught Emotion.

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.030
And now I'm about to
teach you TailwindCSS.

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.679
That is to say,
there's many ways to skin this cat.

12
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.143
[LAUGH] And today I chose
this one because this is kind

13
00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:53.860
of the direction I see a lot
of React developers going.

14
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.648
And the other thing is that Emotion really
hasn't updated a whole lot since I last

15
00:00:57.648 --> 00:00:59.030
taught this course.

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.681
So if you want to learn about emotion-js,
just check out intermediate React V2, and

17
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.610
all that stuff is very current.

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.540
So you can still check out
Emotion if you'd like to.

19
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.230
What do I think about CSS and JavaScript?

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.031
I don't really think about it.

21
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:21.808
Kind of to answer that, I think there
are benefits, I think there are downfalls.

22
00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:24.703
And I'm fine if I go on to a project,
they're using styled components and

23
00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:27.330
it's there,
I will happily keep using that.

24
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.474
If I start a project myself today,
I'm probably just gonna use normal CSS cuz

25
00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:34.879
that's what I'm used to, and
I've done it for so many years.

26
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:39.050
But honestly,
I'm really drawn into Tailwind.

27
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.170
I did a lot of research into
Tailwind to teach this course, and

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.843
I'm pretty enthused about it,
I was able to get a lot done very quickly.

29
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:49.060
So the thing I'll say about
Tailwind CSS is that,

30
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.517
one, this isn't really tied
to React all that much.

31
00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:56.801
Everything I'm about to tell you,
you could probably lift and shift this

32
00:01:56.801 --> 00:02:01.730
to Angular or Ember or just plain HTML and
CSS, so that's one benefit of it.

33
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.896
There's a bit of a starting tax, and

34
00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:09.697
mentally to kinda get up to
speed of how Tailwind works,

35
00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:14.512
because it's very different
from writing normal CSS.

36
00:02:14.512 --> 00:02:16.630
But once you've done it,
I think you can go really fast with it.

37
00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.446
So the thing to say about
styled components and

38
00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:23.910
Emotion is they have run times, right?

39
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.405
So they have something that executes
in JavaScript with your React app,

40
00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:31.220
which incurs some overhead, right?

41
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.615
Even Emotion, which is very fast and
style components don't matter.

42
00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:38.050
They're very fast, they're very small,
there's still something, right?

43
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.378
They're still two or three kilobytes,
they still have JavaScript execution cost,

44
00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:45.902
which can get hung up by the main thread.

45
00:02:45.902 --> 00:02:47.687
You still have to worry about
performance with your CSS.

46
00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:53.360
There's just a little bit of overhead
which is not zero overhead, right?

47
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.020
Tailwind has no execution layer,
it is just a style sheet.

48
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.687
So that is a benefit, right?

49
00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:04.573
You've offloaded everything to the CSS
rendering engine, which is very,

50
00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:07.731
very fast and very performant,
and has been rendering CSS for

51
00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:10.355
a lot longer than most of
us have been writing code.

52
00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:11.808
I'm not gonna say all of us,
but at least me,

53
00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:13.817
it's been doing it a lot longer
than I've been writing code.

54
00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:20.386
So with that in mind, all you have to do
with TailwindCSS is you don't have to

55
00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:23.450
import any JavaScript or
anything like that.

56
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.910
You're just gonna add CSS classes,
that's it.

57
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.040
It's just adding CSS classes to get things
to look the way that you want them.

58
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.652
So you and I are going to re-skin
the entire adopt me pet app from

59
00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:41.246
the Complete Intro to React V6
with just writing classes, and

60
00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:43.690
not writing any CSS whatsoever.

61
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.275
We're actually going to
delete the style-sheet.

62
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.075
So this will be fun or
it'll be terrible, and

63
00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:52.790
it's up to you to decide
how you feel about it.

64
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.607
This is a highly opinionated thing,
and you might hate it, and

65
00:03:55.607 --> 00:03:56.680
that's totally okay.

66
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.600
But I want you to understand why you
hate it or love it for that matter.

67
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.270
So I want you to come here, and
I want you to just copy and paste this.

68
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.257
Well, first of all, we're gonna be
doing it with the project that we built

69
00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:14.406
in Complete Intro to React V6.

70
00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:17.184
So you can see here, I have a copy of it,

71
00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:20.910
this is literally that 12 portals and
refs.

72
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.030
If you look at the project here,
let's just open it, so you can see it.

73
00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:32.218
There it is.
Starting from this one here, portals and

74
00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:35.840
refs, so I just have a clean copy of this.

75
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.505
I'm gonna run bpm install
like the rest of you, and

76
00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:39.230
then we're gonna install
some more dependencies.

77
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.268
We're gonna start getting
into the project.

78
00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:46.123
So I've done that here,
that's exactly what this project is.

79
00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:50.215
Just a bit of a code tour for
you, there's babel,

80
00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:55.090
there's eslint, there's prettier,
there's parcel,

81
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.409
we're using parcel as the bundler here,
react, react-dom and react-router-dom.

82
00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.970
Pretty bare bones React
project in that respect.

83
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.659
There's prettier, eslint, babel,

84
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.047
modify some of these here in just a
second, and then several React files here.

85
00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:19.668
So I'm gonna go ahead and run npm install.

86
00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:23.732
It's gonna install all of
our dependencies here.

87
00:05:23.732 --> 00:05:31.313
It'll take a second cuz parcel in
particular has a lot of dependencies.

88
00:05:31.313 --> 00:05:34.692
We are using parcel 1.12.3,

89
00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:39.430
which does have some
critical vulnerabilities.

90
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.540
So just be aware that you can
expect to see these, it's fine.

91
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.620
We're not sending this out to production,
it's not a big deal.

92
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.089
That's just the last version
that worked with this course.

93
00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.021
By the time that you see this, there might
be a newer version that might work better.

94
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:59.936
But for now let's just stick to 1.12.3,
I know it works with that version, okay?

95
00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:04.988
So if you look here in your package.json,
you have several scripts that we can run.

96
00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:07.472
The one that we're gonna run
right now is this one dev,

97
00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:09.375
that's gonna start out our dev process.

98
00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:15.575
So we're gonna do npm run dev, and
that's gonna build our project.

99
00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:20.662
It's gonna run a local host server for
us on 1, 2, 3, 4.

100
00:06:22.525 --> 00:06:23.806
So you can see here, this is our project.

101
00:06:23.806 --> 00:06:30.720
It's got a location, we can search for
dogs only, or let's look for rabbits.

102
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.688
You can see here, it'll switch what
breeds are coming in via an API,

103
00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.640
always looked just to dogs.

104
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.190
There's a theme selector which
changes all the buttons on the site.

105
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.490
That's kind of the tour of the website.

106
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.807
This is my puppy, Luna, she's adorable.

107
00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:54.832
Okay, so
we're gonna be working with TailwindCSS.

108
00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:57.186
And like I was alluding to earlier,

109
00:06:57.186 --> 00:07:00.650
we're not gonna actually
write any CSS ourselves.

110
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.400
We're just going to be adding CSS
classes to various different components.

111
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.649
And that's going to style our application
for us without writing any CSS.

112
00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:12.730
This might feel a little weird and gross
to some of you, but just stick with me.

113
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.183
And once you kinda get over
that initial hump of [SOUND],

114
00:07:16.183 --> 00:07:19.048
then hopefully we get
to the point of mm-hm.

115
00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:21.523
I don't know, that's what I'm going for

116
00:07:21.523 --> 00:07:25.260
here is that trajectory from
gross to maybe this is okay.

117
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.703
We'll see how much I succeed.
