1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.630
Our project is built, it's ready to go.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.198
Let's go ahead and
stop it just here for a second.

3
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.744
And we're gonna run a bunch of installs,
and I'm just gonna copy and

4
00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:10.800
paste it out of here.

5
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.390
We're gonna run all of
these installs right here.

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.909
Let's talk about them for just a second.

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.590
The first one is postcss here.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.560
Under the hood, Parcel has already
been using postcss this entire time,

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.570
you just didn't know it.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.970
This is the part or

11
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.970
the the tool that transpiles your
futuristic CSS into older CSS.

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.449
It's just like Babble but for
CSS, it's a transpiler for CSS.

13
00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.557
The part that actually does the
transpilation from futuristic to old CSS

14
00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:47.050
is called autoprefixer.

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.575
This is going to go and automatically,
if you're trying to support IE 11,

16
00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:56.727
it'll transpile your gradients to those
old style Internet Explorer 11 gradients,

17
00:00:56.727 --> 00:00:57.231
right?

18
00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:00.100
It does those kind of translations for
you.

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.560
And then we're gonna install Tailwind CSS.

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.811
And we do this fancy aliasing, but
it's basically going to make this package,

21
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.487
which is a compatibility layer
between old postcss 7 and

22
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:15.920
the new postcss 8 that
Tailwind 2 requires.

23
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.430
So this is just an alias of that package.

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.360
They do this so that you can
use it with Parcel, basically.

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.965
And then we're gonna reinstall it again,
just so

26
00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:27.020
we can get the command line interface.

27
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.830
That's why we're installing it twice.

28
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.050
Don't worry,
it's only gonna install the package once.

29
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.874
So just copy all of that so
you don't have to type out all of it.

30
00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:38.870
And we're going to paste that.

31
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.988
As soon as we have post or Parcel 2,
this compatibility layer will not

32
00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:49.980
be necessary anymore,
because Parcel 2 has postcss 8 in it.

33
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.651
So just be aware of that.

34
00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:58.010
So we'll load all these or
install these dependencies.

35
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.317
So kinda to just show you here,
anytime that we say require tailwindcss,

36
00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:08.860
we're just gonna get this package instead.

37
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.046
That's what that alias thing means.

38
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.651
Probably don't need to know that,
I rarely have to use it, but

39
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:15.892
it's a useful thing to know.

40
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:27.490
Okay, and then the next thing that we
wanna do here is npx tailwindcss init.

41
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.623
So what this does is this will go
into our Node modules directory.

42
00:02:32.623 --> 00:02:36.289
And inside of your Node modules directory,
this is a .bin folder.

43
00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.710
And inside of that .bin folder,

44
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.250
there's a bunch of available binaries
that your packages install for you.

45
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.896
So one we can see here is eslint,
it has its own binary that you can run.

46
00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:52.660
So if I said npx eslint,
it would run this eslint, right?

47
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.690
That's the connection
I'm trying to draw here.

48
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.790
One of them you'll see
down here is tailwindcss.

49
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.232
We can do npx tailwindcss then commands,
right?

50
00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:04.390
So that's what we're gonna do right
here is we're gonna tailwindcss,

51
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.599
it's gonna run this binary, and
then we're gonna run the init command,

52
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.080
which is going to generate a config for
us.

53
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.300
If you've ever done TypeScript and
npx tsc init, it's a similar idea.

54
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.404
So you should see here
Created Tailwind config.

55
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.722
And now if we go back to
our File Explorer here,

56
00:03:26.722 --> 00:03:32.092
out of this you'll see that we
have this tailwind.config.js.

57
00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:35.104
That should look something like that,

58
00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:40.777
very bare bones of just here's a bare
bones Tailwind project ready to go.

59
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:45.760
Okay, good so far?

60
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.400
Now we have a base level config here.

61
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.151
We haven't done anything with it,
but it exists.

62
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:55.087
The next thing that I want you to do is I
want you to go into your source directory

63
00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:56.499
and go to your style.css.

64
00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.780
And just Cmd+A delete, all of it.

65
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.590
So all that CSS is gonna be gone.

66
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.374
And I want you to go
put in @tailwind base,

67
00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:17.438
@tailwind components,

68
00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:22.980
and @tailwind utilities.

69
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.538
Now if you're on VS Code like me,

70
00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:28.112
I imagine many of you are seeing some
underlines underneath this tailwind.

71
00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:31.130
And you would probably like
to make it go away, right?

72
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.345
I imagine many of you are like
me don't like underlines,

73
00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:36.690
that tells me something's wrong,
and something's not wrong here.

74
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.199
So again,
this is just if you're in VS Code,

75
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.472
Cmd comma or
Ctrl comma to go to Settings and

76
00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:49.764
search for css.lint.unknown at rules.

77
00:04:49.764 --> 00:04:53.727
Yours is probably on warning and
just change it to ignore.

78
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.606
And then you should be able
to go back over here and

79
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.850
see these are not underlined anymore.

80
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.199
Basically, your built in bare level
CSS linter is just saying hey,

81
00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.802
I don't know what tailwind is.

82
00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:10.384
I'm gonna make sure that
you know what tailwind is.

83
00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:11.361
And we're just telling it,
please stop telling me.

84
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:14.420
Don't talk to me,
I don't wanna talk to you anymore, right?

85
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.440
That's kinda what we're doing there.

86
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.150
So what is this?

87
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.893
These are directives that come
in from Tailwind that bring

88
00:05:22.893 --> 00:05:27.553
in a bunch of base classes and
components and utilities.

89
00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:32.509
That now we have these new augmented
Tailwind CSS capabilities,

90
00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:38.193
that that plugin that we installed in for
postcss is going to use for us.

91
00:05:38.193 --> 00:05:41.440
Another thing that I'm just gonna have you
install here, again, if you're on VS Code.

92
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.598
Go into your extensions,
search for tailwind, and

93
00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:48.270
there's one called
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.

94
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.457
This just makes it super easy,

95
00:05:49.457 --> 00:05:52.070
it's going to make suggestions
when you're writing class names.

96
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.942
It's like, hey, this looks like this
thing that you're trying to type,,

97
00:05:54.942 --> 00:05:57.880
I'm going to suggest that
you keep typing it this way.

98
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.548
It's very, very convenient, especially
if you're writing a lot of Tailwind.

99
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.020
Okay, so now we have Tailwind,
it's all set up and should be ready to go.

100
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:14.521
And we can go ahead and
get started here writing some Tailwind.

101
00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:19.060
So the first thing is let's delete this.

102
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:27.770
You might need to stop and start your,
Your dev server from Parcel.

103
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.965
So let's just go ahead and do that.

104
00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:31.660
Mine wasn't running, but if you are still
running it, just go ahead and stop it and

105
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.211
start it again.

106
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.464
Anytime you make any configuration
changes to Parcel, like Babble changes or

107
00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:44.989
postcss changes, just a good
idea in general to go ahead and

108
00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:48.530
just change it or
to stop it and start it again.

109
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:52.990
Okay, so that should start up again.

110
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.140
And if you should go look at your
application, it will look beautiful.

111
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.640
Just stunning, gorgeous unstyled HTML.

112
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.215
You can see here I was very diligent
in getting the same image size every

113
00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:07.790
single time.

114
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.273
But look at that dog, she's so cute, okay.

115
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.501
So the first thing I'm gonna say here is,

116
00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:20.000
there's a bunch of old
class names in our project.

117
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.375
So if we go look at like app.css or
js or something like that,

118
00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.774
you can see a bunch of
these are gonna have.

119
00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:28.210
Well, this one doesn't, but
let's look at maybe details.

120
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.780
These have class names in them already
from the previous course, right?

121
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.343
From styling the previous course,
like this one.

122
00:07:38.343 --> 00:07:41.243
You can leave them, you can delete them,
they're not gonna make any effect

123
00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:43.437
now because we're not using
those class names anymore.

124
00:07:43.437 --> 00:07:46.542
But if you see me leave them
somewhere it doesn't matter.

125
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.847
Okay, So let's go to app.js.

126
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.552
Inside of app.js, we have this div right
here and we wanna add some styling to it.

127
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.430
So in this particular case, we would like
to make it have 0 padding and 0 margin.

128
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.989
So how do we do that with Tailwind?

129
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.353
Well, what we're gonna do,
Is we're gonna add a class name here.

130
00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:27.042
className =, we want it to have 0 padding,

131
00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:32.610
so we're gonna put p-0, pretty simple.

132
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.820
We want 0 margin, so we're gonna say m-,
maybe you could guess.

133
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.593
Yeah, 0, we're gonna have m-0.

134
00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:45.700
So this is what signifies to Tailwind I
want 0 padding and I want 0 margin.

135
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.500
What if I wanted a little padding?

136
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.940
1, what if I wanted a bit more?

137
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.964
9, right?

138
00:08:53.964 --> 00:08:55.510
There's just numbers there.

139
00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.445
It goes from 1 to 12 and
then it starts kind of skipping around,

140
00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:05.287
it goes 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40,

141
00:09:05.287 --> 00:09:09.450
all the way up to 96 is
the highest number that it has.

142
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.170
And so what's cool about that
is that's a lot of class names.

143
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.740
But what Tailwind actually does for
you is it just goes in detects,

144
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.413
you only used p-0 and p-8.

145
00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:22.719
And I'm only going to include those
classes, then it leaves out the rest of

146
00:09:22.719 --> 00:09:25.566
the classes automatically based
on the build process, right?

147
00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:28.970
It kind of like tree shakes your styles,
which is neat, right?

148
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.473
Then you get the minimum viable CSS,

149
00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:36.420
which is to say that your Tailwind CSS
files are going to be microscopic.

150
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.644
They're gonna be absolutely tiny,

151
00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:40.180
it's gonna be the bare minimum styles
you need to accomplish what you need.

152
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.809
Your trade-off here is that your class
names here are going to get very long,

153
00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:47.690
[LAUGH] right?

154
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.100
Cuz if you wanna apply a lot of
styles like sometimes you do in CSS,

155
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.120
they can tend to get pretty long.

156
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.587
So this is the trade-off
that you're making here.

157
00:09:57.587 --> 00:10:02.750
Okay, so p-0, m-0, I'm good with that.

158
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.750
What if I wanna give
it a background image?

159
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.160
There's no class that I can give it.

160
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.670
So here I have to actually
use a style directly.

161
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.090
Cuz there's no fancy way of doing a class
name that brings in a URL, right?

162
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.910
Does that make any sense?

163
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.111
So some of these things, we do have
to actually go into the style tag and

164
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.160
give it a background.

165
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.470
So we wanna give it a style
equals double curly braces there.

166
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:34.221
And you wanna give it a background of url.

167
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:37.823
And then here we're gonna put a URL of
what we actually want that background

168
00:10:37.823 --> 00:10:38.461
image to be.

169
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:41.413
So it's gonna

170
00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:50.628
be
http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/wall-

171
00:10:50.628 --> 00:10:55.934
paper.

172
00:10:55.934 --> 00:10:58.750
And then here, you can put A,
B, or C, I'm gonna do A.

173
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:05.672
And the original one is B, and
there's also a C as well, up to you.

174
00:11:08.328 --> 00:11:10.231
All right, so I'm gonna save that now.

175
00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:14.805
And let's go take a look
at our application.

176
00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:20.063
So we have a nice little background now.

177
00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:25.120
And if we look at this Inspect Element

178
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.048
on the background, on the p here.

179
00:11:30.048 --> 00:11:31.190
You know what I forgot to do?

180
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.668
I forgot to make the postcss config,
that's what it is.

181
00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:40.460
So right now, postcss doesn't know that
it's supposed to be picking up the config.

182
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.693
So let's do that.

183
00:11:41.693 --> 00:11:45.604
We're gonna make a new file here and
it's gonna be in the current, or

184
00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:49.140
sorry, the root directory of your project.

185
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.198
Call it .postcssrc.

186
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:59.620
So in your postcssrc,
you need to have an object

187
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:05.763
here that's gonna have
a plugins top level item here.

188
00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:07.470
And then here gonna have an autoprefixer.

189
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.529
And we don't have any configuration for
autoprefixer, if you did,

190
00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:11.910
this is where you would put it.

191
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.837
And then for tailwindcss, same thing.

192
00:12:14.837 --> 00:12:18.839
We need postcss to know this exists,
so go look for it,

193
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.103
cuz I won't use it until then.

194
00:12:21.103 --> 00:12:23.980
But at that point, it'll have all
this stuff and it can do that.

195
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.977
So let's go ahead and stop and
start our server again.

196
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:33.633
Now we can come back over to Adopt Me.

197
00:12:35.575 --> 00:12:38.980
And let's go back to the homepage here.

198
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.549
And if we Inspect Element here,

199
00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:50.430
And we look at the top one here, p-0, m-0.

200
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:55.550
There we go, finally.

201
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.110
So let's recap the steps
that we took there.

202
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.960
Cuz some of you might be kind of caught
in that loop that I got caught in myself.

203
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.173
Create a postcssrc file.

204
00:13:08.173 --> 00:13:10.941
In there you need to put this,
right, where it has the plugins,

205
00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:12.235
the two things that you need.

206
00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:16.253
The autoprefixer,
cuz we still want it to prefix old CSS or

207
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:19.110
new CSS for us for old browsers.

208
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.515
And then tailwindcss.

209
00:13:21.515 --> 00:13:22.022
And again,

210
00:13:22.022 --> 00:13:25.430
these are gonna be empty objects,
cuz we're not gonna configure them, okay?

211
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.382
Then what I need you to do is I need
you to stop your Parcel server.

212
00:13:32.052 --> 00:13:34.358
Or you can actually even do it here,
let's just do it from here so

213
00:13:34.358 --> 00:13:35.490
you can see what it looks like.

214
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.815
So stop your Parcel server.

215
00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:44.633
Delete the .cache directory,
delete the dist directory.

216
00:13:44.633 --> 00:13:48.053
And then go ahead and
say npm run dev again.

217
00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:51.820
This will take a while to start up, cuz
it's got a lot of stuff to get through.

218
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.763
So it might take you 10, 15 seconds.

219
00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:01.680
But once you get there,
then you should end up with this.

220
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.380
So now if I inspect the element here and
I look at this p-0,

221
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.770
m-0, you can see the p-0 is bringing
in a 0 padding and a 0 margin.

222
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.051
You also notice that
the typography will change, right?

223
00:14:13.051 --> 00:14:17.197
It'll go from that default weird looking
Times New Roman stuff to something

224
00:14:17.197 --> 00:14:18.760
a little bit more pleasant.

225
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.400
It's probably something sans serif there.

226
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.544
There you go, ui-sans-serif is what it is.

227
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.048
So let's just go through all
the steps that we make sure that we.

228
00:14:30.048 --> 00:14:33.962
The first thing you need to do with
run all of these npm installs, right?

229
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.868
Then you should've done
the npx tailwindcss init,

230
00:14:39.868 --> 00:14:44.391
which will generate
a tailwind.config.js file for you here.

231
00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:49.170
That tailwind.config.js file, we didn't
touch, should just look exactly like that.

232
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:53.605
Once you have that, you should change
your style.css file to look like this,

233
00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:57.384
tailwind base, tailwind components,
and tailwind utilities.

234
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.413
These are some VS Code things,
you don't need to do that necessarily.

235
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:10.043
Okay, and then here we just added, I mean,

236
00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:13.200
we just changed out that div
at the top of app.js, right?

237
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.800
This one here, Just changed that.

238
00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:25.607
Okay, and I think that's all I've done.

239
00:15:27.415 --> 00:15:30.915
The question I might have for you is,
what version of Node are you using?

240
00:15:33.152 --> 00:15:37.627
So if you do node -v,
I'm getting 14.9 at the moment

241
00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:38.527
&gt;&gt; I have 14.15

242
00:15:38.527 --> 00:15:40.461
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that should be fine.

243
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:45.935
&gt;&gt; I'm 14.15 as well, which I believe
is the latest stable version.

244
00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:48.633
&gt;&gt; So I would say delete your .cache,
delete your dist,

245
00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:52.179
delete your Node modules, and
then reinstall everything again.

246
00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:56.349
So do npm install again, and
then run npm run dev again after that.
