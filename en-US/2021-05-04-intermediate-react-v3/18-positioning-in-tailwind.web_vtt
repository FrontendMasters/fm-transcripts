00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.286
Let's go into some positioning and
then we'll wrap up here with Tailwind.

2
00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:09.780
So our pups have these little
name tags underneath them, right.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.733
So Luna, so on and so forth.

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.050
It'd be nice if we could put a little
name tag here on the bottom right so

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.590
it's not just floating underneath,
it'd be a lot easier to read, right.

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.364
So let's open pet.js.

7
00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:26.385
And here we're gonna make
a position relative, right,

8
00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:32.612
cuz we wanna position everything inside
of it relative to the enclosing a tag.

9
00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:37.604
And we'll make that position or
a block, right, so

10
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.676
it's gonna be a display block.

11
00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:45.081
Then here this little info thing,
we're gonna remove that.

12
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:47.871
You can remove this one up here altogether
if you want for the image container.

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.126
And here we're gonna say its position
absolute, it's gonna be bottom-0 left-0.

14
00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:03.213
We're gonna have a nice
bg-gradient-to-top right,

15
00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:07.406
so tr, from-white to-tansparent.

16
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.609
And then we're gonna have a nice pr-2 and

17
00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.837
a nice pt-2 just to get to extend out our
little gradient a little bit further.

18
00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:22.480
So position absolute, which means that

19
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.880
this div is going to position
absolutely within this relative block.

20
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.423
That's why we have to have
the relative up here, right.

21
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:34.030
We want it to be on the bottom
left of this relative block.

22
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.875
We wanna have the background gradient,
so it's gonna start from white and

23
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:41.724
then it's gonna taper off into
a transparent with a little bit of

24
00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:43.330
padding on the top and on the right.

25
00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.555
And now we get these nice little
name tags here at the bottom,

26
00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:51.276
which makes this a lot easier to read.

27
00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:57.680
And again, how quickly we
were able to prototype that,

28
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.350
that took me literally 30
seconds to knock that out.

29
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.370
And when I was writing it myself,
I was just able to do it.

30
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.828
Don't applause me, applaud Tailwind
people, they've done a great job.

31
00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:13.486
&gt;&gt; Let's you have used padding
throughout the app for

32
00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:18.042
whatever, for
let's the top ten in a component.

33
00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:22.169
And let's say you want to
change it to something else.

34
00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:29.411
Is it possible to have named variables so
that when we say B2,

35
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:34.442
it means whatever two
means to us in my app?

36
00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:36.250
If that question makes sense.

37
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so basically can you define the
values that get output by the padding to

38
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.090
and the end to click?

39
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.530
Basically can you define your own rhythm?

40
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.197
And the answer is yes,
you do it all through the theming.

41
00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:48.297
&gt;&gt; Okay cool, thanks.

42
00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:52.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so the one thing, again,
I didn't do here, so if you click on Luna,

43
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.969
we didn't obviously tackle this one.

44
00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.700
I'm gonna leave that to you, cuz I think
that would be a fun exercise for you.

45
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.250
What do I do with these pictures and
how do I prototype that?

46
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.188
I think this would be
a nice little way for

47
00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:06.754
you to kind of cap off your
Tailwind experience here.

48
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.483
Okay, so if you go back to our project
here, what the state of the project is

49
00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:19.300
now is what you actually have
here in the Tailwind directory.

50
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.358
So if you wanna go catch up or
look at what I did differently than you,

51
00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:25.435
that's the state of the repo now.

52
00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:28.770
And that is the end of my
little tutorial on Tailwind.

53
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.334
So hopefully that was enjoyable to you,

54
00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:33.275
at least it shows you a different
current way of working on things.

55
00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:38.355
I'm a fan, I use it when I'm not
necessarily wanting to write a lot of CSS.

56
00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:42.885
If I was starting a brand new big
project at Microsoft I might use it.

57
00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:48.755
I actually quite like it and it enforces
some high quality CSS standards.

58
00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:52.654
The only thing that you have to trade off
here of my biggest downfall is these get

59
00:03:52.654 --> 00:03:56.930
so long, right, and I get so
sick of looking at such long class names.

60
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.670
So that's kind of the downfall from it,
but

61
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.890
everything else I really like about it.

62
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.592
The other thing I'll throw out there
is Tailwind is made by a company called

63
00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:07.790
Tailwind Labs.

64
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.173
And they actually have a paid offering as
well that has like a bunch of higher order

65
00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:14.366
components, like a checkout process or

66
00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:18.010
a blog post or articles,
these bigger compositional things.

67
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.920
So definitely give that a look as well.

68
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.970
You can save yourself a lot of
time by using some of their stuff.
