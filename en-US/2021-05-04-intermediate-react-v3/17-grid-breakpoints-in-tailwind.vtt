00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.987
So what I wanna do now is I have all
these images with nice pictures and

2
00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:05.234
all that kind of stuff.

3
00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:07.522
I'd like to make a nice grid.

4
00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:11.965
So let's see how we would do
that really quick on results.js.

5
00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:15.893
So head to results.js, and
here instead of search,

6
00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:21.131
what I'm gonna put is instead of
search I'm going to put grid gap-4,

7
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:25.696
for like nice gutters between
them like nice little spacing.

8
00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:29.231
And grid-cols-2.

9
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:35.335
And this might blow your mind,
but I'm just gonna save that.

10
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.079
And I'm gonna hop back over here.

11
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.714
And then all of a sudden,
everything is in a nice looking grid.

12
00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:46.561
And that's really how easy it was.

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.768
Now that's just the magic of CSS grids,
right?

14
00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:52.016
That's really doing
the heavy lifting here.

15
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:58.121
But getting this into the correct mode
was, as you saw, very, very simple to do.

16
00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.077
Now you can see here, unfortunately,

17
00:01:00.077 --> 00:01:03.047
my picture of Luna here is not
big enough on a bigger screen.

18
00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:07.376
And you know there's some users
like me that browse at full screen.

19
00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:12.923
So it'd be nice if we should have at large
screens, this should be three, right?

20
00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:15.729
So I think what we can do is we
can just come back over here.

21
00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.969
And we can say, hey, at large screens,
just do lg:grid-cols-3.

22
00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:31.653
And now, At a larger screen, it's three.

23
00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:35.258
But if I make it smaller,
it's gonna pop in two.

24
00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:45.390
And hey, I mean, while we're at it,
let's just make this grid-cols-1.

25
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.640
So that at the smallest sizes,
it'll be on one.

26
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.652
And then we can say everything
after the small break point,

27
00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:55.830
which I think by default is 640 pixels.

28
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.769
Which, by the way,
these are all adjustable via the theme.

29
00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:06.764
I'm gonna say at the small,
we're going to do grid-cols-2.

30
00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:10.590
And then everything after
the large will be grid-cols-3.

31
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.111
So now they come in here, two.

32
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:18.468
And then again it'll pop to one.

33
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:23.545
Pretty slick, right?

34
00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.676
This used to be so hard to do.

35
00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:31.640
I don't know if many of you have
been in the web development industry

36
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.420
as long as I have.

37
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.399
But when I was doing this at Reddit, this
took me hours and hours of messing with

38
00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:40.642
the breakpoints, messing with the widths
and the floats, and that kind of stuff.

39
00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:44.750
It was just a tremendous pain.

40
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.789
And now that we have grid,
this just becomes unbelievably easy.

41
00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.983
Flexbox was a huge step in
the right direction, and

42
00:02:51.983 --> 00:02:55.486
then grid was a huge step
further to get the right spots.

43
00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:58.930
So there's more stuff on that
kind of CSS advanced usage.

44
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.796
So definitely check out the rest of
Frontend Masters' catalog on that.

45
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.295
From Jen, yeah, Jen's great.

46
00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:08.560
Yeah, definitely take that from Jen.

47
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.170
Okay any questions about break points?

48
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.712
I mean, what you saw here is more or
less what it is.

49
00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:22.236
You just put the name of the break
point before it, put the colon, and

50
00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:26.227
then whatever style you want to
apply with that break point.

51
00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:27.537
That's the whole thing.

52
00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:29.502
There's small, medium, large.

53
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:31.999
There's also XL and XXL.

54
00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.835
Those are all the break
points that ship by default.

55
00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:37.791
But you're welcome to define more of
those and call them whatever you want.

56
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:42.766
When I was at Reddit,
we used to call them tall, grande,

57
00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:47.132
venti, and trenta,
cuz of the Starbucks sizes.

58
00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:49.185
Yeah, go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Does the order matter?

59
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:49.800
&gt;&gt; No.

60
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.674
&gt;&gt; Of the class names?

61
00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:57.349
&gt;&gt; Well, it shouldn't, but it does.

62
00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.941
[LAUGH] In this particular case,
if I put small afterwards, no,

63
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.671
it doesn't, this doesn't matter.

64
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:07.430
This will work exactly the same way,

65
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.601
cuz these will get applied in
the same order, so it doesn't matter.

66
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:17.625
However, what might matter
if you do text-white,

67
00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:21.288
or what's a good one we could do here?

68
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:27.256
Well, let's just do it this way.

69
00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:33.399
If we do grid,
I'm gonna delete these for a second.

70
00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:37.458
If I have two exactly competing
class names, like grid-cols-1 and

71
00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:39.536
grid-cols-3, which one wins?

72
00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:40.338
Which one wins?

73
00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:42.172
It's the one that's lower
on the style sheet.

74
00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.354
And you don't know, right?

75
00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:45.608
You're not gonna know which one's
gonna come lower on the style sheet.

76
00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:48.791
So just make sure that you're only

77
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:53.081
applying one class of the class type,
right?

78
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:58.016
So, in my case, going back to results.

79
00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:01.305
The grid-cols-3 came lower on
the style sheet than grid-cols-1.

80
00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:04.094
So that one was always applied.

81
00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:07.186
This one, the grid-cols-3.

82
00:05:07.186 --> 00:05:08.646
But how am I supposed to know that?

83
00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:10.286
Or should I know that?

84
00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:12.107
You're not supposed to know that and
you should know.

85
00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:14.565
So just only apply one.

86
00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:16.347
In other words,
don't depend on that behavior.

87
00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:18.305
That would be a bad idea
to depend on that behavior.
