00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:04.174
That is the conclusion
of Intermediate React,

2
00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:07.890
that was a lot of material
coming right at you.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.383
So one, congratulations for
sticking around but

4
00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:13.888
after taking Intermediate React.

5
00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.916
I think you're well equipped to
go into the React universe and

6
00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.665
know what you like and
what you don't like about React.

7
00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.908
To know what tools you do and do not wanna
use like sometimes you might want to use

8
00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:25.037
Redux other times you wanna
leave that on the side.

9
00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:29.015
Do I wanna use TypeScript,
am I a big fan of what it offers me or

10
00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:32.220
was that a lot of burden for
things I don't like?

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.431
Should I use code splitting and
server side rendering,

12
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:36.320
I'm going to measure that and
figure that out.

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.860
Do I like tailwind or
do I want to go back and try a motion,

14
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.766
is that really interesting to me as well?

15
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:44.316
These are all kinds of questions
that I want you to answer for

16
00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.663
yourself, I have answers for myself.

17
00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.375
I didn't teach you all the tools that are
my favorite but I did teach you the tools.

18
00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.438
That I think are going to be the most
useful for you to make these decisions for

19
00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:54.086
yourself.

20
00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:59.180
So in any case, thank you for
sticking with me, thank you for listening.

21
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.552
If you liked the course definitely tweet
at me, I left you my Twitter stuff on

22
00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:06.258
there, if you haven't started this repo,
I definitely appreciate that as well.

23
00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:11.676
And yeah, thanks for coming, and
thanks for enjoying some React with me.
