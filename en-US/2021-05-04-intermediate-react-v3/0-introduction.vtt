00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.860
Welcome to Intermediate React V3.

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.450
I'm really excited to talk a bit more
about kinda the ecosystem around React.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.647
So let's go ahead and jump into the course
website if you would bit.ly/.react-6.

4
00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:16.648
This is the same website that
many of you were using for

5
00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:19.460
the Complete Intro to React Version 6.

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.819
If you go scroll partway
down through here,

7
00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:24.066
you'll see the Intermediate React v3.

8
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.130
And this is where
Intermediate React picks up.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.760
So go ahead and click on that welcome.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.900
We start chatting about
the structure of this course.

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.630
So, my name is Brian Holt.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.570
And I'm really excited to be here.

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.050
If you haven't, seen other one of my
courses, I have an intro page here.

14
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.451
So if you click that, that'll take you
back to the intro page here, where I kinda

15
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:50.870
talk a little bit about myself, and why I
teach this course and some of the things.

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.070
But, who is this course for?

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.780
This course is hopefully for you.

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.246
Right?
I would like you to learn

19
00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:58.590
more about React and for the ecosystem.

20
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.130
It does require that you
know some JavaScript,

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.559
probably that you're a little
familiar with the command line,

22
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.064
you'll have to know a lot,
you can readily follow along with me.

23
00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:11.872
And then hopefully you've taken
the complete intro to React V6, or

24
00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:16.338
at least you're very familiar with React,
because this part of the course is not

25
00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:19.180
gonna teach you the underlying
basic React parts.

26
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.019
It's just gonna teach you kinda
the more ecosystem things around React

27
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.560
that you should know.

28
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.103
The Complete Intro to React goes over
all the core library, the core API's,

29
00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:30.260
all those kinda things.

30
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.860
So if that's not familiar to yet,
you should hop back over there.

31
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.220
Take that one first and
then come back to this one.

32
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.570
This one's gonna go over more like,
how do I do CSS?

33
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.910
How do I do testing?

34
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.916
We go into hooks in depth and
a bunch of other really cool stuff.

35
00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:48.230
So who am I?

36
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.230
I work at Microsoft.

37
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.715
I'm a program manager
on Visual Studio code,

38
00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:55.849
as well as the JavaScript
developer experience on Azure.

39
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.083
I've worked at Netflix, I've worked at
Reddit, I've worked at LinkedIn, and

40
00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.267
a couple other startups.

41
00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:08.120
And I've been writing React for
a good seven plus years now.

42
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.020
So suffice to say I'm pretty
familiar with the library.

43
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.457
And I crafted this course because I wanted
you to have kinda exposures to kinda

44
00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:21.070
every different piece of the ecosystem,
so you can make informed choices.

45
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.555
So for example,
we're gonna talk about Tailwind CSS and

46
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:27.128
I don't necessarily want to encourage you
that you must choose Tailwind CSS, but

47
00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:28.710
I want you to understand what it is.

48
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.510
So you can make a trade off about like,
should I use Tailwind?

49
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.627
Should I use emotion?

50
00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:34.501
Should I use styled components?

51
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:35.930
Things like that.

52
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.942
I wanna kinda have like an entry point
into every one of these pieces of

53
00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:44.853
the ecosystem, cuz I think that allows you
to make informed decisions about what you

54
00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:47.783
wanna do when you're
writing your application.

55
00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:50.333
This course has been tested on Mac OS and
Windows 10.

56
00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.340
So it should just work out of the box.

57
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.596
By extension working on Mac,

58
00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:56.370
I assume it works on Linux,
I haven't had any problems that way.

59
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.560
Some things that you will definitely
need to do before you get started.

60
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.698
You need to install Node.js,
please be on version 12 or above.

61
00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:10.570
There's some setup instructions here
in to the welcome introduction part.

62
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.020
I'm gonna encourage you to
install Visual Studio Code.

63
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.971
Obviously, I work on Visual Studio Code,
so that's a conflict of interest there.

64
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:22.377
But what I will say is that I'm gonna
teach you some cool short cuts and

65
00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:25.845
extensions and stuff like that with
Visual Studio Code along the way,

66
00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:27.170
specifically for React.

67
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.990
And just to let people know
I use dank models I font.

68
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.016
You can enable ligatures if you go here,
I have this little link there for

69
00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:38.788
you, which is like if I have
like an equal signs and

70
00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:41.437
angle bracket will combine
them into an arrow.

71
00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:45.780
Dank Mono is not free whereas Microsoft
Cascadia Code is also really great fun.

72
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.560
I use dark plus for
my theme on Visual Studio Code.

73
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.463
I do like Sarah Draner's Night Owl.

74
00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:54.550
It's another really good one.

75
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.446
I just use the Mac OS is built in
terminal, works with the great,

76
00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.140
it's nice and fast.

77
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.430
I use the SH with spaceship as my prompt.

78
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.656
On Windows,
I really like Windows terminal.

79
00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:08.752
And then my VS Code Icons
come from vscode-icons,

80
00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:11.450
which is an extension that you can
just download through VS code.

81
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.612
If you have any issues
like spelling mistakes or

82
00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:19.662
anything like that with this course
website, you can just go file an issue or

83
00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:22.980
open a PR On the repo,
that's always very much appreciated.

84
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.876
In fact, I see some people have already
opened up which is really great.

85
00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:29.580
Thank you.

86
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.740
And yeah, that's me.

87
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.650
Thanks to friend of masters for
inviting me back.

88
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.610
I'm always happy to be back here.

89
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.610
You can catch up with me on social media.

90
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.270
I left my links on there.

91
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.610
Just so you know, I'm terrible at
responding to direct messages.

92
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.205
So, sorry.

93
00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:53.580
[LAUGH] And then let's hop back over
here to the Intermediate React V3 here.

94
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.549
Click on the welcome, just to let
you know how this website works.

95
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.292
Anytime that you're watching the video and
you can see this,

96
00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:03.220
you can see the section that we're
on which is Intermediate React V3.

97
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.281
And then welcome, right, so
you can see here if I go back,

98
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:08.750
I'm on Intermediate React V3 and welcome.

99
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.650
That's just you can kinda orient yourself
of where I am on the site at any given

100
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.390
time just by looking at the video.

101
00:05:16.807 --> 00:05:20.411
Okay, let's talk a little bit about
the structure of how this course is

102
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:21.080
gonna work.

103
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.070
Every section here, so
hooks in depth Tailwind CSS.

104
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.970
These are all individual modules.

105
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.401
So, if you don't wanna learn
about Tailwind, for example,

106
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:33.710
you can just skip ahead and
go straight to Code Splitting.

107
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.390
They don't build on each other.

108
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.206
This is different from the Complete Intro
to React where every section builds on

109
00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:40.500
each other, and
you have to kinda take them an order.

110
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.258
This one,

111
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:46.321
they all kinda start from a fresh with
a new repo that we keep going with.

112
00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.620
So that's the first thing I wanna say.

113
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.840
All the project files are here in the
Complete Intro to React V6 projects repo.

114
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.048
So if I click on that,
you can see all of the steps here.

115
00:06:02.048 --> 00:06:05.940
So you can see this code splitting
redux server side rendering.

116
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.060
These are all the intermediate ones.

117
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.381
All of these ones that begin with numbers,
those all come from the complete intro,

118
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:13.760
so we won't be talking about
it in this particular course.

119
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.202
But in particular, what's interesting for

120
00:06:18.202 --> 00:06:21.452
you is every section is gonna
start new from 12 portals and

121
00:06:21.452 --> 00:06:25.630
rests from the last part, the finished
part of the Complete Intro to React.

122
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.122
So basically, what we're gonna do is
every time we get into a new section,

123
00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:32.220
you're gonna copy all the files in.

124
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.543
You're gonna run npm install again, and
we're gonna start with a brand new repo.
