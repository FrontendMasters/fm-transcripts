1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.972
Let's go create some Action Creators.

2
00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.838
So, outside reducer,
we're gonna create another folder.

3
00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:10.996
Called action.

4
00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.175
Creators.

5
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:27.010
Okay, these are not purely necessary,
but I would suggest doing them as well.

6
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.049
They're basically functions that
take in some parameter, and

7
00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:32.250
then they return the correct
shape of action.

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.916
So let me give you an example here,

9
00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:43.002
we have one let's do this for
change theme.js.

10
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:47.820
And it's another function that
you just export default function.

11
00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:53.333
Change theme, this takes in a theme, and

12
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.610
it returns an object that
looks like an action.

13
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.403
So the type is going to be.

14
00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:07.811
Change theme, and
the payload is going to be the theme.

15
00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:11.608
Pretty simple.

16
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.609
Now, I can see you putting all of
your action creators on one file,

17
00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.810
because obviously these are quite short.

18
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.140
Or you can put them in multiple files.

19
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.901
In this particular case,
I put them in multiple files, but

20
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:24.182
that's totally up to you.

21
00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:27.182
So let's make another new file and

22
00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:32.877
we're gonna have to do the same
thing here, change animal.js.

23
00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:37.140
And let's just again, these are really
very similar over and over again.

24
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.919
Change animal, Animal,

25
00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:47.983
change animal.

26
00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:56.613
So these ones were all keeping
track of very simple strings, but

27
00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:59.360
you can imagine they can
have pretty complicated.

28
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.451
Let's say we had an animation and

29
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:06.110
those animations were modifying
various different parts of like.

30
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.590
All right, this is now true, that this has
gone through this animation, it's false.

31
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.160
It started this one and, this should
be green now and they should be pink,

32
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.270
and so, one action, can trigger five
different state trees to change, right?

33
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.172
And so that's why,
it's important that we have these kind of,

34
00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:23.529
there's not always a one to one mapping,
I guess what I'm trying to say.

35
00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.105
Okay, new file, change theme.

36
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:35.748
All right did that one.

37
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:41.576
Let's do change breed.js

38
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.063
Breed, breed, breed, okay,

39
00:02:53.063 --> 00:02:58.360
one more action creator here.

40
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.561
Change, animal, breed, theme, location.

41
00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:21.636
And location, all right,
now we have all of our

42
00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:27.101
action creators,
now we're able to dispatch.

43
00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:35.227
These I guess actions to the,
to ready to dispatch them to redux.

44
00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:43.581
Okay, now, yeah,
we'll talk about here in just a second.

45
00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:49.130
So now,
all of our redux stuff is ready to go.

46
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.593
We are going to, now go integrate that
to our application, so go to App.js.

47
00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:04.534
And here, we're going to,

48
00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:08.200
import provider,

49
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.330
from react-redux.

50
00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:22.860
And we're going to import,
the store from ./store.

51
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.826
So first of all,
we're not using the theme anymore.

52
00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:33.421
We're gonna put that in redux,
so we're gonna delete that.

53
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:36.508
We're gonna delete the theme context
because we're gonna be done with

54
00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:37.130
that as well.

55
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.309
You can delete the theme
context component here.

56
00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:49.476
And instead of that, we're gonna
have a provider, with store=store.

57
00:04:57.482 --> 00:05:01.085
And now, actually using react
context ironically, now,

58
00:05:01.085 --> 00:05:05.491
this provider is providing our redux
store, to all of our application.

59
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:07.946
Now we can start reading and
writing from redux.

60
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.740
All right, so
let's go to search params.j.s now.

61
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.314
And at the top, we're going to delete
context and the use context here,

62
00:05:21.314 --> 00:05:25.450
because we're not going to use that
anymore, as well as that line here.

63
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.211
Underneath breeds that I had here,
this theme, set theme,

64
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.570
we're going to delete that.

65
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.070
And.

66
00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:41.686
Now we're going to get something from,

67
00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:47.250
react-redux called useSelector,
from react-redux.

68
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.670
So this is another hook, it's relatively
new actually for react redux.

69
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.606
And we're gonna get,
instead of using state here from this, and

70
00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:03.387
theme, so go ahead and delete,
animal, location and breed.

71
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.027
And this is going to be
const animal= useSelector,

72
00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:18.680
and it takes in state and
returns, state.animal.

73
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.985
So, basically you give it
a function as like all right,

74
00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:22.690
given the entire state tree.

75
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.276
What do I need to do to get just
that bare minimum out here?

76
00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:28.997
And I'll do the same for location.

77
00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:37.189
For theme, And for breed.

78
00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:46.230
Now, one of you might astutely ask,
couldn't I just pull them all out at once?

79
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.283
You definitely could, in fact,
an easy way you could do that would be,

80
00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:59.186
const, animal, breed, location, theme, and

81
00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:03.976
you could do that through
=useSelectorstate,

82
00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:08.330
like just return the entire thing, right?

83
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.700
This would work as well.

84
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.768
The only thing that I'll
suggest against this is like,

85
00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:14.528
sometimes your redux
stores can be enormous and

86
00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:17.800
it's actually probably better sometimes to
operate those enormous stores like this.

87
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.112
But, this doesn't offend me either,
it's up to you.

88
00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:30.520
Okay, and now,
this is reading from our redux store.

89
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.805
With hooks that became incredibly
easy to use from redux, right,

90
00:07:33.805 --> 00:07:36.870
because you have the provider
which has the redux store on it.

91
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.523
And this useSelector hook,
is actually reading from that store,

92
00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.200
from the provider.

93
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.700
So let's actually start our app.

94
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.539
I think we've broken some things,
but this should at least start up.

95
00:07:56.881 --> 00:08:01.210
So I think this is pretty clean, once you
actually get redux in place and working,

96
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.861
it's pretty clean to look at.

97
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.850
So let's go to local host 1234.

98
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.205
Did I break something else?

99
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:18.233
Can't exhale local lexical declaration.

100
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:29.471
That was, my problem, go to store.js, and

101
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:32.926
I put store here, not reducer.

102
00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:36.338
So on line 2, make sure you,

103
00:08:36.338 --> 00:08:40.570
should be reduced to here not store.

104
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.360
Right because, you can't provide store
to itself that would make any sense.

105
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.985
You have, you give store the route
reducer, and that's how it gets started.

106
00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:58.327
So again, line 5, that should be reducer.

107
00:09:02.748 --> 00:09:07.661
Okay, and now, you can see here,
Seattle, Washington, dog, Havanese,

108
00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:13.160
dark blue, all those things that we,
the new defaults that we set in there.

109
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.990
That's why we're only seeing Luna now,
right?

110
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.094
Because that's the only one that's,
coming back from the store.

111
00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:22.213
However, try and change them now.

112
00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:28.520
It is not working, why?

113
00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:35.546
We have the same problem before is that,
the redux store is being read from, but

114
00:09:35.546 --> 00:09:37.570
it's not being written back to, right?

115
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.920
So I read from, going back to,
let's see we are in search params.

116
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.553
We're reading from,
our state to get state.animal but

117
00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:53.100
where's it being written back to,
it's not, right.

118
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.260
So that's a problem, we have to
actually write back to our store.

119
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.006
So let's go into,
how do we dispatch actions.
