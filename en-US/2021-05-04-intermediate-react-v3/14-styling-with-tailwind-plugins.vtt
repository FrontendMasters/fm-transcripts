00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.510
So first of all, we're just gonna be
doing the search params one here today.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.731
And then I'm gonna leave it as an exercise
to you to go fix details, if you wanna go

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.970
learn more about how to do and just have
something to practice with, for tailwind.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.190
So you can go ahead and delete this
class name here, search params.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.873
And let's go ahead and
add a bunch of class names to this,

6
00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:28.120
let's have p10 March and bottom 10.

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.050
We wanna have rounded corners.

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.820
So think border radius.

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.932
And we wanna have really rounded ones so

10
00:00:33.932 --> 00:00:36.880
we can do large roundings
instead of medium rounding.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.350
Background gray 200 sounds good to me.

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.380
Let's have a drop shadow.

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.510
Everyone likes drop shadows
right there back in vogue.

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.190
Thanks apple.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.980
We have a large one.

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.116
Let's talk about how to do Flexbox
because I think this is fun and

17
00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:57.250
I use Flexbox everywhere.

18
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.210
I used to have to use like floats
everywhere and it didn't enjoy my job as

19
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.420
much as I do now, now that I have flex and
grid, we'll do grid here in just a second.

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.476
So you wanna have a be display
flex you just say flex and

21
00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:14.622
I wanna go in a column so
I'm gonna say flex column, and

22
00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:19.851
then I want to justify centre and
item centre so align items centre and

23
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:25.892
then I want to add a like a horizontal or
a vertical divider between them so like,

24
00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:31.600
always has like a margin bottom or
center apart but a border bottom.

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.870
So they have like a nice
like utility class for that.

26
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.750
It's called divide.

27
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.060
And I wanna divide on the bottom.

28
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.832
So I can do divide x that
would divide side to side and

29
00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:45.020
I can do divide y that divides up and
down.

30
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.678
Like x and y coordinates on
a Cartesian graph, right And

31
00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:55.480
then we want those divides to be, divide
gray and we want it to be pretty dark.

32
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.474
So divide grade 900
pretty close to a black.

33
00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.090
So I did a lot of stuff there.

34
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.877
But I mean, you can see here as,
I was basically just like writing

35
00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:13.812
CSS in my brain and
then translating that to classes.

36
00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:16.906
So now if we go back over and

37
00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:22.535
look we can see we have
a nice background here and

38
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:27.205
you can see everything kind of goes in.

39
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.330
Probably one of us to be on.

40
00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:36.590
Yeah, I did this on the wrong thing.

41
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.420
Sorry.

42
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.480
It's not this div here.

43
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.304
I wanted this to be on the forum.

44
00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:51.200
My bad [LAUGH] so save that and
now this will make more sense right?

45
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.231
This looks like this like a thing up here.

46
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.939
Okay.

47
00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.127
Now, this div up here, what we're gonna

48
00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:13.582
put on it is classname equals my0.

49
00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:21.190
So my margin first thing, and
then top and bottom y zero.

50
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.050
So top and bottom I'd want zero margin.

51
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.920
That's what that means.

52
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.070
As you might imagine, MX zero would be I
want zero margin on the left and right.

53
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.980
Same thing with padding.

54
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.888
I can just say PX,
there would be zero padding on left and

55
00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:42.625
right Then I wanna have on the sides so

56
00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:47.953
I wanna have zero top and bottom and
I wanna have auto left and right mx, auto

57
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.919
And then I wanna have it so it's like
width Most of the page, right so like,

58
00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.774
if I was doing CSS,
I would do like width 95%.

59
00:03:58.774 --> 00:04:00.320
And then I want it to be
centered in the page.

60
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.036
The way you do that here is
they have a column system that

61
00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.090
they divide the page into 12.

62
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.590
And I wanted to take up 11
twelfths of the page, right?

63
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.530
If I wanted to only take up a fourth
of the page, I could do 312 right.

64
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.015
In this case, I want to take up
most of it, so I'm gonna do 11,

65
00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:20.980
12 And there you go.

66
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.129
You can see now it's taking
most of the page but

67
00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.350
at least it's not going
all the way to the edge.

68
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.880
We got nice round of corners
with the drop shadow there.

69
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.121
And yeah, it's starting to
look a little bit better here.
