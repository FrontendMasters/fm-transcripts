00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.212
So there's another hook that we can get
here from React Redux called useDispatch.

2
00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:13.960
And then underneath here, we're gonna
say const dispatch = useDispatch.

3
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.338
And now we have a dispatch function
that we can dispatch actions to Redux.

4
00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:27.735
Let's go ahead and
import all of our actionCreators

5
00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:31.660
here cuz we're gonna use all of them,

6
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:40.139
use import changeLocation from
./actionCreators/changeLocation, okay?

7
00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:43.519
Copy and paste that four times.

8
00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.803
This one will be,

9
00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:54.300
ChangeAnimal.

10
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.499
This one will be changeBreed, and

11
00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.706
this will be changeTheme, okay?

12
00:01:04.706 --> 00:01:07.960
So now we have all of our
actionCreators available to us.

13
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.210
And now we're just gonna go put this in
all of our various different form pieces.

14
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.010
So we don't have updateLocation anymore.

15
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.710
What we're gonna have this be instead is,
this is for

16
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
locations is gonna be change,
it's gonna be dispatch.

17
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.970
Dispatch expects a fully formed action.

18
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.597
So inside of that,
we're gonna put this and

19
00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:33.876
then we're gonna say
dispatch(changeLocation).

20
00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:41.098
So if you remember,
if we look at our change location,

21
00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:44.510
this returns a type changeLocation in
the payload as is location, right?

22
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.382
So this is gonna accept whatever
the user is typing here and

23
00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:51.951
it's gonna dispatch a fully
formed action to Redux.

24
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:58.953
So, in other words, it's gonna
dispatch an action that looks like

25
00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:02.852
this {type: "CHANGE-LOCATION"
with a payload,

26
00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:09.394
Of whatever they typed.

27
00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.440
That's the action that's actually
gonna make it into Redux.

28
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.270
And let's just go test that out.

29
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.460
Save this, come back over to your app.

30
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.655
And now I can type in here again, right?

31
00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:27.070
Because now Redux is
actually being updated.

32
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.045
And then whenever it gets updated,
it's being re rendered back to the DOM.

33
00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:35.942
Make sense?

34
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.650
So let's go ahead and
do that for the other ones here.

35
00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:49.953
Here we're gonna have changeAnimal,
changeAnimal,

36
00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:56.860
and then we're gonna have to surround
both of these with dispatch.

37
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:03.689
Okay, so now animal will work.

38
00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.068
Let's come down here to breed.

39
00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:11.283
And I'm just gonna select
both of these at once.

40
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.519
This is gonna be changeBreed.

41
00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:20.454
Put that in parentheses here.

42
00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:21.934
I'm gonna put dispatch.

43
00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:22.709
So now this is gonna work,

44
00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.524
dispatch(changeBreed |e.target.value|),
okay?

45
00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:31.728
So now our breed selector is gonna work.

46
00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:36.447
And lastly, we need our theme to work.

47
00:03:36.447 --> 00:03:37.401
So let's go make that work.

48
00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:48.200
So this is gonna be changeTheme,
put all this in parentheses.

49
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.560
And we're gonna do
a dispatch(changeTheme|e.target.value|).

50
00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:02.730
All right, let's go take a look and
make sure that everything works.

51
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.570
Do empty, that emptied breed.

52
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.230
So all that stuff is
still working correctly.

53
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.100
Chartreuse, that's working.

54
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.129
If I delete this,
then we can see all the pets.

55
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.332
Still thinks that that's,
or you know what,

56
00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:22.980
cuz we didn't dispatch
to changeBreed to none.

57
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.720
So that's something that we
would actually have to go do.

58
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.230
In fact, we can even go do that and
fix it right now.

59
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.536
In the reducer for changeBreed,

60
00:04:32.536 --> 00:04:36.687
sorry, for the breed reducer,

61
00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:42.223
whenever there is a case of changeAnimal,

62
00:04:42.223 --> 00:04:47.295
we have to respond to this too, right,

63
00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:54.409
because we need to zero that but
only in certain cases.

64
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.029
So if, Let's see.

65
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.070
So we'd actually have to break out of
this into another reducer that would

66
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.550
listen to both of them.

67
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.068
So what you would have to do here is you'd
have to come into your index.js, and

68
00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:26.110
we won't get too much into this.

69
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:32.695
But here you'd actually have to have
another part here where you'd have another

70
00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:36.704
special reducer that could handle both
animal and breed at the same time.

71
00:05:36.704 --> 00:05:38.881
Because if animal's equal to empty string,

72
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:41.700
then breed is going to be
returned as empty string as well.

73
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.780
So actually I have another idea,
this is gonna make this a lot easier.

74
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.598
Instead of handling this
at the reducer level,

75
00:05:49.598 --> 00:05:53.975
what we can do is we can handle it at
the app.js or the SearchParams level.

76
00:05:53.975 --> 00:05:59.920
So here on the animal level,

77
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.615
let's make just a function up here.

78
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:16.321
That's handleAnimalChange,

79
00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.097
With e coming in.

80
00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:27.418
And you're gonna say if e.target.value

81
00:06:27.418 --> 00:06:32.442
=== blah, then you're gonna have to

82
00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:38.354
say dispatchchangeAnimal
to be empty string,

83
00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:45.320
and then you're gonna have to do that for
breed as well.

84
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.990
Actually, you always do this.

85
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.012
It's not even that.

86
00:06:57.578 --> 00:06:58.850
And then you're gonna say dispatch,

87
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:09.090
changeAnimal to be whatever
e.target.value is.

88
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.700
There we go.

89
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.573
Okay, took me a second, got there.

90
00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:18.250
So if you always do it, then you
can handle the reducer or whatever.

91
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.050
This is fine.

92
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.949
We're sticking with this.

93
00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.540
Here on changeAnimal or changeBreed,

94
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.810
changeAnimal, I'm gonna
do handleAnimalChange.

95
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.905
Okay, now if we go back over here,
we go to Rabbit and Submit.

96
00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:43.719
I guess there's nothing in
Seattle that has a rabbit.

97
00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:46.640
And there we go.

98
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.670
Now we're not getting
havanese rabbits anymore.

99
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.340
You can see that I did two actions here.

100
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.264
I also could have handled
this at the reducer level and

101
00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:57.520
everything would have been fine.
