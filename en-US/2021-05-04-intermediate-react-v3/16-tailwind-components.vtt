00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.677
So the question that you might
be thinking at this point is,

2
00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:07.290
I can see myself having to copy and
paste the same styles a lot.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.624
So if I have five inputs,

4
00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.749
do I need to copy and
paste that on every single one of them?

5
00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.447
And the answer is no,
you can still come in and

6
00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:16.210
you can actually make what
are called components.

7
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.483
Let's come back to our style.css.

8
00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:25.209
So I have this problem now that I have
these components here, basically all

9
00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:30.730
these inputs that should have some
relatively similar styles to each of them.

10
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.310
I would like to apply the same style to
each one of them without having to copy

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.210
and paste this my-10 to it.

12
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.130
So come back in your style.css,
and let's put this in here.

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.510
So the first thing you wanna
say here is layer components.

14
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.445
And we're basically scoping this down
as here is the component that exists

15
00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:50.260
inside of my application.

16
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.510
So we're gonna put this layer components.

17
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.886
And then here you can put
some CSS classes, right?

18
00:00:55.886 --> 00:01:01.522
So the first thing we put in here is
a search-label, and it's just normal CSS.

19
00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.973
Here I chose to use CSS, but I also told
you that there's also the ability to kind

20
00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:08.507
of use the Tailwind CSS
classes themselves.

21
00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:09.921
And I'll leave that to your discretion.

22
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:15.338
In this case,
I found it faster to just do a label here.

23
00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:24.759
Okay, so margin-bottom 15,
margin-top 15, width 100.

24
00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.060
All stuff that you can
use to display flex.

25
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.438
This will make everything look nice and
centered for

26
00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:33.178
all these various different labels.

27
00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:37.930
And then the search control, this is gonna

28
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.864
be the, The input in there.

29
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.905
So instead of having all of these,

30
00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:53.274
let's go back to our SearchParams,
these, my-10s, right?

31
00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:55.272
So let's go ahead and delete all
those that we just put in there.

32
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.070
Now what I wanna do is I
wanna give this a className,

33
00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:06.745
Equals to the search-label
that I put in here.

34
00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:13.130
And I'm gonna put that on
each one of the labels here.

35
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.240
And so now I have this reusable style
component that I can put everywhere.

36
00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.964
Okay, and
then I also need to have a search-control.

37
00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.217
Starting to look a little bit better.

38
00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:36.590
I think I put that on here
className = search-control.

39
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.735
Is that what this ended up being?

40
00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:44.912
And yeah, you can put that on the button
if you want to, but you also go ahead and

41
00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:49.882
put these, instead of the w-60,
replace that with search-control.

42
00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:11.058
And now we end up with something that
looks significantly nicer than what we had

43
00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:11.581
before.

44
00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:21.840
Right, this actually
looks mostly respectable.

45
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.660
PostCSS, you can kind of think of
to fill a similar role to SAS.

46
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.822
PostCSS, in and

47
00:03:29.822 --> 00:03:34.810
of itself, is like Babel that all
PostCSS does is process CSS, right?

48
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.639
Babel by itself does nothing.

49
00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.559
Babel needs plugins and presets and
configuration stuff for it to do anything.

50
00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:46.810
PostCSS is the exact same way, whereas
SAS out of the box does a bunch of stuff.

51
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.419
SAS is a language unto itself.

52
00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.016
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.

53
00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:52.628
&gt;&gt; Yep.

54
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:59.709
So in this particular case,
PostCSS is the processor, but

55
00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.131
the actual transformations
are coming from Tailwind.

56
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:06.934
And that's the difference there.

57
00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.086
Tailwind needs PostCSS.

58
00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.735
PostCSS doesn't necessarily need Tailwind.

59
00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:17.161
Okay.

60
00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.700
And then we can do our
button down at the bottom.

61
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.205
So let's replace the search-control
with rounded px-6,

62
00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:33.099
so padding on the left and right of 6,

63
00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.628
py-2 to have some padding top and bottom.

64
00:04:42.144 --> 00:04:49.267
Remove that color,
text-white hover:opacity-50.

65
00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:56.110
And border-none.

66
00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:05.450
That'll make a nice little button there
that'll look significantly better.

67
00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:12.715
So you can see those got
nice rounded corners and

68
00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:15.360
all that kinda stuff, there you go.

69
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.988
Rounded px, I think everything here is
we've all ready kinda talked about.

70
00:05:18.988 --> 00:05:22.095
The hover opacity-50, that makes it so
whenever I hover over it,

71
00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:25.538
it goes 50% opacity, so it looks
like it's a clickable button, right?

72
00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:26.593
People expect that.

73
00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:33.430
Okay, we do have one problem right now.

74
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.947
So right now this breed
selector is disabled, right?

75
00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:40.201
And right now it looks very clickable.

76
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:43.835
So a user might go in there and he's like,
wait, why can't I click on that, right?

77
00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:49.000
It's only populated once I select dog,
and now there's breeds to select.

78
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.437
But when it's empty,
it should look grayed out.

79
00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:54.401
So how do we do that?

80
00:05:54.401 --> 00:06:00.230
Well, if you're on PostCSS 8,
you can just do this.

81
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.341
Let's go up here.

82
00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:10.254
On the breed selector up here, this one,

83
00:06:10.254 --> 00:06:16.026
we could do disabled:opacity-50.

84
00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:22.740
The issue is this doesn't work on
the PostCSS 7 version that we're using.

85
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.490
So we have to kinda go hack
around it a little bit.

86
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.346
But like I said, everything's
the latest version of Tailwind,

87
00:06:29.346 --> 00:06:31.460
this would just work out of the box.

88
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.165
But never fear, there's a little
thing that we can work around here.

89
00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:39.595
If we go into here into the variance,
into the,

90
00:06:43.983 --> 00:06:47.753
Here, instead of the extend,
we can say opacity,

91
00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:53.308
after, and give it a little function here.

92
00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:58.898
After:["disabled"].

93
00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:05.090
So if this is a little opaque,
pun kind of intended there.

94
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.147
It's cuz it's a kind of esoteric way
that we can basically say, hey, if

95
00:07:12.147 --> 00:07:18.156
you find this disabled pseudo class here,
then allow the user to set the opacity.

96
00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:22.452
If you want any more
explanation than that,

97
00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:26.660
you're gonna have to go dig into the docs
cuz that's basically what I got out of it.

98
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.381
All I know is that it works, right?

99
00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:39.636
And now what I'm gonna have to do because
this is a new config, I have to stop and

100
00:07:39.636 --> 00:07:41.183
start the server again.

101
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:52.263
So again, I kinda get caught by this
bug always with Parcel that whenever

102
00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:56.013
you are modifying configs,
you gotta go clear the cache.

103
00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:57.805
You have to delete the cache.

104
00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.595
You have to delete the dist.

105
00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:02.558
And then you have to start it again.

106
00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:06.980
Cuz a lot of time, what Parcel is doing is
it's caching all of those configurations

107
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.140
so that it doesn't have to reread them.

108
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.696
I think Parcel 2 has fixed a lot of this.

109
00:08:16.423 --> 00:08:18.740
And there you go,
now it's finally grayed out.

110
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.962
So now, if I change this to dog,
notice this gets ungrayed out and

111
00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:24.431
people can like, okay,
now I can select things.

112
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.246
And then I select this again and
it is grayed out again.

113
00:08:30.517 --> 00:08:34.792
Luckily, again, if you're using the latest
version of Tailwind, which very soon will

114
00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:38.840
have Parcel 2, you will not have to worry
about doing this workaround to get there.
