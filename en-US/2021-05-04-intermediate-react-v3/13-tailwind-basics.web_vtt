00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:02.582
Let's go on to the basics here.

2
00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.914
So, here we put in this p-0, this m-0, and

3
00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:14.229
this was a nice way of
just doing padding 0 and

4
00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.978
margin 0, but let's just go ahead and

5
00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:22.765
see what it'll look like
if i put m-24 in here.

6
00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:27.617
So, if I go back here to
the Adopt Me page, not that one.

7
00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:30.572
Refresh the page here,
except mine is not running, so

8
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.214
I have to get it back running again,
npm run dev.

9
00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:41.016
Refresh the page here,
notice I push everything in a lot, right?

10
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:47.713
So if I go look at this body and
root and this one right here,

11
00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:54.025
notice that there is a margin of 6 rem,
which is a lot.

12
00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:57.975
You might not be familiar
with the rem measurement,

13
00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.582
it's root so there's a thing called ems.

14
00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.561
I imagine many of you have
probably seen ems before, right?

15
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:08.158
Ems actually scale with your font size,
right,

16
00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:12.820
cuz it's the size of a literal m,
right, like an m on the page.

17
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.228
You also might not be aware,
but there's also an x.

18
00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:22.682
So the m is the width of an m, and the x
is the height of an x, a lowercase x.

19
00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:28.291
Sometimes it's useful too,
I've never had to disambiguate the two But

20
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:32.243
the nice thing about ems versus rem,
sorry,

21
00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:37.869
the nice thing about rems versus
ems is it does change with type.

22
00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.322
So if I have a smaller type
in a smaller component,

23
00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:46.763
that will make that measurement smaller,
which can be not what you expect.

24
00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:52.800
When you put in a root rem,
it's the root of your entire page.

25
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.133
It measures that end, so

26
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:58.646
it actually doesn't change with the type
scale the various different components.

27
00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:02.331
It's kind of a subtle difference, but
I would say nine times out of ten when

28
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.564
you're using ems as a measurement,
you probably want root ems.

29
00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:10.931
Only when you specifically do you
want it to scale the type scale,

30
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.500
then you want ems.

31
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.549
And not that it really matters anyway,

32
00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.036
all of the measurements in Tailwind
are all done with rems anyway.

33
00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:19.679
So I just wanted you to be aware
of what you're looking at.

34
00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.033
Cool, so let's take away that 24,

35
00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:29.495
let's go back to 0 cuz that's
really what we expected.

36
00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:30.282
There we go.

37
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.263
So, now let's go with something a little
bit more intense with how Tailwind works.

38
00:02:40.263 --> 00:02:46.078
We're gonna make a nice header that
has a really fun gradient on it.

39
00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:47.080
So let's do this.

40
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.957
We're gonna have a class name here, and
we're gonna put a lot of stuff in here.

41
00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:57.347
Width (full), so they have the same
thing here, width 0, width 10.

42
00:02:57.347 --> 00:03:01.805
So if we did width 24,
we just saw that that's 6 rems across, but

43
00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:04.559
I want it to go all
the way across the page.

44
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:09.349
So you can do width (full),
that's gonna be width 100%.

45
00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.998
Margin bottom mb, so
margin 10 would be on every side.

46
00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:19.983
If I just want to do bottom,
its margin bottom 10.

47
00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:23.763
Text, I want that to center,
so text center.

48
00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:27.544
Let's give it a bit of padding p7,
seemed like it worked pretty well, and

49
00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:29.658
then we're gonna do a gradient, right?

50
00:03:29.658 --> 00:03:32.184
So we wanna have this really
cool looking gradient.

51
00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:36.074
So we're gonna say background gradient,
and

52
00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:39.874
we want it to go from top to bottom,
so to-b.

53
00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:43.884
If we want it to go to top,
to-t, or to-l to go left,

54
00:03:43.884 --> 00:03:49.167
to-r to go right, but in this case,
we want it to go to bottom, okay?

55
00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:54.486
We're gonna go from, so
this is the gradient now,

56
00:03:54.486 --> 00:04:01.429
starting from purple, and
we want to purple of intensity 400.

57
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:07.430
So the intensity of these colors range
from 100, which is almost white,

58
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.354
to 900, which is almost black, and
400 is somewhere in the middle.

59
00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:19.507
And then we're gonna go
from there to red 500,

60
00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:24.793
so that will go from purple to red, right?

61
00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:27.393
What if you wanna have like
a color stop along the way?

62
00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:31.002
You can also do via-pink-500, and

63
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:36.107
I'll show you what these look
like when we're in there.

64
00:04:36.107 --> 00:04:42.279
And then we also wanna have, well, let's
take a look what this looks like first.

65
00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.055
So, save all of that.

66
00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:47.267
And now look at this, we have this really

67
00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:52.089
interesting gradient that we
made without writing any CSS.

68
00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:54.174
Pretty cool, right?

69
00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:57.905
On one hand, we wrote a lot of classes,
so it feels kinda strange, but

70
00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:01.024
at the same time,
you created a gradient without any CSS.

71
00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:05.228
So, I hope what you can see here is,
if you get pretty familiar with all

72
00:05:05.228 --> 00:05:10.078
the nomenclature on this, and you start
figuring out these kind of class names,

73
00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:13.717
you can start flying by just
reading all these class names and

74
00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:16.035
never having to hop over into the CSS.

75
00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:19.708
So what happens if I take this via-pink
out, I wanted to show you that.

76
00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:20.936
So I take that out, and

77
00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:25.424
now notice that color stuff in the middle
just goes from straight to purple to red.

78
00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:27.004
And if I put that pink back in,

79
00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:31.323
we get this kinda nice little pink inner
stop layer in there, looks really cool.

80
00:05:36.277 --> 00:05:40.842
So let's go make this Adopt Me
text look a little bit bigger.

81
00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:44.942
So let's go into our link class here,
and if you give it a class name,

82
00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:47.514
it will apply that to the anchor tag for
us.

83
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.762
So let's make that text
significantly better.

84
00:05:49.762 --> 00:05:52.328
So let's make it 6 XL.

85
00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:56.263
So another thing that you'll find there,
small SM,

86
00:05:56.263 --> 00:06:01.433
medium which is MD, large which is LG,
I think, I'd have to go look.

87
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:03.999
I think large is LG.

88
00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:10.303
Then there's XL, 2 XL, 3 XL,
4 XL, 5 XL, and I think 6 XL.

89
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:15.686
I think it goes all the way up to 9 XL,
I'd have to go look, up to 9 XL, yep.

90
00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:22.113
So we're gonna do 6 XL,
which makes it about that big, right?

91
00:06:22.113 --> 00:06:29.086
And then here, we're gonna say text-white,
that'll look better against that backdrop.

92
00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:35.647
Okay, so, looking a bit better.

93
00:06:35.647 --> 00:06:37.629
You might think this
is pretty bad looking.

94
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.042
I was like, well,
you can blame my design skills,

95
00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:42.978
but I'm trying to teach you the CSS,
not the design portion.

96
00:06:42.978 --> 00:06:45.959
Go take Sarah's class if you
wanna learn the design skills,

97
00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.596
cuz she's 1,000 times
better at that than I am.

98
00:06:50.907 --> 00:06:55.108
Okay, and what if we wanted a nice hover
states to show people this is a link,

99
00:06:55.108 --> 00:06:58.341
cuz right now it doesn't do
anything when I hover over it.

100
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:06.911
We can do a hover : text-gray-200.

101
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:09.396
So this hover colon is what makes it so

102
00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:13.655
we're able to put these kind of
pseudo states on them, right?

103
00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:17.133
So now if you mouse over it,
you get a nice little gray, so

104
00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:20.121
people can say, okay, I can click on that.

105
00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:31.359
And there you go, we just did a whole
kinda header without touching any CSS,

106
00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:33.015
but just with classes.

107
00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:35.156
Does any one have any
questions about that?

108
00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:40.057
&gt;&gt; So let's say I don't wanna have,
let's say, the padding and

109
00:07:40.057 --> 00:07:45.065
the margin in rem, is there any
way I can change it back to pixel?

110
00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:50.115
&gt;&gt; I don't think so, it's pretty
opinionated of how you do these things.

111
00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:53.381
You'd have to go check,
to be honest with you.

112
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:57.940
There are some things you can do, I think
you can move over things by one pixel,

113
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.373
by doing something like, I don't know.

114
00:08:00.373 --> 00:08:05.413
Let's do margin top-px, and
I think if we now look at

115
00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:14.124
this in inspect element,
Did I put it on there?

116
00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:17.649
Yeah, it puts a margin top of one pixel,
right?

117
00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:20.135
So if you wanna move something
down just a little bit,

118
00:08:20.135 --> 00:08:22.409
there's a couple of
utility classes like that.

119
00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:24.772
But they're trying to enforce on you,

120
00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:28.862
which is in general a good practice
when doing CSS and design stuff.

121
00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:31.888
They having a spacing system or a rhythm,

122
00:08:31.888 --> 00:08:35.095
its the terms that I
hear a lot of people use.

123
00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:40.062
And so they're trying to say, I want one
unit, two units, four units, 16 units, and

124
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:41.999
they're proportional, right?

125
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.885
And so that kind of helps enforce that.

126
00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:46.053
I think that's the idea there.

127
00:08:46.053 --> 00:08:51.116
And so, if you're hard over, like I
really wanna be able to control that I

128
00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:56.606
can do 177 pixels exactly, Tailwinds
probably just not the answer for you.

129
00:08:56.606 --> 00:09:02.431
Or you can go on there and literally
put style equals width of 177 pixels,

130
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:07.907
and you can kinda break out of it
temporarily for very specific things.

131
00:09:07.907 --> 00:09:12.804
&gt;&gt; If you hover the parent, let's say,
I want something to happen to one

132
00:09:12.804 --> 00:09:17.124
of its children,
is that something possible with Tailwind?

133
00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:22.484
&gt;&gt; So, I have over this and
it makes the child go pink?

134
00:09:22.484 --> 00:09:24.017
&gt;&gt; Exactly, change color.

135
00:09:24.017 --> 00:09:25.117
&gt;&gt; It's a good question,

136
00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:28.088
cuz you could just do a child
selector at that point with the CSS.

137
00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:33.365
I don't know how to do it,
to be honest with you.

138
00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:35.907
My inclination is to say that
it's not possible, and so

139
00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:37.322
something that's specific.

140
00:09:37.322 --> 00:09:43.201
What you can do is you can just head
back over to the style.CSS here,

141
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:47.445
you could say like,
let's actually just do it.

142
00:09:47.445 --> 00:09:50.393
So if I do header a, and

143
00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:55.685
then there's an extends command here.

144
00:09:55.685 --> 00:10:00.228
So you can actually continue using
the class names from Tailwind, and

145
00:10:00.228 --> 00:10:05.238
I'd have to go look at how you do it,
cuz I don't remember off the top my head.

146
00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:09.118
But basically you can say
something like Tailwind extends or

147
00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:13.236
something like that,
then you can just say margin bottom 10.

148
00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:16.509
And you can actually use those class names
inside of this and the preprocessor will

149
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:19.782
catch it, and then you can continue using
the same kinda system just with CSS if you

150
00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:22.552
have advanced needs there, and
I think that's the purpose of that.

151
00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:26.237
That if you need to use those kind of
advanced selectors, that's available too.

152
00:10:26.237 --> 00:10:30.217
&gt;&gt; For the gradient,
you used pink and purple,

153
00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:33.987
what if we had custom colors for
our theme,

154
00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:39.748
like some random hex color that
we wanna use throughout the site,

155
00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:43.545
throughout the app, how would we do that?

156
00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:45.909
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

157
00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:51.185
Let's just go take a look here
at the Tailwind CSS docs.

158
00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:55.076
You can basically create your own
theme that has its own names.

159
00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:57.774
So we're just gonna be using all
of the colors now for example.

160
00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:03.622
But if you go in here to the colors on the
docs, here's all of their default colors.

161
00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:07.452
Honestly, they're pretty
nice looking colors, but

162
00:11:07.452 --> 00:11:13.029
here in your Tailwind config, you can
actually update your theme to like okay,

163
00:11:13.029 --> 00:11:16.128
I want white to actually be fefefe, right?

164
00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:18.985
And I want red to be this
other color of red, and

165
00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:22.958
you can see here they're changing
color to rose instead of red.

166
00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.216
So you can actually make your own theme
with your own names, and things like that,

167
00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:30.994
and Tailwind CSS can handle you
creating your own theme for everything.

168
00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:34.633
And this is true of everything,
we're gonna be looking at break points and

169
00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:36.846
variants and spacing, those kinda things.

170
00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:41.137
You can actually go and define what
Tailwind makes those things, right?

171
00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:43.997
They provide you a very,
very good starting point,

172
00:11:43.997 --> 00:11:46.922
and I suggest using it to start with,
cuz like I said,

173
00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:50.375
it's been looked at by high
quality professional designers.

174
00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:53.387
But when you like start using it for
your site and you have,

175
00:11:53.387 --> 00:11:56.768
this is the Netflix red and
the Netflix black, and you have to have

176
00:11:56.768 --> 00:12:00.112
these specific hex numbers,
you can go modify those on the fly.

177
00:12:00.112 --> 00:12:03.933
It doesn't have to be red,
you can call it brand red, right?

178
00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:06.110
And you can customize
what those names are.
