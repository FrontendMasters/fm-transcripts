>> That is the conclusion of Intermediate React, that was a lot of material coming right at you. So one, congratulations for sticking around but after taking Intermediate React. I think you're well equipped to go into the React universe and know what you like and what you don't like about React.

To know what tools you do and do not wanna use like sometimes you might want to use Redux other times you wanna leave that on the side. Do I wanna use TypeScript, am I a big fan of what it offers me or was that a lot of burden for things I don't like?

[00:00:32]
Should I use code splitting and server side rendering, I'm going to measure that and figure that out. Do I like tailwind or do I want to go back and try a motion, is that really interesting to me as well? These are all kinds of questions that I want you to answer for yourself, I have answers for myself.

[00:00:46]
I didn't teach you all the tools that are my favorite but I did teach you the tools. That I think are going to be the most useful for you to make these decisions for yourself. So in any case, thank you for sticking with me, thank you for listening.
