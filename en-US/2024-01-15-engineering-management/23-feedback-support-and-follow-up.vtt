00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.782
After giving the critical feedback,
I mentioned the most positive outcome is

2
00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:10.540
you've kind of had that hard conversation
and hopefully things are gonna get better.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.242
I honestly think that, I mean,

4
00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:15.468
letting someone go is a really
tough thing to do as a manager.

5
00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:19.608
But I think the critical conversation
where people aren't meeting expectations

6
00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:22.250
is absolutely the hardest thing.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.100
But once you kinda set that level,
hopefully things get better.

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.055
What I like to do is make sure to
give the person time to reflect and

9
00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:34.100
digest the feedback.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.887
Sometimes they might need the day
to just kinda think it through.

11
00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:41.520
And maybe you do a follow-up conversation
the next day or the following week.

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.160
But allowing people time to digest and
reflect can be really good.

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.894
They might be a little bit
defensive in the moment and so

14
00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:50.980
you kinda wanna let
them sit with it a bit.

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.537
I really like to provide written feedback.

16
00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:59.821
Maybe it's not right in the moment,
right after having the conversation.

17
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.575
It might be that next day or
something, but

18
00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.789
I wanna emphasize to make
sure that it's clear and

19
00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.088
that we're both hearing the same language
of what needs to be fixed or addressed.

20
00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:16.422
Sometimes it hits harder in written
communication, where people are able

21
00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:21.514
to be like whoa, this is critical,
this is really important to my job.

22
00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:26.379
I also like to have
the person reflect on it and

23
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:32.480
almost actually outline a plan for
how they can start to meet expectations.

24
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.641
How are they gonna address
the problem that we've talked about?

25
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:39.445
And this is a good area,
too, for how can I help?

26
00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:42.811
Cuz ultimately I'm on board with
helping this person get there.

27
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.781
We've kind of had that hard conversation,
now I wanna say, all right,

28
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:48.160
let's work through it.

29
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.292
And I think it's really helpful for

30
00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:54.281
people to kinda think through
what's their plan moving forward.

31
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:57.352
Sometimes this can be scenarios
where they're like, yeah,

32
00:01:57.352 --> 00:01:59.750
I don't wanna do anything differently.

33
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.230
And that might be a signal that it
might not be the right fit for them.

34
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.303
There's a lot that can come
in these conversations, but

35
00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:09.280
having some sort of plan for
it is really great.

36
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.000
I know some companies have performance
improvement plans, PIT plans.

37
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.931
But if you don't have that,
it doesn't mean that you can't

38
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:19.752
kinda have some of these types
of conversations in place.

39
00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:26.339
And that's, like I said,
that's where I'm asking, I'm a partner,

40
00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.200
I wanna be supportive.

41
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.735
I'm not just here to crap on someone and
make them feel bad or

42
00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.410
set those expectations.

43
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.590
I wanna be there to be a partner,
and how can I help?

44
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.610
It's on the person to fix and
address, but what can I do to help?

45
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.349
And I'm asking that question and
I'm like, okay.

46
00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.071
And if I can't do something,
I'm gonna tell them too,

47
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.547
we're gonna have
conversations around that.

48
00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:53.801
And then, I think this is really important
too, is provide ongoing feedback.

49
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:58.900
After a week or two of them working
to address it, how's it going?

50
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.958
Have check-ins.

51
00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.246
Yeah, actually you're improving on this,
this is really good, or, hey, wow,

52
00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:05.984
you're meeting expectations.

53
00:03:05.984 --> 00:03:07.445
Now, how does that sustain?

54
00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.311
But you wanna have
the ongoing conversations.

55
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:14.690
Whether it be just nudging some positive
reinforcement that, wow, this is good,

56
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.831
keep doing that,
this is exactly the behavior I wanna see.

57
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.423
But it gives people signals
in the right direction.

58
00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:28.393
If things aren't improving, well,
prepare for what's next, right?

59
00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:30.439
What are the next steps?

60
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.979
Do you have to continue
giving more feedback?

61
00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.451
Is it maybe that this team's
not the right fit for them?

62
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:39.430
You have to think about
those things as a manager.

63
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.286
There's no set timeline in my mind.

64
00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.813
There's probably some sort of timeline
you should be thinking about.

65
00:03:47.813 --> 00:03:52.491
But it doesn't have to necessarily be,
in a week I need to see you do this.

66
00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:54.810
But maybe you are thinking about that.
