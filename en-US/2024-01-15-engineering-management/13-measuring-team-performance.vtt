1
00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:05.469
All right, so
we talked about measuring projects and

2
00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:11.326
like work earlier, but
how do you know your team is performing?

3
00:00:11.326 --> 00:00:15.201
It's not necessarily easy.

4
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:21.368
I think it gets to some of
these more qualitative things.

5
00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:23.491
There's clear goals and
alignment on the work.

6
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:25.971
People know what they're supposed to do.

7
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.052
There's not a lot of ambiguity.

8
00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:31.741
Or if there is ambiguity,
they know how to work through it.

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.444
Cuz I know there's times where I'm putting
people on projects where I'm like,

10
00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:38.071
I don't know all the details
that need to get worked out.

11
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.994
Here's the goals, so
what we're trying to achieve.

12
00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:44.483
And I want people to have
the autonomy to figure it out.

13
00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:46.196
I don't want to dictate it to them.

14
00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:51.148
But it's not this completely ambiguous
thing that they're trying to figure

15
00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.593
out all sorts of ends, that's hard.

16
00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:56.521
But if you can say, yeah,
here's the problem at hand.

17
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.609
I don't want to be prescriptive
on how you solve that, but

18
00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.893
I am pointing them in a decent
enough direction, hopefully.

19
00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:07.273
Sometimes I don't, and maybe I need
to get more clarity on something.

20
00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:12.309
Your team is executing,
they're delivering,

21
00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:13.846
they're meeting their timelines.

22
00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:16.035
Not perfectly, that's okay.

23
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:18.315
We have slips, things happen.

24
00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:23.193
One thing I always ask my team is if you
say that you're going to have something

25
00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:26.721
done, August 15,
let's just throw a random date and

26
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:29.590
it's coming up on that
timeline end of July.

27
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.973
You're like, I am going to miss that
timeline because there was some dependency

28
00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:36.173
I didn't account for, whatever it is.

29
00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:37.269
Just communicate it.

30
00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:39.304
Let's have a conversation on that.

31
00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:41.767
Have a conversation with
your stakeholders, partners,

32
00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:42.778
whoever's involved.

33
00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:47.167
Maybe you can cut scope because you still
need to make that August 15 deadline.

34
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:51.458
Or maybe it's like,
let's just ship two weeks later.

35
00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:56.111
But I'd rather that than August 15
come up and my team is like, yeah,

36
00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:58.087
we didn't make that timeline.

37
00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:01.034
Like, okay,
why didn't you raise that sooner?

38
00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:05.816
So I think it's like, yeah, as long
as you're executing and delivering.

39
00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:08.151
This is one of my favorite ones,

40
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:12.139
absolutely one of my favorite
ones is people tell you.

41
00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.646
They're like, hey Ryan.

42
00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:15.465
Jem is doing awesome.

43
00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:20.126
I can't believe how impressive what
he just shipped and this is amazing.

44
00:02:20.126 --> 00:02:21.167
I love hearing that.

45
00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.966
It's like the unsolicited
positive feedback is great.

46
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:27.610
People will tell you
when things are bad too.

47
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.309
Oftentimes they don't necessarily, getting
that positive feedback goes above and

48
00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.994
beyond and you really hear that,
that's huge.

49
00:02:34.994 --> 00:02:40.399
Not hearing feedback isn't necessarily
meaning that your team isn't performing.

50
00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.184
They're probably meeting the expectations,
but

51
00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:46.172
hearing this unsolicited
positive feedback is huge.

52
00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:54.054
I think every individual on
your team should impress you.

53
00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:56.439
I take a look at my team and
I'm like, yeah,

54
00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.022
I really like what this person's doing or
not.

55
00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:02.819
And if time and time again
someone's not really quite there,

56
00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.215
I would say maybe it's like they're
kind of mediocre or some feeling.

57
00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:12.380
They're doing their job, but
are they impressing me and the team?

58
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.100
And those are things to think about.

59
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.944
And it's hard It's not something
that you're like have a checklist

60
00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:22.798
to make sure that they're
impressing you or the team.

61
00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:28.240
This one came up earlier, but your team is
excited about the work, there's passion.

62
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.044
They want to kind of strive
to make things better.

63
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:31.781
They're excited.

64
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.911
They're not just, yeah, yeah, we need
to do this for the business, we get it,

65
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:36.505
whatever.

66
00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:43.610
That's not gonna last long and
you're not doing your best work.

67
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.689
Individuals on your
team should be growing.

68
00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.082
They should be growing their skills,
their impact.

69
00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:51.014
It doesn't have to be huge.

70
00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:55.427
They might try new challenges, but
over time you should see them growing,

71
00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:59.437
that they are getting better at
something they're doing and love.

72
00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:02.895
Or they're trying some new
challenging thing they've never done.

73
00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:08.274
But there should be some sign of
growth from individuals on your team.

74
00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:09.058
And guess what,

75
00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:12.922
that's part of your job as an engineering
manager to maybe help with that growth.

76
00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:14.899
It's not entirely on you.

77
00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.572
I absolutely say it's a joint partnership,
but

78
00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:20.386
I do think you should be
seeing growth from people.

79
00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.588
This is a good one too.

80
00:04:24.588 --> 00:04:27.923
There should be room for healthy debate.

81
00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:31.622
You should be challenging
each other in team meetings,

82
00:04:31.622 --> 00:04:33.834
approaches, in poll requests.

83
00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:35.475
But you want it to be healthy.

84
00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:39.333
You want that trust that people
are able to be vulnerable,

85
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.313
to be wrong, make mistakes.

86
00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:44.753
And when it's toxic, you'll know it.

87
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:49.136
And I've been there, where it's like,
people are just having heated debate,

88
00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:53.719
hating this person's approach, and it's
really not great for anyone in the team.

89
00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.419
Even if it's just two
people butting heads,

90
00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.701
and you need to address that quickly.

91
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:01.896
A lot of things on you know, how do
you know your team is performing, but

92
00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:04.096
I'm sure there's a lot
of things I've missed.

93
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.346
These are some of
the things that I look for.

94
00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:09.796
Curious to the audience,
what are things that you all look for?

95
00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:13.744
Or think of it in a team that you're in,

96
00:05:13.744 --> 00:05:18.785
that you know that it's performing well,
yeah.

97
00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:23.209
&gt;&gt; I think the unsolicited
feedback from other people.

98
00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:28.300
I think unsolicited positive feedback
within the team is a good key sign.

99
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.576
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen on teams and
I've done this on my own,

100
00:05:31.576 --> 00:05:35.563
where even just having kudos in
team meetings and things like that.

101
00:05:35.563 --> 00:05:38.155
And just kind of leaving
that open ended for

102
00:05:38.155 --> 00:05:43.268
someone to be like, thanks Mark helped
me on this pull request, unblocked me so

103
00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:47.535
well, and just being able to celebrate
those things are really cool.

104
00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.848
I like that one, good.

105
00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:54.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to add on to the individuals
that are growing their skills and impact.

106
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.060
Also helping grow the skills
of your coworkers,

107
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.026
being a mentor and bringing-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

108
00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:02.663
&gt;&gt; Having everybody kind of level up.

109
00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:04.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, giving back and

110
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.026
like also leveling up other
people's skills when you're like,

111
00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:12.893
I'm really good at hiring, I want to
go help others do that, that's awesome.

112
00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:14.762
And also your team is thankful for

113
00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:17.980
it too cuz they're getting
better at something as well.

114
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.961
I like that.

115
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:23.118
&gt;&gt; This kind of fits into
the room probably debate, but

116
00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:29.084
having a psychologically safe team and
meetings and all that and culture.

117
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:33.169
One of the highest performing
teams I've been a part of,

118
00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.680
we were relentless and
pretty ruthless in terms of our candor,

119
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.871
in terms of this thing's not
ready to work on, moving on.

120
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:45.889
We're not gonna waste time
on it until it's ready.

121
00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.904
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and
that's something that takes time.

122
00:06:48.904 --> 00:06:50.023
But as a manager,

123
00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:54.957
I think there's ways in which you can
help foster that psychological safety.

124
00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:59.871
I do cover that I think in the feedback
portion too cuz I think that's really

125
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.551
important to just be able to be
comfortable giving one another feedback

126
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:09.076
is there has to be that psychological
safety and vulnerability too.

127
00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:14.244
&gt;&gt; That seems to me like a bit of
a loaded term, psychological safety,

128
00:07:14.244 --> 00:07:18.871
because I've heard it used in
several different contexts,

129
00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:21.788
meaning completely things, right?

130
00:07:21.788 --> 00:07:28.566
So from my perspective, a high performing
team is debating about the right things.

131
00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:33.293
They're putting the end user experience or
the product first.

132
00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:37.652
And then they're debating over like,
what is the best way to accomplish that?

133
00:07:37.652 --> 00:07:43.538
Rather than, I don't know,
there's other interpretations of that.

134
00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:49.898
I think to me it means it's okay to fail,
it's okay to give feedback.

135
00:07:49.898 --> 00:07:55.406
You're not possessive over your idea,
it's like we're trying to make the best

136
00:07:55.406 --> 00:08:01.002
idea when and we're trying to learn from
each other, we're all on the same team.

137
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:03.833
And I think that that's
what it means to me and

138
00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.451
that's what I've seen it's used good.

139
00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:10.661
But I've also seen the reverse where
it's used in a way it's not that,

140
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:13.132
it's something completely different.

141
00:08:13.132 --> 00:08:14.658
I don't know, you know what I mean?

142
00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:19.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I think you the way you
define it is absolutely the way I think

143
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.118
about it in a team dynamic and
just feeling comfortable to make mistakes,

144
00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:29.011
give feedback, and
without repercussion, right?

145
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:33.984
I like what you said Mark on the your end
state, you're building a user experience,

146
00:08:33.984 --> 00:08:38.468
you're building a product, it's for
your users or whatever it may be, and

147
00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:40.593
that's your common goal, right?

148
00:08:40.593 --> 00:08:43.797
And there's different
approaches to get there.

149
00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:48.246
And I might really wanna do this one
technical approach or use this library and

150
00:08:48.246 --> 00:08:51.270
someone else's passion
about this other library.

151
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.199
And it's okay that we disagree on that,
but how do you come to gather on that?

152
00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:58.662
And it's working through the trade-offs.

153
00:08:58.662 --> 00:09:00.505
Neither one of those is
probably the right answer.

154
00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:03.795
There's no perfect solution, but
how can you kind of get there and

155
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:05.808
feel comfortable doing that together?

156
00:09:05.808 --> 00:09:09.645
And then just being like,
yeah, you're right, I'm wrong.

157
00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:12.955
Let's go with that approach.

158
00:09:12.955 --> 00:09:15.072
&gt;&gt; At least I respect your decision.

159
00:09:15.072 --> 00:09:16.548
&gt;&gt; That too, yes.

160
00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:20.400
&gt;&gt; You respect your colleague's
intelligence and be like, yeah,

161
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.457
let's try that.

162
00:09:21.457 --> 00:09:22.397
And let's go down that path.

163
00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:24.228
And if it doesn't work,
then we'll try my idea.

164
00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:25.529
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's fine,

165
00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:29.045
we just need to start somewhere, and yeah,

166
00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:34.937
that's the best co-worker experience
ever is when people are just not so

167
00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:38.656
possessive over their choice, or whatever.

168
00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:42.104
It's like, hey, yeah,
let's try that, maybe it is.

169
00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:45.935
Let's go forward.

170
00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:47.741
&gt;&gt; Here's another one, too.

171
00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:49.777
Even if you go with that said approach,

172
00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:52.195
it's actually the wrong
one in the end state.

173
00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:54.587
If you don't need to be
that person I told you so.

174
00:09:54.587 --> 00:09:56.165
Right, cuz that's not great either.

175
00:09:56.165 --> 00:09:59.273
It's like cool, I mean, we tried that,
I was on board with that,

176
00:09:59.273 --> 00:10:01.006
even though I had another approach.

177
00:10:01.006 --> 00:10:02.706
I agreed we went down that road and

178
00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:05.631
it's a team dynamic to go back
the other way if we need to.

179
00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:08.317
&gt;&gt; And if you handle that correctly,
guess what,

180
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.880
they're gonna trust you
more the next time.

181
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.218
That decision needs to be made.

182
00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:16.391
So you're building trust over time if
you're not holding it over somebody else.

183
00:10:16.391 --> 00:10:20.226
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so it is all these things,
it's healthiness, and trust, and

184
00:10:20.226 --> 00:10:20.937
everything.

185
00:10:20.937 --> 00:10:24.243
And yeah,
being able to be vulnerable too, is like,

186
00:10:24.243 --> 00:10:27.921
I don't know how to write this,
or deal with this library.

187
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:29.299
Can you help me?

188
00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:32.007
And not feeling like you're
getting judged for that.

189
00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.989
Cuz we all have different skill sets and
as a team,

190
00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:37.263
we wanna lean on one another for that.

191
00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:43.707
&gt;&gt; Mistakes also produce growth
is something someone said, so

192
00:10:43.707 --> 00:10:47.951
then identifying them must be okay and
be available for

193
00:10:47.951 --> 00:10:51.469
learning or
places where the team can learn.

194
00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:55.791
Someone else said in their opinion, it
also means that people are not afraid to

195
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:59.012
prioritize input and
participate in the conversations.

196
00:10:59.012 --> 00:11:04.033
They know that they won't get
bashed when they make a mistake or

197
00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:09.635
when they even make the smallest
mistake and someone else responded.

198
00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.480
Feedback produces growth.

199
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.273
It's not necessarily a threat and

200
00:11:15.273 --> 00:11:19.469
it should be expected to be received.

201
00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:20.696
&gt;&gt; So many good points there.

202
00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:22.751
I have comments on a few of them.

203
00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:26.141
To the feedback one,
I truly believe feedback is a gift.

204
00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:28.418
It may seem cheesy, but it is.

205
00:11:28.418 --> 00:11:33.149
I'm not giving someone feedback
because I wanna slam them.

206
00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:36.316
I probably will avoid, if I don't want
someone to get better, I'm probably not

207
00:11:36.316 --> 00:11:39.268
gonna even bother giving the feedback
cuz it's not easy to give feedback.

208
00:11:39.268 --> 00:11:40.875
It is actually work.

209
00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:45.612
And to me, I'm like, I'm giving someone
feedback cuz I see something that I think

210
00:11:45.612 --> 00:11:48.738
they can do better at and
I want to help them get better.

211
00:11:48.738 --> 00:11:49.468
So that's a good one.

212
00:11:49.468 --> 00:11:54.328
And then on the mistakes,
I think about it is maybe as a leader,

213
00:11:54.328 --> 00:12:00.589
can you celebrate mistakes and really
just encourage that make that it's okay.

214
00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:03.843
I often try and just share my
own stupid mistakes and try and

215
00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:05.444
make people okay with that.

216
00:12:05.444 --> 00:12:09.892
And it's helpful to do that,is just
putting yourself out there and

217
00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:12.320
it encourages others to do the same.
