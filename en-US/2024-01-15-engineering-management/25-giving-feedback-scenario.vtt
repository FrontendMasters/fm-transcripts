00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.876
Now, just as much as
anything in management,

2
00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:05.250
it's hard to know what it looks like.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.412
So we're gonna do a little
bit of a scenario.

4
00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.065
All right, Jim, thank you for
joining me and yeah,

5
00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:17.062
you're my direct report today,
you're gonna be giving me feedback.

6
00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:20.250
The scenario is, well,
you're the engineer on my team.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
You're frustrated with a decision
that I've made as a manager to

8
00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.637
leverage a new technology.

9
00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:28.588
You have constructive feedback for me.

10
00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:32.594
Let's dive in.

11
00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:33.147
&gt;&gt; Think of this one.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.827
&gt;&gt; Maybe it's short sighted.

13
00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:41.965
I'm just saying that we should use,
let's talk front end.

14
00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:46.942
We should go use jquery,
this react isn't working.

15
00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:48.709
&gt;&gt; I've got a real one.

16
00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:54.149
Ryan, we spent all this
time talking about KPIs and

17
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.294
how to measure team performance for
the betterment of the team.

18
00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.660
And we all agreed,
we started doing that for a quarter.

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.288
And all of a sudden, we're using OKRs and
we're using this brand new tool.

20
00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:07.994
It just feels like it came out of nowhere,
what are we doing as a team?

21
00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:13.290
I don't feel like you're paying attention
to how much churn this causes us.

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.666
Also, I don't like your black shirt.

23
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.947
&gt;&gt; All right, well,
thank you for choice on colors.

24
00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:23.844
I am a fan of black, but I understand
that you might not like that color.

25
00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:28.328
All right, but
to the OKR piece, what are you

26
00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:33.122
finding that's causing the turn
&gt;&gt; I don't know how to use it,

27
00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:37.484
and it's slowing me down and I've heard
similar from other people in the team.

28
00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:41.683
&gt;&gt; You know what, that's something I've
been thinking about too is that I've

29
00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:45.494
noticed in some of our team meetings
that even as we're writing OKRs,

30
00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:49.070
that it feels like there's a lack
of clarity on how to write OKRs.

31
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.231
And I've been wondering if I've
sprung this on the team too early and

32
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:56.401
without actually educating
on how do we write OKRs?

33
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.242
Do you think that would have been more
helpful in this point if we spent a little

34
00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:00.915
bit more time as a team
working through that?

35
00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:06.323
If I was to say, let's maybe bring someone
on who knows how to write OKRs well and

36
00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:10.358
give us a presentation on that or
help us get better at that,

37
00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:14.742
would that be something that would
make it less feel less churn?

38
00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:16.693
&gt;&gt; That'd be helpful, but I think overall,

39
00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:18.762
there's just been a lot
of changes going on.

40
00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:22.182
And this just piles on on top of,
we're just trying to find direction for

41
00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:22.696
the team.

42
00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:25.864
So I think having some training
would help, but overall,

43
00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:29.819
I think there's a theme going on of just,
we can't find any stability.

44
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.243
&gt;&gt; What kind of changes do are you kind of
speaking to that maybe not making you feel

45
00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:34.788
stable?

46
00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:38.816
What's something I could do to
make it feel a little more stable?

47
00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:41.047
&gt;&gt; I had a parking space in
front of the building, and

48
00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:44.141
now they've done construction,
it's in the back of the building.

49
00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:46.439
So it's not really helping me, and

50
00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.815
the lunch menu just didn't
relate where I wanna be.

51
00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:54.932
But in seriousness, yeah, just in general,
the market's really uncertain.

52
00:02:54.932 --> 00:02:58.645
I have friends looking for jobs,
it's a tricky time to navigate.

53
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:03.217
And what I'm looking for
is just stability and inside our team.

54
00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:07.063
Yeah, what are ways we can
you can provide that for us?

55
00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:09.028
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean stability is good, right?

56
00:03:09.028 --> 00:03:15.280
And so I think anything that we can do
to feel better as a team, absolutely.

57
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.167
How are OKRs?

58
00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.388
That was kind of the problem
that you're really seen surface,

59
00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:21.648
how do you feel like that's not stability?

60
00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:25.510
Is it because it's yet another change
that we're doing as a team and

61
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.695
it might not feel like the right time?

62
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:31.566
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel like we're very
reactive to decisions made above us.

63
00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:35.386
And I know you feel that way too, you
mentioned in some of the team meetings.

64
00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:39.259
So it's just another change
in how we do things and yet

65
00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.504
another tool we have to learn.

66
00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:43.073
I just wanna get back to coding.

67
00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:48.257
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this seems to be eating a lot
of your time up is going through OKRs,

68
00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:49.480
is that correct?

69
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.643
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

70
00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:52.245
&gt;&gt; Okay, I definitely hear it.

71
00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:56.355
Do you think it was clear on
why we were trying to achieve,

72
00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:58.678
why we've started using OKRs?

73
00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:02.829
Was it clear to you on why
the goal was to leverage OKRs?

74
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.613
&gt;&gt; Not really, I could use a bit more
context around how we arrived here.

75
00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.976
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that was something
that I didn't do a good job of,

76
00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:14.212
is really making it clear that I felt like
our team wasn't really clear on the type

77
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.672
of work that we were doing.

78
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.784
We weren't really prioritizing
effectively, and it wasn't clear,

79
00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:21.023
what the impact was.

80
00:04:21.023 --> 00:04:26.306
And so me introducing OKRs was
a way to try and address that.

81
00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:31.147
But reflecting on it is, it could have
been better for me to one state that goal,

82
00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:35.196
and maybe not even state a solution,
maybe asking you all of like,

83
00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:37.397
how do you think we could do better?

84
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:41.067
Maybe it was we swung too far
into process where it was, yeah,

85
00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:43.405
we don't need to go all the way to OKRs.

86
00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:45.917
Maybe there's something
that I was missing and

87
00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:49.506
probably could have gathered more
input and feedback from you all.

88
00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.726
&gt;&gt; Thanks for listening,
Ryan, I do feel better.

89
00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:55.889
I know not everything's your fault, but
I appreciate you listening to my concerns.

90
00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.334
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for the feedback, Jim.

91
00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:00.644
This is super helpful,
I do want to try and

92
00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:04.943
address some of these things to make it
easier for you and the rest of the team.

93
00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:10.231
First off, I think just even educating
you all better on what's the approach for

94
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:14.293
writing better OKRs but
even what's the point of us doing it.

95
00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.427
I don't think that's been
clear what you're telling me.

96
00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:20.746
And I think that's a huge miss on my part,
so I need to circle back with a team and

97
00:05:20.746 --> 00:05:22.456
make sure that that's clear.

98
00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:25.779
And also ask for input and feedback
on how we can improve the process.

99
00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.182
We do need to improve our planning,
I do think that's important, but

100
00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:32.542
maybe there's something else that
I'm missing that could help us.

101
00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:35.154
Thank you for the feedback Jim.

102
00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:37.162
I'm gonna open up to the audiences.

103
00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:41.233
This was on the fly, so
I don't even know how I did on it, but

104
00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:45.565
I'm curious to know what do you
think worked in that scenario.

105
00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:47.127
What could have been better?

106
00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:51.290
Yeah, you heard Gemini run through that
scenario that was really on the fly.

107
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.137
And so, I would love to hear
you all witnessing that,

108
00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:57.490
what were some of the takeaways,
things that you felt worked,

109
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.107
things that you were maybe
unsure of questions.

110
00:06:00.107 --> 00:06:02.571
Feedback on how I could
have received that better,

111
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.051
how Jim could have delivered
the feedback better.

112
00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:06.705
Love to hear some thoughts.

113
00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:10.661
&gt;&gt; So I think you did a good job
Ryan of receiving that feedback.

114
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:15.264
But I was wondering for Jim was your
wording of not everything is your

115
00:06:15.264 --> 00:06:19.409
fault intentional, or
was that more just how it came out?

116
00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.279
&gt;&gt; There's intentional.

117
00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:25.138
Especially in the environment we're
in right now where there's a lot

118
00:06:25.138 --> 00:06:29.105
of changes happening and
a lot of technology companies.

119
00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:31.722
I know myself I've been
through a lot of re-orgs, so

120
00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:34.991
a lot of things that I have to
represent as the face of the business.

121
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.152
I have no control over
I just represent them.

122
00:06:37.152 --> 00:06:40.788
And that's that kind of scenario
is based on like scenarios

123
00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:44.361
I've actually experienced
where the team understands.

124
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:47.682
We're shifting directions we have
to change our how we report things.

125
00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:52.054
And they know it's not on me, but
being the face of the business,

126
00:06:52.054 --> 00:06:56.999
you deal with a lot of frustrations
that aren't necessarily your fault.

127
00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:02.972
So, the team does acknowledge that,
they're like, hey, I know it's on you and

128
00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:09.283
I'm venting, but what can you do to try
to make this a little bit easier for us.

129
00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:11.035
&gt;&gt; Couple comments.

130
00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:13.155
Firstly, Twitch chat
likes your black shirt.

131
00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:14.187
So-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

132
00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:14.687
&gt;&gt; Good,

133
00:07:14.687 --> 00:07:15.648
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

134
00:07:15.648 --> 00:07:16.419
&gt;&gt; One plus there.

135
00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.572
So, [LAUGH] someone commented,

136
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:23.517
just general comment, the way you
controlled the talk by navigating away

137
00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:28.065
from the other personal themes that
were bothering the engineer and

138
00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:33.066
kept focus on the initial issue was great.
And then kinda more generally,

139
00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:38.376
just when it comes to personal connections
that you might have with an engineer or

140
00:07:38.376 --> 00:07:42.985
team member, how do you manage
the boundaries in a relationship while

141
00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.813
giving or handling feedback.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good question.

142
00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:47.629
Honestly,

143
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:52.853
I could see some people maybe struggling
if you have personal connections or

144
00:07:52.853 --> 00:07:56.951
quote unquote friends.
I think it's good to kind

145
00:07:56.951 --> 00:08:00.980
of separate those things a little bit.

146
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.437
But in some ways, having strong
relationships with your team,

147
00:08:04.437 --> 00:08:06.280
you bond together as a team.

148
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.860
I think there's a lot of
benefits that come with that.

149
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.120
You trust your friends, right,
or you should, hopefully.

150
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.049
So I think you can build those
friendships, but you also have to

151
00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:20.586
recognize that you still might have
to have those tough conversations.

152
00:08:20.586 --> 00:08:24.145
I think that's okay, but
it's harder to navigate.

153
00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:27.899
I still think that it's possible,
some people will be like,

154
00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:29.999
don't hire friends and all that.

155
00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:34.585
Yeah, that can absolutely happen where
it doesn't work out, but maybe you can

156
00:08:34.585 --> 00:08:39.054
also talk about those things upfront if
you are to hire, truly hire a friend.

157
00:08:39.054 --> 00:08:42.448
I think oftentimes too, you become
friends with people you work with too.

158
00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:47.632
So it's not an easy thing to navigate,
but I think there's also benefits,

159
00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:50.924
there's trade-offs that
come along with it.

160
00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:51.866
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

161
00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.465
&gt;&gt; I think Jim started kind of broad,

162
00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:56.231
which I think is fine when
you're trying to give feedback.

163
00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:59.095
Maybe you don't really know
what you're getting at, but

164
00:08:59.095 --> 00:09:02.367
I thought you did a really good job
of asking follow up questions and

165
00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:06.179
trying to nail down of what the actual
issue is to then go ahead and solve that.

166
00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:11.321
And you also spoke aloud and
verbalize like ways you could do better.

167
00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:14.890
So it's more than like,
I think you're verbalizing that yes,

168
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.249
we can help you fix this issue, but I'll
also put in work to then make sure it's

169
00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:21.987
not an issue going forward for
other scenarios.

170
00:09:21.987 --> 00:09:25.761
&gt;&gt; Right, it was definitely a lot
of seeking to understand like,

171
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:28.077
t what is it about it but then also, yeah,

172
00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:31.946
trying to state back to here are some
things I think I could do to help.

173
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.672
And then also looking for maybe gems
like nah, that's not gonna help her.

174
00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:37.289
Yeah, maybe that would help,
let's try that.

175
00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:39.842
So yeah, good call out.

176
00:09:39.842 --> 00:09:41.301
Yeah.

177
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:45.307
&gt;&gt; I found that in asking those
clarifying follow up questions,

178
00:09:45.307 --> 00:09:48.167
I oftentimes am jumping
ahead a little bit.

179
00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:51.833
And perhaps being more direct or

180
00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:57.537
jumping to conclusions
the other person isn't,

181
00:09:57.537 --> 00:10:02.289
and sometimes that comes off as arguing or

182
00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:06.523
defensive without intending to be.

183
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:11.611
I've noticed one thing a leader in my org
does really well is prompting by asking,

184
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:16.405
I wanna ask some clarifying questions
could you help me better understand and

185
00:10:16.405 --> 00:10:18.640
kind of setting the table there to?

186
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.378
It's subtle and it's short,
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

187
00:10:23.378 --> 00:10:28.260
&gt;&gt; But as I've read things I've
understand stood that's really important

188
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.062
stuff that she does to make sure that,
we're clear that when I'm asking

189
00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:37.075
you questions here my goal is
not to justify my behavior, but

190
00:10:37.075 --> 00:10:42.453
to understand better what specifically is
the issue and how we might address it.

191
00:10:42.453 --> 00:10:46.771
&gt;&gt; I love that you called that out cuz
actually even in the moment there,

192
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:51.909
I was a little worried that my follow-up
questions might have come across a little

193
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:56.544
bit defensive or maybe like trying to
skate around it, or not take blame.

194
00:10:56.544 --> 00:10:59.003
But some of it was, and
I love that kind of stadium.

195
00:10:59.003 --> 00:11:02.307
Like here, I wanna better understand,
I thank you for the feedback.

196
00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:05.430
Even that I could have probably
started thanks for the feedback,

197
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.118
I wanna better understand that and so
I do have some follow-up questions, so

198
00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:11.410
it's not like I'm
attacking with questions.

199
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.537
I was trying to seek to understand, but

200
00:11:13.537 --> 00:11:16.964
I think that would have even
better delivery in that sense too.

201
00:11:16.964 --> 00:11:21.066
&gt;&gt; One other thing I liked that
you did was, you stood firm and

202
00:11:21.066 --> 00:11:26.610
clear on what the goal was,
even if the execution isn't always good.

203
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.819
We had a conversation about this we
recently changed our stand up format to be

204
00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:35.640
less like calling individuals and
more oriented towards sprinkles.

205
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.614
And, [COUGH] certainly our execution
on that has not been great.

206
00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:42.790
Our stand ups have actually gotten longer.

207
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.290
And we've had a lot of conversation back
and forth and retrospectives about that.

208
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.569
But I found that reiterating
what the goal is,

209
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:53.680
is to keep everyone
bought in on shipping and

210
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.147
on clarifying what our priorities are as
a team to help orient folks towards,

211
00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:04.020
I know this person is working on
that thing, how can I help them?

212
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:10.149
How can I identify when they need a review
or they need QA prioritize that.?

213
00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:14.613
Helps everyone understand that like, okay,
that gives good context for what we're

214
00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:18.777
trying to do, we're not just arbitrarily
changing process for the sake of it.

215
00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:22.153
And how we might be able to orient
things better towards that.

216
00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:26.335
Where maybe it just needs to be two
minutes at the beginning of standup to

217
00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:30.796
align on like, here's the top priority,
and here's the three tickets for

218
00:12:30.796 --> 00:12:34.441
that we don't need to go through
every ticket for every goal.

219
00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:37.332
And one other thing we eliminated
was just there were too many goals.

220
00:12:37.332 --> 00:12:39.835
&gt;&gt; Right, and
that obviously can be a painful thing too.

221
00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:44.254
And actually, even in that scenario,
I was taking ownership of maybe I

222
00:12:44.254 --> 00:12:47.653
didn't state the goal,
I just enforce some process.

223
00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:52.165
And it wasn't clear to the team
on what that goal was, but

224
00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:55.369
yeah, aligning on a goal that's huge.

225
00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:58.324
I think in terms of real
feedback on that feedback.

226
00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:00.675
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So we don't rehearse this, so

227
00:13:00.675 --> 00:13:04.465
it's totally,
he's just reacting to what I'm saying.

228
00:13:04.465 --> 00:13:08.196
I think there was an opportunity to
dive deeper there, where I was like,

229
00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:11.991
I'm generally frustrated with the company
and you represent the company

230
00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:16.301
rather than going to like, hey, I'll fix
the problem with like OKRs and tooling.

231
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:18.151
It's like, tell me more about that.

232
00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:18.974
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; What else?

233
00:13:18.974 --> 00:13:20.955
What can I do to provide more stability?

234
00:13:20.955 --> 00:13:24.950
And that's, sometimes people are upset
with you and something you did, or

235
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.832
should I say me?

236
00:13:25.832 --> 00:13:30.819
But sometimes it actually is something
else and because you are the business, and

237
00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:33.430
there's no one else to yell at sometimes.

238
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.104
That's their frustration,
it's coming through on other parts.

239
00:13:36.104 --> 00:13:40.749
And I'm not saying it's always not your
fault, but that's something it's tricky to

240
00:13:40.749 --> 00:13:44.327
navigate, to try to dive deep and
see what's really the problem.

241
00:13:44.327 --> 00:13:47.792
And if it is like something minor or
not minor, but something you did,

242
00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:49.868
then that's something you can address.

243
00:13:49.868 --> 00:13:53.755
Sometimes it's not, actually, a lot of
times it's not, it's something else.

244
00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:56.999
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think in those months
I've completely agree with what you had

245
00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:57.587
said there.

246
00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:58.704
And that's actually a good feedback.

247
00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:03.217
And I was actually purposeful of like,
that's gonna go really deep.

248
00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:08.557
And so I avoided that, but it's also
helpful too is oftentimes as leaders,

249
00:14:08.557 --> 00:14:11.239
sometimes this isn't our decision.

250
00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:14.226
You don't want to say,
I don't like the decision either,

251
00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:15.730
that's not a good reaction.

252
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.073
But we can empathize too, right?

253
00:14:18.073 --> 00:14:22.604
It's like trying to state the goal or
understand the goal of why we're trying

254
00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:26.714
to achieve it is, yeah, I'm a little
worried that it might not work,

255
00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:30.083
but how do we kind of get you
on board a little bit to try it?

256
00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:32.876
And we've kinda got to disagree and
commit, but

257
00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:36.164
also it's okay to empathize
with people in that moment.

258
00:14:36.164 --> 00:14:39.649
Especially if it is above you and
you can't do something,

259
00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:43.360
ultimately you don't want
a frustrated person on your team.

260
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.436
So you don't wanna empathize so
much so you're like, yeah,

261
00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:48.219
I'm frustrated too this is awful.

262
00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:52.172
This is gonna bomb, and
it's gonna be terrible, that's not great.

263
00:14:52.172 --> 00:14:56.707
But if you can try and orient around like,
yeah, I'm a little concerned too, but

264
00:14:56.707 --> 00:15:00.417
here's how I'm thinking about it or
I see where they're headed.

265
00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:07.494
It does help show empathy as a leader
without also just kind of piling on.

266
00:15:07.494 --> 00:15:11.759
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but nothing more frustrating than
when you're complaining to your manager,

267
00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:16.094
and just the company line 100%, just
like disregard everything you're saying.

268
00:15:16.094 --> 00:15:17.950
It's like well, yeah,
we got to do this and here's why.

269
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.656
And you're like,
I thought we had a relationship.

270
00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:24.892
And that like I found that erodes stress
really quickly if you're not like,

271
00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:25.959
yeah, I hear you.

272
00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:30.203
I hear you and it's been bumpy for me,
too but here's here's why I'm positive.

273
00:15:30.203 --> 00:15:35.144
I'd like to you said, you spin it at
the end of like, yeah, I hear you but

274
00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:37.260
here's what I think we can do.

275
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.274
&gt;&gt; Yeah., versus Jim,
just get on board, you got to do it.

276
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.789
That's not that helpful.

277
00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:43.595
&gt;&gt; You did well there, Ryan.

278
00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:44.749
I threw you a lot of hard curveballs.

279
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:46.087
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I appreciate it.

280
00:15:46.087 --> 00:15:47.678
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I actually appreciate the hard

281
00:15:47.678 --> 00:15:49.877
curveballs, it gets more realistic here.

282
00:15:49.877 --> 00:15:52.785
Emily.
&gt;&gt; Can I ask a general giving feedback

283
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:53.661
question?

284
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.946
&gt;&gt; Yes.

285
00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:58.038
&gt;&gt; You're giving feedback to someone.

286
00:15:58.038 --> 00:16:00.309
And maybe they have low confidence.

287
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:01.556
They take things personally.

288
00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.343
It's not that ideal scenario
how they're doing that.

289
00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:05.045
So they start crying in that scenario.

290
00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:10.021
What do you do in that scenario to kind of
address that and give them that space but

291
00:16:10.021 --> 00:16:11.522
also kind of handle it?

292
00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:14.554
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good question.

293
00:16:14.554 --> 00:16:19.151
Cuz yeah, we're people,
there's emotions right?

294
00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:20.540
Some of it, it's hard.

295
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.094
I think if in the moment, I mean, if
someone joins, say we're on a remote call

296
00:16:25.094 --> 00:16:29.234
and they join and they're upset for
you, you've even said feedback,

297
00:16:29.234 --> 00:16:33.585
don't give them feedback, right,
especially that critical feedback.

298
00:16:33.585 --> 00:16:38.349
But if you're giving feedback and
they're a bit upset, recognize that,

299
00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:41.763
you don't wanna be harsh,
you wanna be empathetic.

300
00:16:41.763 --> 00:16:44.542
But you don't wanna stop
to necessarily say, well,

301
00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:48.267
I just won't give them the feedback
because that's not right either.

302
00:16:48.267 --> 00:16:51.206
You still have to give that
timely feedback, it is very,

303
00:16:51.206 --> 00:16:52.441
very hard to navigate.

304
00:16:52.441 --> 00:16:55.953
I have been in that situation,
and it's tough.

305
00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:59.398
But I think it's still important for
you to talk through it.

306
00:16:59.398 --> 00:17:04.709
It might take more conversations to
is like, hey, it's gonna be too hard

307
00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:10.465
to talk through this right now, I want
you to have some time cuz you're a human.

308
00:17:10.465 --> 00:17:13.718
Empathize with them, what would you like
in that scenario and try and do that.

309
00:17:13.718 --> 00:17:17.245
Or even ask, should we try and
meet another time?

310
00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:20.879
I wanna give you space for that,
but you're still gonna meet, right?

311
00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:23.840
You're still gonna have to give that
feedback and you don't wanna avoid it.

312
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.672
That's easy, right?

313
00:17:24.672 --> 00:17:27.919
All right, cool, they're crying, I'm out.

314
00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:32.203
So I think that's how I would approach it,
it's really situational, but

315
00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:35.336
being prepared that, yeah,
people might get upset.

316
00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:37.721
It's tough to hear that critical feedback.

317
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:41.270
And when your job might be on the line,
that's tough.

318
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.563
So, yeah, you might run into that and so

319
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:48.160
I think it's just how would you like to
handle or be dealt with in that situation?
