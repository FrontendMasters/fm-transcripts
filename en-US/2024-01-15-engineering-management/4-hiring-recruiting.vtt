1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.560
All right, so we'll do a quick recap,
we've covered roadmaps,

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.489
creating team charter,
how to measure impact.

3
00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:18.424
Next, like I mentioned, yet at some point
in time you will be hiring for your team.

4
00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:20.691
Your team is really, really important,

5
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:23.233
you want to have the right
people on your team.

6
00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:25.309
And I can't stress this enough,

7
00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.470
I think that managers need to be
heavily involved in this process.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.197
I've been at companies where it's
maybe a little more like recruiting

9
00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:35.466
does everything.

10
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:40.372
You give input on it, but
they're doing a lot of that, that's fine,

11
00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:44.547
I think, but you still wanna try and
be as involved as much.

12
00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:49.292
I think it's a partnership between
a manager and recruiting and the team,

13
00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:49.826
right?

14
00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:53.409
The team definitely knows what they
need or who are the right people.

15
00:00:55.617 --> 00:01:02.270
So the way I think about hiring is like,
what are the first steps?

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.670
This is before I've even
written a job description.

17
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
I wanna start to think about what
are the skills that the team needs.

18
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.628
So I wanna outline the required
skills that I think are for the role,

19
00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:18.670
outline what experience is required.

20
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.922
Maybe it's no experience, maybe it's
a new college grad and that's okay for

21
00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:26.094
this particular role,
maybe I need someone very senior.

22
00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:29.976
It's important to think about and
just really understand how you're setting

23
00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:33.170
someone up for success and
what they're bringing for the team.

24
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.047
And there again, include your team, ask
them what skills would they like to see.

25
00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:42.427
Maybe it's like you're doing something
with GraphQL on the team, and

26
00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:45.055
everyone's doing it and kind of knows it,

27
00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:48.709
but it's fairly new to the team,
no one is the expert in it.

28
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.606
And they're like, you know what would be
really beneficial to up-level our team?

29
00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:56.138
Is having someone who has a lot
of expertise there, that's cool,

30
00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:58.925
like that's something good
to hear from your team.

31
00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:03.091
You may not get that on the higher, or
maybe it's not a prioritized thing, but

32
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.131
knowing that is very, very helpful.

33
00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:11.000
And then, maybe it's similar
to the Graph QL comment,

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.163
what's additive to your team, I think it's
really important to take a step back,

35
00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:19.443
look at your team,
what would be added to your time?

36
00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:23.699
And I don't mean necessarily on
the technical side, it could be,

37
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.744
what's the diversity and
make up of your team?

38
00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:30.175
What are some lived experiences
that might help you?

39
00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:35.536
When I think about working at Netflix
on the Netflix sign-up flows,

40
00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:39.426
we were building a lot of
experiences worldwide.

41
00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.923
We're dealing with
different payment methods,

42
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.771
there's things that I have no idea.

43
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.402
I haven't experienced what it's
like to live in India, but

44
00:02:47.402 --> 00:02:52.030
someone on my team has, and they can
definitely provide just things that they

45
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.681
didn't even know were helpful at the time.

46
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:58.854
And so I think about those types of
things too, is like, it's not necessarily

47
00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:02.963
a required skill, but it is something
that might be a very nice to have, and so

48
00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:06.620
I think these are important
things to think about.

49
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.660
The team dynamics,
how's the person gonna fit in the team?

50
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.320
What's the team culture?

51
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.680
What's maybe missing that could
maybe up level you in certain areas?

52
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.887
Maybe it's communication skills,

53
00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:22.680
maybe it's really good
written documentation skills.

54
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.965
I've definitely had that happen
where I've had an engineer who's so

55
00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:31.978
passionate about writing documentation and
it up-leveled the rest of the team,

56
00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.753
and so that's additive, that's awesome.

57
00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:38.960
Maybe it's leadership skills,
I think this is an awesome one.

58
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.110
Not everyone on the team is
gonna want to lead a project or

59
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.750
mentor certain things, it's fine.

60
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.711
There's make-ups of people, what they
wanna do, and you lean on them for

61
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.250
the skills that they want.

62
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.684
But I absolutely believe as a manager,

63
00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:58.950
you are very successful when
you have leaders on the team.

64
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.420
And it doesn't have to be
an official title, but

65
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.699
it's people that are doing certain things
that you can delegate or lean on them, and

66
00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.069
it's growth opportunities for
them as well.

67
00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:14.664
Maybe before I dive into
the job description,

68
00:04:14.664 --> 00:04:17.551
what are some things that you
think would be helpful or

69
00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.223
additive when you're thinking
about adding someone to your team?

70
00:04:21.223 --> 00:04:25.183
&gt;&gt; I think I'm just a girl that lived
experiences, since I do work in

71
00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:30.007
a very niche science field, I've hired
people in the past who went to school for

72
00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:33.257
things like pre-med and
then did coding boot camps.

73
00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:37.361
And they have that science background, and
that knowledge is something that you can't

74
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:40.866
just replicate, and so that's
something that's been really valuable.

75
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.079
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I even like that of
the educational side too,

76
00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:48.764
because I'm not a believer that as
a software engineer you need a CS degree.

77
00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:53.289
It definitely helps in many ways,
but I've seen people be so

78
00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.115
successful from self-taught
to from a boot camp.

79
00:04:57.115 --> 00:05:01.512
And maybe that's bringing different
perspectives for your team too,

80
00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:05.110
my productivity engineering
team creates a lot of tools.

81
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.057
Maybe it's like just having a different
perspective on how a tool is being

82
00:05:09.057 --> 00:05:11.667
ingested by someone coming
out of a boot camp, so

83
00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:13.978
I love that one, that's a great call out.

84
00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:17.617
&gt;&gt; Like remote aspects come into
play of time zones or countries or-

85
00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.874
&gt;&gt; Yes, how did I miss that one?

86
00:05:19.874 --> 00:05:23.950
Thank you, yes, remote,
absolutely a factor.

87
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.459
That's something that for me,
I've been at Netflix for a while now,

88
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:32.980
I think it's over eight years, and
for a long time we're not remote.

89
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.443
And so this is absolutely,
I take into a lot of thought into this,

90
00:05:37.443 --> 00:05:39.887
now is most of my team is now remote.

91
00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:41.704
And time zones are a factor,

92
00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:45.358
even sometimes I already have
someone in that time zone.

93
00:05:45.358 --> 00:05:50.269
Is that gonna be a good area where maybe
they're the only one on the east coast, so

94
00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:53.808
it would be nice to have more
people on that same timezone,

95
00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:55.730
that's a great call out.

96
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.738
Also someone with experience
working heavily remote,

97
00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:02.080
or someone that having
experience working open source.

98
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.232
There's a lot of these things that
can just make your team better and

99
00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:08.661
they will uplevel and bring ideas that
you may just not have thought of, so

100
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.240
good getting back to
that lived experience.

101
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.822
Great call out on the remote,

102
00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:15.806
that is something that we need
to think a lot more about.

103
00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:21.589
Obviously there's been companies for
many years that are heavily remote,

104
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:26.015
but being have hybrid or
remote, that's a newer thing for

105
00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:30.646
companies and so it is really
helpful to have that skill set.

106
00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:34.697
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You might be covering this later,

107
00:06:34.697 --> 00:06:39.626
I'm not sure, but
I think looking at budgeting constraints,

108
00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:44.741
comp guidelines and market conditions
is also a factor here where

109
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:49.396
maybe you can't hire on the upper
end of comp in the market.

110
00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:54.007
But the skills you're expecting
are outside of that range, so

111
00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:58.270
you need to adjust to say,
okay, this is probably gonna be

112
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.055
very difficult to find someone in
this range with the skill set and

113
00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:08.900
setting expectations appropriately around
like, how soon do we need to hire?

114
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.060
How long do we have to find that person?

115
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.592
Stuff like that.

116
00:07:11.592 --> 00:07:14.211
&gt;&gt; Absolutely,
budget plays heavily into this,

117
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.725
these are all factors that can change how
you think about it, but also maybe to have

118
00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:22.733
that hard conversation with a leader
of like, do we need this skill set?

119
00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:26.795
The budget that I've been provided
doesn't help me, I gotta go higher, so

120
00:07:26.795 --> 00:07:29.657
you can have that conversation and
get ahead of that.

121
00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:34.273
Not waiting till the like offer stage and
going like I have this great candidate.

122
00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:36.706
No, you can't hire them Ryan,
or you can't pay them that,

123
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.790
you're gonna have to lowball them,
that is really helpful to think about.

124
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.325
Mark.

125
00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:46.310
&gt;&gt; Meg says, we look for
complementary skills,

126
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:52.353
if there's five primary skills needed for
my team, I don't just look for

127
00:07:52.353 --> 00:07:56.850
generalists in all five skills,
or all specialists.

128
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.080
Some specialists and some generalists.

129
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.371
&gt;&gt; Right, that's a great call out, maybe
you have someone who's a CSS expert or

130
00:08:05.371 --> 00:08:10.539
an accessibility expert, and
that up levels the team, right?

131
00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:12.080
Definitely you learn from them,

132
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.837
and that not honestly that
helps your culture too, right?

133
00:08:14.837 --> 00:08:17.040
We all wanna learn from one another.

134
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.414
Mark.

135
00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:22.529
&gt;&gt; The way that I always describe it
personally is, in the early stages of

136
00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:26.736
the startup ecosystem,
it's like you're looking for generalists.

137
00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:32.565
But also you kind of have to play on
who is interested in your project,

138
00:08:32.565 --> 00:08:35.681
your product and that kind of thing,

139
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:40.319
you can't really say I want
this very specific skill.

140
00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:46.237
It reminds me of professional sports where
you have the teams that have huge budgets,

141
00:08:46.237 --> 00:08:50.262
so they can be like,
I want this person, at this height and

142
00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:53.074
this weight and this position exactly.

143
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.570
And they can just hire for
the very specific and

144
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.644
fit the team together with
a very specific set of skills.

145
00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:03.692
Whereas somebody who has less
budget has to be more scrappy and

146
00:09:03.692 --> 00:09:09.516
kind of focus on, okay,
I'm seeing this person's skills aptitude,

147
00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:14.194
recognizing that and
doing more with less kind of thing.

148
00:09:14.194 --> 00:09:19.684
And seeing like, hiring for
aptitude more than the specific skillset,

149
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:24.544
because you're not gonna be able
to hire exactly the team makeup

150
00:09:24.544 --> 00:09:28.054
that you want in the early days,
especially.

151
00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:32.678
&gt;&gt; I think even that larger, it's hard to
even find that exact specific of height,

152
00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.330
and obviously we're not hiring for
height and

153
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.790
stuff like that in software engineering.

154
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.676
But yeah, I love that point,
and often even sports teams,

155
00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:45.328
they have a budget and
they can blow it all on one player,

156
00:09:45.328 --> 00:09:49.862
that doesn't make it that they're
gonna win all the games, maybe.

157
00:09:49.862 --> 00:09:53.193
But they have to think tactically
about how they spend that money and

158
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:56.350
what's the makeup of the team,
it's not just one single hire,

159
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.708
you have to think more broadly,
so I love that.

160
00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:03.976
&gt;&gt; Some coaches really thrive in that kind
of very specific, setting up the team

161
00:10:03.976 --> 00:10:08.932
in a more specific way, and some
coaches thrive in that aptitude space.

162
00:10:08.932 --> 00:10:14.214
&gt;&gt; I'm a big fan of hiring for aptitude,
I think I tend to lean more towards that.

163
00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:18.374
Obviously there's this core set
of skills that you need, but

164
00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:22.134
someone who has a lot of aptitude,
can learn quickly and

165
00:10:22.134 --> 00:10:25.828
they're hungry to learn,
those things are awesome.

166
00:10:25.828 --> 00:10:30.589
And so, yeah, I'm really glad
that Mark called that one out.

167
00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:32.787
&gt;&gt; A lot of things can be taught,
domain knowledge and

168
00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:34.130
certain skills can be taught.

169
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.536
However, culture and attitude and
communication skills,

170
00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:40.616
sometimes it's harder to
teach some of those things.

171
00:10:40.616 --> 00:10:45.494
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, let's use
Mark's analogy on the sports team,

172
00:10:45.494 --> 00:10:50.202
it's like you have that superstar,
some of them are really nice,

173
00:10:50.202 --> 00:10:52.495
some of them are jerks, right?

174
00:10:52.495 --> 00:10:54.120
Do you want that on your team?

175
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.160
Right?

176
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.912
But that can really actually,
even if you have the top superstar,

177
00:10:58.912 --> 00:11:03.273
rock star engineer, whatever all the gross
terms that get thrown out there.

178
00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:07.688
It doesn't matter if the rest
of the team can't perform and

179
00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:10.879
work as a team or unit, that's not great.

180
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:11.431
Yeah.

181
00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:16.001
&gt;&gt; That's why hearing is so
tricky on the general versus specialists,

182
00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:21.302
it's like you don't want a team involves
a project manager or stuff like that.

183
00:11:21.302 --> 00:11:24.852
Cuz you already uncovered at that point,
and you're like, I love my project

184
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:28.306
manager, and it's cool, but you need
to actually do some poll requests.

185
00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:31.206
But you also don't want a team
of nobodies project managing,

186
00:11:31.206 --> 00:11:34.410
because then that's on you,
and that's wasting time.

187
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.778
So hiring is so tricky cuz you really
have to understand your team and

188
00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:41.070
then what the role is and
what's coming in the business.

189
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.344
And I'm with you on the hiring for
aptitude, you want someone who's

190
00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:47.915
adaptable, not someone who's like,
yeah, they can do the job today.

191
00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:52.082
I see so many companies are like, yeah,
react specialist versus how do you know

192
00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:55.120
what technology you're
gonna be using next year.

193
00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.040
And someone's like, I only do react, which
I've seen plenty of times people are like,

194
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.044
I only do this, and that's not helpful for
me as we grown business with him.

195
00:12:04.044 --> 00:12:06.680
&gt;&gt; Adaptability, yeah, huge.

196
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.801
Also, I like, Gem,
what you were starting to get at too, and

197
00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:11.543
I didn't really put this in here,

198
00:12:11.543 --> 00:12:15.290
is thinking about where are we next year,
where are we two years from now.

199
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.497
And it's hard, it's really hard as
a leader to know all those details, but

200
00:12:19.497 --> 00:12:24.037
thinking about those things in the makeup
of your team is absolutely something you

201
00:12:24.037 --> 00:12:25.049
wanna try and do.

202
00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:26.611
You can get it wrong, but

203
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:31.225
I think thinking about today I absolutely
need someone who knows react and

204
00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:35.778
we're starving for that maybe, but
also are you gonna need that later?

205
00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:37.282
Is that still gonna pan out?

206
00:12:37.282 --> 00:12:41.559
You wanna think about those things,
it might still be I need that hire today.

207
00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:45.438
But it's just really taking that
reflection time, not just like,

208
00:12:45.438 --> 00:12:48.444
like I said,
it's a partnership with recruiting.

209
00:12:48.444 --> 00:12:51.530
Is you can give them a list of skill sets
and they're gonna go find you people.

210
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.319
Absolutely, but if you can start
to have conversations with them,

211
00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:58.850
even talking about, well,
this would be additive to my team.

212
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.061
Maybe it is like I don't wanna
pick too much on even gender,

213
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:10.024
but software engineering has
typically oriented heavier

214
00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.971
on male versus a female engineer.

215
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:17.832
And maybe you want more of those different
perspectives, and so maybe you spend more

216
00:13:17.832 --> 00:13:22.230
time looking and sourcing for candidates
that you don't have on your team.
