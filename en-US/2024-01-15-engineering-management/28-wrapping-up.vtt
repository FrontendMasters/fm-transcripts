00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.280
All right, we're coming to the end of
practical engineering management 102.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.616
I hope there's been some really good
takeaways, people have learned something.

3
00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:16.620
I just wanna recap that
we've covered quite a bit.

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.574
Jim got us from 101 to starting
that being the manager and

5
00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:24.369
then we picked up where how to
set up our team for success,

6
00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.620
dealing with roadmaps,
dealing with setting a vision.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.970
And we talked about hiring,
interviewing practices, networking.

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.350
And then we talked about how building up
partnerships and why that's important.

9
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.240
And then really, how do we give and
receive feedback?

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.425
And then lastly,
how to deal with change management and

11
00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.970
make sure that we are helping
our team through those changes.

12
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.370
I wanna thank everyone for just joining
me and going through this course.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.680
I want it to be a helpful resource.

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.720
It's great hearing a lot of the audience
participation and input, right?

15
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.940
This is not something
that's one size fits all.

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.397
Everything has these different
situations and it's so

17
00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:10.110
helpful for us to kind of share our
thoughts and input on various scenarios.

18
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.928
So I'm really thankful for

19
00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:15.990
the participation cuz I think
that makes us all better.

20
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.122
Now I wanna leave you all with
some leadership resources.

21
00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:22.452
There's a lot of amazing
resources out there.

22
00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:28.840
I actually have compiled a big list
that I continually add to on Github.

23
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.410
It is just a read me.

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.555
But it has a list of articles and
books, podcasts, videos,

25
00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:36.990
various things on leadership.

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.514
And I think that it is really
helpful to always be learning or

27
00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:43.290
just getting different perspectives.

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.901
I know in Jim's one-on-one course,
he talked about the one book,

29
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:50.290
the first 90 days,
we're he didn't find it that useful.

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.811
That's okay cuz it was some other
perspective that he's like.

31
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:54.930
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

32
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.580
Maybe he took away two points out of it.

33
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.330
And that's all, that's cool.

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.520
That's like I think is really helpful.

35
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.720
It's great to kind of always be
checking and learning on these things.

36
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.008
So I have a laundry list of that and I've
called out a few books that I found really

37
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.310
useful throughout my time and ones that I
would maybe if even gone back and read.

38
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.680
One of my favorites, radical candor.

39
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.680
This gets out a lot about giving and
receiving feedback is so well done.

40
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.717
Kim Scott walks you through like a lot of
tactical advice on how to provide feedback

41
00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:33.270
and have those hard conversations, so
I highly recommend checking that one.

42
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.101
And then our friend Sarah Drasner, and
actually a teacher on Frontend Masters

43
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:44.760
has written an excellent book that I
feel is it does a really good job.

44
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.636
Of highlighting management for managers,
but also for engineers who just want

45
00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:54.673
better insights into what being a leader
looks like, how they can show up better.

46
00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.532
There's a lot of really good
information on this book

47
00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:06.598
The Manager's Path, I think this was one
that I read fairly early in my career and

48
00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:08.090
it has been a while.

49
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.047
I don't think I've gone back to it,
but I have often given advice for

50
00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:13.080
newer managers.

51
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.670
I'm pretty sure I've even
told Gem about this one.

52
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.022
that there was some really good advice in
this book to just read covers a lot of

53
00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:23.354
different different tact techniques and
being a leader,

54
00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:26.320
so I highly recommend
checking that one out.

55
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.470
And then finally, a parenting book.

56
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.710
Well, how's this leadership?

57
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.800
Well, this is absolutely
one of my favourite books.

58
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.940
Yes, I'm a parent and I believe I
read it because of being a parent.

59
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.569
And yeah, okay, my direct reports
are not kids, but I think there's so

60
00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.462
many great tactics for
just how to communicate better in this,

61
00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:55.107
how to talk so kids will listen and
listen so kids will talk.

62
00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:56.770
This is really valuable.

63
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.453
I honestly think everyone
should read this and

64
00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:02.148
it would just make you
a better communicator.

65
00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:04.510
You don't have to be a leader or
a manager.

66
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.860
It just honestly helps
with any relationship or

67
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.650
conversation that you're having, so
I highly recommend checking that one out.

68
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.520
Thank you for
attending Practical Engineering

69
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.155
102, thank you all.

70
00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:24.678
