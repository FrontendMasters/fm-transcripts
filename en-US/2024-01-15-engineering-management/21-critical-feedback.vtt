00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.910
How do you approach having critical
feedback and having those conversations?

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.082
I think it's important to think
about setting up the space for

3
00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:13.987
having the critical feedback,
making sure that people are in

4
00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:17.835
the right headspace to receive,
this is really important.

5
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.700
It can be tricky because sometimes
they're not in the right place for a bit.

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.970
You need to try and navigate,
like you need to give the feedback,

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.040
like you do still have to deliver that.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.903
But if someone's having a hard time, maybe
they have dealing with family issues,

9
00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:33.600
who knows?

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.230
There's a lot of things,
we're dealing with people, right?

11
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.940
Maybe you wanna say like,
I'm not gonna give that to them right now,

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.140
that's not gonna be
helpful in this moment.

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.880
But there's ways in which you should check
in, is this person ready for feedback?

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.398
And there again,
our nice little assume best intent, right?

15
00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:55.656
Even when I'm giving someone critical
feedback, I wanna assume that they're

16
00:00:55.656 --> 00:01:00.756
mean well, and that if they made mistakes,
I wanna try and approach it with,

17
00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:05.943
this person, they're doing their best and
I wanna try and treat it like that.

18
00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:09.223
When you're giving critical feedback,

19
00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:13.916
this is so important,
be as clear and concise as possible.

20
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.451
Leaving ambiguity is so hard.

21
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:22.114
And my team knows this, is like if I'm
saying you are not meeting expectations on

22
00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:28.070
said thing, it's taken a lot more serious
than I think you could improve on that.

23
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.010
Those are two different things,
and I make sure that that's clear.

24
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.487
I talked about that before they even
have to hear critical feedback, but

25
00:01:34.487 --> 00:01:37.340
I'll reinforce that it's clear and
concise as possible.

26
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.540
I've made mistakes where
it hasn't been clear.

27
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.469
I'm always trying to tighten that up and
make it as clear as possible.

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.819
You wanna frame the feedback, I think
Jem mentioned this, is in observation.

29
00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.517
So I might focus in like, I've noticed
you're missing some timelines lately and

30
00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:56.838
I'm kind of worried about that.

31
00:01:56.838 --> 00:01:58.678
Is that something you're noticing too?

32
00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:02.852
And this opens it up a little bit where
maybe there is an external factor that I'm

33
00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:06.153
just unaware of this person
struggling with something, and so

34
00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:07.852
we can kinda talk through that.

35
00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:11.495
I can still see say, well,
you're not meeting my expectations,

36
00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.912
but it will change up
on how I approach that.

37
00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:17.379
If someone's dealing with some
major issue, it's like all right,

38
00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.466
I don't need to pile on for them, and like
we can work through this in other ways.

39
00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:26.090
So I do like to approach it with
that curiosity and ask you like,

40
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.870
share my observation, but then also get
their input and understanding on it.

41
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.030
You wanna provide concrete examples.

42
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.823
This one's tough, I think, too,
in the sense that I think sometimes you

43
00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:43.910
can get over prescriptive on examples or
people get hung up on the examples.

44
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.904
I still find sometimes I
don't find the right balance.

45
00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:50.568
Sometimes people are like, well,
I need more concrete examples.

46
00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:54.672
Or, yeah, that's a lot,
they focus too much on the example and

47
00:02:54.672 --> 00:02:56.700
not more on the common theme.

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.331
I still struggle with this one, but
I think it is really helpful to speak to

49
00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:03.157
examples, especially ones
that are more in the moment.

50
00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:08.054
Not, hey, six months ago you did this,
that's not good, that is not helpful.

51
00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:12.790
People forget, or it's also why didn't
you give me that feedback six months ago?

52
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.356
So timely feedback is good too.

53
00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:17.911
Be empathetic.

54
00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:21.951
Understand that maybe this person was
a high performer on your team and

55
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.671
now they're not doing well.

56
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:28.344
Well, okay, let's seek to understand,
and these are people we're dealing with.

57
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:34.308
.Be patient, have an open dialogue,
have discussion,

58
00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:38.350
hear them out, understand,
approach it with curiosity.
