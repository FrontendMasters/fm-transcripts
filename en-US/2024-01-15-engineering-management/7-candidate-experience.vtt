1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.925
All right, we kind of touched
a little bit on this but

2
00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.645
think about the candidate experience.

3
00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:11.221
Says a lot about your company and
you as a manager, your team,

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:15.190
the candidate should
absolutely be evaluating you.

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.430
There's a lot of jobs out there,
why do they wanna come work with you?

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.857
And oftentimes, I actually like
when I'm interviewing someone and

7
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:27.372
they have five other opportunities
that they're interviewing for.

8
00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:32.103
The way I think about it is, I don't
need to try and overly prescriptively

9
00:00:32.103 --> 00:00:37.040
convince them that my team is the best
one and you need to come to there.

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.720
It's I want them to opt
into what's best for them.

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.030
And if it is us, that's great.

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.511
It's gonna be more successful and so

13
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.403
I wanna provide a great candidate
experience, I wanna be transparent.

14
00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:53.110
Responding in a timely fashion.

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.206
I gotta admit,

16
00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:59.442
I feel this one I'm probably not the best
at I think every one of us isn't.

17
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:03.915
Because when you're the candidate and
you're interviewing somewhere,

18
00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:06.740
you wanna hear back as soon as possible.

19
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.070
But there's things internally
that are slowing you down.

20
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.238
That person's not the most
top of mind thing.

21
00:01:13.238 --> 00:01:16.406
You are trying to hire but
you still have your team,

22
00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:20.458
you still have project meetings,
there's still work going on or

23
00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:24.810
you are waiting on feedback
from other people who are busy.

24
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.670
So you wanna think about this is,
how can I be responding?

25
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.851
And maybe it is,
I'm still waiting on some feedback,

26
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:36.069
I was hoping to come back to you sooner,
haven't forgotten about you but

27
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.269
staying in communication
with people goes a long way.

28
00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:47.067
Let candidates know who they're meeting,
right?

29
00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:48.026
Who are they meeting?

30
00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:49.940
They can look them up on LinkedIn,
that's awesome.

31
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.134
Actually, even on my job
descriptions I've often put,

32
00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.005
who are some of the team members?

33
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.572
You kinda good to know that,
it's nice to kind of be

34
00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:00.943
transparent get some of those
insights into people ahead of time.

35
00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:03.864
You are prepared,
I'm meeting with the VP of engineering,

36
00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.570
all right,
what's the conversation gonna look like?

37
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.330
That's a little bit different
than someone who's on the team,

38
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.180
what types of questions should I ask them?

39
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.484
That's really nice to help a candidate.

40
00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:21.616
Be very explicit, clear,
set clear timelines and expectations.

41
00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:27.469
We talked a little bit about that even
just in doing a technical exercise.

42
00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.250
Do you have to have it completely
polished, could it be pseudocode?

43
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.762
Does it have to be fully working,
what are you looking,

44
00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:38.896
what are you evaluating for,
does it have to have tests, right?

45
00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:41.855
Yeah, call it out, just be clear on that.

46
00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:46.775
And it really helps people show their best
work and sometimes it may not meet the bar

47
00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:50.785
and that's okay but at least you're
setting them up for success.

48
00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:56.715
Let candidates know
what you're evaluating.

49
00:02:56.715 --> 00:03:01.218
You don't have to be really
specific on this, but yeah, you're,

50
00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:05.174
I want you to be able to communicate
your skills in this way.

51
00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:09.418
Or I'm gonna be evaluating how you
partner with the rest of the team or

52
00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:14.340
how you collaborate, that's an important
skill set that we need on this team.

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.355
And so we will be evaluating that.

54
00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:20.828
Even when I'm interviewing for
other teams, I called out the partnership

55
00:03:20.828 --> 00:03:25.665
example cuz I feel that's what I'm always
thrown on as a partner of other teams.

56
00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:30.029
And I start my interviews of going,
I'm evaluating for partnerships.

57
00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.520
We're gonna be talking about how you
collaborate with a team like mine and

58
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.113
how you think about that,

59
00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:40.398
and I'm just explaining what I'm
even gonna be asking questions on.

60
00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:44.658
I also even say leaving time for
questions, right?

61
00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:48.700
When you're interviewing people, we've all
been there, we're we have one minute left,

62
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.446
what kind of questions do you have for me?

63
00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.304
&gt;&gt; That's not a great
candidate experience.

64
00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:58.208
So I've oftentimes called it out at
the start where I'm we're gonna talk for

65
00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.452
about 30 minutes and
then I'm gonna watch time,

66
00:04:01.452 --> 00:04:04.939
the last 10,
15 minutes you can ask me questions.

67
00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.716
Sometimes it's not perfect but
I like to try and hit the ten mark and

68
00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:12.444
I will stop my questions if I have
to just to give people that time.

69
00:04:12.444 --> 00:04:14.874
I also evaluate the questions
that I'm asked.

70
00:04:14.874 --> 00:04:17.591
So I think it is a valuable thing and
it's helpful for the candidate.

71
00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:24.516
I think we just came up a little bit
earlier, but provide options for

72
00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:26.390
the technical exercise.

73
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.832
People prefer certain things,
don't throw them off their game,

74
00:04:30.832 --> 00:04:33.760
live coding it can be a daunting thing.

75
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.360
Not everyone's all for it.

76
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.960
How many times do you live code and
your work today as an engineer,

77
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.340
you're not doing that.

78
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.900
So you're already in a bit
different environment interviewing.

79
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.555
So what can you do to just try and

80
00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.563
help people really be able to
show up as their best self?

81
00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:55.778
Close out with candidates.

82
00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:57.065
I know sometimes this can be hard.

83
00:04:57.065 --> 00:05:00.484
If they've interviewed with you,
please, please close out with them.

84
00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:04.906
If they've applied, not all companies
obviously can get back to everyone just

85
00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:07.660
because you applied
that you weren't a fit.

86
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.890
Some companies are good about it,
some are not.

87
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.348
But I definitely think if they've
spent the time talking with you and

88
00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:16.420
you're not wanting to move forward,
close out with them.

89
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.673
And then this one for

90
00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:21.809
some reason is a little bit of
a spicy topic is providing feedback.

91
00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.892
Some companies say that they
legally don't wanna do that and

92
00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:29.610
that it can get them in trouble, I've
heard all sorts of stories around that.

93
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.946
But I think it's so
important to provide a candidate feedback,

94
00:05:32.946 --> 00:05:34.900
what could they have done better?

95
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.920
What were you looking for
that they maybe just didn't do great on?

96
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.057
I see this because they've spent time
to interview with you and your company,

97
00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:44.970
feedback as a gift.

98
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.740
It helps people get better.

99
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.324
And not only that, I think it's
helpful for you and your company,

100
00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:54.804
is I've seen this at Netflix, where I've
interviewed someone, they were good,

101
00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.470
maybe just not the right time.

102
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.630
They needed to grow in some areas.

103
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.630
I gave them feedback, a year or
two later, they come back to me.

104
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.780
I have an open role and
they want to interview again.

105
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.910
That's awesome, they've gotten
some feedback to work on that.

106
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.429
And those candidates that I've talked to,
I'm cool, I look at my notes,

107
00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:17.826
I'm I gave you feedback that
you need to do x, y, and z.

108
00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:21.977
What's changed,
how have you grown in that area?

109
00:06:21.977 --> 00:06:25.012
So it's helpful for me too, but
it's also helpful for that candidate.

110
00:06:27.918 --> 00:06:32.125
All right, kind of the recap of different
things that I think about building

111
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.583
a candidate experience.

112
00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:37.223
I'm curious on the audience, what
are things that you would like to see or

113
00:06:37.223 --> 00:06:40.808
would make, maybe it's things you've
experienced where a company's

114
00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:44.997
done something for you that you're, wow,
that was awesome, a great experience.

115
00:06:44.997 --> 00:06:46.468
What are things that could be better?

116
00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:52.854
I don't think I covered them all so.

117
00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:03.460
&gt;&gt; The timely feedback is one that
a lot of people miss, I miss on it too.

118
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.901
It's so hard to there's so

119
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:08.857
many other things going on as an
engineering manager that you just forget.

120
00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:12.237
So it's really you have to have a lot
of empathy and being, they don't know

121
00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:15.792
everything that's going on, the processes,
you may have paperwork going.

122
00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:16.560
&gt;&gt; Yep.

123
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.982
&gt;&gt; So really have to put in
a lot of effort to do that.

124
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.707
The feedback one, I do it.

125
00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:27.785
But it takes so
much time to write feedback for

126
00:07:27.785 --> 00:07:32.321
people because earlier my career
when I was hiring I didn't filter

127
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.885
the feedback from the team
even on technical stuff.

128
00:07:35.885 --> 00:07:37.570
And it's copy paste it.

129
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.913
And then it ended up a long
argument with someone.

130
00:07:39.913 --> 00:07:40.539
&gt;&gt; Yep.

131
00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:41.800
&gt;&gt; I did this, and this and this.

132
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.660
So lesson learned there was just,
I have to filter the feedback and be,

133
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.690
what's the overall themes?

134
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.086
I don't copy paste specific things that
people said cuz they can take the wrong

135
00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:54.400
way cuz they don't know me or the team.

136
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.099
But that takes time.

137
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:55.732
&gt;&gt; Yep.

138
00:07:55.732 --> 00:07:59.802
I tried to give it back but I understand
why companies are hesitant to provide

139
00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:03.427
feedback cuz some people are just
gonna argue with you and you're,

140
00:08:03.427 --> 00:08:05.161
look, I'm trying to help you.

141
00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:09.221
It's already a no, so you're not
gonna argue your way back in but.

142
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:11.504
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's such a balance.

143
00:08:11.504 --> 00:08:16.743
Yeah, people are tricky bit to deal with,
especially during interviews.

144
00:08:16.743 --> 00:08:17.587
&gt;&gt; I like that you called that out.

145
00:08:17.587 --> 00:08:21.750
And I'm granted, I've definitely made
similar mistakes where I've shared

146
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.095
the feedback, and it hasn't landed well.

147
00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:26.843
And I've gotten better
at how I share that.

148
00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:30.200
But also, I think feedback is important.

149
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.533
Definitely is an important factor
is to be able to give feedback but

150
00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:36.500
also you want people to be
able to receive feedback.

151
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.390
We're all growing, we're all learning.

152
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.763
That's an important factor and so Gem in
that case where someone's arguing with you

153
00:08:42.763 --> 00:08:46.550
or dismissive or those types of things,
it's pretty telling.

154
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.814
I'm yeah, this now the true
colors to come out and so

155
00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:53.146
maybe I don't revisit that
candidate two years from now or

156
00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:56.691
a year or whatever,
because that's an important skill set.

157
00:08:56.691 --> 00:09:00.795
And, or maybe I still revisit, but
I'm gonna be bringing that up as,

158
00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:04.008
you weren't great at being
able to receive feedback.

159
00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:06.377
It wasn't a productive conversation.

160
00:09:06.377 --> 00:09:10.151
&gt;&gt; And people forget we have candidate
tracking systems where we keep records of

161
00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:10.913
these things.

162
00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:12.212
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So we look it up later,

163
00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:14.363
and I think people don't remember that.

164
00:09:14.363 --> 00:09:18.818
We keep a very long record of what
people said and how they acted and

165
00:09:18.818 --> 00:09:23.970
if they didn't get the job,
it pops up later and we're, no.

166
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.130
Cuz I see what Ryan wrote
about them three years ago.

167
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.009
And I can see if that changed, but

168
00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:32.782
some things just really hard to
get past if they haven't evolved.

169
00:09:32.782 --> 00:09:35.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's a hand here.

170
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:40.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna mention,
when you were talking about setting clear

171
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.881
timelines, specifically during interview,
let's say we've got a phone call

172
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:48.830
that's scheduled for 60 or
90 minutes or whatever.

173
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.900
I always ask if they have a hard stop or
be clear that I have a hard

174
00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:00.062
stop if I do because sometimes
the conversation is really, really great.

175
00:10:00.062 --> 00:10:04.124
And we're both asking
great follow up questions,

176
00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:08.570
probing questions,
learning more about one another.

177
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.050
So it's nice to know if you got an extra
five, eight minutes to bleed over.

178
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.260
&gt;&gt; I like that, yeah, just even calling
that upfront and asking that question.

179
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.493
Another thing sometimes too is
oftentimes we'll do this on,

180
00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:24.358
especially the early phone calls or

181
00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:28.604
things that maybe it's a little different
now when it's a scheduled Zoom call.

182
00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:33.900
It feels a little different but
I'd often say, is now still a good time?

183
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.502
&gt;&gt; Yep.

184
00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:37.477
&gt;&gt; Maybe something happened
that they're actually, no.

185
00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:42.507
[LAUGH] I had this on my calendar and
didn't wanna decline or not show up.

186
00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:45.972
But it's, yeah maybe they're not in the
right headspace for some reason then that

187
00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:48.711
might be a good thing which I can-
&gt;&gt; My dog just puked on the rug and

188
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:51.250
now I need to, sorry,
can I call you back in 10 minutes

189
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.977
&gt;&gt; Yeah and that you're gonna be,

190
00:10:52.977 --> 00:10:55.122
well actually that might not work for
me but

191
00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.936
let's reschedule and
things that are really helpful.

192
00:10:57.936 --> 00:11:01.441
It's those little things that can
go a long way, I think, Jeff.

193
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:03.244
&gt;&gt; I mean it kind of but it was more so,

194
00:11:03.244 --> 00:11:06.607
I mean I had an interview where
we had technical difficulties and

195
00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:10.550
it ended up just working out where we
both were allowed to or had time after.

196
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.863
So, instead of rescheduling,
we just did it and we just went along.

197
00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:16.554
&gt;&gt; Yep.

198
00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:23.207
&gt;&gt; And I think in both cases, all a lot of
these, it's just communicating clearly and

199
00:11:23.207 --> 00:11:27.439
not holding that against someone and then-
&gt;&gt; Sure.

200
00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:28.895
&gt;&gt; Transparency.
&gt;&gt; Transparency, yeah.

201
00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:32.292
&gt;&gt; Transparency is huge, yeah.

202
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.998
All right, my favorite thing, networking.

203
00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:38.967
You should always be networking, and
this is so easy to forget, but yeah,

204
00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:40.358
you're hiring, right?

205
00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:45.235
You're manager, you're gonna be
hiring at some point in time.

206
00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:48.831
And you may not have an open
role on your team, that's okay.

207
00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:51.238
Talk with people, and it's easy.

208
00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:54.402
I think Mark's question from
someone on the chat is,

209
00:11:54.402 --> 00:11:56.450
how much time should you be doing?

210
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.180
This is hard, I have many other
things I should be doing.

211
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.000
This is not a priority
if I don't have a role.

212
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.820
But I wanna be doing something and
building those connections.
