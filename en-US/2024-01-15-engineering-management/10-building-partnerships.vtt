1
00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.314
All right, so
we've gone through quite a bit on hiring.

2
00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:06.550
We could go deeper.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.902
Hiring is definitely a big part of
an engineering manager's role, but

4
00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:15.617
we focused on thinking about what's
needed on your team, what's needed for

5
00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:18.320
that particular role that you're hiring.

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.314
We've hopefully built up some sort
of thoughts and practices for

7
00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:26.309
writing job descriptions,
building up an interview panel, and

8
00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.080
then the networking and sourcing.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.202
I'm curious for the audience,
any networking and

10
00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:36.130
sourcing things that you've found
useful that maybe I missed?

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.550
Go ahead, Dustin.

12
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.362
&gt;&gt; From the chat,

13
00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:42.109
I'm a coding bootcamp grad who is now
leading a team of developers, and

14
00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.480
staying in contact with the bootcamp's
career support department has been a great

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.690
way to have a funnel of great candidates
for entry-level junior roles.

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.686
&gt;&gt; I love that, too, because also being
someone coming from a bootcamp or

17
00:00:55.686 --> 00:01:00.590
coming right out of school,
that's hard to find a job, right?

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.142
And so if you already have that
connection from like, yeah,

19
00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:08.779
this bootcamp works really well with the
company, that's a great way to do that.

20
00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:11.087
I love that, great suggestion.

21
00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:12.222
Anything else?

22
00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:15.490
Yeah?

23
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.958
&gt;&gt; If I'm looking to just kind
of generally expand a team,

24
00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.750
not looking necessarily for
specialists, things like that.

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.217
Yeah, I like that intern to full-time
pipeline as well, of bringing on summer

26
00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:29.763
interns, things like that, and then
bringing them on full-time eventually.

27
00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:31.120
&gt;&gt; Those are great too.

28
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.183
And even some companies have that kind of
just someone's job is to focus on that,

29
00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:38.710
and that's really helpful too,
to really help build that pipeline,

30
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.996
I love that suggestion.

31
00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:45.789
All right, now, I mentioned this earlier,

32
00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.066
that I do feel that as part of your
job as an engineering manager,

33
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.206
even as an engineer,
how do you build partnerships, right?

34
00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:55.654
That's really important.

35
00:01:55.654 --> 00:01:58.366
You're gonna rely on
others across the company.

36
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:01.088
Maybe you're working on
similar projects together.

37
00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:05.826
You might have dependencies on
a partner team that you need to get

38
00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.944
your job done effectively.

39
00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:11.950
So I wanna focus a little bit on
how do you build partnerships?

40
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.789
How do you make them strong?

41
00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:18.821
Let's start by what does
a healthy partnership look like?

42
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.671
For me, I think it's,
there's mutual trust.

43
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.911
You can trust one another, you feel
comfortable working with one another.

44
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:32.131
Your teams get along,
there's collaboration.

45
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.551
There's transparency and communication.

46
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:40.906
Trust is absolutely really important,
but I think being transparent and

47
00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:46.967
communicating and making sure that you
are talking with partnering teams is huge.

48
00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.870
There should be a good alignment on goals.

49
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.520
You're both trying to achieve things for
the business, so

50
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.015
that's probably a pretty
good alignment right there.

51
00:02:55.015 --> 00:02:58.117
But you're depending on each
other to deliver something.

52
00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:02.670
And so understanding each other's goals
and motivations can go a long way.

53
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.508
Sometimes I'll do this even
in a one-on-one with, say,

54
00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:09.217
another engineering manager, is like
what's your team trying to achieve?

55
00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:11.410
What are challenges that you're having?

56
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.131
It might not even affect me in any way or
my team, but it's helpful to know that,

57
00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:17.940
and maybe I can help.

58
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.020
Maybe there's things where a partnering
team is trying to hire a certain engineer

59
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.684
that they're struggling with.

60
00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:28.147
And I'm like, wait, my network, I could
probably find someone that fits that.

61
00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:32.261
And so I think building that alignment on
things can really help in many ways to

62
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.289
help one another.

63
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.737
You have this shared
responsibility of outcomes.

64
00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:38.305
Like I said,

65
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:42.160
there's often times that you're
working together to deliver something.

66
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.633
You wanna make sure that you are lockstep,
that you're able to understand what each

67
00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:50.791
part of the role plays, what's gonna
be delivered, what are the timelines,

68
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:53.952
and make sure that you're responsible for
your outcomes.

69
00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:59.380
So couple items that we've covered for
healthy partnerships, but

70
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.473
I'm gonna lean on the audience here and
anyone on the stream,

71
00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:06.838
I'm sure there's a lot of things that you
all think about for building partnerships.

72
00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:10.693
What are things that you think
are important or could help partnerships?

73
00:04:10.693 --> 00:04:13.042
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Something as a candidate in the past

74
00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:17.345
that I've been kinda blown away
by is lack of what they're doing.

75
00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:21.848
Which is, I interviewed, and they're like,
you have great technical knowledge, but

76
00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:23.795
you're not the right fit for this role.

77
00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:26.795
And then they haven't maintained.

78
00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:31.054
And I had a friend who worked at the
company, and they never maintained that

79
00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:34.974
backlog of engineers that were good,
technically, and could fit on

80
00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:39.921
a different team, but they never maintain
that to reach back out for another role.

81
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:40.750
&gt;&gt; That's a good one.

82
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.690
&gt;&gt; And that blew me away, that so
many companies don't do it.

83
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.699
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think even just that's where
you can help partnering teams too,

84
00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.420
where I've absolutely done that, where
I've interviewed someone, and I'm like,

85
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.543
you're not quite a fit for
this role, but you know what?

86
00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:57.988
There's this other team that
you are absolutely a fit.

87
00:04:57.988 --> 00:05:00.860
And then probably gonna be more
happy there too because it's so

88
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.450
much more aligned.

89
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.027
And so not only is that great for

90
00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:07.242
the candidate, going back to
that candidate experience, but

91
00:05:07.242 --> 00:05:11.625
it's also great for your company and great
for your partner, you just help them out.

92
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:14.139
That's a good one.

93
00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.065
Anything else, yeah?

94
00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.026
&gt;&gt; I think one thing is,
me as the manager,

95
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.340
I don't want to be the only one
that maintains those partnerships.

96
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.540
So I wanna make sure that my team is also
having one-on-one time periodically with

97
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.528
different partners that we work with.

98
00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:28.663
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

99
00:05:28.663 --> 00:05:31.743
&gt;&gt; And having that time to get to
know each other and build that trust,

100
00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:34.385
because that doesn't
necessarily always come freely.

101
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:37.045
And so I think that's something
that I push my team to be like,

102
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.999
have you met with this person one-on-one?

103
00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.905
Do you know them?

104
00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:42.113
Do you know what they do
from a day-to-day basis?

105
00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:45.287
That way, when we do have things
that we have pressures and urgency,

106
00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:47.327
things like that,
it all is a lot smoother.

107
00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:48.478
&gt;&gt; I love that too.

108
00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:53.437
And I think you called it out really well
too, is it takes a lot to build trust.

109
00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:57.770
You're speaking to that as it helps
even having the team involved in that.

110
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.980
It's really easy to break trust, right?

111
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.480
That fails really fast, and so
you wanna build up the trust.

112
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.692
And you're gonna make mistakes,
absolutely.

113
00:06:06.692 --> 00:06:10.625
And you'll have conflict between
partnerships, but it's so much better if

114
00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:14.751
you have that baseline of strong trust and
that you can work through it together.

115
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.875
So I love that even involving the team.

116
00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.465
One more.

117
00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:25.953
&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, [COUGH] I've
noticed in many companies I've been in

118
00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:30.662
that siloing tends to happen, where
folks are very focused on their team and

119
00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:35.444
what their team is up to, but are a little
more reticent to break out of that and

120
00:06:35.444 --> 00:06:40.034
kind of, like Emily said,
build trusting relationships across teams.

121
00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:43.440
And one thing I found that's helpful
with that is centers of practice.

122
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.834
Or we have what we call guild meeting for
front end developers,

123
00:06:46.834 --> 00:06:51.319
where we're intentionally getting folks
together who might not talk to each other

124
00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.893
very often, but can share ideas, share
things that their team is struggling with.

125
00:06:55.893 --> 00:07:00.657
Or what they're finding success with that
might be adoptable by other teams, and how

126
00:07:00.657 --> 00:07:05.630
they might be able to coordinate training
or adopting some of those strategies.

127
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.428
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of it is really
just connecting dots too, right?

128
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:12.470
Knowing what other teams are working
on and just being like, wow,

129
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.850
connecting that dot.

130
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.244
I will say one of my biggest pet peeves,
especially in large companies,

131
00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:22.997
is having teams that create something
that another team has already created or

132
00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:25.320
is doing, and that's that siloing.

133
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.611
And it's so
frustrating because you're like, wait,

134
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.742
we just spent and wasted a lot of time
when we could have collaborated or

135
00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:36.045
leveraged something that
some other team has created.

136
00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:38.948
So finding those ways in
which to share knowledge.

137
00:07:38.948 --> 00:07:42.110
I love the guild idea or
pulling forums together.

138
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.010
It's hard, cuz you don't always know
what's the right thing to share?

139
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.240
But the more you share,
someone will connect that dot.
