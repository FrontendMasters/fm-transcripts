00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:05.265
Another important one that I think
about too, is I talked about

2
00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:10.520
building trust as a manager,
I wanna hear feedback from my team.

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.806
And it can be harsh or critical
feedback to like, I wanna hear it.

4
00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:18.067
I'm not perfect,
I'm not gonna do things well all the time.

5
00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:21.479
And I think I am just as much
a part of the team as anyone else.

6
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.096
And I wanna hear feedback
on how I can improve and

7
00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:28.366
I wanna have those candid conversations
with folks, but I think it's hard.

8
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:32.466
You need to be able to really
maybe go an extra mile of setting

9
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:36.332
up that vulnerability or
trust with your team members.

10
00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:39.882
Cuz no matter what,
there is a little bit of power dynamic,

11
00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.234
and we need to recognize that, right?

12
00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:46.831
Your manager can hire and
fire you and that's tough, right?

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.965
And you need to know that and
so you don't wanna feel like,

14
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:53.290
there's gonna be repercussions,
if I give my manager feedback.

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.994
I'm not gonna have repercussions if
someone gives me feedback and, so

16
00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.722
I want them to feel comfortable
to come with me that.

17
00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:03.250
So there again,
same as how I approach giving feedback,

18
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.391
is I'm gonna assume best intent.

19
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:09.080
I've had some really bad feedback,
not even from direct reports, but

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.305
even from peers where like, it was awful.

21
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:14.429
It was just not helpful feedback,
but I looked at it and go,

22
00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.322
I'm gonna assume best intent, and
there's probably something there.

23
00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.972
Okay, what could I have done better?

24
00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:24.963
And I might just pull in tease
out something out of that and

25
00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:29.871
that's where being an active listener
can help to is have curiosity,

26
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:33.970
ask questions like, well,
what do you mean by that?

27
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.764
How could I have shown up better?

28
00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:37.734
What would you have liked to see?

29
00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:41.165
Sometimes people don't land
the feedback well, and so I think you,

30
00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:45.496
instead of being dismissive of it, should
take an approach of like, I'm listening.

31
00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:48.339
You don't have to agree with
all the feedback either, but

32
00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:50.381
showing that you're listening is huge.

33
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:54.102
Yeah, you don't have to agree
with every piece of feedback.

34
00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:58.899
But I do think that there are times where
even when I haven't fully agreed with it,

35
00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.281
it might have been the delivery,
there's probably something there, and

36
00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:07.406
me just kind of pulling it out a little
bit more, even with the person.

37
00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.548
Or maybe with others on the team, like,
have you seen me show up like this?

38
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:13.318
Is this something I could do better?

39
00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:14.293
It helps me.

40
00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:19.958
It helps me be better and
I think that's better for the team.

41
00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.963
Let's cover some things that maybe that
you should avoid when receiving feedback.

42
00:02:23.963 --> 00:02:25.327
Try not to take it personally.

43
00:02:25.327 --> 00:02:27.082
I know it's hard.

44
00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:32.269
Even when you get that really tough
feedback and someone delivers it really

45
00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.212
poorly, let's assume best intent and avoid
becoming defensive or making excuses.

46
00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:43.823
That's tough cuz sometimes people don't
have the full picture of why a decision

47
00:02:43.823 --> 00:02:49.288
was made or whatever that may be, maybe
you could have explained that better.

48
00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:53.206
There's always something that was there
and so you wanna try and say, yeah,

49
00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.541
I could have done better.

50
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.303
And don't interrupt or argue.

51
00:02:56.303 --> 00:03:00.867
I've seen this happen, I hope I haven't
done this, but I've definitely seen it in

52
00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:04.793
like peer feedback sessions where
someone will get really defensive and

53
00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:07.752
kind of interrupt the person
before they're even able

54
00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:11.779
to finish giving the feedback and
arguing, that's not gonna look good.

55
00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.401
It's not gonna build trust with your team.

56
00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:22.090
You wanna engage feedback from your teams,
so oftentimes I've shared ideas for

57
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.483
things if I wanna invite
feedback I might say,

58
00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:28.793
I wanna be better at
how I'm communicating.

59
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:32.700
I want my ideas to come
across clear with you all.

60
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.034
Can you give me feedback on that?

61
00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:39.191
If I'm in a team meeting, I'm saying
something that didn't land well, tell me.

62
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.207
Actually, you can tell me in front
of the whole team, go for it.

63
00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:47.298
And then this came up earlier,
thank people for the feedback, right?

64
00:03:47.298 --> 00:03:48.573
Thank them.

65
00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:51.522
Oftentimes I've even surfaced
that in team meetings,

66
00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:54.982
like so-and-so gave me this feedback,
it was really helpful.

67
00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:57.908
So it's inviting more of that.
