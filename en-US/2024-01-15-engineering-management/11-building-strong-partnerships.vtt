1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.842
So we have definitely covered a lot of
this, of what makes strong partnerships.

2
00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:07.321
But I'll make sure to kind of
touch on a couple other things,

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.023
making sure I mentioned there's
dependencies on other teams.

4
00:00:11.023 --> 00:00:15.083
In order for your team to be successful,
you're not just doing all the work

5
00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:19.023
by yourself, there's no way,
there's definitely collaborations.

6
00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:27.048
You have also opportunities to get input
and feedback from partners, right?

7
00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:29.953
They see different things
that you may not, and

8
00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:33.582
so I think this brings to the fact
that you can get new ideas,

9
00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:37.590
diverse perspectives, and
ultimately you'll innovate more.

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.178
So even in that thing that bothers me
of when people created the same tool or

11
00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:43.595
something like that.

12
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:48.045
It's if you bring the groups together
to think about meeting both needs,

13
00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:49.336
the tool or product or

14
00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:53.951
whatever you're creating ends up being
probably that much more stronger.

15
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.331
There's also a wider range of resources,
expertise, capabilities, and

16
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.258
this can show up in many ways,
where it's hiring.

17
00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:09.108
We've talked about that, is like,
hey, you'd be perfect for this team.

18
00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:12.269
Maybe it's leaning on that team,
is like, hey, Jim,

19
00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:15.721
you have a lot of engineers that
are really great at GraphQL.

20
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.419
I'm just struggling,
I don't have that on my team right now.

21
00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:22.279
I really, really need someone
with a lot of those expertise.

22
00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:25.335
Do you have someone who has
bandwidth to help my team?

23
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:28.897
Maybe they can help pair or
get input or feedback on that,

24
00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:31.508
maybe I need your team to help interview.

25
00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:36.264
And so these are things where you wanna be
able to help and share those expertise.

26
00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:40.248
Partners can also help,
add assistance, give advice, guidance,

27
00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:42.729
I've said that many times and it's true.

28
00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.193
So, how do we build strong partnerships?

29
00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:49.190
It's an important aspect.

30
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.740
Trust, let's get back to that,
you want to build trust and

31
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380
this can come in many ways.

32
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.271
It could even just be spending some social
time together, getting to know each other,

33
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.755
how do you operate,
maybe it's reading their team charter,

34
00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.835
having them read your team charter.

35
00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:08.465
Getting to really understand each
other from that perspective and

36
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.588
what are the goals that you're
often trying to achieve.

37
00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:16.348
When I'm working with newer teams that has
been times where we've actually gone and

38
00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:20.389
done something like played bocce ball
together or gone out for dinner.

39
00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.060
Sometimes those things you don't
know if it's gonna pay off or

40
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.367
not, but it does, it's just hard to
know the connections that are made.

41
00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:35.741
You wanna have effective communication,
you wanna have check-ins with your

42
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:41.091
partners, you wanna know how are things
going, is my team doing well for you all?

43
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.009
We're working on this,
what could be better?

44
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.663
When things aren't going well,
it's better to communicate it,

45
00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:48.501
let's talk about that upfront.

46
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:53.394
If I'm gonna miss a timeline, or
my team is, I wanna communicate that,

47
00:02:53.394 --> 00:02:55.334
I wanna go get ahead of that.

48
00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:58.033
It's fine to miss timelines or
make mistakes, but

49
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.920
leaving it to the last minute
to not communicate that,

50
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.097
that's gonna erode trust, it's not gonna
be look good for you and your team.

51
00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:12.526
Align unclear expectations, if you're
working on projects where's the divide,

52
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.624
who's owning what,
where's the handoff happen.

53
00:03:15.624 --> 00:03:17.517
Just trying to get that clarity for

54
00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:20.397
one another when you're
working together is huge.

55
00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:24.936
Be adaptable, be flexible.

56
00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:30.156
Things will change, you're also
partnering with a new set of people

57
00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:35.650
that they might have different ideas or
different ways of doing things.

58
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.158
It might actually help you, you might
embrace some of those changes and

59
00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:40.043
learn from them.

60
00:03:40.043 --> 00:03:43.061
But it also helps you both
kind of become together and

61
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.775
be flexible in that manner and
ultimately collaborate better.

62
00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.279
I think I'd mentioned this one earlier,
but yeah, understand you ultimately

63
00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:59.104
have similar goals as a company,
you're probably still striving for things.

64
00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:03.389
But there are gonna be individual goals
for a team, and understanding what

65
00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.411
a team's motivation and goal is can
help you really understand that.

66
00:04:09.862 --> 00:04:14.774
And then, yeah, make sure the partner
understands your goals and ask them that,

67
00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:15.993
do you understand?

68
00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:19.475
You could explain it, but even just making
sure they fully understand what you're

69
00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:20.977
trying to achieve can go a long way.

70
00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.872
And be open to help your partner, but

71
00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:28.064
also be open to help or
ask for help where you need it.

72
00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.803
Any other, yeah.

73
00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:37.822
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I guess I was kind of curious if you

74
00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:42.696
have some perspective on when teams and

75
00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:47.716
partner teams seem to align in goal, but

76
00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:53.194
disagree on approach to solving problems.

77
00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:59.630
So in our company, we have a lot of
teams that want to actively collaborate.

78
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.925
We've got a lot of sister teams to those
teams that want to operate autonomously.

79
00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:10.960
So it can create this kind of push and
pull where one team

80
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.442
wants to operate autonomously and
drive in their own lane.

81
00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:20.731
And dependent teams want to
pull them out of that lane and

82
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:26.130
get them collaborating more actively and
sharing more information.

83
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.191
It can result in a lot of confusion and
friction, so,

84
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:37.162
curious your perspective on like
how to untangle some of that.

85
00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:40.445
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that can be a difficult one too,
and I'm sure there's not management,

86
00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:41.628
not a right answer, right?

87
00:05:41.628 --> 00:05:43.918
There's definitely different ways
to approach it, but I think-

88
00:05:43.918 --> 00:05:44.916
&gt;&gt; It's a themed perfect science.

89
00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:47.916
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I think there's
definitely things that I would try too.

90
00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:52.967
Is trying to understand if that one
team wants to be very independent and

91
00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:55.168
is it looking to collaborate.

92
00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:57.010
And that's what it kind of sounds like,

93
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.457
it's like there's others
wanting to collaborate.

94
00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:02.029
It's trying to say, okay, that's fine,

95
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.002
let's meet in the middle,
you still need to communicate, right?

96
00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:09.232
You still need to talk
through what's going on.

97
00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:14.751
So should we have weekly meetings to sync
up to check in on where things are at?

98
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.491
Should we do joint stand-ups?

99
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:21.124
It's trying to understand and
maybe even giving suggestions or ask them,

100
00:06:21.124 --> 00:06:22.604
how do we collaborate?

101
00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:24.299
How can we still collaborate?

102
00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:26.585
There's gonna be some form of it, right?

103
00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:31.261
You may not be meeting as much,
maybe even understanding if there's

104
00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:35.950
a meet-in-the-middle moment, but
also why don't they want to?

105
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.861
Ask that, right?

106
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.492
What's preventing you from collaborating?

107
00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:42.938
Maybe they don't trust your team,
that could be it, right?

108
00:06:42.938 --> 00:06:47.445
And if that's the case, better to know
that than to not, and then you can try and

109
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:50.965
figure out, do I need to start
to build up better trust there?

110
00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:53.355
Is that something that's been broken?

111
00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:56.736
So I think a lot of it is
approaching it with curiosity.

112
00:06:56.736 --> 00:07:02.044
And possibly another thing is like we
often forget, maybe you're frustrated.

113
00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:06.923
This team won't listen to me,
they're not collaborating, they're siloed.

114
00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:10.323
And it's good to try and
take a step back and go, all right,

115
00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:14.409
let's approach this with curiosity and
approach it with best intent.

116
00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:18.975
And so to me, it's not probably answering
you, giving you a perfect solution, but

117
00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:23.304
its ways in which I'm trying to think
about how I would approach the situation.

118
00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:26.674
But you obviously need at some
point some communication or

119
00:07:26.674 --> 00:07:28.816
collaboration that's happening.

120
00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:32.393
&gt;&gt; Meghan at chat had mentioned
that another tip learn for

121
00:07:32.393 --> 00:07:36.525
communication is just acknowledgment and
being responsive.

122
00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:39.605
Even if it's just saying,
I'll get back to you, and

123
00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:43.313
then of course following up with
what you said you're gonna do.

124
00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:47.018
And as you follow it up with,
Conway's Law usually happens here.

125
00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:51.709
Your software systems design ends up
following the communication patterns of

126
00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:52.425
your team.

127
00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:56.235
&gt;&gt; Yes, great point for
Meg, I like that a lot.

128
00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:58.860
Yeah, definitely, that's a good point.
