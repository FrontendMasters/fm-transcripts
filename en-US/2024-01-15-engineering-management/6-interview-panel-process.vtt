1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.150
All right, so we have our job description
people are flooding the gates.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.521
There's so
many people excited to apply to your role.

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:11.082
You need to now start being
prepared to interview folks.

4
00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.675
So I call this out,
is like don't take it for granted and

5
00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:16.590
you need to think about this.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.299
Every company is different.

7
00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:22.478
Some companies are very specific
on like this is how we interview.

8
00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:25.200
At Netflix,
we haven't taken that approach.

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.550
It is really up to the manager to set
that tone on how they want to interview.

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.550
You can adapt and change it for like,
I might be hiring a UI engineer.

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.140
Maybe I'm hiring a back engineer,
maybe I'm hiring a TPM.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.390
They're going to vary.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.606
And so I want to think about
what's the most effective way,

14
00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:48.480
what do I need to get out of the for
the role and evaluate that.

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.472
So I think about that is important to
think about how are you going to interview

16
00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:54.940
this person, what's important to evaluate.

17
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.840
So think about creating a panel.

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.270
Put together a plan.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.280
This is super helpful, do it.

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.836
It's not only helpful for

21
00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:08.730
you to think about reflecting
on what you want to evaluate.

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.200
But it really helps set others up
on your panel, up for success.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.644
And make sure that they're evaluating for
the right things.

24
00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:20.640
Be explicit on that, make sure
that they have that understanding.

25
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.633
There's been so many times I've been
thrown on interviews, and I'm like,

26
00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.550
what am I supposed to cover?

27
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.560
Because nobody told me,
I can ask questions.

28
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.954
But then what if like, three other persons
people ask the same question on that

29
00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:37.617
panel, not the greatest candidate's
experience, but also that managers who's

30
00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:43.180
hiring just got ,didn't really get as much
depth that they should on evaluating.

31
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.550
So I like to also outline what each
interview panels responsible for.

32
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.063
Obviously, you know there might be for
interviewing for

33
00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:54.314
engineers there's going
to be technical panels so

34
00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:58.380
what's the technical exercise they're
going through what's it evaluating?

35
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.670
What should the engineer
on my team be looking for?

36
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.620
Those are good things to highlight.

37
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.490
But then maybe I have someone like Jem,
who's a partner team that I work with.

38
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.470
I'm like, Jem, I want you to focus on how
will this person collaborate with you and

39
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.830
your team?

40
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.570
Here's some types of things
I want you to look for.

41
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.892
It makes his life easier, but then I
also have a better understanding that

42
00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:22.812
he's evaluated for that
&gt;&gt; What's

43
00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:26.032
your take on live coding
exercises interviews?

44
00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:30.265
&gt;&gt; That's a good question,
I personally like to give options.

45
00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:35.923
So there's, you know, especially when I
think of that early technical screen,

46
00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:40.890
some people really actually like
the live one, others do not.

47
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.829
I want to try and give people the option
to like what's going to be best for

48
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:45.740
them to show up.

49
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.580
It could be a take-home exercise and
that can be helpful and

50
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.470
people will opt into that.

51
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.217
But also, I've been in the scenario
where if I'm interviewing a lot,

52
00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:59.410
I don't want to spend eight
hours on a take-home exercise.

53
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.360
That's a lot.

54
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.770
And so if I've got five of those,
that's a lot.

55
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.196
But if I can jump on a call for
45 minutes to an hour and

56
00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:09.188
we can do something live coding,
that works.

57
00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:14.810
I've not liked coding in a Google Doc.

58
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.071
I've had to do that.

59
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.080
That's daunting.

60
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.590
I don't didn't feel good on that.

61
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.740
I don't like it just feels out of
my nature to code in a Google Doc.

62
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.640
And also you have someone watching you
just as you're typing and it's awkward.

63
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040
So I think thinking about those types
of things is really important to.

64
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.660
It's like what tools are you giving for
someone.

65
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.356
&gt;&gt; One thing I would add, if you do do it,

66
00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:37.607
make sure your environment that you're
having them code in is working.

67
00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:39.148
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Because I had an interview where

68
00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:41.430
the environment wasn't working properly.

69
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.959
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that prevented me from being able

70
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:43.960
to code properly.

71
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.640
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

72
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.734
And I think sometimes even if
you use things like code pen or

73
00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:52.092
there's a lot of different ones that you
can kind of set something up where it's at

74
00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:55.230
least giving them a coding environment.

75
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.465
Give them that ahead of time to, so
you can have your recruiter or yourself or

76
00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:03.917
someone who's getting in touch with them
and is like you'll be using code pen.

77
00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:07.764
And like letting them know ahead of time,
here's a link to it, just so

78
00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:11.500
that they can actually get that set up and
feel comfortable.

79
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.100
Nobody likes entering an interview or
they're having technical difficulties.

80
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.230
That sucks.

81
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.630
It throws people off their game.

82
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.035
And that's you want them to be set up for
success.

83
00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:22.411
So that's a really good question.

84
00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:30.680
Also have alternatives for
your interview panel.

85
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.374
This is an important one too, even
especially on the engineers on my team,

86
00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:39.844
I think about it's like I don't want
to overload one person with a ton of

87
00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:41.880
technical interviews.

88
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.992
And often I mean that too is like
you usually have like split up

89
00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:49.082
where it's like technical is usually
going, a lot of candidates are going to go

90
00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:53.260
through a technical interview,
they may not make it to like a round two.

91
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.550
But you don't want to
overload one engineer.

92
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.364
Maybe one engineer loves doing that.

93
00:04:57.364 --> 00:05:01.136
That's a different story and
if they want to do that great, but

94
00:05:01.136 --> 00:05:05.690
I often like to try and have two or
three engineers that are alternating, and

95
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.344
that if recruiting setting that up,
it's clear in my plan.

96
00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:12.530
It's like Joe, Sally and
Mark are all here available.

97
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.590
You can pick and
choose by the calendar who's available.

98
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.285
And you're trying to sequence them, so
that they're not all getting bombarded

99
00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.230
with one, or
one of them is getting bombarded.

100
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.338
Jim,
&gt;&gt; As a still a newer manager,

101
00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:27.960
I'm still getting hiring.

102
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.855
It's a lot of work.

103
00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:30.344
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; It's way more work than I ever

104
00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:31.460
expected.

105
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.820
A mistake I made very recently
was not getting my filters right.

106
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.600
So, what I did was I sent home,
I did a lot of take homes, and

107
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.810
like take homes are great.

108
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.584
I think they're the better experience for,
for candidates, but take homes,

109
00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:47.890
take a lot of time to grade.

110
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.326
And I was taking so
much of my team time, like hours and

111
00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:53.900
hours reviewing these take homes
when really I should have done.

112
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.716
Probably like a live coding first,
because that's much faster, and

113
00:05:57.716 --> 00:05:58.953
then do the take home.

114
00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:02.663
And I just didn't think about how
much time was my team taking and

115
00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:06.248
how much time my partner is taking
to review all these people.

116
00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:09.382
So, learn from my mistakes,
get your filters right early,

117
00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:13.580
otherwise it's just really expensive
to review like, dozens of people.

118
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that color but I also
love you like surfacing the mistake,

119
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.970
because you make those mistakes and
you iterate and adjust and learn.

120
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.030
I love it.

121
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.530
Mark.

122
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.600
&gt;&gt; Hiring can be hard to fit
in with the busy schedule.

123
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.858
What percentage of your
time should be spent on?

124
00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:32.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

125
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.540
&gt;&gt; Hiring and recruiting.

126
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.210
&gt;&gt; It depends.

127
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.371
I do often say, or
I've said it many times,

128
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:44.050
I feel like hiring is a full-time job,
on top of your job.

129
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.357
And I'm not saying that you should
work double hours or anything, but

130
00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:50.590
it is exactly what Jem said.

131
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.960
Is it takes up more time than you expect,
and it's really important.

132
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.300
You want to hire the right person,
you want to spend that time.

133
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.910
It is a lot of work, but
it's also very rewarding.

134
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.750
And also when you get it right,
that's the good thing.

135
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.560
It's also expensive doing
all that interviewing.

136
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.640
If you get it wrong, it happens,
don't beat yourself up about it.

137
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.749
But you have to go back to the drawing
board and start over and that's, you know,

138
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.610
that's expensive to you and the team.

139
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.728
You might have onboarded them and
then they, two, three months,

140
00:07:18.728 --> 00:07:20.230
they didn't work out.

141
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.750
You're having to go back to the drawing
board and that's, that's tough.

142
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.644
I don't know how to say it,
like my percentage of it.

143
00:07:26.644 --> 00:07:30.444
I do think about hiring, all the time.

144
00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:34.716
Even if I'm not hiring I do want to
have some bit of like percentage

145
00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:39.560
of my time thinking about like even
just staying in touch with people.

146
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.268
I talk about it later on
the sourcing side and networking of,

147
00:07:43.268 --> 00:07:48.212
I want to be of always be networking type
mentality .Where you are thinking about

148
00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:51.430
like well what happens if
someone leaves tomorrow?

149
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.742
I want to have that pipeline of
people that I'm thinking about that

150
00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:59.010
could be potentially good for the role.

151
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.626
Also, they might not be ready
to leave their company, and so

152
00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:04.160
just keeping a pulse on
that can be really helpful.

153
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I put it in chat,
but I just wanted to share.

154
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.872
I had an experience not too long ago
with a company called Brilliant and

155
00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:15.230
this outsourcing company
they used to call Woven.

156
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.450
It's by far the best candidate experience
I've ever had on live coding exercises.

157
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.366
There was a PR review that was
given about 30 minutes to complete.

158
00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:29.791
A bug-finding exercise in a live coding
environment that was given about 30

159
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:31.073
minutes to complete.

160
00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:35.608
And then a function coding exercise that
I think was given about 60 minutes to

161
00:08:35.608 --> 00:08:36.304
complete.

162
00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:38.385
And they were all very well-scoped.

163
00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:43.089
They were setting clear expectations ahead
of time of, like what's achievable and

164
00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:43.894
what's not.

165
00:08:43.894 --> 00:08:48.490
And also what's expected of you, like
it's okay if it doesn't pass every test.

166
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.366
These are kind of the like, good, great
and excellent brackets of what achievement

167
00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.290
would look like and it was paid
&gt;&gt; So I just-

168
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.360
&gt;&gt; That's a good one.

169
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.693
&gt;&gt; I have considered looking into
Woven for our company as well,

170
00:09:01.693 --> 00:09:04.910
because I was blown away with
how amazing that process was.

171
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.231
I thought it was really well
all-encompassing of like what a technical

172
00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:12.488
exercise like what does
a technical contributor do?

173
00:09:12.488 --> 00:09:16.487
And kind of capturing all of
those different skill sets and

174
00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:20.740
they give great feedback also of like,
here's what you did.

175
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.770
Well, here's what we would have
liked to have seen differently.

176
00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:25.580
&gt;&gt; Man, like I love all that.

177
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.610
I've never done the paid part too.

178
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:32.125
But like when you're asking someone
to spend eight hours on an exercise.

179
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:35.260
That's time is valuable to all of us.

180
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.680
Time is such an important thing.

181
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.730
So I like that call out.

182
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.020
And I like setting expectations.

183
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.630
I do talk about like, how do we
make a great candidate experience.

184
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.572
That is absolutely said is like,
setting expectations.

185
00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:51.277
Let people know and understand what
they need to do to show up well.

186
00:09:51.277 --> 00:09:53.402
Do you want to set them up for success?

187
00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:55.906
You're not telling them
exactly what to do, but

188
00:09:55.906 --> 00:09:57.931
just giving them great instructions.

189
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.076
Goes a long way
&gt;&gt; Yeah this kind of goes back to the job

190
00:10:02.076 --> 00:10:06.274
description aspect, is there a difference
or do you have to the process of how

191
00:10:06.274 --> 00:10:11.072
you would write your job description for a
prospective employee versus the recruiter?

192
00:10:11.072 --> 00:10:14.713
Cause the recruiter kind of has to
digest that job description and then,

193
00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:17.630
obviously, filter down candidates for you.

194
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good question.

195
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.842
So even in that interview plan that
I talked about, I will often have

196
00:10:23.842 --> 00:10:28.823
a lot more internal thinking that's
maybe not in the job description,

197
00:10:28.823 --> 00:10:33.655
to just even help a recruiter or
others like Jem being a partner team.

198
00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:37.880
They can read that and
kind of understand some of the things.

199
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.394
It might even be talking
about upcoming projects or

200
00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:44.410
something on there that I don't want to
necessarily blast to the whole world.

201
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.635
Not that it's, like, bad, but
it's just like, I might talk in person or

202
00:10:48.635 --> 00:10:53.128
have a recruiter even say like, yeah,
Ryan's team, they're going to be

203
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:57.260
starting to invest in this project
called X, Y, and Z or whatever.

204
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.244
And they can have a little bit of
verbiage to speak to that and go,

205
00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:02.370
it's like, yeah, it's like.

206
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.499
A react code base,
they're leveraging TypeScript, or

207
00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.840
just giving some more insights.

208
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.765
Might be in the job description, but
they have a little bit more information.

209
00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:15.344
And you're helping set the recruiter
up for success to be able to answer

210
00:11:15.344 --> 00:11:19.410
questions, or any of the partnering teams,
or anyone on your interview panel.

211
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.540
So I think, yes, thank you, good call out.

212
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.200
Is like, that's why having that.

213
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.950
You know, like I said, have a plan.

214
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.260
It just helps everyone on your panel.

215
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.504
&gt;&gt; You answered.

216
00:11:29.504 --> 00:11:31.590
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
I love that when that happens.

217
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.650
Here's an example of just
like this would be a really.

218
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.673
I actually probably even have
more to a simple section, but

219
00:11:37.673 --> 00:11:41.280
let's say it was that
collaborative partnership one.

220
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.247
Am I tell Jim like try and
get like I don't want to,

221
00:11:44.247 --> 00:11:47.993
I don't care if someone like Jim
writes his own questions, but

222
00:11:47.993 --> 00:11:51.685
giving him an idea of what I'm looking for
is really helpful.

223
00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:56.364
And so I might even have suggestions for
questions but like, definitely,

224
00:11:56.364 --> 00:11:59.285
I don't want to be prescriptive on that.

225
00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:02.837
But these are things that I'm looking for
that I want you to try and

226
00:12:02.837 --> 00:12:05.429
tease out and
be able to answer in the feedback.

227
00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:07.361
Like, how did they do on these things?

228
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.175
And if there's gaps that helps me.

229
00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:12.153
I can evaluate that if they're
not the best partner, but

230
00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:15.190
they're not going to
the park on everything else.

231
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.320
Maybe that's okay, and
that's an area that I can help coach.

232
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.710
So that's why it's really important
to try and think through this.

233
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.976
And like what are you trying
to get out of each section?
