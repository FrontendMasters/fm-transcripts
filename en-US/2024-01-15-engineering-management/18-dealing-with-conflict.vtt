1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.887
All right, another thing that I
don't think always happens, or

2
00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:07.370
hopefully doesn't happen a lot,
but it does.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.349
As a manager,
you have to deal with conflict.

4
00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.090
I talked about interpersonal,
dealing with people, it's hard.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.092
That is definitely a challenge, everyone
deals with problems differently, and

6
00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:21.250
sometimes there's friction.

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.181
And guess what?

8
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:24.650
You as a manager get to deal with that.

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.608
So how do managers deal with conflict?

10
00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.230
This is a tough one to teach or
just kinda speak to.

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.495
So this is where I'm going to be
leaning on a bit of a scenario,

12
00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.376
where I'm gonna lean on Jem Young again.

13
00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:40.911
And he and I are gonna go
through a couple scenarios and

14
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:43.170
talk through how we might approach it.

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.750
And definitely, audience, chime in if
you have approaches that you would take.

16
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.034
I think this is a really helpful way
to do, is cuz dealing with scenarios,

17
00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:57.610
getting advice from other managers on how
they might do it is very, very helpful.

18
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.040
So Jem,
let's dive into some scenarios here.

19
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.872
There's an interpersonal
conflict in the team.

20
00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:11.168
The engineer one brings up an issue in a
one-on-one with you as a manager and says,

21
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:16.250
engineer two on your team, they're being
really aggressive in code reviews.

22
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.498
How do you approach that?

23
00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This one's easy.

24
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.004
You fire them, and-
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: [LAUGH] Well,

25
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:23.317
that's easy, right?

26
00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:24.622
That's all we do as managers.

27
00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:25.303
Okay, yeah.

28
00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.715
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This one is a little bit
easier because that's something I can

29
00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:32.971
actually look at myself.

30
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:39.210
What are some examples of being
aggressive, cuz that's a little ambiguous?

31
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.824
So I had to go look at what they're
actually being aggressive about.

32
00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:47.516
In this case, aggressive, pedantic,
you can say they're the same thing.

33
00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:52.491
So I dive in and see, yeah,
maybe this is right, or maybe,

34
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:55.090
hmm, why do you feel this way?

35
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.210
So always be curious.

36
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.150
Never take any person's side immediately,

37
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.290
because the other person
probably has a valid opinion too.

38
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.099
If I feel maybe it's a little aggressive,
then I'll have a talk with engineer

39
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.240
number two and say, hey,
what's your philosophy on code reviews?

40
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.807
What's your stance?

41
00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:14.758
What's your policies?

42
00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:18.516
Do you think the team agrees
with you on that, yes or no?

43
00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:22.254
And then depending on how that
conversation goes, we can say, hey,

44
00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:27.025
why don't we implement team-wide policies
on disagreement across everybody on how we

45
00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:30.000
do code reviews,
what the language we should use are?

46
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.180
Let's implement tooling so we don't
actually have to address, I don't know,

47
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.953
you're missing semicolons or
something like that.

48
00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:40.778
Let's automate this to a tool
that we all agree to use, and

49
00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:43.055
we'll see how it goes from there.

50
00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:45.980
I'm not saying that that will
solve the problem immediately,

51
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.550
but it's a good place.

52
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.198
And usually, with something like this,

53
00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:51.329
it's a sign there's a process
that's not working.

54
00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.316
And a process, immediately is, that's
my job, is to figure these things out.

55
00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.440
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah, I like that too.

56
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.488
I love even just,
if it's something on a code review,

57
00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:03.670
it could just be linting
rules that you're like, yeah,

58
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.341
let's just not have a person have
to harp on something like that.

59
00:03:07.341 --> 00:03:11.874
I think in this scenario, too, I might
even before going to some of that, I mean,

60
00:03:11.874 --> 00:03:14.795
reading it is awesome,
but I think understanding.

61
00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:18.884
Absolutely agree with you,
I would take that curiosity approach,

62
00:03:18.884 --> 00:03:22.191
understand, and maybe try and
see, what do you feel?

63
00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:23.419
What's aggressive about it?

64
00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.630
Well, how does that make you feel?

65
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.106
And kinda understand that.

66
00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:31.270
But then my first inkling is, have you
given that person the feedback on that?

67
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.676
Because I think oftentimes
it can feel escalated, and

68
00:03:34.676 --> 00:03:39.266
you don't want it to feel escalated
where a manager's like, all right,

69
00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.723
I gotta go talk to engineer number two.

70
00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:45.625
It might get to that point if
there is still a lot of conflict.

71
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:50.436
But oftentimes I wanna try and help
encourage the engineer number one to have

72
00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:53.156
that conversation with the other person.

73
00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:57.937
Especially in something like a code
review, or Slack threads, messages,

74
00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:02.860
tone is really hard to read,
like my goodness, that is a tough one.

75
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.197
Something even Jem said in Engineering
Management 101 Is that reactions in Slack,

76
00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:13.552
you might give the wrong reaction and
not have that intent.

77
00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:16.593
And so this other person might
have had positive intent and

78
00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:20.380
had no idea that this other person
was interpreting that that way.

79
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.364
So I think to me, it's like, all right,
go have that conversation with them.

80
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:26.508
And then if that doesn't work,
maybe it is more of like, okay,

81
00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:28.682
I probably need to approach this engineer.

82
00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:30.968
And I think the processes one, absolutely,

83
00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:33.326
being able to implement
some of those things.

84
00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:38.088
Like, let's just agree on some standards
as a team and let a computer decide that.

85
00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:39.375
That really helps, too.

86
00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.121
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
it's pretty good, Ryan.

87
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:42.708
And I think this is a good scenario
that shows the difference in

88
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.020
experience between you and I.

89
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.841
My bias is always towards I need to do
something, let me step in, where yours is,

90
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:51.327
no, the better, maybe more efficient
solution is to have people solve it

91
00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:53.203
themselves and you just stay out of it.

92
00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:56.451
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: I don't know if it's
better or worse either, it's just to me,

93
00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:57.425
it's hard, too.

94
00:04:57.425 --> 00:04:59.815
You're like,
I gotta fix the problem, right?

95
00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:02.766
And that might be it,
it's encouraging that, or

96
00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:06.437
maybe you can help the person
deliver that feedback, right?

97
00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:08.540
I've said it earlier today.

98
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.330
I'm gonna say it again.

99
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.907
Giving feedback is hard.

100
00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:14.974
And sometimes it's something that
if you're not practicing it a lot,

101
00:05:14.974 --> 00:05:19.310
I'm nervous to go give that engineer
feedback, what should I say to them?

102
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.260
That they're mean, or
that they're aggressive?

103
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.440
And you can kinda help coach them.

104
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.209
Well, here's how I would approach it,
does that work for you?

105
00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:30.111
Is that gonna help the relationship?

106
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:33.270
Or maybe it's just jumping in
a room to have that conversation.

107
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.265
Well, let's jump to another scenario.

108
00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:38.178
You have a partner disagreement.

109
00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:42.249
So an engineer on your team is
having troubles working with

110
00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.835
another individual
contributor on another team.

111
00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:49.272
So now, you have someone who
reports to you directly, but

112
00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:52.024
someone who also reports
to another manager.

113
00:05:52.024 --> 00:05:56.503
Maybe it's just a conflict that
they're disagreeing on an approach.

114
00:05:56.503 --> 00:06:00.091
Let's say it's a technical approach and
they're just not getting alignment and

115
00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:01.551
they're butting heads on that.

116
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:03.700
How do you approach that?

117
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.109
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Another easy one.

118
00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:08.582
You go to the manager of the partner team,
you take them out to a nice dinner,

119
00:06:08.582 --> 00:06:10.372
you sit them down and you be like, hey,

120
00:06:10.372 --> 00:06:14.145
I think you should fire this other person
cuz they're causing me a lot of trouble.

121
00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:15.543
No, you definitely don't.

122
00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:16.543
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Again,

123
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:21.240
you start with curiosity and say,
what is the the problem here?

124
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.416
And hopefully, by now,

125
00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:26.338
you're aware of all the interpersonal
relationships between a lot of the people.

126
00:06:26.338 --> 00:06:28.654
And say, is this a broader problem?

127
00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:31.313
Let me better understand what
exactly you're talking about.

128
00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:34.564
And then, following on what
you said in the last scenario,

129
00:06:34.564 --> 00:06:38.919
ask the engineer on your team to give
feedback to the other person and say, hey,

130
00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.430
here's how I'm feeling.

131
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.021
And depending on how that went,
then sometimes you do have to escalate and

132
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:49.242
you have to mention it to the other
manager, and say, hey, so and so

133
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.230
is having problems,
they gave this feedback.

134
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.518
Maybe you can help me resolve this, what's
going on with this person on your team?

135
00:06:55.518 --> 00:06:59.232
Because this is just what I've observed or
we're hearing.

136
00:06:59.232 --> 00:07:02.840
One thing I don't do is I don't go
directly to the person on the other team,

137
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.336
because from a parent metaphor,
that's kinda your kid misbehaving and

138
00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:09.199
someone else at the park going
up to your kid and being like,

139
00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.631
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

140
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:15.512
And as a manager, if someone did that to
me, I'm gonna be like, what are you doing?

141
00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:16.793
That's my job.

142
00:07:16.793 --> 00:07:19.074
I don't have to that trust and
relationship built up, so

143
00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:20.820
it just comes across poorly.

144
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.290
You let the other manager
kind of handle it.

145
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.629
But again, you have to be really
delicate with you handle that situation,

146
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:28.696
cuz you don't wanna come
in finger pointing,

147
00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:31.936
cuz that manager is gonna get defensive
for their team, as they should.

148
00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:33.760
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah,
they wanna protect their people, and

149
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.301
that's a good quality to have, too.

150
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:39.541
It's like, you don't wanna be defensive,
but you also wanna be like, well,

151
00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:41.460
I wanna hear both sides of it, too.

152
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.045
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, that's why I always
like phrases like, I've observed this, or

153
00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:48.384
someone from my team observed this.

154
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:52.523
And really it's a neutral stance on, hey,
I'm not saying this is how I felt or

155
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:53.548
this is what I see.

156
00:07:53.548 --> 00:07:57.010
It's just,
this is kind of what I've observed.

157
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.141
What do you think about?

158
00:07:58.141 --> 00:07:59.855
Have you noticed that as well?

159
00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:03.407
And then being curious and
showing you are being curious about,

160
00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:05.916
I'm concerned about this other person too.

161
00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:08.578
It's not just like I want you to
do something about it, it's like,

162
00:08:08.578 --> 00:08:09.476
we're all together.

163
00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:11.336
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's fix something if it's

164
00:08:11.336 --> 00:08:12.003
not working.

165
00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:12.634
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: No, I love that.

166
00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:14.506
I think that's very similar
to how I'd approach it.

167
00:08:14.506 --> 00:08:18.100
Maybe one other thing that I would,
depending on the situation,

168
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.214
I might even encourage the engineer
on my team, if they feel comfortable,

169
00:08:22.214 --> 00:08:24.527
gave that feedback, it's not working.

170
00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:28.743
Sometimes they feel comfortable enough
to go to the person's manager and going,

171
00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:33.281
hey, I gave this person the feedback, I'm
not sure it's fully resonating with them.

172
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:36.244
I'm still concerned that this
behavior is still showing up.

173
00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:40.121
And so maybe it's okay and not, but
it just really depends on situation.

174
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:40.984
But absolutely,

175
00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:44.676
I would have approached it in the sense
that I'll talk to the other manager.

176
00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:47.925
I might still do that as, hey,
I know there's been a bit of a rift or

177
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:51.136
conflict happening with our team,
how are you feeling about it?

178
00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:53.895
I might even just do that
behind the scenes a bit, and

179
00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:57.369
have that conversation so
that we're both on the same page of it.

180
00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:01.297
But yeah,
I'm very aligned with your approach, too.

181
00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:02.478
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Hopefully,
it's been resolved.

182
00:09:02.478 --> 00:09:06.916
But even after that, I still talk to
the other manager and say, hey, so and so

183
00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:09.944
having this,
they had a conversation that solved.

184
00:09:09.944 --> 00:09:12.681
But it's important for
you to know about it,

185
00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:17.160
just in case there's actually a theme
going on that you're not aware of.

186
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.344
And it's just a courtesy,
I would wanna know that.

187
00:09:19.344 --> 00:09:22.632
I wouldn't want it to happen four or
five times and then suddenly, yeah,

188
00:09:22.632 --> 00:09:25.720
this has been happening for months and
I'm like, no one's told me.

189
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.611
So it's a courtesy after
it's all been resolved.

190
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:31.183
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah, you're like,
I'm not asking you to do anything,

191
00:09:31.183 --> 00:09:33.178
just more awareness and you're like, wow,

192
00:09:33.178 --> 00:09:35.715
that's actually been the fifth
time this has happened.

193
00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:40.081
And you're like, this is a broad theme
that I may need to fix or address, and so

194
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.014
it is really helpful to know that.

195
00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:46.796
&gt;&gt; Mark: I think running this company for
over a decade,

196
00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:52.667
what's helped me is kinda
similar to the team alignment.

197
00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:57.303
You talked about having a team, I forget
what the term you guys use, team charter.

198
00:09:57.303 --> 00:09:59.053
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah.

199
00:09:59.053 --> 00:10:03.899
&gt;&gt; Mark: I think having that team
charter somehow reminding them

200
00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:07.610
of that seems to resolve
a lot of conflict,

201
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.659
cuz you're shifting it from he said this,
she said that,

202
00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:17.010
whatever, to how do we align
on our goal as a team?

203
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.675
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yes.

204
00:10:17.675 --> 00:10:22.757
&gt;&gt; Mark: And whenever you shift
the conversation from the individual

205
00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:27.150
to the team,
it seems like a lot of problems go away.

206
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:32.379
Just in my life,
my family life, everything,

207
00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:38.020
it's like if you can find
the common denominator.

208
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.245
If two parties want the same thing,
there's nothing that they can't get over.

209
00:10:43.245 --> 00:10:49.824
And that's my guiding philosophy, running
this company, dealing with my family.

210
00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:52.183
It's like, what do we all want here?

211
00:10:52.183 --> 00:10:54.803
And how do I remind everyone first?

212
00:10:54.803 --> 00:10:59.275
This is what we're all after first, and
just keep bringing the intention back to

213
00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:02.124
or shared,
I think you used the term shared goals.

214
00:11:02.124 --> 00:11:05.357
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Shared goals,
common goals, Mark, I love that.

215
00:11:05.357 --> 00:11:09.403
Because, I mean, maybe you disagree on the
goal, so you have to kinda start there.

216
00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:11.945
But once you have
the alignment on the goal,

217
00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:15.188
the other problems kinda
start to work themselves out.

218
00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:21.118
Maybe not, you kinda keep tying it back to
the goal and the trade-offs to get there.

219
00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:24.874
&gt;&gt; Mark: Well, and like you said,
if the goals are different,

220
00:11:24.874 --> 00:11:29.377
that's when maybe this person
isn't the right fit for the team.

221
00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:32.337
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Right.
&gt;&gt; Mark: Or whatever, but that ultimately,

222
00:11:32.337 --> 00:11:36.856
if two people want the same thing,
they'll get over anything,

223
00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:39.544
because they both want the same goal.

224
00:11:39.544 --> 00:11:44.725
And yeah, dealing with now 70 people,
[LAUGH] we all want the same thing,

225
00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:47.769
which is educate more
people more deeply and

226
00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:53.465
just bringing people back to that focus
first and then, okay, what's going on?

227
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:54.127
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Mark: And

228
00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:57.342
it's just like it level sets everything.

229
00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.747
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah, and so that sounds
more like your individual team, but

230
00:12:00.747 --> 00:12:04.738
even when you have a partner team and
those conflicts are happening too,

231
00:12:04.738 --> 00:12:06.898
it's like what's your team's goal,

232
00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:10.911
what's my team's goal, where's
the common goals that are together?

233
00:12:10.911 --> 00:12:14.944
It's like it is baseline just getting
alignment on that absolutely can help some

234
00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:15.844
of those things.

235
00:12:15.844 --> 00:12:17.149
Depends on the problem of nature,

236
00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:19.269
it could just be literally,
I don't like that person.

237
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:26.260
And the goal may not change that, but
I think that is a great approach.

238
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.689
&gt;&gt; Mark: But you could hate,
I should say, not hate, but

239
00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:31.365
have a completely different style,
working style.

240
00:12:31.365 --> 00:12:33.127
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Mark: Communication style,

241
00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:36.042
your styles should be polar opposites.

242
00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:37.380
But if you want the same thing,

243
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.329
it seems like you always can figure
out how to work with that person.

244
00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:43.152
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah, and then even
just kinda understand where the person

245
00:12:43.152 --> 00:12:45.869
is coming from or
how they approach it can, yeah, help.

246
00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:51.069
&gt;&gt; Mark: That they sharpen you and
you always get better as a result, so act.

247
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:52.481
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Great points,
no, thank you.

248
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:56.531
That was great call out, and ties it
back to that team charter, I love that.

249
00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:02.477
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: All right,
scenario three, customers.

250
00:13:02.477 --> 00:13:08.094
So your team has internal customers that
use the product that your team works on.

251
00:13:08.094 --> 00:13:12.143
Maybe you build a platform that
people are building on top of.

252
00:13:12.143 --> 00:13:16.911
A customer comes to you and shares how
unhappy they are with the product.

253
00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:18.845
Not the people in your team,
but the product.

254
00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:22.585
And they have a lot of feedback
that it's not working for them,

255
00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:24.148
how do you approach that?

256
00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:26.662
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Again,
one of my favorite values is curiosity.

257
00:13:26.662 --> 00:13:29.927
So okay, tell me about that, and empathy.

258
00:13:29.927 --> 00:13:32.603
Recognize that they're trying
to solve some problem.

259
00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.656
So it's good to uncover,
what exactly are they trying to solve?

260
00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:40.985
And then I definitely wanna start with
visibly documenting what they're saying,

261
00:13:40.985 --> 00:13:43.582
just to show I'm taking action on this.

262
00:13:43.582 --> 00:13:48.492
So like, hey, tell me about that, tell
me specifics so we can address them, and

263
00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:52.197
then kind of walk through that and
then reiterate or repeat.

264
00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:55.280
Kind of like, so here's what I'm saying,
here's what I heard.

265
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.490
Is that accurate?

266
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.673
And they say, yeah, or
no, something like that.

267
00:13:58.673 --> 00:14:01.402
They you say, okay,
let me come back to you on this.

268
00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:05.137
I don't promise anything,
I won't say we're gonna fix it.

269
00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:09.774
I think the mistake I've made it before
is, my team's so busy and I hear you,

270
00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:14.498
we got all these bugs, and trying to play
for pity, I guess, when I think about it.

271
00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:19.661
But the truth is people don't care
how busy you are, everybody's busy.

272
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:23.927
Sympathy does not work well, and
you learn that really early as a manager,

273
00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:25.157
people don't care.

274
00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:27.936
So it's like, okay, what's going on?

275
00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:30.625
And then maybe,
depending on the level of feedback,

276
00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:34.713
maybe I'll take it to some people on my
team and I'm like, here's what I heard.

277
00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:35.870
What do you all think?

278
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.926
Are these bigger problems?

279
00:14:36.926 --> 00:14:38.567
Have you heard similar?

280
00:14:38.567 --> 00:14:41.948
And then maybe we work out a plan
to address, maybe we don't.

281
00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:45.499
But whatever happens in between, I
definitely follow up with that person who

282
00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:49.319
brought it to me and say, hey, I took the
so and so, or I've looked at this, some of

283
00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:52.894
this we've got in the roadmap, some of
this is not a high priority right now.

284
00:14:52.894 --> 00:14:57.054
But just to show you are taking them
seriously and you value that feedback,

285
00:14:57.054 --> 00:14:59.771
regardless of whether you
do anything about it.

286
00:14:59.771 --> 00:15:03.263
You definitely wanna close the loop for
that person who brought you that,

287
00:15:03.263 --> 00:15:05.129
if they're unhappy about something.

288
00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:07.150
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah,
all the things I love about.

289
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.702
I love the reframing too to make sure that
you're understanding the problem too and

290
00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:15.277
just making sure that you are both
aligned on what the problem is,

291
00:15:15.277 --> 00:15:16.985
bringing it back to your team.

292
00:15:16.985 --> 00:15:21.252
Maybe it's like, actually that's a really
quick fix, let's just do that and

293
00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:24.272
you're like great, but
not promising something either.

294
00:15:24.272 --> 00:15:26.357
I've seen the mistakes made too, and

295
00:15:26.357 --> 00:15:30.932
actually, it causes even probably more
problems and erodes trust with partners.

296
00:15:30.932 --> 00:15:34.335
Is where you're like, yeah,
we'll put that on our backlog.

297
00:15:34.335 --> 00:15:38.139
Okay, I mean, that's one approach.

298
00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:43.478
But I've also picked up a backlog
that's two years old and I'm like,

299
00:15:43.478 --> 00:15:48.290
have we told customers,
our partners that we're doing this?

300
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.341
And they're like, well, yeah,
but we just put in our backlog.

301
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:54.057
I'm like this is two years old,
no would have been a better answer,

302
00:15:54.057 --> 00:15:54.925
we're not doing it.

303
00:15:54.925 --> 00:15:58.996
Because then it could also spark
a conversation where you're like, but

304
00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:02.011
my team is dependent on this,
and it's like, okay.

305
00:16:02.011 --> 00:16:07.121
Is it higher priority than these ten
other things that my team's doing?

306
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:08.452
I don't think we can do that.

307
00:16:08.452 --> 00:16:12.275
Maybe another team can do it, but
it starts to have those conversations, or

308
00:16:12.275 --> 00:16:16.100
maybe we need to go hire someone, or
it just starts those conversations.

309
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.340
No is a strong answer, and
it's a good answer, versus, yeah,

310
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.972
we'll just put on the backlog.

311
00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:25.581
So I echo all the things you said,
Jem, I think are really great ones.

312
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:27.543
All right, well, thank you,
Jem, for your insights.

313
00:16:27.543 --> 00:16:31.449
I'll bring it back, we'll go
through the scenarios just briefly.

314
00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.844
For the audience,
I would love to hear some insights or

315
00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:35.104
thoughts that you may have.

316
00:16:35.104 --> 00:16:37.296
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The fourth one.

317
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:40.705
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Crap, there is,
there's four, thanks, Jem.

318
00:16:40.705 --> 00:16:47.184
All right, fourth scenario,
Jem, leadership.

319
00:16:47.184 --> 00:16:51.942
You have a manager, your direct manager
is asking your team to add additional

320
00:16:51.942 --> 00:16:56.776
scope that your team doesn't have
bandwidth to successfully deliver without

321
00:16:56.776 --> 00:16:59.573
impacting the current
work on their plates.

322
00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:02.018
How do you approach that?

323
00:17:02.018 --> 00:17:03.715
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This has
happened to me many times.

324
00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:05.170
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah,
I'm sure it has [LAUGH].

325
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.764
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Something I talked
about yesterday in terms of, or

326
00:17:07.764 --> 00:17:11.261
we talked about today in terms of
charter and the things we don't do,

327
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:15.210
and why it's really important to have
that, and that applies to everybody.

328
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.392
It applies to your manager as well.

329
00:17:16.392 --> 00:17:19.395
So I say, interesting, okay, so

330
00:17:19.395 --> 00:17:23.401
my understanding was the scope
of the team was this.

331
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:26.056
Where does this fall in
terms of prioritization?

332
00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:26.910
Who's asking for it?

333
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.880
If we don't do it, what happens?

334
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.760
Are we the best team
successfully equipped for that?

335
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.052
Having a really strong charter
helps these conversations,

336
00:17:35.052 --> 00:17:39.321
because it gives your manager a baseline
on what you're supposed to be doing.

337
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:42.312
If they're like,
you need to add more scope, you say,

338
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.010
okay, so here's our current priorities,
again, so

339
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.530
this is where you have a roadmap
that you've already shared out, too,

340
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.309
which is, again, it's agreed upon
contract of what your team is gonna do.

341
00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:54.681
And you say, hey,
here's our current roadmap,

342
00:17:54.681 --> 00:17:58.427
here's the prioritization based on
the business needs and things like that.

343
00:17:58.427 --> 00:18:01.524
We're gonna have to drop this,
or what should we drop here,

344
00:18:01.524 --> 00:18:03.180
because we just can't do more.

345
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.471
And then you force your manager, in this
case, to say, you drop this, and you say,

346
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:10.917
okay, well, I'll send out some
communication to our partners and

347
00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:14.435
whoever's depending on it, and
both our names are gonna be on this.

348
00:18:14.435 --> 00:18:16.998
Because if it's coming from above,
it's not my choice,

349
00:18:16.998 --> 00:18:19.159
then you have to own part
of that decision, too.

350
00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:23.305
That's just part of leadership,
if you ask people to do things like that.

351
00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:23.830
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah.

352
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.080
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This one's tricky,
what about you, Ryan?

353
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.659
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: I mean, I liked all
the things you had said, but one thing in

354
00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:34.597
particular I really liked, and I think
it's a question that I often use, not even

355
00:18:34.597 --> 00:18:39.416
just leaders, but just in general,
is what happens if we don't do it, right?

356
00:18:39.416 --> 00:18:43.556
So sometimes something comes up and maybe
that team in that other scenario where

357
00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:47.883
they're asking for something or saying
something's not working in the product,

358
00:18:47.883 --> 00:18:49.952
I might ask, what if we don't do that?

359
00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:51.762
What does that mean for you?

360
00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:54.236
Well, just I wish it was done.

361
00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:56.477
Okay, well, that tells you a lot there.

362
00:18:56.477 --> 00:19:02.322
Or it's like, I can't deliver on one of
the most important business priorities and

363
00:19:02.322 --> 00:19:03.239
this is why.

364
00:19:03.239 --> 00:19:07.675
And so it really kind of starts that
conversation with curiosity as well.

365
00:19:07.675 --> 00:19:12.211
But that you did, too, of circling
back on here's the priority list,

366
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:17.519
here's where my thinking is on priorities,
could we drop this one, is that okay?

367
00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:21.467
I think is really powerful and
it starts that conversation.

368
00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:25.047
Maybe it's like, well, Jem,
we need more resources on your team so

369
00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:28.649
that we can pick that up, but
you have to force those conversations.

370
00:19:28.649 --> 00:19:32.670
Not, all right, yeah, my team will do it,
which means you might not deliver on

371
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.057
anything cuz you're trying to do too many
things, or you're overworking your team,

372
00:19:37.057 --> 00:19:38.040
burning them out.

373
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.283
They're trying to stay up on evenings and

374
00:19:40.283 --> 00:19:43.241
weekends to pick up work
that you've now agreed upon.

375
00:19:43.241 --> 00:19:45.818
And so I really liked your
tactics of going back and forth.

376
00:19:45.818 --> 00:19:49.795
And approaching with curiosity,
I think, is a really good suggestion.

377
00:19:49.795 --> 00:19:53.029
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: You can definitely
document any changes to your roadmap,

378
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:54.415
any incoming requests.

379
00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:57.503
I've been burned by that before,
taking on more and more and more, but

380
00:19:57.503 --> 00:20:00.706
I didn't reflect it in the roadmap or
things we were supposed to be doing.

381
00:20:00.706 --> 00:20:01.801
So at the end of the quarter,

382
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:04.639
it just looked like we hadn't done
anything that we said we were gonna do.

383
00:20:04.639 --> 00:20:08.225
But it turns out we did, we just had
a lot of other higher priority requests.

384
00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:12.221
So I found documenting any sort of
changes, any sort of income request,

385
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:15.889
changes priority, and then
communicating that out is a safe way of

386
00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:19.492
covering yourself as a manager to be like,
they are delivering,

387
00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:24.237
they just start shifting because they're
in a position that the priorities change.

388
00:20:24.237 --> 00:20:27.850
And that happens for a lot of teams,
depending on your role of the business.

389
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.405
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah, communication,
too, is always a good one.

390
00:20:30.405 --> 00:20:33.567
And maybe the team catches that and
goes whoa, whoa, whoa,

391
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:37.417
now that's screwing me over, and so
you have a bigger conversation too.

392
00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:40.190
I think that's why it's
important to communicate.

393
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.634
Another aspect, too, that I was thinking
about when you're saying that, too, is,

394
00:20:45.634 --> 00:20:50.160
yes, the communication, but also on
roadmaps, they should be flexible, right?

395
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.335
Priorities change, and that's okay, and so
that's why even having that stack ranking

396
00:20:55.335 --> 00:20:59.903
or priority list is that you at least
can maybe drop something fairly quickly.

397
00:20:59.903 --> 00:21:03.743
Or you have to go back to the drawing
board and re-evaluate, and you and

398
00:21:03.743 --> 00:21:05.668
your team should be okay with that.

399
00:21:05.668 --> 00:21:08.149
It's gonna to slow something down for
a bit, and that's okay.

400
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.613
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, the P0, P1,

401
00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:15.550
P2, P3, super helpful when stuff like
this happens, which it does all the time.

402
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.770
And P0s are the,
we absolutely have to get this done.

403
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.884
P1s are, yeah, we should get this done.

404
00:21:21.884 --> 00:21:23.714
P2, P3 is like-
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Probably not even getting

405
00:21:23.714 --> 00:21:24.284
into those.

406
00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.003
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We're probably
not getting to it, but

407
00:21:26.003 --> 00:21:27.520
if we have extra capacity, yeah.

408
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.029
And then I really love your point on,
don't oversubscribe your team,

409
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:32.615
don't put 100% capacity.

410
00:21:32.615 --> 00:21:37.453
People get sick, people go on vacation,
stuff happens, we have fly-ins, and

411
00:21:37.453 --> 00:21:41.525
if you're just overdoing your team,
you can't account for that.

412
00:21:41.525 --> 00:21:44.920
&gt;&gt; Ryan Burgess: Yeah, and there should
also be time for keeping the lights on,

413
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.840
whether it be paying down tech debt or
just investing in certain things.

414
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.766
You wanna afford your team that,
or your team's a platform team, so

415
00:21:52.766 --> 00:21:57.234
there are things that might happen or
change that it's like, you have to fix or

416
00:21:57.234 --> 00:21:59.421
address cuz it affects another team.

417
00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:04.063
And so, yeah, you wanna make sure that
you're setting aside that time and

418
00:22:04.063 --> 00:22:05.544
not oversubscribing.

419
00:22:05.544 --> 00:22:06.612
Right, well, thank you, Jem.

420
00:22:06.612 --> 00:22:08.775
Those are good insights, thank you.

421
00:22:08.775 --> 00:22:13.660
So now, what we'll do, too, is I'd love
to hear some quick suggestions from

422
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.918
the audience,
to just hear your perspectives on how

423
00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:21.008
maybe you would approach scenario one,
two, three, and four.
