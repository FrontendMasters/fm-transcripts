1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.690
We're gonna be talking about sourcing,

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.220
it's kind of goes along a little
bit with the networking.

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.063
That's absolutely a form of sourcing, but
I wanna think about how do you source?

4
00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:15.980
How do you find candidates that might be
potentially a good fit for your role?

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.243
Oftentimes, companies will have
recruiters doing a lot of this work,

6
00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:22.952
maybe you have partners
that are doing that.

7
00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:25.717
But I do try and
do this still a little bit,

8
00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:30.384
I wanna kinda look what's out there,
spend some of the time doing it.

9
00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:34.389
Maybe not entirely me doing it,
that is nice to have those partners.

10
00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:38.995
But I thought I should share some general
tips the way I've thought about it, so

11
00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:43.280
it's gonna take a lot of time, yeah,
let's just start baseline there.

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600
It's not easy, there's a lot of people
out there that you might be looking for.

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.946
You have the applicants,
obviously that are applying, but

14
00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.553
I also really like to go out there,
and look at things, and try and

15
00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:58.634
see what's in the market, and see what
people might be right for my role.

16
00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:00.119
I like to get creative,

17
00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.844
I'm trying to think of some
examples of things I've done.

18
00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:07.814
Maybe looking at events or
meet ups, things like that,

19
00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:11.030
you don't necessarily need to attend them.

20
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.252
You can even just look like, maybe there's
a react event in your city, who attended?

21
00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:22.179
Grab those names, look them up on LinkedIn
to see if there maybe have the background

22
00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.000
that you're looking for.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.456
So I think I like to get creative and
try new things, see what works,

24
00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:31.170
going to LinkedIn is what everybody does,
so try something different.

25
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.190
Even if you don't have an open role, same
thing as networking, keep an eye on this.

26
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.103
I don't know what the right
percentages to do, but

27
00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:44.210
It's something that you can be
doing on a regular cadence.

28
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.330
So when you are hiring,

29
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.700
you've at least got something a little
bit of a foot in the door on that.

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.263
Look at your network, is important, right?

31
00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:56.635
[LAUGH] Just start there, but
also, you wanna be building and

32
00:01:56.635 --> 00:01:59.216
broadening your network, right?

33
00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:02.397
You talk about hiring for
diversity and inclusion,

34
00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:06.960
you don't wanna just look to your
networks, try and expand that network.

35
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.146
Look at candidates from past roles,

36
00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.959
I know this has come up
earlier that companies have.

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.185
Candidate software where they're tracking,

38
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:24.020
look at past candidates that
have interviewed for a roles.

39
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.894
Maybe you passed on them for
some reason or maybe they declined,

40
00:02:27.894 --> 00:02:30.750
they took a role at some other company.

41
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.300
Go back and look,
that can be a really great starting point.

42
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.511
Referrals, referrals, referrals, this is
my favorite one, I will go to my team

43
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:46.000
as like, hey, do you know anyone that
would fit this role or partners, etc.

44
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.072
Referrals are so helpful, people
already have insights into this person

45
00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:55.752
that you might be wanting to hire,
so it often leads to a great hire.

46
00:02:58.537 --> 00:03:03.451
What I like to do too, it's hard, we all
have so many things going on, to source,

47
00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:07.040
and to find the time to do that or
even ask our team to do that.

48
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.029
So sometimes, I'll even set up time
with my team or others to just say,

49
00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.538
can we spend an hour, half an hour?

50
00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:19.171
Look at your LinkedIn networks, look at
what other network that you have, and

51
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.427
just put some names in a spreadsheet.

52
00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:24.821
And it's nice too, that I'll probably
have like, if Jem added five names,

53
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.664
I'd probably want his name beside them.

54
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.241
So that I know like,
are you really close with this person?

55
00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.920
Would you feel comfortable introducing us?

56
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.794
But definitely doing things like
this can be really, really helpful.

57
00:03:37.794 --> 00:03:42.021
All right, this is our portion of
where I'm gonna ask a manager.

58
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.254
Also probably gonna ask the audience
just around some sourcing

59
00:03:45.254 --> 00:03:47.516
ideas that you've had or found effective.

60
00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:53.998
But, yeah, let's ask Jim,
when have you had a new role?

61
00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:56.308
How do you start sourcing for
candidates, Jem?

62
00:03:56.308 --> 00:03:58.858
&gt;&gt; That's a trick question,
Ryan, if I have a new role,

63
00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:00.585
I've already sourced candidates.

64
00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:04.450
&gt;&gt; Ooh, smart answer, I love it.

65
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.561
&gt;&gt; But I look at,
I think critically about the role, so

66
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:11.099
a lot of that I've already
gotten from my job description,

67
00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.733
where it's forced me to think about,
what am I looking for?

68
00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:17.060
What are the things that
are additive to the team?

69
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.270
What sort of technologies or
skills who do I need?

70
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.569
From there, I started looking,
LinkedIn is an okay place.

71
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:29.290
It's good for a lot of people, but I
prefer probably more personal connection.

72
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.983
So before that,
I've already done external things,

73
00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:37.580
we have a podcast together,
which helps raise our visibility.

74
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.864
When I say like, hey, I'm hiring,
people already know me,

75
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:45.049
which is actually pretty helpful, but
not super scalable for a lot of people.

76
00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:49.297
But if there's conferences and
the technology that I'm looking for,

77
00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:51.364
I tend to go to those conferences.

78
00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:54.400
So recently I was hiring for
someone who's an expert in Graph QL.

79
00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.302
So I go to Graph QL conference and started
looking for people in those those skills.

80
00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:05.195
But I think my favorite is probably
internal and referrals, and

81
00:05:05.195 --> 00:05:08.740
I think that's the next question,
so I will.

82
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.192
&gt;&gt; Well, when you say internal too,
Jem, is that like looking for

83
00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:17.314
internal talent that already exists at
your company and you'll be like, wait,

84
00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:21.110
maybe they need a role change,
is that what you mean by internal?

85
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.151
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and ideally,
I've already know those people,

86
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.220
because I meet with a lot
of people all the time.

87
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.761
So it's kind of the,
you're always hiring in some degree and

88
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:33.810
not necessarily even
they might not know it.

89
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.162
But you might have something that
comes up and you're like, hey,

90
00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:37.890
I know you've kind of hit
a ceiling in your team.

91
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.920
I have a role opening up,
what do you think about joining my team?

92
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.330
How does that sound to you?

93
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.038
And if you already do the pre-work,
it's not a big, my god,

94
00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:47.640
I gotta hire all of a sudden.

95
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.215
It's not like a big shock to your system,
because you're always kind of on

96
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:55.089
the lookout for people who would be a good
fit for either you or our partners team.

97
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.060
&gt;&gt; I like that, and I've definitely
had a lot of great hires internally,

98
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.482
even where I've had an engineer I've
hired externally and joined my one team.

99
00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:08.166
And then I moved to another team, and
then they're looking for a change, and

100
00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.426
it works out really well.

101
00:06:09.426 --> 00:06:13.229
Also, you don't have to interview as
much or you shouldn't have to, right?

102
00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.809
Ideally, they're already good for the
role, because they're at the company, so

103
00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:19.560
I love that you called that out.

104
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.594
What's some advice you have for sourcing
other than you should always be sourcing

105
00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:26.237
or networking,
which I'm hearing from you as well.

106
00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:31.575
But what's some other advice that you
would share with other hiring managers or

107
00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:34.535
engineers looking to build up candidates?

108
00:06:34.535 --> 00:06:38.181
&gt;&gt; This one's a little counterintuitive,
but if you have a high profile or

109
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:42.247
high visibility within your company, or
even externally, it makes sourcing so

110
00:06:42.247 --> 00:06:42.993
much easier.

111
00:06:42.993 --> 00:06:46.084
For example,
my most recent role when I was hiring,

112
00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:49.034
a lot of people internally
knew about it already,

113
00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:53.620
because I had shared it in the Slack
channels, I shared with other managers.

114
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.830
So they're able to share that out as
well and that makes it a lot easier.

115
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.199
Some of the best sourcing I get is
referrals from people within the company,

116
00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.766
because they know what the culture is,
they know what the team needs,

117
00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:06.747
they know who I am.

118
00:07:06.747 --> 00:07:09.400
So they can find people like,
hey Jim, I have a friend,

119
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.910
I think they'd be a good fit, because they
know a lot about me already beforehand.

120
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.243
And that's really been the strongest
source of hires for me has always

121
00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:21.930
been referrals, because it's kind of
like a built-in filter ahead of time.

122
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.790
&gt;&gt; Do you think about when you're
talking to people internally that you're

123
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.653
ultimately trying to build
your persona up with them or

124
00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:32.260
kind of sell your team just on
an ongoing basis, or is that explicit,

125
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.690
or you just think it just
kind of happens naturally?

126
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, as a manager, you're always
selling your team, or you should be.

127
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.369
People should be aware of what your
team does, and it doesn't mean you push

128
00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:46.203
it in a shady sort of marketing way and
like, hey, my team's doing this.

129
00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:49.929
But generally, it's a good idea at every
level for people to know what you do, and

130
00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:51.235
that's helpful in hiring.

131
00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:52.806
It's helpful with your manager and

132
00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:56.640
managing up, it's helpful with executives
who know who you are on your team.

133
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.090
That all goes a long way, and that happens
a lot in one-on-ones in conversations.

134
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.586
&gt;&gt; That's great, I really like that,
so it is somewhat explicit, but

135
00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:09.320
it's also just naturally happening,
right on, thanks, Jem.

136
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.820
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ryan.
