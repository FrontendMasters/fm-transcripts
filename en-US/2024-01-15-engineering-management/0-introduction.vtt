1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.944
To practical engineering management.

2
00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:06.900
This is
Practical Engineering Management 102.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.990
I'm Ryan Burgess, I'm a software
engineering manager currently at Netflix.

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.465
I've been a manager for

5
00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:18.210
now I think it's just over ten years
now it's gone by pretty quickly.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.580
I'm what you would call thrown
in as an accidental manager.

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.750
I was at a startup called Evernote.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.056
I was a lead front end engineer
walked in one day and they're like,

9
00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:30.130
you are now managing the team.

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.500
I didn't hate it,
I was definitely up for the challenge.

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.137
I had been doing a lot of somewhat
leadership on the technical

12
00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:41.930
side of mentoring and things like that
throughout my career at various points.

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.230
I worked at agencies where
I was working with clients.

14
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.400
So I did really enjoy a lot
of the people side of things.

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.473
So it was I was up for it,
I was up excited about the challenge, and

16
00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:53.670
I stuck with it.

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.250
When I joined Netflix,
I lead UI engineering team.

18
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.348
That was called it our
Acquisition UI team,

19
00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:06.974
which was building a lot of the sign-up
flows for iOS, Android, web, and TV.

20
00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:09.652
We did a ton of AB testing to optimize,

21
00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:14.050
make sure that it was really
great user experience.

22
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.231
And then most recently, I'm in what we
call our Productivity Engineering Org,

23
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:23.803
and that's where I focus on trying
to make more centralized tooling and

24
00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:28.850
infrastructure to make other engineers
across the company more productive.

25
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.361
So it's really just making their
lives easier to ship production,

26
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:37.880
our product code out to what our
consumers are now using on Netflix.

27
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.480
You can find me on Twitter it is Twitter,
just just wanna say that @burgessdyan.

28
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.330
I am on LinkedIn at Ryan Burgess.

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.710
So yes connect with me on either platform.

30
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.090
I still I'm not on Twitter as
much lately but I still go there.

31
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.930
I'm also on a podcast,
mentioned Jem Young teaching.

32
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.504
I'm the practical engineering manager 101,
him and I are both on this podcast

33
00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:09.896
it's been long running, how many of you
have heard of it before show of hands?

34
00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:14.632
All right, quite a few hands awesome
let's get to here, for those of you who

35
00:02:14.632 --> 00:02:19.480
haven't listened it's really a casual
podcast with a group of panelists.

36
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.201
We have guests and regular panelists where
we're talking about various technologies,

37
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:26.660
career development.

38
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.500
It's not just front end, we've kind
of covered a variety of topics and

39
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.200
we're continuing to do that.

40
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.646
So if you haven't checked it out,
please do.

41
00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:39.831
All right, so
hopefully some of you have watched

42
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.721
Practical Engineering Management 101.

43
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:48.810
Jem Young, which I've mentioned,
he covers that topic really well.

44
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.860
He is also at Netflix as
a software engineering manager,

45
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.607
and he's on Twitter @Jimyoung so
follow him there.

46
00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:03.596
What Jim covered in 101 is really
what I like to think about is their

47
00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:08.499
very early stages you may not even
be a manager it's like really just

48
00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.680
like thinking about what is management?

49
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.870
Do I wanna do that?

50
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.910
Is that something that I
could see myself doing?

51
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.140
And so he does a really good job
covering the path to leadership.

52
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.720
Thinking about it, what does that entail?

53
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.180
Why might you wanna do it?

54
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.750
And maybe why you might not want to do it.

55
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.180
He does a very good job
going through that.

56
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.000
And then really just
understanding the role.

57
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.960
What does it mean to be
an engineering manager?

58
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.420
What are things that you
need to think about?

59
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.270
And then really thinking
about interviewing.

60
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.030
How do you get that first job?

61
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.770
And then you're in that first job,
what does that look like?

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.220
What's that first 30 days?

63
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.500
How do you prepare yourself for
just diving deep into management?

64
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.452
So he really set you up on a path
to that early days and in 102,

65
00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:58.998
I kind of wanna pick up from there,
as like you've been in the role a bit,

66
00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:02.450
you've started to get
a little bit of footing.

67
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.233
And so I wanna cover things like,
all right, you have a lay of the land you

68
00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:10.450
somewhat understand what you're doing,
what your team's doing.

69
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.510
And so how do you help set
your team up for success?

70
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.420
So we'll go into that and thinking about
ways in which you can help your team out.

71
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.460
And then we'll go really deep on hiring.

72
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.940
Hiring I think is one of the most
important things as a manager.

73
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.890
You got to build a team.

74
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.390
You wanna have a strong team
that's able to deliver.

75
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.010
That's what you wanna be doing, and you
may not hire right away, sometimes you do.

76
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.613
I like when you do hire early in your
career because you're taking over a team,

77
00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:42.936
it's like you wanna be able to understand
what the makeup of the team is and

78
00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:44.520
hire someone.

79
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.560
But at some point in time,
you will be hiring.

80
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.370
I guarantee it, someone will leave
the team or your team needs to grow.

81
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.260
You take on some new initiative.

82
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.190
It's gonna happen.

83
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.190
Then another point that I
wanna cover is partnerships.

84
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.653
You need to really think about building
strong partnerships with other teams,

85
00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:07.051
partners on efforts that you're working
on, you are trying to connect a lot of

86
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:11.533
the dots for your team, so building
strong partnerships is really important.

87
00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:16.161
I think one of the most important things
when you're managing a team is being able

88
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:17.970
to give feedback.

89
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.828
There's lot of different
types of feedback and

90
00:05:19.828 --> 00:05:22.200
how you're delivering that with your team.

91
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.770
But also, how do you receive feedback?

92
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.264
I think that's an important aspect, too,
is being able to effectively receive

93
00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:34.240
feedback and inviting your team to
give you feedback is really important.

94
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.930
And then we'll dive into change
management and what that's like.

95
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.154
I think that's one thing that I personally
didn't feel like I was prepared for

96
00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:44.138
before diving into management and so

97
00:05:44.138 --> 00:05:47.410
I'm kind of hoping that we can
give some insights into that.

98
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.390
So who's this course for?

99
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.090
I don't think it's just for
engineering managers.

100
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.813
I see this as a course for an engineer who
just wants to have more insights into what

101
00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:04.468
management is doing, there's a lot of
valuable skills like giving feedback,

102
00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:08.350
I hope you're giving feedback
to your peers or your manager.

103
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.540
There's a lot great tips and
that's what I wanna cover.

104
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.010
It could be like I said,

105
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.920
an engineer thinking about
management that should help them.

106
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.136
It could be for tech leads and
of course the engineering manager.

107
00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:26.037
So my goals here for
the course is I wanna try and

108
00:06:26.037 --> 00:06:30.770
help provide some strategies for
navigating challenging situations,

109
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.250
help prepare for things that
you may have not thought about.

110
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.339
And equip you with effective tools and

111
00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.310
things to just make your life
a little bit easier as a manager.

112
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.580
And then I'll share some valuable
perspectives on my thoughts on management.

113
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.220
We'll cover some scenarios
where how I might approach it.

114
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.053
I'm gonna call on Jem for
his perspectives as well.

115
00:06:56.372 --> 00:07:00.279
And throughout the course, I don't wanna
stand up here and talk all day, so

116
00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.356
we're gonna do various things to try and

117
00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.180
give you more different
perspectives on management.

118
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.760
So we'll have some exercises and
we'll cover some things in an exercise.

119
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.738
But also go through some
scenarios which I had mentioned,

120
00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:16.460
like maybe it's how to give feedback and
this is where I'll rely on Jem.

121
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.070
Him and I will go doing some back and
forth and go through some conversations.

122
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.942
So you're getting some insights into what
some of those conversations might actually

123
00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:26.440
look like.

124
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.840
And then I will have another part
where I will call on ask a manager.

125
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.200
I'll definitely be leaning on Jem.

126
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.500
But I'm also leaning on
you all in the audience.

127
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.070
I wanna hear your thoughts.

128
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.320
I think it's really important
to lean on others as a manager,

129
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.520
there's no right way to do something.

130
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.760
There's wrong ways.

131
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.450
But there are definitely ways in which you
wanna get other people's perspectives.

132
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.426
And I often do this where, hey,
I'm dealing with the situation,

133
00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:56.420
how have you thought about that?

134
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.002
How would you approach the situation?

135
00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:02.360
And so I think that's really valuable
as a manager to think about that.

136
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.111
You can definitely read books and
gain a lot of insights that way, but

137
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.810
sometimes it's also just asking
your peers and getting insights.

138
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.911
So that's what I wanna try and
leverage in this course.

139
00:08:14.545 --> 00:08:19.156
All right, before we go into
setting your team up for success,

140
00:08:19.156 --> 00:08:22.400
I wanna set why management is difficult.

141
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.660
I mean, it's very rewarding.

142
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.100
It's exciting, I enjoy it.

143
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.857
I love the challenges, but it's a lot
different compared to being a software

144
00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:32.359
engineer and it's a lot less tangible.

145
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.679
And so even teaching a course on it, it's
not like I can give you an exercise like

146
00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:41.530
code this thing and
you can see if it works or it doesn't.

147
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.334
Like I said, it's not as tangible.

148
00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:48.180
Every situation is different.

149
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.258
I've dealt with many times where even
hiring someone or giving someone feedback

150
00:08:53.258 --> 00:08:57.900
even for the same exact thing, it's so
unique and different every time.

151
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.293
There's always some sort of nuance, and so

152
00:09:00.293 --> 00:09:03.410
that is very different from
even software engineering.

153
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:10.381
I know there's nuances, but with
management it's a lot different that way.

154
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:16.064
It requires many skills, oftentimes people
will say you wear many hats, it's true.

155
00:09:16.064 --> 00:09:19.403
There's times where you are a recruiter,
you're looking for

156
00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:23.508
someone to join the team there's times
where you're a project management.

157
00:09:23.508 --> 00:09:27.756
You're leading a project or maybe
you're even playing the role of product

158
00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:32.543
manager where you're trying to think about
the strategy of a project or a product and

159
00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:35.340
what your team should be focused on.

160
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.345
Maybe you're even a therapist,
listen to someone,

161
00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:42.240
vent about a problem that they're
having or helping coach someone.

162
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.124
There's just a lot of different
hats that you wear as a manager.

163
00:09:47.906 --> 00:09:51.690
And those hats aren't given to you for
a week long or

164
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.860
a day long thing,
it could happen every other hour.

165
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.720
You are constantly context switching,
which can be difficult.

166
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.590
It's not the same as being
heads down coding something.

167
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.706
You are context switching
a lot more as a manager.

168
00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:12.750
You also need to be adaptable, flexible.

169
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.730
There's a lot of things that are changing.

170
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.810
There might be new technologies
that your team needs to adapt.

171
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.870
Maybe there's new challenges,
maybe the business is changing.

172
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.470
Maybe you have to like completely
pivot on some priorities.

173
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:32.399
If you need to be flexible and be able to
help your team deal with those changes.

174
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.333
You're also dealing with people,

175
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:38.080
right, we're not dealing with code,
we're dealing with people.

176
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.240
So there's definitely interpersonal
challenges that come along with that.

177
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.930
I personally love that part of it.

178
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.082
I think that's what probably
brings me the most joy as being

179
00:10:47.082 --> 00:10:49.420
a manager is dealing with people.

180
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:55.540
And it's different, it's definitely
a challenge each and every time, Mark.

181
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.355
&gt;&gt; From the developer's side,
management work seemed very easy, but

182
00:10:59.355 --> 00:11:03.580
after going through Jem's 101 course,
I've changed my perspective.

183
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.300
&gt;&gt; That is a really good insight.

184
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.521
I'm glad that they took that
away too because Jem and

185
00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:11.650
I've joked about that times too.

186
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.990
As Jem actually reported to me for
a while before moving into management.

187
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.970
And he so jokingly, nicely, put it
he's like, he didn't know what I did.

188
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:27.450
And it's true, it's like does he
really do anything as a manager?

189
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.670
And it's like, he's in meetings.

190
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.640
I talk to him on a one-on-one.

191
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.550
Maybe see him leading a project or
something, but what does a manager do?

192
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.140
And it's hard to really know that.

193
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.370
And so I'm actually really happy that
that was a takeaway in the 101 course.

194
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.230
It's given you a little
more insights into that.

195
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.679
It often requires experience, and
I don't want this to shy someone away as

196
00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:58.069
that you need to have experience as a
manager, to be a manager, because clearly

197
00:11:58.069 --> 00:12:03.890
in Jem's course on 101, we talk about
how do you actually become a manager?

198
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.727
And so Jem even talked about speaking
to some of the experiences that you

199
00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:12.170
have as an engineer or life experiences.

200
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.440
It requires pulling
from those experiences.

201
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.570
And even as a manager, I'm constantly
gaining more experiences over

202
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.300
my ten years that I am
constantly leveraging.

203
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.990
So that's what I really mean by
experience is it definitely helps you.

204
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.520
It could be maybe as an engineer,
you're leading a project.

205
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.220
Maybe you're helping with interviews,
that's experience and that is helpful.

206
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.440
I hope you're giving feedback to people,
that's experience.

207
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.459
And you learn all these things and
it definitely helps you as a manager.

208
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.980
It's hard to measure, like I said,
Gem didn't know what I did.

209
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.480
He's like, what is he doing?

210
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.870
And it's true, it's when I think of myself
as an engineer, I might work on a feature.

211
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.090
I ship it, hopefully there was no bugs.

212
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.690
People are happy with it,
they're using it.

213
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.020
You can even get nice data
on how it's performing,

214
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.340
how quick it's loading, or
how many people are using it.

215
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.106
That's awesome.
There's a lot more tangible

216
00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:08.520
metrics on that.

217
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.940
As a manager, there's days,
I don't even know what I did.

218
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.470
I'm like, cool, my team shipped that.

219
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.970
I'm excited for them.

220
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.670
What did I do?

221
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.790
I know I helped in some way, but
it's hard, it's not as tangible.

222
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.810
So hopefully I didn't scare you away.

223
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.880
All these challenges, they're hard but
they're good, I love them.

224
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.263
And that's why I've
continually been a manager.
