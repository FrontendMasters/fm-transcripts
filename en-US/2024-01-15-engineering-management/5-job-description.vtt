WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.710
So now, we've decided what
we need on the team, right?

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.232
We're pretty clear, we have some ideas,
I need to write that job description.

3
00:00:09.232 --> 00:00:13.607
I got to admit,
it's not my most enjoyable thing.

4
00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:17.747
I don't know why, or I don't put
a ton of time and effort in this.

5
00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:21.077
And so maybe I'm trying to tell
you all to do better than me.

6
00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:25.959
But I think about it as it's
just a piece of the puzzle.

7
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:30.494
I'm more leaning towards,
I want just enough information for

8
00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:35.114
someone to be excited enough to be,
yeah, I fit that criteria,

9
00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:39.498
I'm excited, and
then I can have a conversation with them.

10
00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:44.070
I find the conversation is very much what
I wanna get to, but it is very important

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.522
to have a really good job description
that helps build up that conversation.

12
00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:53.355
Let's start with the job title.

13
00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:58.821
Let's have job titles that
accurately explain what the role

14
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:03.642
is as simple as possible and
avoid all the acronyms and

15
00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:08.158
all the fun,
joyful things that companies have.

16
00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:12.228
Netflix has tons of them, and we don't
need to necessarily say that out to you

17
00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.686
all if you're applying,
because it doesn't make sense to you.

18
00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:19.445
I also think another important one.

19
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:23.719
This is probably one of the areas where
I try to spend more of my time on,

20
00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.840
is building a really clear,
concise job summary.

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.882
It's that TLDR.

22
00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:33.335
Someone's looking to apply that hopefully
they saw the title that resonated with

23
00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:37.219
them, and then there's this really
quick blurb of, what is the role?

24
00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.938
And in the importance of it,

25
00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:42.602
what's the impact that they're
gonna have on the company?

26
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.760
And then you wanna start to
kinda get into that like, yeah,

27
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.833
primary purpose of the role,
some of the objectives, then you can start

28
00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:56.844
to think about highlighting those
key responsibilities for the role.

29
00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.031
List out the main duties, tasks.

30
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:04.142
You don't need 30 tasks,
maybe it's 10, maybe 15,

31
00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:08.764
it's getting up there, and
you can use action verbs.

32
00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:10.457
I had never thought about this one,

33
00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:13.688
but I started doing that a little
bit in some of my job descriptions.

34
00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:18.839
But you can say you'll manage
the codebase for X, Y, and Z,

35
00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:24.706
you'll develop tools that enable
other developers at the company.

36
00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:27.946
You'll help coordinate
with your design partners.

37
00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.379
It helps that job applicant
really understand,

38
00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.664
just that wording can really help them
understand what they'll be doing.

39
00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:40.517
And you u wanna be very specific and
avoid the vague language.

40
00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:44.990
This is where being pretty clear and
concise, even bullet points are very good

41
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.607
just someone can really get a quick
glance of what that role is.

42
00:02:48.607 --> 00:02:53.132
You wanna be clear about what's required
and what are the required qualifications?

43
00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:54.168
Just be upfront.

44
00:02:54.168 --> 00:02:59.121
If you need someone who knows React,
put that there.

45
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:03.001
They've had experience with it,
that's important.

46
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:09.034
But also, my last bullet point there,
be realistic on the job requirements.

47
00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:10.589
I have seen this.

48
00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:15.009
I have definitely seen where someone's,
it's probably was a mistake that they

49
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.527
didn't realize, but
you need 20 years of React experience.

50
00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:23.810
I'm sorry, React is not 20 years old,
so I'm not sure how that would happen.

51
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.048
It's things like that.

52
00:03:25.048 --> 00:03:30.048
You can turn off a candidate pretty
easily, but it's also unrealistic.

53
00:03:30.048 --> 00:03:34.726
Nobody has that,
the creators of React don't have that.

54
00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:38.252
And then you can also
put what's preferred and

55
00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:42.956
what's required to I like to
separate those types of skills or

56
00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:48.489
requirements is kind of surfacing
maybe some of those additive skills.

57
00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.670
You have strong communication, you're
you're able to present public speak.

58
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.130
Maybe that's just a nice additive thing.

59
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.447
I can help someone be excited about that
role, but it's not a requirement and so

60
00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:02.651
make that very clear and concise, Jim.

61
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.716
&gt;&gt; Got a spicy one for you, right?

62
00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.275
Yeah.

63
00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:09.735
&gt;&gt; What are your thoughts on putting
the salary ranges on job descriptions?

64
00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:13.095
&gt;&gt; I like it, I think it's a nice way to,

65
00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:19.300
if you have expectations on a salary,
I think that is really helpful.

66
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.535
You don't necessarily have to opt
though or after a phone call and

67
00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:26.312
waste time in that if they're not paying.

68
00:04:26.312 --> 00:04:29.846
If you're being paid top of market in your
current company, that might be something

69
00:04:29.846 --> 00:04:32.698
you want to keep getting paid if
you're moving to another company.

70
00:04:32.698 --> 00:04:34.928
So I think it's helpful.

71
00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:38.055
I don't think it's as helpful sometimes,
now we have requirements.

72
00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:39.219
I know in California,

73
00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.602
that's one requirement that
companies are having to post that.

74
00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:44.992
It doesn't give you a tonne of clarity.

75
00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:49.278
I've noticed companies
are putting a really broad range.

76
00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:51.455
It's not really that helpful at that time.

77
00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:56.294
So I like the sentiment of it,
but it also varies, right?

78
00:04:56.294 --> 00:04:58.826
I don't wanna be locked in to someone,

79
00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:03.993
if I say you're gonna get paid $10
million, well, it's not gonna happen.

80
00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:06.711
I wish software engineers got paid that,
that would be amazing.

81
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:11.080
But it's like you don't wanna be locked
in cuz you also might decide that you

82
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.654
want someone more experienced or
less experienced while you're interviewing

83
00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:18.944
that might adjust, and so
you don't wanna be locked in.

84
00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:22.793
It's not to say that you're wanting
to lowball someone or anything, but

85
00:05:22.793 --> 00:05:24.414
it can just muddy that up a bit.

86
00:05:24.414 --> 00:05:29.218
So I think setting expectations is good.

87
00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:33.987
I think the whole you can get paid
$1 to a $1 million dollars is

88
00:05:33.987 --> 00:05:35.765
such an extreme range.

89
00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:37.475
&gt;&gt; Just as an anecdote,

90
00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:42.226
I would also encourage folks to
take it with a grain of salt.

91
00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:46.830
Because I have seen on a lot of postings
that there's a big disclaimer that said,

92
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.488
this is what we're targeting,
but it's based on geography and

93
00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:53.355
remote preferences and
all these other factors.

94
00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:58.754
And friend of mine just went through
a round of interviews and one of them,

95
00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:04.432
they got to the final round of interviews
and they're like we wanna hire you.

96
00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:09.532
This was after weeks of round after
round of phone calls, in-person,

97
00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:13.952
video chat, and
they're getting to salary negotiations and

98
00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:18.208
they're like,
we can't pay you what you're asking for.

99
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:21.098
And he's like, well, but
that's what was on the job description.

100
00:06:21.098 --> 00:06:23.801
And they're like, yeah,
we posted that bit,

101
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.110
we don't really wanna pay people that.

102
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.036
It was basically their answer.

103
00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:31.027
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, I feel really sorry for you.

104
00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:36.319
&gt;&gt; So yeah, yes, take it with a grain
of salt and and ask those questions.

105
00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.527
If it's really an important thing for
you to make your move,

106
00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:45.327
then be really clear about that
upfront on the on the screening call.

107
00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:48.982
&gt;&gt; I would say that first initial call,
some depends on the company.

108
00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:51.487
It might be actually
even not even company,

109
00:06:51.487 --> 00:06:55.291
sometimes I'm the first call where
I'm reaching out to someone.

110
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:57.916
That's a good conversation for
someone to just ask.

111
00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:01.738
Let's get those expectations upfront,
and there again,

112
00:07:01.738 --> 00:07:03.657
they may not give you a solid.

113
00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:07.425
You will pay exactly this because it
depends on how the interview goes and

114
00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:09.296
all those there's factors there.

115
00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:13.117
But yeah, trying to get that upfront
is really just a high level.

116
00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:17.221
Cuz if they're way off, you're like,
okay, that might be the end point and

117
00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:21.517
that we should just end the conversation
now and you're saving yourself time and

118
00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:23.437
you're saving others time, too.

119
00:07:23.437 --> 00:07:29.631
Another thing that often things
is posted its base salary, right?

120
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:32.434
It's the cash, and so that's really hard.

121
00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:36.973
Some companies pay all cash,
some companies pay more cash,

122
00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:41.601
less cash, but there's stock options and
that can vary too.

123
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.001
And so
even having that conversation upfront,

124
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:47.181
you can kind of understand how
the compensation is broke down.

125
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:51.895
And then understand,
they're gonna reward me a lot of stock or

126
00:07:51.895 --> 00:07:55.535
hey, they can't meet my
expectations on cash, but

127
00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:58.698
they're willing to negotiate on that comp.

128
00:07:58.698 --> 00:08:00.364
And sorry, on the stock options,

129
00:08:00.364 --> 00:08:03.823
these things are really important
to have those early conversations.

130
00:08:03.823 --> 00:08:05.400
So I'm glad you all brought that up.

131
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:15.082
All right, I think this is this is one
I feel like companies don't always do.

132
00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:18.005
I've often seen where job titles, sorry,

133
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:22.201
job descriptions aren't
highlighting the company culture.

134
00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.850
I think this is really important.

135
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.965
Celebrate the things that
are good about your company..

136
00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:30.334
Maybe it's the benefits and things that
are available, but even just how you like

137
00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:33.447
to work and what are things that
you all like to do as a team?

138
00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:36.703
Maybe there's a team dynamic
that you really like,

139
00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:40.117
this is a great time to kinda
celebrate and share that.

140
00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:43.339
People join companies for culture, too.

141
00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.988
They don't wanna be just joining for
the tech, or

142
00:08:45.988 --> 00:08:48.332
there's a lot of factors
that go into that.

143
00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:52.005
So highlighting the company culture
is a really good one to do.

144
00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:55.929
If you have toxic culture,
maybe avoid putting that.

145
00:08:55.929 --> 00:08:57.328
But be realistic and

146
00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:02.681
say maybe in the interviews you talk
about where you're working to improve.

147
00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:04.920
Being transparent is really good.

148
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.852
Another thing to think about is being
inclusive and then try to avoid bias.

149
00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:10.046
This is hard.

150
00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:14.866
I mean, I definitely made mistakes,
my God, I didn't write that well,

151
00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:17.359
and there's ways that you can avoid it.

152
00:09:17.359 --> 00:09:22.568
Obviously, just thinking about it
can help, but get people to review.

153
00:09:22.568 --> 00:09:23.359
Lean on your team.

154
00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:25.527
If you look at this job
description I wrote.

155
00:09:25.527 --> 00:09:30.122
I like throwing things in a Google doc,
people can comment, make suggestions.

156
00:09:30.122 --> 00:09:33.809
But yeah, you're not in this by yourself,
bring others and

157
00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:36.062
leverage your recruiting partner.

158
00:09:36.062 --> 00:09:37.421
I think this is really important.

159
00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:42.057
There's also, I think, I call it out
later, I'm gonna call it now, too is,

160
00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:43.973
there's even tools that help.

161
00:09:43.973 --> 00:09:49.758
There's one that I've used called Textio,
and that's how you pronounce it.

162
00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:53.460
It will work for anything, but
you can put a job description in there and

163
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.733
it will highlight some words that could
change to make something more inclusive.

164
00:09:57.733 --> 00:10:01.077
You want to be open to
anyone being able to apply.

165
00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:07.583
Yeah, so
avoid using gender specific pronouns like,

166
00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:12.019
he will be a great engineer on the team or
that's why.

167
00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:17.799
Just say they, or them,
or just other words.

168
00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:19.103
If someone reads that,

169
00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:22.507
they're gonna already feel like
it's not speaking to them.

170
00:10:22.507 --> 00:10:25.972
And you'd be surprised,
it seems pretty straightforward, but

171
00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:27.801
a lot of companies have done this.

172
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:34.531
Avoid mentioning age related preferences.

173
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:38.490
I don't see this one is often,
but something to think about.

174
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.589
Just in the example there,
we are seeking a young dynamic developer.

175
00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:47.589
You don't need the young there,
maybe dynamic developer is not the great

176
00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:50.116
greatest either, but
just things like that.

177
00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:54.173
It's really truly thinking about
how the language is being read.

178
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:57.974
This is the one I think, go ahead.

179
00:10:57.974 --> 00:11:01.986
&gt;&gt; Going to the young dynamic developer,
there's a lot of companies that will post

180
00:11:01.986 --> 00:11:05.471
things like new grad, do you think
that kind of falls into that still?

181
00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:07.560
I would call it a new grad then, right?

182
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.439
Be specific on that.

183
00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:14.954
Maybe it's new college grad or
it's right out of school, minimal years of

184
00:11:14.954 --> 00:11:20.484
experience, those types of things is
your right, that is true but young.

185
00:11:20.484 --> 00:11:24.216
I mean,
you could be going second career, right?

186
00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.824
I have an engineer on my team, actually,
a couple that have gone through.

187
00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:32.981
They started out one was in sales and
is now an engineer.

188
00:11:32.981 --> 00:11:35.586
I mean, they're young, but they're not.

189
00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:38.590
It can speak wrong to them in that sense,
and

190
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.935
it can be in a little bit
exclusive in that sense.

191
00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.477
But yeah, good call out.

192
00:11:44.477 --> 00:11:51.980
I'm not a fan of any job description
that says, ninja, rockstar, guru.

193
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.949
It turns me off reading that.

194
00:11:53.949 --> 00:12:00.087
So maybe someone gets excited on this one,
but I don't think a lot of people do.

195
00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:02.189
So just avoid that.

196
00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:05.337
It's not really specific either,
it's interpretive, right?

197
00:12:05.337 --> 00:12:06.389
What's a ninja?

198
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:08.281
What's a rockstar?

199
00:12:08.281 --> 00:12:12.819
Hard to tell, so try and
just avoid those words.

200
00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:16.373
Any other words that you've seen that
would be ones that you would avoid in

201
00:12:16.373 --> 00:12:17.357
a job description?

202
00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:27.790
I know I've sometimes too have seen maybe
on the inclusive side of we wanna be able

203
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.497
to grab beers as a team and
things like that.

204
00:12:30.497 --> 00:12:32.694
That's not very inclusive.

205
00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:35.628
It's like, we're hiring to be buddies.

206
00:12:35.628 --> 00:12:39.147
You wanna like people you work with and
enjoy working with them, but

207
00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:41.936
you don't necessarily have
to grab beers with them.

208
00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:46.421
Maybe they don't drink, or
maybe that's not their thing, Mark.

209
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:52.311
&gt;&gt; On a side note, what do you look for
in new grads or early junior devs?

210
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:55.766
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good question.

211
00:12:55.766 --> 00:13:00.263
You want to look for, my first thing
I'm gonna highlight from earlier,

212
00:13:00.263 --> 00:13:01.673
aptitude is a big one.

213
00:13:01.673 --> 00:13:05.176
Absolutely want someone
who's wanting to learn,

214
00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:08.520
who shows up with curiosity,
that's a big one.

215
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.062
You don't know everything.

216
00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:11.958
There's no way.
I mean, I don't know everything and

217
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.704
I've been doing this for
a really long time.

218
00:13:13.704 --> 00:13:16.831
Nobody does, but
especially when you're a new college grad,

219
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:19.790
there's just gonna be a ton of
things that you don't know.

220
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:25.830
But being curious and asking questions,
that really resonates with me.

221
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:30.492
Having obviously some sort of experience
doing the task at hand can help, but

222
00:13:30.492 --> 00:13:32.795
you don't need years of experience.

223
00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:36.347
Clearly, it's a new college grad,
I can't have that expectation.

224
00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:40.885
So having those clear expectations, but
aptitude and curiosity will time and

225
00:13:40.885 --> 00:13:41.648
time again.

226
00:13:41.648 --> 00:13:45.143
That's not even the technical skills,
that's literally a skill that I look for.

227
00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:47.859
So leverage some tools,
there are tools out there.

228
00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:50.933
I'm sure there's many that I'm
not even thinking about, but

229
00:13:50.933 --> 00:13:53.949
I mentioned Textio earlier that
it really just highlights and

230
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:57.144
it's helped me just flag things
that I didn't even think about.

231
00:13:57.144 --> 00:14:02.455
I mean, we've got so much AI now too
like ChatGPT definitely helped make

232
00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:08.042
things more concise, more clear,
word it better, leverage those tools.

233
00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:10.953
Maybe you tell it to write
your whole job description.

234
00:14:10.953 --> 00:14:13.630
I don't know if that's gonna be perfect,
but it's a good starting point.
