1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
All right, so audience, Scenario 1,

2
00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:07.852
you're dealing with some interpersonal
conflict within your team.

3
00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:14.470
Engineer 1 and Engineer 2 are having some
aggressive behavior in code reviews.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.020
How would you have approached this?

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.610
You heard what Jem and I both said.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.350
What are some suggestions you have?

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.910
Yes?

8
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.086
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's kinda been
a theme over this last two days anyway,

9
00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:29.500
is the approaching things with
curiosity and good intent.

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.187
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And

11
00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:35.550
maybe giving that feedback to Engineer2
when they're doing code reviews.

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.125
I know me, personally, when I'm doing code
reviews, I look at it initially and go,

13
00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:40.280
I wouldn't do it that way.

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.187
And I'm like, wait, but there's
a bunch of different ways to do it.

15
00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:50.328
Might be in a different way, maybe it's
not adhering to the coding standards or

16
00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:55.280
whatever, but just kind of having
that engineer kinda have that

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.160
mindset might help for better,
less combative code reviews.

18
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.105
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, cuz positive
intent going both ways is so good.

19
00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.049
Yes, go ahead.

20
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.205
&gt;&gt; I think one thing jumps out is,
well, in this scenario,

21
00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:13.563
you could go look at the code reviews and
see the actual comments.

22
00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:16.829
I think the other thing I
would be curious about, too,

23
00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.310
is this just a problem with Engineer 1 or
the entire team?

24
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.084
To understand if the entire team
is kind of feeling this way or

25
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:28.895
these comments do appear somewhat
aggressive on other code reviews as well.

26
00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:33.224
But then also, too, if it's something
I need to work with Engineer 2 on,

27
00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:37.720
kind of going through and coaching that,
maybe they don't have ill intent.

28
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.325
Maybe it is a cultural way in which they
are speaking, different things like that.

29
00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:46.888
Everyone comes from different backgrounds,
so maybe it's just the way that their

30
00:01:46.888 --> 00:01:50.874
messages come off in a digital world
that's misconstrued all the time.

31
00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:55.322
So kind of coaching them how to maybe add
a little bit of fluff in there when you

32
00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:56.656
wanna give feedback.

33
00:01:56.656 --> 00:02:00.544
Or use ChatGPT to kind of learn some
better ways to soften some ways to give

34
00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:01.967
constructive feedback.

35
00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.086
And kind of giving them those tools, so

36
00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:06.921
that they can be successful
within the team as well.

37
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:07.786
&gt;&gt; I love that too.

38
00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:12.531
And I think just touching on that too is
in a remote world, we're relying a lot

39
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:17.575
more on Slack, and text-based, and
it's really hard to know the tone, right?

40
00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:22.273
And so even just getting those two
people to have a conversation outside of

41
00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:23.270
a chat is huge.

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.753
But I love what you said there, too,
is there's also tools to kind of,

43
00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:28.508
can you make this sound less harsh?

44
00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:31.590
And ChatGPT will help you there.

45
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.198
&gt;&gt; Jump off what you
said about ill intent.

46
00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:38.309
You don't know what's going on fully,
you may, but you may not,

47
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.696
know what's going on fully
in other people's lives.

48
00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:45.426
And so some things could be bleeding
through, maybe unintentional.

49
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:50.142
And so, yeah, starting with
the assumption that people aren't coming

50
00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:52.865
into the conversations with ill intent.

51
00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:58.066
Kind of that curiosity, but maybe a
different coin of that, side of the coin.

52
00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:02.686
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean even for, going back to
the remote world, I will say that for me,

53
00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:06.905
if I'm bouncing between meetings,
I do get Slack messages to people.

54
00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:10.409
And I'm quick to respond, and
my tone might have been off.

55
00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.961
And that sucks if someone reads that or
misinterprets that.

56
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.328
And so I was just quick to respond, that
person might have just been quick giving

57
00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:21.078
feedback because they're
behind on something.

58
00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:24.011
They still wanna give feedback
on a pull request, but

59
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.603
it wasn't their intent to necessarily
come across in that tone.

60
00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:31.657
So I think it is really good,
I guess curiosity we've called out, but

61
00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:34.698
understanding someone's
intent can go a long way.

62
00:03:34.698 --> 00:03:36.958
There's one more comment.

63
00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.005
&gt;&gt; For this one specific example, I wanted
to remind people that you can actually

64
00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:43.170
leave positive comments in code review.

65
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.654
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

66
00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:46.621
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I joined a team once and

67
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:50.416
I actually had somebody give feedback,
and they were like,

68
00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:55.050
I never even thought to give positive
feedback, on something that they liked.

69
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.932
And I was like, yeah, that's an option.

70
00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:58.172
&gt;&gt; Positive feedback goes a long way.

71
00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:01.903
Yes, it really, truly does.
And it's so easy to forget.

72
00:04:01.903 --> 00:04:07.604
All right, we'll jump to Scenario 2,
where you've had the partner disagreement.

73
00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:10.361
Curious of your thoughts.

74
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:14.170
Or I guess it wasn't
partners disagreement, but

75
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.716
necessarily a two team, one person on
your team and one on another team.

76
00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:20.530
Yeah?

77
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.858
&gt;&gt; Actually literally had
this happen last week.

78
00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:28.596
We had a contractor working
on some things that didn't

79
00:04:28.596 --> 00:04:33.441
follow the process of having
two approvals on their PR.

80
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:40.524
And also added some NPM dependencies that
didn't have a clear explanation for why.

81
00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:44.648
And it seemed hadn't addressed feedback or

82
00:04:44.648 --> 00:04:49.670
didn't get feedback on why
that would be happening.

83
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.752
And so I had two separate people from
two different teams come to me saying,

84
00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.102
hey, I'm concerned about this.

85
00:04:57.102 --> 00:05:00.970
There's some knowledge gaps
in terms of how to use git.

86
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.088
There was a lack of understanding
on how reverts work and

87
00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:08.954
how to rework the original
work into a better state.

88
00:05:08.954 --> 00:05:14.013
And I got a message just today talking
about how, after I let them know,

89
00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:19.767
here, I'll work with my partner manager,
we'll bring this to his attention.

90
00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:24.942
I'll look through what's going on and
find out, and then let's find

91
00:05:24.942 --> 00:05:30.041
a way to give that feedback in
a constructive way to the other person.

92
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:35.150
And I had one of the two engineers who
was complaining reach out to me today,

93
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.956
say, hey, this engineer reached out
to me asking for help with this.

94
00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:41.039
I worked with him on it, and

95
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.973
then I found out it's more complicated
than I thought it was originally.

96
00:05:43.973 --> 00:05:46.535
So I'll work with him on how to solve it.

97
00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:47.118
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

98
00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:50.913
Yeah, these are real world scenarios, too.

99
00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:52.793
And I love how you've approached that,
too.

100
00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:56.238
And just even something like git,
maybe there's just someone

101
00:05:56.238 --> 00:06:01.048
didn't fully understand that, and you need
to up-level that knowledge on the team and

102
00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:04.250
just make people feel more
comfortable in that space too.

103
00:06:07.243 --> 00:06:08.219
Yeah?

104
00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.754
&gt;&gt; I think with this one, too, it's kind
of sitting with that engineer and saying,

105
00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:14.316
all right, let's check the facts
of what everything is and

106
00:06:14.316 --> 00:06:15.868
then let's also check our biases.

107
00:06:15.868 --> 00:06:19.360
So what on the team, say you've got
a front end team and a back end team.

108
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.155
So these engineers on the front end team,
they think it should work in a certain way

109
00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:25.852
because they're consuming
the back end in a certain way.

110
00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:30.199
Vice versa, the back end team might think
they have to do something that way.

111
00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.908
So trying to figure out the biases
between how those teams work and

112
00:06:33.908 --> 00:06:38.371
how maybe those things could work together
and kind of coaching them through.

113
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.072
Being able to ask those questions and
recognize,

114
00:06:41.072 --> 00:06:45.024
this makes your team's life easier, but
it makes them ten times harder there.

115
00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:49.449
So having those kind of conversations with
the engineer as well to really understand

116
00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.747
what this scenario is, but also then help
them think about it in different ways and

117
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.456
put themselves in their shoes.

118
00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:56.188
&gt;&gt; I love that.

119
00:06:56.188 --> 00:06:59.469
And I'm smiling because I feel like
I recently have dealt with this.

120
00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.423
Even just in my team,
I do have front end and back end, and

121
00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:05.580
full-stack engineers on
the product they're working on.

122
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.403
And that has happened, where it's like,
well, why can't the back end do this?

123
00:07:09.403 --> 00:07:12.727
And it's kinda back and forth, and
you have to try and understand,

124
00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:17.038
going back to some of those trade-offs of,
well, yeah, you think that it should, but

125
00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:21.144
it's so much harder on there, and maybe it
is actually better for the UI to do this.

126
00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:24.941
Just kind of approaching it that way too
is like, what's the best for the business,

127
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:25.970
and getting us there?

128
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.855
That's awesome.

129
00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:32.296
All right, what about customers?

130
00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:35.050
You've gotten feedback on
the product that you work on.

131
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.375
This one was really specific probably,
too, an internal customer being able to

132
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:43.191
bring this attention, but you have
products out in the world too that,

133
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.460
I mean, I see feedback on Twitter
on what Netflix should do.

134
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.676
It happens, and
how do you maybe address it?

135
00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:52.003
I think it's easier to
address with internal, but

136
00:07:52.003 --> 00:07:53.853
I'm curious your thoughts on this one?

137
00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:54.720
Yeah?

138
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.936
&gt;&gt; One of the things that Jem mentioned,
I recall,

139
00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:02.654
was just taking that perspective of
having empathy for your customer.

140
00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:07.254
Seeing things from their perspective
goes a long way to really

141
00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:12.915
understanding in what way the product
isn't meeting their expectations or

142
00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:15.844
their needs or solving their use case.

143
00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:19.982
One thing I'm always sure to do in
those situations is thank them for

144
00:08:19.982 --> 00:08:21.588
providing the feedback.

145
00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:23.734
&gt;&gt; Yes.

146
00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:26.019
&gt;&gt; Because a lot of times,
especially with internal customers.

147
00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:31.574
I think you had mentioned this, too, is
you'll hear about it when things go wrong

148
00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:36.906
most of the time, but you don't always
hear when you're doing things right.

149
00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:42.357
So just thanking them and making sure that
they know the feedback is appreciated,

150
00:08:42.357 --> 00:08:45.201
whether it's positive or constructive,

151
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:49.157
keeps that line of communication open and
bidirectional.

152
00:08:49.157 --> 00:08:55.460
So yeah, I think it's really important
to have a shared empathy for

153
00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:02.659
what is it that we're trying to solve,
and how are we going about solving it?

154
00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:03.839
&gt;&gt; I love the thanknyou part.

155
00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.097
Thank you for the feedback.

156
00:09:05.097 --> 00:09:05.883
It's a gift.

157
00:09:05.883 --> 00:09:06.610
Thank you.

158
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.346
You don't have to accept it all, and
you don't have to act on it all, but

159
00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:14.163
you're hearing it, and you want people
to bring that to your attention.

160
00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:18.184
If they're not giving you that feedback,
you're flying blind on a lot of it.

161
00:09:18.184 --> 00:09:19.538
So that is a good callout.

162
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.998
All right, we'll jump.

163
00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:24.278
Sorry, I'll go back.

164
00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:26.909
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the customers,
as Jem and Evan said,

165
00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:30.033
it's a good part to have
the conversation around it.

166
00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:35.271
Cuz I think a lot of in software, and
I love feedback that I get from my family

167
00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:41.197
and stuff, cuz they know I can understand
how the software is built or architected.

168
00:09:41.197 --> 00:09:44.277
It's like, well,
what are the steps you took to get there?

169
00:09:44.277 --> 00:09:49.151
Cuz I think you put analytics in software
to understand how users are using it.

170
00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:53.471
And if you have the opportunity to talk
to a customer and say, I know exactly how

171
00:09:53.471 --> 00:09:57.916
you're using it, is so key to then
probably unlocking so many more doors.

172
00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:00.881
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
even being able to sit down with them and

173
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:05.691
have them walk you through is like,
I didn't intend that you do that.

174
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:08.349
And it's like you can see how
someone uses it, I love that.

175
00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:14.892
All right, last one, leadership.

176
00:10:14.892 --> 00:10:18.661
Someone's adding scope to your plate,
coming down from higher above,

177
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:20.717
how would you approach this scenario?

178
00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:27.216
Yeah?

179
00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:30.795
&gt;&gt; I think the big thing is presenting
all of the information typically on

180
00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:34.981
your JIRA board, whatever, of hey, this
is all the work we have in the pipeline,

181
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:39.190
showing that, giving that visual of if we
bring this in, where does it fall into?

182
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.053
If we haven't started these
three other things yet,

183
00:10:42.053 --> 00:10:43.970
does this get started before that?

184
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.554
Of yes, all three of these things say must
have, but in the worst-case scenario,

185
00:10:48.554 --> 00:10:49.284
what slips?

186
00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:51.549
And if that can't slip,
is the timeline negotiable?

187
00:10:51.549 --> 00:10:56.395
Different things like that, just trying to
really understand that, and kind of having

188
00:10:56.395 --> 00:11:00.922
that visual too of that work, I think
sometimes can help with that conversation.

189
00:11:00.922 --> 00:11:03.520
It's hard to say we're
already at bandwidth.

190
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.396
So being able to have that in there.

191
00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:08.452
And sometimes even putting
those placeholders in place for

192
00:11:08.452 --> 00:11:10.783
those things that
are keeping the lights on.

193
00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:14.924
So that that's represented, because
sometimes your leaders are gonna be much

194
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.470
higher up, and
they're very far from the code.

195
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.570
And so being able to have that as, this
is a big chunk of our time of having to

196
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.747
fulfill these different requests for
things and stuff,

197
00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:29.275
this is tangible work the engineering is
doing, that we can't stop doing that.

198
00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:30.664
So I think that's kind
of how you approach it.

199
00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:33.403
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna kinda
help me educate upward, too.

200
00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:37.689
As much as you as a manager might be
that much closer to your team's work,

201
00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:41.785
I still rely on my team to educate
me in the depth of where they're at.

202
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.985
So it's kind of like you're
pushing that information up.

203
00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:45.795
I love that call out.

204
00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:51.269
Something I didn't touch on, too,
that is really helpful, is maybe that your

205
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:57.173
team is right now, this quarter, has all
the D priorities, the top one priorities.

206
00:11:57.173 --> 00:12:00.536
And so maybe you have to do it,
everything's the P0.

207
00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:04.623
You should never have all P0s, but,
hey, maybe that's the case, and

208
00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:08.650
this one thing is so truly, nothing
else can slip, this has to come in.

209
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.316
I look to my leader to go, well,
they have vantage points into other areas

210
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.647
that I'm not the only team
that they're seen over.

211
00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:17.930
Can we build a virtual team?

212
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.890
Can we pull in some other engineers?

213
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.722
Could another priority in our org
get dropped so that we can do this?

214
00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:28.418
And I think that kind of dovetailed off
what you were saying, is it's educating

215
00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:32.807
them a bit and having those conversations
&gt;&gt; This was asked a little bit

216
00:12:32.807 --> 00:12:37.801
earlier related to metrics, but
kinda fitting for this scenario.

217
00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:42.465
What happens when the decisions
about metrics, or tracking,

218
00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:45.554
are made at the senior leadership level?

219
00:12:45.554 --> 00:12:50.026
At that kind of level where even
your manager isn't helpful at

220
00:12:50.026 --> 00:12:51.925
changing the situation?

221
00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:53.111
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that happens.

222
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:58.522
I mean,, there again, I would probably
take Emily's approach there too,

223
00:12:58.522 --> 00:13:00.949
is educating as much as possible.

224
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:05.314
Make sure that you're giving as
much information as possible.

225
00:13:05.314 --> 00:13:11.060
But also curiosity, what information
are you possibly missing for your team?

226
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.540
As a manager, I wanna make sure that
my team has the full picture, but

227
00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.871
there's often gaps too.

228
00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:19.570
So I wanna understand,
what am I missing, right?

229
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.449
You're pushing this metric down.

230
00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:22.290
What am I missing?

231
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.992
Why is this so important?

232
00:13:23.992 --> 00:13:25.395
How's that gonna work?

233
00:13:25.395 --> 00:13:27.506
And it takes a lot of back and forth.

234
00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:30.936
I think the wrong thing to do
in that scenario is just, well,

235
00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.971
my manager told me to do it, right?

236
00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:36.084
I don't want engineers
on my team saying that.

237
00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:38.598
I don't wanna take orders like that,
either.

238
00:13:38.598 --> 00:13:43.100
And I don't think my manager above me or
above them wants that to happen either.

239
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.924
We're all in this together, and
we see it from different vantage points.

240
00:13:46.924 --> 00:13:51.178
And so I think there's no simple answer
to that, but I think it's really

241
00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:55.015
understanding both sides and
trying to come to a common ground and

242
00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:58.319
sharing all the trade-offs
that may possibly happen.

243
00:13:58.319 --> 00:14:02.974
And then you kind of get a little
bit closer to a picture of what

244
00:14:02.974 --> 00:14:05.531
should go forward.

245
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:09.221
All right, now,
we've talked a lot about giving and

246
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:12.912
receiving feedback throughout
this whole session.

247
00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:18.051
I think it is so critical as a manager
to be able to give feedback,

248
00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:20.540
but also to receive feedback.

249
00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:27.621
So we've also talked about
creating psychological safety.

250
00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:31.265
I think this is absolutely an area where,
as a manager,

251
00:14:31.265 --> 00:14:35.857
I'm thinking about how do I foster
psychological safety for my team?

252
00:14:35.857 --> 00:14:39.427
How do I make sure that there's trust and
that we're able and

253
00:14:39.427 --> 00:14:43.500
comfortable enough to make mistakes,
to give each other feedback?

254
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.100
Feel that we're having the best intent.

255
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.472
And there are ways that you can try and
help build this overtime.

256
00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:51.717
You can't force it.

257
00:14:51.717 --> 00:14:54.689
You can't say, hey, we all just
gonna give each other feedback,

258
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:56.508
it's gonna be all easy and everything.

259
00:14:56.508 --> 00:14:57.995
You have to kinda set the example.

260
00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:02.001
Maybe it's being vulnerable about, you
know what, I got feedback from my manager

261
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.795
the other day that I'm not communicating
enough about what my team's doing.

262
00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:06.835
And so that's feedback I got.

263
00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:08.838
I'm gonna share that with all of you.

264
00:15:08.838 --> 00:15:12.881
And maybe you can help me make sure
that I'm highlighting the things that my

265
00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:14.431
leaders should know about.

266
00:15:14.431 --> 00:15:16.624
And so we can work on that together, but

267
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:21.024
it also was vulnerable that I shared
something that I'm getting feedback on.

268
00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:24.714
So you wanna help create that environment
of trust, share mistakes, and

269
00:15:24.714 --> 00:15:26.686
build trust with your direct reports.

270
00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:28.849
And that's really for
the receiving feedback.

271
00:15:28.849 --> 00:15:32.453
And something that was called out earlier
is, even just saying thanks for feedback.

272
00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:34.965
I celebrate when people give me feedback.

273
00:15:34.965 --> 00:15:37.692
And sometimes it might even be in Slack,

274
00:15:37.692 --> 00:15:41.394
David on my team shared that
I should do better at this.

275
00:15:41.394 --> 00:15:44.241
And he's not wrong, and
just celebrating and

276
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:48.700
kind of calling attention to that and
encouraging others to do the same.
