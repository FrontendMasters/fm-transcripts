00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.566
All right, let's jump into our final
Ask a manager, where I will be asking

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:10.729
Jem Young his great advice on how he's
had to deal with change management.

3
00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.910
Especially as a newer leader,
I would love to hear your perspective.

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.282
We're gonna do one last Ask a manager,
I really wanna hear Jem's perspectives.

5
00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:24.260
He's a newer manager, and
dealing with change of management is hard.

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.460
I still struggle with it, and so I'm
really curious, Jem, how you've dealt with

7
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.787
it, and so I have some questions for you,
and yeah, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

8
00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:38.341
So, what have you found most difficult
dealing with change management?

9
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:39.085
&gt;&gt; The change?

10
00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:42.729
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Largely, I'd say one

11
00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.501
of the most difficult things has been
my lack of experience in doing it.

12
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:52.913
I became a manager in 2021, which was
the year when a lot of things changed.

13
00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:57.614
I've had to navigate, kind of Netflix
first time ever doing layoffs

14
00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:01.598
in maybe ten, 15 years, and
I'm like, I don't know.

15
00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:05.364
I just became a manager
a few months before.

16
00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.735
I navigated bringing in
new VP of Engineering,

17
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:13.803
letting go that VP of Engineering,
hiring a new CTO for the first time.

18
00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:18.458
I've been through three reorgs in,
I think a year.

19
00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:21.093
Actually a little bit less than that,
probably like six months or so.

20
00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:25.261
Adding on new members of my team,
my team changing,

21
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:30.205
my manager changing,
all within a very short period of time.

22
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:32.746
So in all that, I think the navigating and

23
00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:37.539
trying to figure out what I should be
doing with things I've never experienced

24
00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.679
before has been probably
the most difficult part.

25
00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.310
&gt;&gt; And that's a lot, I'm just gonna say.

26
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.501
That is definitely a lot to deal with all
at once, especially as a new manager.

27
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:49.381
I feel like I'm exhausted just
thinking about all that as

28
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.621
even having more years of experience
to deal with some of those,

29
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:55.207
and kind of pattern matching
on how to deal with it.

30
00:01:55.207 --> 00:01:57.683
But yeah,
those are definitely difficult ones.

31
00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:02.779
Maybe just you got thrown in the deep end,
and you're just, this is the way it is.

32
00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.736
&gt;&gt; It's my baseline now, so
that's where the positive looking back.

33
00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:11.612
I'm like, yeah, been through those
things before, it'll happen again, but

34
00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:12.866
I'm not gonna be scared.

35
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.663
I'm not used to a steady ship,
I'm used to an unsteady ship, and

36
00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:18.889
I found my balance for me and the team.

37
00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.711
So it's a positive in the long run,
but when you're in the thick of it,

38
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:24.638
it's very difficult to navigate.

39
00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:25.905
&gt;&gt; It's exhausting, too.

40
00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:27.775
Okay, I truly feel like it's a tough one.

41
00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:31.000
But I do like, yeah,
having that experience now,

42
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.805
you'll be able to pull from and have that,
so that's one takeaway from it.

43
00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:40.374
What have you found is helpful when
approaching the changes with your team?

44
00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:44.384
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to get context from my
manager, whoever can provide that context

45
00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:48.287
as much as possible, and then distilling
that down for my team is helpful.

46
00:02:48.287 --> 00:02:52.790
A lot of times that doesn't happen, so
like you said earlier in your slides,

47
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.384
taking a minute to kind of think about
it myself and not being purely reactive.

48
00:02:57.384 --> 00:03:00.619
And there's times when I have been
reactive and I disagreed with things, and

49
00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.054
I don't have that with my team,
I have it with my manager,

50
00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:05.530
cuz that's what my manager's job is,
to listen to that.

51
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.834
So it's been helpful to calm down,
take a step back, get context,

52
00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:13.393
take it to the team, and
be open and honest with my team.

53
00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:17.004
I am very candid with my team about
things I'm struggling with, or

54
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:21.264
things that I don't really know fully,
or even things I disagree with, too.

55
00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:24.776
But I sort of get it, but
I don't really agree with it, but

56
00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:26.867
we'll figure this out together.

57
00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:30.815
And I think they found that helpful,
rather than me just putting on a front of

58
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:35.197
I'm a rock who knows everything, and
don't worry about, it's all gonna be good,

59
00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.552
cuz maybe it won't be good, but
we'll figure it out together.

60
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:42.686
And then you had a really good point
on hearing your team's concerns, and

61
00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:46.763
taking those, writing them down,
and sharing them with your manager.

62
00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:50.032
Cuz maybe other people have the same
concern, and maybe my manager's managers

63
00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:53.172
can help address that, or maybe it's
a theme for the entire organization.

64
00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:57.312
Which has happened so many times, where
that email they sent out about some change

65
00:03:57.312 --> 00:04:01.572
was missing some critical information that
maybe VPs knew, or directors knew, and

66
00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:03.144
everybody else didn't know.

67
00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:06.829
But putting that together and rather
than just complaining internally and

68
00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.994
doing something about it, trying to get
more information has been really helpful.

69
00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:12.032
&gt;&gt; Now, I love that.

70
00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:14.677
It's like, yeah,
definitely approaching it too.

71
00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:17.660
It's being transparent
on your feelings too.

72
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.684
You're showing your own vulnerability too.

73
00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:22.494
It's like, yeah,
you don't have all the answers,

74
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:24.685
you're not going to, and that's okay.

75
00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:29.622
Rather than trying to have all
the answers, which ends up backfiring.

76
00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:34.321
&gt;&gt; One more of a manager tip I
found really useful is writing down

77
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:38.018
what happened, like things I've navigated.

78
00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:40.493
Cuz a year from now,
I don't remember these crises,

79
00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:43.634
the infires that I've had to put out,
and things I've dealt with.

80
00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:47.327
So I keep a separate doc of Q1 2022,
here's what happened, and

81
00:04:47.327 --> 00:04:51.848
here's how I dealt with it, here's what
happened, here's how I dealt with it, so

82
00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:56.587
that I can reflect later on, yeah, I have
grown, I have experienced this before.

83
00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.661
But even when you're looking for
another job in the future,

84
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:03.275
which you're always kind of
looking around, you can say, yeah,

85
00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:07.451
I have overcome a lot personally, and
here's how I navigated these challenges.

86
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.737
Cuz people are gonna ask you that.

87
00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:13.897
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in interviews they always ask,
tell me about a time when you've had to

88
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:18.383
deal with a hard conversation, tell me at
a time when you've dealt with conflict.

89
00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:22.291
And I love that, I'm totally stealing
that from you as just documenting and

90
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:24.380
reflecting better, that's awesome.

91
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.628
I think it also reminds you on how to deal
with some of those situations better,

92
00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:32.822
and even reflecting on
what mistakes you made.

93
00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:36.564
Cuz you probably could have
done something better,

94
00:05:36.564 --> 00:05:40.996
in how you messaged it, and
just reflecting on that is great.

95
00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:45.039
What's something that maybe would have
helped you maybe prepare a little

96
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:45.632
bit more?

97
00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:49.485
You kinda got thrown in the deep end
on this change management job, but

98
00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:53.418
what are some things that maybe would
have helped you to prepare for it?

99
00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:55.304
&gt;&gt; I think, recognizing that it's normal.

100
00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:58.650
Change is the constant that we live with.

101
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.634
We've been fortunate in having a really
strong market in tech, salaries kept

102
00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:08.860
going up, jobs were plentiful, and
then that changed really, really quickly.

103
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.028
And then we had COVID with remote work,
and

104
00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:16.608
a drastic change to tech, and
that's kind of why I joined in.

105
00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:22.472
And I think someone just come in and
be, this is normal, it's happened.

106
00:06:22.472 --> 00:06:26.587
Listening to more experienced managers
like yourself and others who've like,

107
00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:28.291
yeah, I've been through this.

108
00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:33.036
People have been through this in the 90s
when tech crashed again, know that, yeah,

109
00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.965
we've done this before
there's no reason to panic.

110
00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:40.287
And I think all that would have been
helpful going into changed management,

111
00:06:40.287 --> 00:06:45.080
having someone there kind of listen to my
concerns, and not back them away and like,

112
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.775
I hear you.

113
00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:49.125
Yeah, it's really tough,
especially your first time around, but

114
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.696
here's some tips that I found.

115
00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:54.544
But fortunately, I had a good manager
during that time who was super calm,

116
00:06:54.544 --> 00:06:58.840
super steady, talked about their time in
the 90s, and their time at Microsoft.

117
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.683
And other times, when they're like,
I've been through this before,

118
00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:04.962
here's some things I've found helpful.

119
00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:09.667
So yeah, again, having that network and
knowing this is all normal,

120
00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:14.881
change is normal, I think there's things
I really wish I knew ahead of time.

121
00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:18.817
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I like what you said, too,
about not only having someone who's

122
00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:22.274
been through it to leverage,
definitely an amazing way to do it.

123
00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:25.856
But I think even just talking with
your peers, like other managers,

124
00:07:25.856 --> 00:07:29.465
even if they're brand-new managers,
how are you dealing with it?

125
00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:32.534
And maybe you can't vent as much with
your team, I like that you said,

126
00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:34.422
I can vent with my manager, that's good.

127
00:07:34.422 --> 00:07:37.561
But even with your peers, you can
kinda talk through those things, and

128
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.093
how you're all feeling about it.

129
00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:41.920
You need those conversations as a manager.

130
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.557
It's like I know in Engineering Management
101, Jem, you called out,

131
00:07:46.557 --> 00:07:48.300
like management is lonely.

132
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.785
It is, it absolutely is.

133
00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:55.095
You have to show up a little bit
differently than sub for your team, but

134
00:07:55.095 --> 00:08:00.010
you still need to have areas to be able to
vent, or not be happy with some change.

135
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:05.170
And that's okay, but you just need
to know how you can vent on those.

136
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.039
Awesome, well, thank you, Jem,
that was definitely some great insights.

137
00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:13.200
I'm taking away some of your reflection
material, so that's a really helpful tip.

138
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.245
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ryan.
