1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.526
All right, well, this is the portion
where we are going to ask a manager,

2
00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:06.424
I don't have all the advice and

3
00:00:06.424 --> 00:00:11.252
I love to lean on peers to help me think
about it maybe a little bit differently.

4
00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:15.638
So we're gonna be talking on the topic
of performance, management, and

5
00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:17.204
measuring performance.

6
00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:23.818
So I'm going to lean on Jem Young to
help me, a seasoned manager and peer.

7
00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:25.821
Jem, I have a couple of questions for

8
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:28.870
you that I'd love to kind of
hear how you approach them.

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.706
So what did you found useful to
know that your team is performing,

10
00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:34.749
they're doing the right things?

11
00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.560
How do you get signals
into that with your team?

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.122
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
my view is may be a little different.

13
00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:45.273
I found it useful to know
I can see how my team is

14
00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:49.003
performing if they point out problems.

15
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.991
I totally don't mind complaining,
I complain all the time.

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:55.103
I believe in the power of venting
to make yourself feel better, but

17
00:00:55.103 --> 00:00:56.613
they also bring solutions too.

18
00:00:56.613 --> 00:01:00.590
So like, man, this thing sucks,
here's what I think we should do about it.

19
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.705
And I see that cycle starting to build up,

20
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:06.763
where people start solving their own
problems and they bring those to the team.

21
00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:11.207
That means the teams are performing cuz
they're spending their time on the right

22
00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:11.740
things.

23
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.691
That's a really strong signal for me.

24
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.944
Another one is in terms of performance.

25
00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:19.941
If people are giving me feedback, and
they feel comfortable like, hey, Jem,

26
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:21.120
what about this process here?

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.422
I think, maybe we shouldn't do
stand up this time in the morning.

28
00:01:25.422 --> 00:01:28.708
Or maybe we shouldn't have this meeting
cuz prople aren't really even in

29
00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:29.880
the office at this point.

30
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.410
And people feel comfortable doing that,
and looking at the team as a whole.

31
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.853
I feel good about the team performance,
because it means our culture is really

32
00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:38.952
healthy and
they feel comfortable doing that.

33
00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:41.728
&gt;&gt; I love that there,
helping you do your job better too.

34
00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:45.656
It's like I saw this point
that maybe you didn't see.

35
00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:49.796
&gt;&gt; Another one is, it's kind of on the
measurement side, but it's a little bit

36
00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:53.570
different on, so we use OKRs on the team,
they're still fairly new.

37
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.074
But one thing I've found is I say,
here's some objectives,

38
00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:00.162
what are other objectives?

39
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:02.735
And the team can come together and
create their own objectives, and

40
00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:03.511
they agree on that.

41
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.700
Says a lot about the team health and
culture and

42
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.530
performance where they're like, okay,
we agree these are obvious problems.

43
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.890
And then they write their own key results
and their own timelines and milestones and

44
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.658
things like that.

45
00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:14.680
I don't have to do that.

46
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.881
That says, they own these areas which
make me comfortable in these areas.

47
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.251
And that frees me up for
it to do other things.

48
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:26.217
But more importantly, if they don't hit
those targets that they set, then we can

49
00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:29.968
have a conversation, not in any blameless
way or in a totally blameless way.

50
00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:34.599
But you're the one setting these targets,
let's figure out what's going on and

51
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.547
what we can fix.

52
00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:38.663
And it's more collaborative at that point,
and it's not me dictating,

53
00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:42.300
it's not them dictating, it's just we're
coming together and figuring this out.

54
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.923
If we can do all that and the team's
functioning, that means they're performing

55
00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:50.610
really well, and I'm free to focus
on other aspects of the role.

56
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.634
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think in those ways too, you're
helping them feel more engaged too, right?

57
00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:58.263
Which's feeling engaged with the work and
not just, well,

58
00:02:58.263 --> 00:03:02.117
my manager told me to do it,
that's a huge difference, right?

59
00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:07.235
And feeling like you can
own some of those outcomes,

60
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.387
and that can be really helpful.

61
00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:14.533
I love what you said too, like people
bringing problems to you, I love that.

62
00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:17.078
And I'm actually comfortable
with even the venting.

63
00:03:17.078 --> 00:03:20.817
I appreciate when someone has suggestions,
or possible solutions, and

64
00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:22.878
they're looking for my advice on them.

65
00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:26.290
But sometimes it can be just like,
Ryan, I'm just frustrated.

66
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.881
I'm so frustrated with this process that
we're doing, I don't have an answer, but

67
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.984
it's not working.

68
00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:33.002
Can we talk about it?

69
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:36.520
And then, the two of us can have
a bit of a conversation around that.

70
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.658
And maybe I'm unaware of
some of those things.

71
00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:42.577
So I'd really love that too,
because having that open dialogue and

72
00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:46.508
having people feel comfortable to
have that conversation is huge.

73
00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:50.186
That's what you want, because they have
a different vantage point than you do as

74
00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:53.071
a manager, and you want them
bringing up some of those points.

75
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:56.573
&gt;&gt; I like your sort of engagement,
I don't think we even brought that up.

76
00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:59.575
But yeah, if the team's engaged and
people are engaged,

77
00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:02.454
that says a lot about how
well they're performing, and

78
00:04:02.454 --> 00:04:05.531
how well they're not stressed
about things necessarily.

79
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:08.101
Or if they are, they're engaged
enough to bring that to you and

80
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:09.080
bring that to the team.

81
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.747
And between engagement and something like
OKRs that they've set themselves, it's

82
00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:18.110
really not that hard to measure at that
point if your team's performing or not.

83
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.031
There's always the part on how
are your partners viewing the team and

84
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.119
things like that.

85
00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:25.030
But that's my job as a manager
to kind of go out and do that.

86
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.276
That's not at a team level.

87
00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:34.518
But I think people make seeing if my teams
are forming well probably too complicated.

88
00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:37.500
A lot of it you can
just feel as a manager.

89
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.180
Just like if you're driving down the
street and your car's not running right,

90
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.740
you can feel it.

91
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.803
You can always say, it's this way,
that you just know something is off.

92
00:04:45.803 --> 00:04:48.259
And that, to me,
is kind of the instinct of a good leader,

93
00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.684
is you can just feel when things are going
well, you can feel when things are not.

94
00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:53.284
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those gut signals,

95
00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:57.050
it kind of give you a signal that I
need to dig in a little bit here.

96
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.403
I think another thing that you mentioned
too that I really liked was almost,

97
00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:04.464
I'll kind of frame it a little
bit different way, but

98
00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:09.158
you're allowing your team to decide what
metrics are important for those OKRs and

99
00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:12.994
really show up to speak to the work,
is, yes, they're engaged.

100
00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:16.212
But then, also demonstrates their
depth of knowledge in the space too.

101
00:05:16.212 --> 00:05:18.188
I think that's really helpful,

102
00:05:18.188 --> 00:05:21.857
because having a high performing
team is they understand it,

103
00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:26.600
they understand the details deeper than
you do in some areas, and they should.

104
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.072
So I think that's a really good call out,
and I really liked that one as well.

105
00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:34.974
&gt;&gt; And also, I guess another lens is how
autonomously is everybody operating?

106
00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:38.074
Do they need to ask for feedback and
advice all the time, or

107
00:05:38.074 --> 00:05:40.305
is it they only bring the critical stuff?

108
00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:43.074
That says a lot about kind of
the experience of the team.

109
00:05:43.074 --> 00:05:47.246
When they're asking me questions, the type
of questions they're asking says a lot

110
00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:50.199
about how engaged they are,
how engaged other people are.

111
00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.898
But I really like the autonomous
working mode, but

112
00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:55.360
coming back together at
the right intervals.

113
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.883
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they probably feel
comfortable to make calls on

114
00:05:57.883 --> 00:05:58.557
their own too.

115
00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:01.764
They're not like, Jem,
can I get your permission to do this?

116
00:06:01.764 --> 00:06:04.043
It's like, no, yeah,
I feel like this is the right call.

117
00:06:04.043 --> 00:06:08.953
I might get input on it, but
I'm gonna push that and make that call.

118
00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:10.123
I like that.

119
00:06:10.123 --> 00:06:12.143
What are things that you've maybe found?

120
00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:15.595
Maybe you've tried something for measuring
performance, or paid attention to

121
00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:18.691
something, or you've seen something so
egregious that you're like,

122
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:21.451
I would never ever use that as
a metric for performance already.

123
00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:25.644
Did I cover them all, or
did any come to your top of mind?

124
00:06:25.644 --> 00:06:28.532
&gt;&gt; Lines of code is such a bad pattern.

125
00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:29.385
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

126
00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:32.346
&gt;&gt; There's things that are really,
really complex.

127
00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:36.098
Especially, I work in the platform space
where a lot of times we don't know what

128
00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:39.906
the problem is, or we don't know how
complicated it is, because we're looking

129
00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:42.890
at other people's code that they
built on top of the platform.

130
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.014
So things like a refactor,
I couldn't say like, hey,

131
00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:48.818
here's a target for
getting this refactor done.

132
00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:52.189
Get it done in this time frame,
because we don't know what it'll take.

133
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.880
Maybe it'll be short, maybe it'll be long.

134
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.470
So I think measuring hard metrics or
lines of code, or

135
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.264
did you get this thing done
on this specific time frame,

136
00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:09.291
it can often be a bad sign of performance
that people tend to lean into.

137
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:13.905
And I think, I mean, I don't wanna
criticize other managers, but I will,

138
00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:14.851
it's easier.

139
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:20.601
Just look at, hey, we'll close a lot
of pull requests, but Emily didn't.

140
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:24.755
And like a sheer of numbers are really
easy to point to because it's kind of

141
00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:28.374
a lazy way of doing things, but
it doesn't tell a bigger story.

142
00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:32.001
And I see that way too often, of people
trying to measure in terms of hard

143
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.176
numbers, without digging in and being
like, actually, they changed one line of

144
00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:40.066
code, and it was brilliant because it
actually solved this other problem.

145
00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:44.068
But it took them maybe a week of research
to figure out this is just the one thing

146
00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:45.063
we need to change.

147
00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.669
And that's where being the engineering
part of the management comes in.

148
00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.036
But I think if you lean too
much on the people side and

149
00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:54.562
not enough from the engineering and
understanding what your team is doing,

150
00:07:54.562 --> 00:07:57.227
you just rely on pure numbers,
which is just incorrect.

151
00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.661
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's so much nuance to
everything that's being done that you

152
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.756
really have to kind of understand,
like that you call that out for

153
00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:04.672
the lines of code.

154
00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:06.410
I also wanna celebrate deleted code.

155
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.822
It's like, yeah,
we don't need more complexity.

156
00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:12.340
You deleted lines of code,

157
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.699
[LAUGH] I'm almost wanna celebrate that
more than I want to count lines of code.

158
00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:20.288
&gt;&gt; Another one is, people,
I don't know, your director or

159
00:08:20.288 --> 00:08:23.435
manager or
whoever is coming in like, so and so

160
00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:28.151
did such a great work and you're relying
on that as a metric of performance.

161
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:33.149
It's really good to acknowledge those type
of things, but some of your higher-ups or

162
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:37.193
even partners are only gonna see
the really highly visible projects.

163
00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:40.476
And if you're only focusing on the team
members who would like to do the highly

164
00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:43.220
visible projects,
you're missing all that hidden glue work.

165
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.687
Like documentation writing and tests
that no one sees, but it's critical for

166
00:08:46.687 --> 00:08:47.748
your team to function.

167
00:08:47.748 --> 00:08:52.270
So it's another one like, yes, acknowledge
it, but you can't lean on that as much.

168
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.140
And be like, hey, Ryan, you haven't got as
much praise from my manager in a while.

169
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.295
What's going on with you?

170
00:08:58.295 --> 00:09:00.650
And that's just a poor way
of measuring performance.

171
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.454
&gt;&gt; I might look at that on you, Jem,

172
00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:05.031
is why is the manager not
aware of the good work,

173
00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:09.430
that your manager is not aware of some of
the work that's happening on your team?

174
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.524
That so and so has written so much solid
documentation that might go unnoticed, but

175
00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:14.760
it's super impactful.

176
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.471
You wanna help celebrate that or
share that up to your leadership too.

177
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:22.191
So yeah, it's a good call out.

178
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:22.866
Cool, well, thank you, Jem.

179
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:23.520
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ryan.
