1
00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:03.529
Now, we talked about hiring,
that's absolutely

2
00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.188
a form of building a high-performing team,
but I think building and

3
00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:12.551
maintaining a high-performing
team is just an ongoing thing.

4
00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:16.759
Even if you're a new manager taking
over a new team, whatever it looks like,

5
00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.651
there's existing people there.

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:22.765
Or even if you've hired those folks,
there's existing people and

7
00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.961
there's things that you can do to
help build a high performing team.

8
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:31.466
So let's start by what does
a high-performance team mean?

9
00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:38.224
And to me, it's like your team
is exceeding expectations.

10
00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:41.866
I mean, at least you're meeting them,
that should be a bare minimum.

11
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.616
But hopefully,
you're really impressing people.

12
00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.252
You're like, that team is dependable.

13
00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:51.150
They're doing the work and delivering.

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.997
You have some sort of high
degree of efficiency.

15
00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:55.996
So that can show up in many ways.

16
00:00:55.996 --> 00:01:00.087
But I think of even just effectively,
I hate using the word resources,

17
00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:02.076
even though I have it on the slide.

18
00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:05.343
But you're effectively using
the engineers on your team and

19
00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:09.776
that they're doing the right things for
the job, and sometimes that can change.

20
00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:13.570
We talked about the charter and
things evolving over time.

21
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.327
Maybe your team, they have some
deep level expertise in GraphQL and

22
00:01:18.327 --> 00:01:20.083
you stopped using that.

23
00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:23.853
Maybe it's like that person should shift
to another team or things like that I

24
00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:27.508
think about, and that you're effectively
using what's there for you and

25
00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:31.595
you're thinking about, do I have the right
people for the job that we have at hand?

26
00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:38.166
Your customers/stakeholders are satisfied.

27
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.490
They're happy, and how do you know that?

28
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.235
Well, ask them, how's my team showing up?

29
00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:46.300
Are we collaborating well?

30
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.756
Are we meeting your expectations?

31
00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:50.118
What could be better?

32
00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:52.153
And that's where I think
that as a manager,

33
00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:55.518
those are the types of things that yeah,
absolute, my team can do that.

34
00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:59.135
But I'm gonna be meeting with
the partners as well, and just checking,

35
00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.394
getting a pulse on that.

36
00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:01.991
What's not working?

37
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:03.664
How can we do better?

38
00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:06.121
That helps me, and
I can work with my team.

39
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.417
Maybe I disagree, too.

40
00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.847
It's like, well, that's actually
not part of our charter to do that.

41
00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:14.332
So I can also clarify with the partner
that you actually have the wrong

42
00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:15.425
expectations.

43
00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:24.072
Hopefully, your leadership team above
you values the output from your team.

44
00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:26.484
And those should be ongoing
conversations as well.

45
00:02:26.484 --> 00:02:30.953
I hope that if there's problems, your
leader's telling you, but if they're not,

46
00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:32.268
or you wanna know, ask.

47
00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:37.048
Make sure you're asking those questions
and making sure there's alignment there.

48
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.498
Your team should be having
impact on the business, right?

49
00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:48.807
At the end of the day, we're paid to do
a job for a reason, and there's outcomes.

50
00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:53.493
It varies and shows up in different ways,
but you wanna make sure that you're

51
00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:57.043
doing the right things and
having impact on the business.

52
00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.677
Now, you'll make mistakes.

53
00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.678
Let's not forget, that's a good thing.

54
00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:03.569
You can evolve and
learn from those mistakes.

55
00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.686
And I don't think anyone's
gonna fault you for that, but

56
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.318
you ultimately do wanna be delivering
something for the business.

57
00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:16.408
And this kinda gets to
that making mistakes.

58
00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:18.489
I'm a big believer in
continuous improvement.

59
00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.606
It's like, yeah, own those mistakes,
what could be better?

60
00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.183
This worked, but
what would we do different?

61
00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:30.435
I'm a fan, I don't know, anyone do
retrospectives in their companies?

62
00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:31.534
Yeah, that's good.

63
00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:34.145
You don't have to do them
just cuz there was a problem.

64
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:37.645
Sometimes my favorite question is,
what's working?

65
00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:39.222
And just continuing that.

66
00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:44.220
But evolving the processes that you
use and saying like, wow, yeah,

67
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.027
we spent way too much time on stand ups.

68
00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:49.615
Next time let's not do that,
let's try something different.

69
00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:53.581
So you wanna continuously improve and
try something different and

70
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:55.289
figure out what works best.

71
00:03:59.368 --> 00:04:03.936
This is a good one, too, that I often
kinda maybe don't think about, but it's,

72
00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:05.473
how does your team show up?

73
00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:07.016
Are they being consistent?

74
00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:08.710
Are you being consistent?

75
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.628
So, people, partners, other people in
the company know what to expect of you and

76
00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.789
your team, that goes a long way for
building trust.

77
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.323
They know how to operate with you.

78
00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:21.937
I mean, I guess you could show up
poorly and be consistent on it too.

79
00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:26.845
Hopefully, you can change that but
people know what they get,

80
00:04:26.845 --> 00:04:30.374
and that is absolutely
an important factor.

81
00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.668
So those are kinda some of the things
I've been thinking about as

82
00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:35.566
a recap on high-performing teams.

83
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:36.320
What else?

84
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.361
What have I missed?

85
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.321
You all have suggestions.

86
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.595
&gt;&gt; One of mine is, how often do I have to
step in for, I think, smaller decisions?

87
00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:52.140
And how often do our problems getting
solved without me even knowing about them

88
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.051
is a really good strong indicator
the team is functioning well.

89
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:58.017
Where I just get feedback from
somebody who was was like, hey,

90
00:04:58.017 --> 00:04:59.798
someone on your team solved this thing.

91
00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:01.165
I was like, that was a problem?

92
00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:02.301
I didn't even heard about it.

93
00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.651
And that's that's where
I like to operate at,

94
00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:07.834
is they're just doing that cuz
they know how to do it without me.

95
00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:11.329
&gt;&gt; That is the best kinda problem,
I love those and they just get solved.

96
00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:13.045
And you're, yeah, this is great.

97
00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:17.606
And then that's a good point for
you to make sure you're giving positive

98
00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:22.258
reinforcement on, yeah, that's
exactly what I wanna see on this team.

99
00:05:22.258 --> 00:05:24.157
Any other suggestions?

100
00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:33.775
&gt;&gt; What this raises in my mind is when
you're having a team that is struggling

101
00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:38.157
and you're in this constant cycle of
you're trying to add features and

102
00:05:38.157 --> 00:05:40.218
solve problems but bugs come up.

103
00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:43.723
And then it's just a cycle of
you're trying to fix them,

104
00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:45.632
cause more bugs kind of thing.

105
00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:49.794
And what I'm curious about, I guess,
and maybe you'll go into this.

106
00:05:49.794 --> 00:05:52.266
But how to fix that cycle.

107
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:55.190
How to try to get to be
high-performing when you're not.

108
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.905
&gt;&gt; Yes, I love that question.

109
00:05:57.905 --> 00:05:59.598
I've totally been in that case, too.

110
00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:04.832
And you need to take a step back and
evaluate.

111
00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:07.081
Maybe your team is trying
to do too many things.

112
00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:08.120
That could be it.

113
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.557
It may be that you need to
actually pause on some stuff too,

114
00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:14.865
and that can be hard to have
those conversations, too.

115
00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:18.159
Especially, if you're working
with a product management team

116
00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.429
who's expecting certain things, you've
got to put an end to this cycle, right?

117
00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:25.697
And so it might take taking
a step back and going,

118
00:06:25.697 --> 00:06:28.736
we don't have the right
processes in place.

119
00:06:28.736 --> 00:06:33.301
We haven't paid tech debt down, and
there's ways in which you can quickly

120
00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:36.932
change those behaviors, but
you have to be very explicit.

121
00:06:36.932 --> 00:06:43.381
So, let's say I had an application
that had no tests at all.

122
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:44.837
That's happened, right?

123
00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:49.356
And that's not great, we're probably
shipping and there's a lot of bugs that

124
00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:53.687
are happening and that might be a solve
to fix the quality that's going out.

125
00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:58.591
But how do you write tests when you're
constantly trying to keep up or maybe for

126
00:06:58.591 --> 00:07:03.881
new features able to write more tests, but
you still need to go back to the baseline.

127
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.693
So I'll set aside time.

128
00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.741
And it may mean that my team moves slower.

129
00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:10.551
For the next quarter,
we're going back and we're writing tests,

130
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.744
that's what we're doing.

131
00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:14.628
I'm telling my team that,
we're focusing on that.

132
00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:19.233
But I'm also communicating that to my
partners, and they might be frustrated.

133
00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:22.311
I wanna talk about it,
let's have that conversation.

134
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.672
Maybe we can't spend as much time on it.

135
00:07:24.672 --> 00:07:27.665
All right, let's talk about that.

136
00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:30.767
So I think about it now is that you
kinda have to do something a little bit

137
00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:31.461
more drastic.

138
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.756
You can't just expect
that it's gonna change.

139
00:07:35.902 --> 00:07:37.824
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And kinda related to that.

140
00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.423
How would you tell a person or

141
00:07:39.423 --> 00:07:43.300
a member of the team that they need
to improve in some technical area?

142
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.857
&gt;&gt; It's a good one, we do get into
some feedback later in the sections.

143
00:07:47.857 --> 00:07:50.395
But I think being honest with someone,
too.

144
00:07:50.395 --> 00:07:54.929
If I'm talking to an individual
on my team, I'm gonna say, like,

145
00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:59.319
I'm a little worried about you
not having this technical skill.

146
00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.972
How do you feel about that?

147
00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:02.937
Do you feel the same?

148
00:08:02.937 --> 00:08:04.558
Are you struggling in this area?

149
00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:06.496
And then the two of us
can work through that.

150
00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:09.949
Maybe it's that I need to help, maybe I
put them in the wrong project, too, right?

151
00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.725
That's not something that
they're passionate about or

152
00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:15.276
it is the skills aren't aligned,
that could be it.

153
00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:19.361
Maybe it's they're like, I do need
a little more depth in this area.

154
00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:22.610
So maybe I can help pair them up
with someone else on the team or

155
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.215
someone else in the company.

156
00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:28.404
Maybe there's going to courses on
something like Frontend Masters,

157
00:08:28.404 --> 00:08:29.760
that might help them.

158
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.073
So it's things like that that
you just think creatively and

159
00:08:33.073 --> 00:08:35.999
trying to how to solve that
is what I would approach.

160
00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:36.654
Question.

161
00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:40.074
&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say,
on teams I've been on,

162
00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:44.041
if you have a great structure,
the team just cares.

163
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:47.173
I think it's really simple,
if they care about the work and

164
00:08:47.173 --> 00:08:50.380
they care about the product,
a lot of things fall into line.

165
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.372
&gt;&gt; Yeah, passion, and they're really
bought into what you're doing,

166
00:08:54.372 --> 00:08:56.110
right, and excited about it.

167
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.952
That can go a long way.

168
00:08:57.952 --> 00:09:03.507
I think about that, even if everyone on my
team is like, I love what we do as a team.

169
00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:08.399
There's certain projects that
speak to them even more.

170
00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.778
Lean into that, right?

171
00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:14.865
Everyone works on exactly
what they wanna work on.

172
00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:15.594
But as a manager,

173
00:09:15.594 --> 00:09:19.114
you might be thinking about that as like,
yeah, you would like that type of project.

174
00:09:19.114 --> 00:09:22.450
I'm gonna keep an eye open for
that kinda project coming up.

175
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.791
And that definitely keeps people happy and
more driven on that work.

176
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:26.862
That's a good call out.

177
00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:32.585
&gt;&gt; Ryan,
if if your team's consistently performing,

178
00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.331
how do you know when to adjust processes?

179
00:09:35.331 --> 00:09:42.138
Cuz you don't wanna mess up their flow but
you're always like, things be optimized.

180
00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:44.727
So how do you strike that balance?

181
00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:45.760
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

182
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.609
Yeah, don't fix what's not broken, right?

183
00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:50.859
It's working.

184
00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:55.344
I think it is recognizing maybe it's
from those retrospectives where there's,

185
00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.710
everything's so good.

186
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.512
Okay, cool, but

187
00:09:57.512 --> 00:10:00.680
maybe there was something that we
could have done a little bit better.

188
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.593
And so maybe you as the leader taking
a step back and saying, what could be

189
00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:10.676
better and just maybe optimizing or
making small adjustments or suggestions.

190
00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:14.374
Or even just asking the team,
too, for suggestions on that.

191
00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:18.792
But I don't think you need to take a full
swing, like I said, where you're having to

192
00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:23.085
pay down tech debt or something, where
you're like, we actually need to pause on

193
00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:26.098
some things or cut scope in
an area to really go deep on it.

194
00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:29.834
It might just be trying some incremental
improvements just to constantly get

195
00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:30.871
a little bit better.

196
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:32.843
I don't think anyone's perfect, right?

197
00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:34.290
And so it's, how do you adjust?

198
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.233
But you don't need the pendulum
to swing too far the other way.

199
00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:40.144
And maybe you do, and
you accidentally do that, and you're like,

200
00:10:40.144 --> 00:10:42.204
it was actually better
the way we had it before.

201
00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:44.473
That happens, and that's okay.

202
00:10:44.473 --> 00:10:48.323
You've actually learned something,
that it was working better before and

203
00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:49.114
stick with it.

204
00:10:49.114 --> 00:10:53.303
It can be painful if you're constantly
doing that to your team, but I think if

205
00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:58.081
you can try different things and evaluate,
you're gonna get better and better for it.
