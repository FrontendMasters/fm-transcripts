00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.002
Often tools that I've found useful,
there's probably many that I'm not

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.124
even thinking about, but
LinkedIn is always the go-to.

3
00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:10.587
It's like, yeah, you can see people's
resumes essentially by looking them up.

4
00:00:10.587 --> 00:00:13.466
There's a lot of search
terms that you can leverage.

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.287
I've found a lot of value
in Twitter over the years.

6
00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:19.600
I've been able to connect with people and
have conversations.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.273
There's definitely people I have truly
hired that we just met through Twitter.

8
00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:28.895
Maybe I've met them at conferences but
it's that conversation had started,

9
00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.848
conferences, meetups,
events, I love those.

10
00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:35.460
You're able to talk with people and
just get to know people and

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.686
talk about what they're working on.

12
00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:40.086
It goes a really long way.

13
00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:41.976
You can set up coffees, lunches.

14
00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:44.581
Obviously, not super scalable, right?

15
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.017
But it definitely is working.

16
00:00:47.017 --> 00:00:51.292
Slack communities,
you can engage on and meet people.

17
00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:54.294
You can look at open source of
things that people are working on.

18
00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:57.580
You're like, wow, that person's
really engaged on this project,

19
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.261
they're doing a lot of great work.

20
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:03.206
It's a great way to network and
talk to that person.

21
00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:07.167
I also think about to that scalable point,

22
00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:12.349
how do you maybe scale or
sell your company or your team?

23
00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:17.293
Find ways to maybe create tech blog
posts and put that work out there.

24
00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:18.684
This is not only good for

25
00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:22.313
people external seeing all
the cool work that you're doing.

26
00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:26.626
But as a team, sometimes it's really cool
to be able to talk about those things.

27
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:28.561
And granted,
you can't talk about everything.

28
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.616
We all have different things that
secret sauce and things like that, but

29
00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:34.287
it's really super helpful.

30
00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:36.914
I share updates on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

31
00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:41.411
Just keeping a small volume of
this over time is really helpful.

32
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:44.184
I like to speak or attend conferences,

33
00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:48.896
granted I don't speak as much,
but I think it's really helpful.

34
00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:51.282
Or encouraging people on my team to speak.

35
00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:52.633
Yeah, you should really talk about that.

36
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:53.254
You wanna do that?

37
00:01:53.254 --> 00:01:54.395
That's a really cool idea.

38
00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:57.821
Podcasts, those are really lightweight.

39
00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:02.725
I'm not saying you need to go create
a podcast, but you can be a guest on

40
00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:07.652
a podcast and talk about some of
the cool work that your team's doing.

41
00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:12.648
One thing I really like to do, and
this is an exercise that I've done and

42
00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:17.750
made other managers on my team do as well,
is creating a dream hire list.

43
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.035
And what I like to say about
the dream hire list is it's

44
00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:25.787
basically creating a list of people that
you would jump at the chance to hire.

45
00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:30.632
What you wanna do is it's probably,
this is not a huge list,

46
00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:36.619
you might have your sourcing tool
that there's thousands of candidates.

47
00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:41.118
I look at this as my dream hire list is
maybe five to ten people, then I'm like,

48
00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:44.612
wow, if you were looking for
a role, I would wanna hire you.

49
00:02:44.612 --> 00:02:48.602
And so I'm keeping them top of mind and
in my networking,

50
00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:53.258
in my little bit of spare time,
I might be checking in with them, or

51
00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:56.186
let's grab coffee and go back and forth.

52
00:02:56.186 --> 00:03:00.319
There has definitely been people
that I've connected with for years.

53
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.761
I end up hiring them because
it was the right time, Mark.

54
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:10.150
&gt;&gt; Will just said keep in mind for
volunteer opportunities,

55
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.755
I don't know if you want to share.

56
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.674
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a local
bootcamp called Prime Academy.

57
00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:23.489
I've actually hired two
of their graduates and

58
00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.025
they're both really stellar performers.

59
00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:31.761
And I've also met lots of great other
mentors who would be kind of in that list

60
00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:36.651
of like, if you were available to
join our team, that sounds excellent.

61
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:39.457
I've really enjoyed
the conversations we've had,

62
00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:43.769
the perspectives you've given to these
bootcamp graduates, things like that.

63
00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.613
&gt;&gt; I love that, too.

64
00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:48.711
And also, if you're volunteering,
you're giving back to the community, and

65
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:50.890
that's even why I like
on even a blog post.

66
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.192
It's like you're helping educate others or

67
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.171
giving insights into
the approaches that you've taken.

68
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.020
I love all that.

69
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.675
Tech is a small community,
I think we should help each other.

70
00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.894
Jem said it very well in 101.

71
00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:06.923
He talked about that of us helping
one another and giving back.

72
00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:10.449
I think that's super important,
but it also can help you, right?

73
00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.414
You make those connections.

74
00:04:12.414 --> 00:04:14.254
So who should be on a dream hire list?

75
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.117
I mean, yeah, it's people you
wanna jump at and hire, but

76
00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:19.769
maybe it's someone you've
worked with previously.

77
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.031
I've worked with a lot of great
people that I'm like, yeah,

78
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.389
I would love to work with them again.

79
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.552
Maybe it's someone that's
referred by others.

80
00:04:27.552 --> 00:04:31.493
I love referrals,
ask your team for referrals.

81
00:04:31.493 --> 00:04:35.777
But someone speaks really
highly of them and you're like,

82
00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.440
wow, maybe I should talk with them.

83
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.711
Maybe it's someone that you've
read a tech blog post or

84
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:44.254
it's like you've seen their open source
work, they're doing something publicly.

85
00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:48.310
Maybe they spoke at a conference and
you're like, wow, he seemed very

86
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.381
knowledgeable about that topic,
I need to talk more with this person.

87
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:57.335
Maybe it's someone who's left your
company that you're like, man,

88
00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:02.304
I would totally rehire that person,
and kind of regret that they left.

89
00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:04.487
All right, so we're gonna do an exercise.

90
00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:08.114
You all are gonna create
your dream hire list.

91
00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:12.412
Essentially, what you'll do is I have a
Google Doc that will kinda help give some

92
00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.307
instructions.

93
00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:16.981
But really, it's going through
your network, look on LinkedIn,

94
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.568
think of colleagues that
you've worked with.

95
00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:23.977
People that you know or someone that's
publicly available that you're like,

96
00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:27.940
I would love to work with that person and
start to form a dream hire list.

97
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.212
And then you can leverage this and look
back to it and kinda just maintain this

98
00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:36.842
list over time and look for opportunities
to connect with these people over time.
