1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.019
All right, so we learned a little bit more
about how to measure a high performing

2
00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:07.580
team and
pay attention to that as a leader.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.271
I've mentioned earlier in some of our
conversations that growth is really

4
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:14.800
important, right?

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.980
You want your team to be growing,
i's that's awesome.

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.707
You're gonna be better for
that every individual growing is going

7
00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:25.040
to be better for your team,
your company, it's all good.

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.879
So are you as managers
having conversations,

9
00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:31.600
are you having growth
conversations with people?

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.924
I've definitely heard of teams,
they're like,

11
00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:36.960
I've never had a growth conversation,
I'm like what, really?

12
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.969
That's a problem, as engineering managers,

13
00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.810
you should be setting aside time for
having growth conversations.

14
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.947
It doesn't have to be every week or
month or it doesn't have to be a perfect

15
00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:53.110
cadence, but you should be checking in and
having these conversations.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.780
So, how do you have these conversations?

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.589
For me, I think about having
really standard expectations

18
00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.730
to understanding baselines of what's
expected of you as an engineer.

19
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.985
It is important for the team to understand
that, what are things that I expect that

20
00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:14.624
if you're committed to a timeline
that you're being communicated if

21
00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:19.720
something's happening and you're not able
to make it, that's an expectation I have.

22
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.097
It's not that you have to make
the timeline cuz we estimate wrong,

23
00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:27.680
we make mistakes we didn't know, we didn't
think of the one dependency, those things,

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.939
but I do have a strong expectation
that you're communicating,

25
00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.480
you're not leaving until the last
minute to raise concerns.

26
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.410
So setting a baseline standard is
helpful for these conversations but

27
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.499
I think one of the really
important things is

28
00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.440
growth means something different
to each and every one of us.

29
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.110
It might be that you wanna be getting
that high level as an engineer.

30
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.440
That's fine, that's growth to someone.

31
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.605
It might be that you just wanna
try a different technology or

32
00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.530
you want to lead a project.

33
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.760
You want to grow in your
communication skills,

34
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.952
you wanna grow in your deep
technical database who knows?

35
00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:12.674
Every growth conversation
can be different, but

36
00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:17.036
you wanna be having these individual
conversations and not make assumptions.

37
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:23.351
So what I like to do is I like to work
on a growth plan with individuals on

38
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.490
the team.

39
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.896
I put a lot of work on each individual
to take some time to reflect and

40
00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:32.270
think about what does growth mean to them.

41
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.627
I don't put them on the spot,
like in our one-on-one I'm not like, hey,

42
00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:39.420
let's we're gonna talk about growth today,
because I think it does take some time.

43
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.959
Some people can be good about
that right off the fly and

44
00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.080
maybe they're even telling
you what they want.

45
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.480
But for a lot of us, we need time to
think about it and reflect on that.

46
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.714
So often tell people, hey,
in our next one-on-one or next month,

47
00:02:53.714 --> 00:02:57.330
I would love to have a bit
of a growth conversation.

48
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.279
And I actually have started giving some
high level questions for them to think

49
00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.560
about their growth and bring that back so
that we can work together on that.

50
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.119
But I think it is a joint thing
that you're working on together.

51
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.179
As I'm understanding where
someone wants to grow,

52
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.948
what they wanna work on,
maybe what I even wanna see them grow in,

53
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.850
I wanna think about how am
I giving them feedback.

54
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.608
How am I being constructive on that
feedback, but also how I'm giving

55
00:03:25.608 --> 00:03:30.340
a positive feedback like, wow,
that's really great, keep doing that.

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.024
I try a little bit more in this area but
that area wow,

57
00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:35.220
you're really getting good at that spot.

58
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.320
You want to give these constant mechanisms
for someone to know how they're doing.

59
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.500
Like I mentioned earlier,
I think it's shared ownership.

60
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.721
I don't want to be it is not my job to
decide your growth if you're on my team,

61
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.460
but I do feel it's some
of my responsibility.

62
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.894
I wanna help you in these areas, some
of it might be that I just have vantage

63
00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:04.256
points to put you in the right position
to tackle a challenge that you've

64
00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:09.530
never dealt with, work on a certain
project, maybe kick you out of my team.

65
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.280
Because there's another challenge
that I can't provide you,

66
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.308
that you wanna go work on some deep
technical thing on the platform and

67
00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:21.980
I manage UI team, I might say here's
this opportunity, I think you should go.

68
00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:27.173
That sucks, I have done that, but
it's better for that person and better for

69
00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:28.637
the company, hopefully,

70
00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:32.445
cuz hopefully they're not having
to leave the company for that.

71
00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:35.745
But being able to find those
opportunities for people is really cool.

72
00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:42.446
Being an advocate for individuals,
similar as finding them opportunities, but

73
00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:44.115
also celebrate those things.

74
00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:46.863
Let your leadership team know where wow,

75
00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:51.968
Sally on my team she's doing amazing
we shouldn't be leveraging her more for

76
00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:55.816
presenting or we should leverage
her more in these areas,

77
00:04:55.816 --> 00:05:00.390
sometimes even just other leaders
knowing about that is really great
