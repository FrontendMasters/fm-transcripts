1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.623
All right, well, this also leads us
well into one of our final sections

2
00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:12.297
in Practical Engineering Management 102,
is dealing with change management.

3
00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:16.527
And I think given the scenario that Gemi
and I we're talking about too is like,

4
00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:20.198
he had kind of alluded that this
might be coming from not me, right?

5
00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:25.120
I'm just the manager that has
to deliver the message or

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.510
change some process and
get the team doing that.

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.991
Change man is difficult.

8
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.730
I don't think I was ever prepared for
it as a leader.

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.517
I mean, I did also say that I was
thrown in as an accidental manager.

10
00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:43.699
But it's something that I've definitely
grown to think about more and

11
00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.422
more, and
how can I really help show up for my team?

12
00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:51.000
So, let's kinda talk about
what is change management.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.226
And to me, it's transitioning individuals,
teams, organizations from

14
00:00:56.226 --> 00:01:01.547
a current state to a desired future state
in order to achieve business goals.

15
00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:04.682
And so that could be like reorgs, or

16
00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:08.664
processes that make you
probably do better.

17
00:01:08.664 --> 00:01:10.844
But change is hard.

18
00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:12.010
People don't like change.

19
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.663
And when it's a drastic change and you
don't know why the change is happening,

20
00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:17.644
that's tough.

21
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.686
And so, it's good for
us as leaders to try and

22
00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:25.266
help people understand those changes and
why they're happening.

23
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:30.510
So some of those examples, reorg, I mean,
tech, we've seen a lot of layoffs.

24
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.465
I'm sure there's a lot of managers having
to have some really tough conversations

25
00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:40.135
and trying to orient the people that
aren't laid off to, you're still here,

26
00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:42.140
we need to work through the work.

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.410
And those are not easy
conversations to have.

28
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.601
Maybe it's technology changes.

29
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.232
We're not investing in
this technology anymore,

30
00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:51.137
we're moving on to something else.

31
00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:53.130
New strategic initiatives.

32
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.384
New priorities.

33
00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:56.472
We're dropping all of our priorities.

34
00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:59.280
This one came in,
we gotta drop everything.

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.935
We gotta move to this.
And

36
00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:02.460
you have to orient the team around that.

37
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.294
Employment changes, whether it be
someone is leaving, maybe it's,

38
00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:10.659
you've promoted someone into management.

39
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.517
It's not a promotion like
Gemini said in Management 101,

40
00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:17.719
is like, it's not a promotion,
it's in change.

41
00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.235
But maybe an engineer on the team is
now a manager on the team, and so

42
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:25.150
that you know definitely changes things.

43
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.061
So, how do you approach change management?

44
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:35.350
First off, this is an important one,
is you need to digest the changes, right?

45
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.956
As a manager, if it's something that
you're not making the change and

46
00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:44.589
it is coming from higher up than you,
understand what the changes are.

47
00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.690
What are the goals?

48
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.900
What's the motivation for it?

49
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.773
What's the need for it?

50
00:02:50.773 --> 00:02:52.165
Why?

51
00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:54.680
And then, how does it impact your team?

52
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.474
Maybe it doesn't have much
impact on your team, great.

53
00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:03.321
Still wanna be able to communicate it and
talk about it, answer questions, but maybe

54
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:07.990
it absolutely impacts your team and you
wanna make that connection for your team.

55
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.877
And then, take some time to think
about how you feel about it.

56
00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:12.548
That's important.

57
00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:16.950
And then, maybe even reflect on that and
go, wait, I'm missing some clarity.

58
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.190
And try and gather that clarity.

59
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.899
Especially, this is all helpful to get
this information hopefully before your

60
00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.298
team does, so that you can show up well.

61
00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:30.512
I've also been in times where I'm getting
the information the exact same time as my

62
00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:31.725
team, and it's hard.

63
00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:35.781
I'm trying to digest all these things
the same amount as they are, and

64
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.343
guess who they're looking to for answers?

65
00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.226
They're looking to me.

66
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.527
So, then, hopefully you had that time
to digest, you've thought about it,

67
00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:50.948
you understand how this affects your team,
you have answers yourself from higher up

68
00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:54.140
leadership or partner teams,
whatever that change may be.

69
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.894
So you wanna talk to your team, you wanna
make sure that it's clearly stated,

70
00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:05.037
what the change is, that that's clear,
and then share the reasons,

71
00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:09.161
the goals, the drivers,
why the change is happening.

72
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:11.833
And then share really how
it's impacting your team.

73
00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.187
This is how I see it show up.

74
00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:18.710
But also be aware that you may not know
all the things that's affected, right.

75
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.817
There's gonna be things that surface your
teams like, yeah, but what about xy and z?

76
00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:26.874
And that's helpful to understand and
hear that.

77
00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:30.010
And then, it's okay to be
transparent about your thoughts.

78
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.749
It's kind of like what Gemi and
I were talking about there's,

79
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:36.371
you don't have to agree with every change.

80
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:41.143
I think there is ways in which you
can be transparent, show empathy, and

81
00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:45.230
say, like, yeah,
I'm a little worried about this change.

82
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.440
Yeah, let's talk about that.

83
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.847
You don't have to be like, nope, it's
the right thing, and sell it to your team.

84
00:04:50.847 --> 00:04:57.471
That doesn't come across as authentic,
but you also have to balance the line.

85
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.736
And then involve the team, right?

86
00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:06.500
Allow your team the time to process, they
might need space, time to just digest it.

87
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.110
You've probably already had that time,
hopefully.

88
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.661
So you wanna give them that time.

89
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:14.678
Leave room for questions,
gather the questions.

90
00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:19.114
You may not have answers to everything,
and it's okay to say,

91
00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:21.047
I don't know that answer.

92
00:05:21.047 --> 00:05:22.060
Let me find out for you.

93
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.993
I will get that and
circle back with your team.

94
00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:30.440
Invite their input, try and
address any concerns they have.

95
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.426
Hear them out.

96
00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:33.750
And if you do have answers,
try and address it.

97
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.215
And then like I said, If you don't,
it's okay to say you don't know, and

98
00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:38.095
you'll find out.

99
00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:41.586
And then, that's where you
can offer to follow up with,

100
00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:45.878
maybe it's the leader above you or
partner team, whatever it is, and

101
00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.528
you try and get that information for them.

102
00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:51.768
I also like to think about this
in a couple of ways of like,

103
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.753
maybe there's follow ups,
as I've had conversations with my team,

104
00:05:55.753 --> 00:06:00.301
there might be some really valuable
feedback for whoever is making the change.

105
00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:03.682
That, maybe there's some things
that nobody accounted for but

106
00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:06.950
the engineers are starting to
surface that it's affecting.

107
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.109
And so you wanna surface that feedback,
maybe something doesn't need to adjust.

108
00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:16.134
And then again, get the answers and
questions from your team,.

109
00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:19.490
And circle back,
circle back with your team,

110
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.980
close the loop with them,
don't leave things open-ended.

111
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.812
Actually, before I jump
into the ask a manager,

112
00:06:27.812 --> 00:06:32.300
I also want to say that after
some changes happen, like,

113
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.302
Jem gave me feedback on something like
maybe I implemented OKRs in our team.

114
00:06:38.302 --> 00:06:41.522
It's great to revisit those things too,
right?

115
00:06:41.522 --> 00:06:43.736
What was the goal for doing that?

116
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:44.644
Hopefully the team knows.

117
00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:47.733
But then if it's not working,
it's great to kind of revisit that.

118
00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:51.723
I hope leadership is doing that, and it's
like, how are things going on that, and

119
00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:52.865
asking for that input?

120
00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:56.637
But you might be doing that with your
team and just gathering that feedback and

121
00:06:56.637 --> 00:06:58.040
sharing that more broadly.

122
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.050
And I think that's an important thing too,
is, things can change.

123
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.472
Dustin.

124
00:07:04.472 --> 00:07:09.974
&gt;&gt; You can have change or like reorg
scenarios, how would you deal with,

125
00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:15.009
if you were maybe moved to a area
of the business where you didn't

126
00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.508
have as much kind of technical expertise,
for example.

127
00:07:19.508 --> 00:07:23.995
Transitioning from managing a front-end
team to a back-end team and kind of those

128
00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:28.806
challenges and uncertainties about not
understanding, necessarily, the technology

129
00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:33.122
that that you're working with or it being
outside of your domain of expertise.

130
00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:34.143
&gt;&gt; That's a good one.

131
00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:37.158
There's a lot to unpack there.

132
00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:39.950
In some ways, it might be a good thing.

133
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.159
Like is a good challenge as a leader,
I think you can absolutely be a really

134
00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:49.874
strong front end engineer and
have that depth and understanding.

135
00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:53.732
I think you can go lead a back-end team,
like, I don't think that's impossible.

136
00:07:53.732 --> 00:07:56.260
There's a lot of common patterns there.

137
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.400
But you might not want to do that too,
right?

138
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.185
Like, you might just not
be passionate about that,

139
00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:05.317
that might be way out of your depth and
might actually not be a good situation.

140
00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:06.630
So I think it's really situational.

141
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:11.098
And it's a good point to reflect too,
is like, can I do this?

142
00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:13.001
What are the things I'm worried about?

143
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:15.470
Can I address those concerns?

144
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.590
What's that gonna look like?

145
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.840
To me, it's a big reflection point, and
it might be, I don't wanna be here.

146
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.171
That's okay too, right?

147
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:27.738
Like, the business is throwing you
in there and you're like, yeah,

148
00:08:27.738 --> 00:08:29.440
I'm not passionate about this.

149
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.020
Might be my time to leave or
go find another opportunity.

150
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.640
I mean, you might be able
to say that to your leader.

151
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.940
It's all dependent.

152
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.347
Maybe there is still room for
you to stay on the existing team or

153
00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:41.390
to move to another front-end team.

154
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.477
But those are the types of things
that would go through my head.

155
00:08:44.477 --> 00:08:48.060
I know it's not a perfect answer,
but it is very situational.
