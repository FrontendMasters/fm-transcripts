1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.733
All right, going back to the vision,

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:06.720
I often think about it is
maybe as a team charter.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.713
It's a team charter is really
trying to help tell you

4
00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:16.704
about what your team does,
and I think this is a great

5
00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:22.055
exercise to do with a team and
think about why you exist.

6
00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:26.479
It brings a clarity on the team's
mission and goals, and

7
00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:32.379
this clarity helps the team, but
it also helps partners and stakeholders,

8
00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.191
maybe leadership,
to just understand why that team exists.

9
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:44.456
When it gets that alignment, I oftentimes
think about there's ownership of

10
00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:49.100
different things that are getting passed
around in a company and being like,

11
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.900
Jem's team should own this.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.894
Because his charter says this or
his charter says this,

13
00:00:54.894 --> 00:00:56.920
they probably shouldn't own that.

14
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.479
And so, it helps bring clarity and
alignment for people across the business.

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.572
It also has team accountability,
this one's a really good,

16
00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:11.034
your team has a better sense
of what they should focus on.

17
00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:14.476
And even when requests come to them,
they're kinda saying,

18
00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:18.594
that doesn't quite fit our charter,
maybe another team should do this.

19
00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:22.381
Or they can raise that flag versus
just opting to do the work,

20
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.413
cuz you wanna make sure that
you're taking on the right things.

21
00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:32.500
So I like to think about the exercise,
breaking it down from a high level.

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.645
There's a good book called The Advantage,
these questions aren't exactly pulled from

23
00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:42.374
The Advantage book, but
it talks a lot about that and saying like,

24
00:01:42.374 --> 00:01:46.300
focusing really high level on,
who are our customers?

25
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.133
What do we own as a team, what are we
responsible for, what don't we do?

26
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:56.444
That's an important one,
right, we don't do or

27
00:01:56.444 --> 00:02:00.768
own the UI,
we only leverage the API and own that.

28
00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:05.513
And so when a request comes to us to do
something on the UI, that's not us, and

29
00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:07.930
it's very clear and people know that.

30
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.490
Why does our team exist?

31
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.486
I mean, it could be just
to bring joy to customers,

32
00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:16.134
it could be to make money,
I don't know, but

33
00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:20.340
you want to have a good clarity statement
around why you exist as a team.

34
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.150
And then how do you operate, what
are things that you want to do as a team?

35
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.660
How's the culture within your team,
what makes you successful?

36
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.404
And then, yeah, how are you successful,

37
00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:33.350
how do you know you're
doing the right things?

38
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.566
So, we're gonna run through
an exercise where we will

39
00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:44.840
actually go through and
start to brainstorm a team charter.

40
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.118
What I want you all to do is think
about your team that you're on now,

41
00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:52.980
maybe an existing team,
maybe just some made up team.

42
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.923
And think about answering those questions
about why you exist, how do you operate,

43
00:02:57.923 --> 00:03:03.050
and this is a great exercise I've done
with my team in smaller breakout groups.

44
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.061
And what's really cool to do it
that way is you kind of bring it

45
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:12.670
all back together and it can be in bullet
points and going through that way.

46
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.906
Ideally at the end of the, kind of the end
state that you have, it's very clear,

47
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:22.080
concise, like one to two sentence for
each of those questions.

48
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.814
But by doing the small
breakout groups with the team,

49
00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:27.250
you get to kinda see
different perspectives.

50
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.460
And oftentimes a lot of commonality,

51
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.870
sometimes completely different things that
come up, but it's been really helpful.

52
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.573
I know at first when I started doing this,
I was like,

53
00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:41.417
I don't know if this is that helpful,
but I've done it a few times now to know

54
00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.900
that it is bringing a lot of clarity for
the team.

55
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.308
So, I will show you the exercise here,
which is available as a Google Doc,

56
00:03:50.308 --> 00:03:55.096
it outlines the questions and
really like I said, it can be bullet form.

57
00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:59.416
Focus and think about as a team,
what you do as a team,

58
00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:04.130
and think about that, and
we will circle back after that.

59
00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:13.222
Welcome back from doing the exercise
of creating your team charter.

60
00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:16.556
So hopefully you all found that useful,
I'm curious for

61
00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:20.306
the audience what are some of
the things that you thought about,

62
00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:24.630
what was something that was maybe
difficult to think about for your team?

63
00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:30.756
&gt;&gt; So, I have two teams right now, and

64
00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:35.015
I started by trying to think of
the smaller team that I have.

65
00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:39.258
And I think what this was very
illuminating for me for is I've lacked

66
00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:44.262
a lot of the clarity on team charter and
team goals and objectives for that team.

67
00:04:44.262 --> 00:04:49.141
We have kind of a duality of projects
with a platform that currently supports

68
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.200
the majority of our business and

69
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.791
a future looking platform merging
with our parent company in Bangkok.

70
00:04:55.791 --> 00:05:00.055
And the smaller team is responsible for
a kind of nebulous goal

71
00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:04.647
of figuring out how we get onto that
platform in Bangkok [COUGH] and so

72
00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:08.665
with a small team,
with kind of a very big scope like that,

73
00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:12.860
it's been very difficult to
find that kind of team charter.

74
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.168
And so this was helpful for
me in finding a framing device for

75
00:05:18.168 --> 00:05:23.372
perhaps having a conversation
with my directors to figure

76
00:05:23.372 --> 00:05:29.528
out how can we reign that in,
how can we find something achievable and

77
00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:34.650
useful to the company
that's within our means.

78
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.775
&gt;&gt; I like that, and I definitely even
recommend hearing from the team to, like,

79
00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:41.100
yeah, like what did
they think of that too?

80
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.766
And I think sometimes taking a step
back could be an interest even,

81
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.695
this is a good exercise that something
even if you have a team that exists

82
00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:52.820
already, which oftentimes you are like,
even as a new manager coming in,

83
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.250
like the teams might already existed for
years, right?

84
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.083
And so I think sometimes just taking
that step back can really help and

85
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:03.270
hopefully bring that clarity too,
any other thoughts?

86
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.091
&gt;&gt; I work at a 20 person startup, so the
question of what don't we do it's kind of

87
00:06:09.091 --> 00:06:12.467
hard to answer given that we
have one engineering team.

88
00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:17.883
But for that one it's kind of thinking
through what do our stakeholders do and

89
00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:22.377
how do we kind of interact with them
of what do they do that helps us

90
00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:25.153
deliver software at the end of the day.

91
00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:28.723
So, we have a data science team so
kind of working with them, and then,

92
00:06:28.723 --> 00:06:32.412
since we're in a regulated space too,
we work with a lot of regulatory and

93
00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:35.232
quality and
we have to produce deliverables for those.

94
00:06:35.232 --> 00:06:38.325
But we don't end up packaging
those up at the end of the day and

95
00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:41.250
sending those things out to the FDA and
things like that.

96
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.924
So, kind of even just making it clear of
what those different boundaries are to

97
00:06:44.924 --> 00:06:48.265
kind of answer that one since the team
itself does do everything else for

98
00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:49.530
the product.

99
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.100
&gt;&gt; I love that, so you're just
responsible for everything, yeah.

100
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.800
But, yeah,

101
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.938
I hope that what I heard there too it's
almost like maybe even prioritizing,

102
00:06:56.938 --> 00:07:01.470
it's like thinking about, well, here's,
maybe it's not what we don't do.

103
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.624
There's probably a couple,
but it's even like,

104
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:06.931
how do we think about the priorities, and
maybe there are certain ones that for

105
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.910
the regulatory things, you're like,
we can't miss that, right?

106
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.497
It's like that for the team to have that
clarity, but yeah, that's an interesting

107
00:07:13.497 --> 00:07:16.240
one, yeah, when you're like,
we just kind of do everything.

108
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.254
&gt;&gt; I have the exact same
problem with writing the, and

109
00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:25.914
I feel with that it's almost,
cuz we operate as two large teams,

110
00:07:25.914 --> 00:07:30.829
I feel like we almost need to break
down the team into smaller teams and

111
00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:33.480
actually give ownership to things.

112
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.569
So that there is more of that,
or it's less nebulous.

113
00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.862
These people own this part of
the platform, cuz yeah, I was really

114
00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:47.706
struggling with the what don't we do,
it's like we again do everything.

115
00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:50.257
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and I like that, too,

116
00:07:50.257 --> 00:07:54.210
as it could be just certain people on
the team might be the like you own this.

117
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.775
And so it's like you might not be
responsible for the 100 other things

118
00:07:57.775 --> 00:08:01.910
that's someone else's part and so
even having some of that clarity.

119
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.198
That can sometimes get in my mind
a little bit too deep in some ways,

120
00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:11.328
maybe it's I think more for speaking to
partners but maybe that is good, is like

121
00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:16.303
they can even have, I go to Joe for
this and I go to Sally for this, right,

122
00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:21.618
it does bring them that clarity and that
might change and evolve over time, Mark.

123
00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:26.556
&gt;&gt; Online someone said, Natalie said,
I'm realizing from the charter

124
00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:32.860
exercise that my last team could have
probably clarified our OKRs and vision.

125
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.696
We were an acquisition team that were
thrown into a lot broader concerns because

126
00:08:37.696 --> 00:08:38.279
of this.

127
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.445
&gt;&gt; Yep, I have been there many times and
even when I said I think at first

128
00:08:43.445 --> 00:08:47.890
when I thought of doing this team charter,
I was like, that's kind of useless.

129
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.582
Like I'll admit, and it doesn't, it feels
like that even when I first like think

130
00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:56.940
about it but once you start bringing
that clarity out, it really helps.

131
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.214
I've been on teams where you
struggle to have that identity or

132
00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:06.306
you're trying to do too many things and
you don't deliver what you should

133
00:09:06.306 --> 00:09:11.640
be delivering, and so I think that
is a really good callout, Mark.

134
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.945
&gt;&gt; For OKRs,
is it more setting realistic OKRs or

135
00:09:16.945 --> 00:09:24.940
more on the influential side of
getting your OKRs prioritized?

136
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.057
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question,

137
00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:30.836
I think it's like you want them
to be somewhat realistic and

138
00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:36.300
you wanna be thoughtful on that, but it's
also okay not to meet them either, right?

139
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.770
There's definitely been times where,
right now with like, being in productivity

140
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.640
engineering at Netflix is a lot of it
is relying on customer satisfaction.

141
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.642
Our customers are engineers at Netflix,
and so we're running surveys

142
00:09:51.642 --> 00:09:58.070
where I might say, last year our
satisfaction for this product was 85%.

143
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:05.333
Maybe my OKR is something I wanna
maintain that or I wanna grow it to 90%.

144
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:10.398
And it might drop, that's not bad,
I mean, that was a bit aspirational and

145
00:10:10.398 --> 00:10:14.830
we didn't deliver on that,
that's not a bad thing.

146
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.307
Cuz it also allows you to go,
what happened, what what was wrong?

147
00:10:19.307 --> 00:10:23.246
So I think about it not way, but
there again, don't measure everything,

148
00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:26.506
please don't do that cuz that's
just the wrong thing, Jem.

149
00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:30.940
&gt;&gt; If I was hitting 100% of my OKRs,
I'm doing something wrong,

150
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.149
I'm not trying hard enough or
making it really, really easy.

151
00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:38.103
So I'd say they should be
aspirational to some degree, but

152
00:10:38.103 --> 00:10:40.407
you don't wanna hit like 30% of your OKRs,

153
00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:44.149
then you're not you're not measuring
properly or something's off but.

154
00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:48.737
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe it's like 80%, yeah,
so you wanna be realistic, but

155
00:10:48.737 --> 00:10:51.425
you also don't wanna low ball it either.

156
00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:56.079
It's like, yeah, we're gonna slip in
customer satisfaction, and so that's cool,

157
00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.055
we can just sit back and that's fine.

158
00:10:58.055 --> 00:11:00.005
It's like, no,
you wanna strive for something and

159
00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:01.525
improve that, that's a good call out.
