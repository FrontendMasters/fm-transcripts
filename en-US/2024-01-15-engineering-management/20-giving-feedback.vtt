00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.298
Let's also recognize I've said it before,
I'm gonna say it again,

2
00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:05.220
giving feedback isn't easy.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.360
It's not something that we
practice on a daily basis.

4
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.130
I feel as a manager, I'm getting more and
more, that's just regular thing for me.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.510
But I recognize that I still
need to be better at it.

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.990
I wanna get better at something that
I'm always trying to do better at.

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.547
But also the people on my team aren't
gonna have as much practice as

8
00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:24.573
I may have on that.

9
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.031
I have the easy way is just not do it,
right?

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.449
Give me feedback it's easy to like man
like that person's not doing so good, or

11
00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.740
yeah I wouldn't take that approach,
it's hard to have those conversations,

12
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.281
you have to set aside time to have
the conversation with someone.

13
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.009
You have to maybe get
pretty uncomfortable,

14
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.749
especially as a leader where you're
like you're not meeting expectations,

15
00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.460
or we need to really adjust and
then those are not fun.

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970
It's easier to just avoid,
but you shouldn't.

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.500
Let's also think about
the types of feedback.

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.477
I know we came up even on
the positive reinforcement and

19
00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:07.360
positive feedback that even on the pull
requests that came up earlier,

20
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.098
it's like It's good to
give positive feedback.

21
00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:12.980
It's helpful to know that
you're doing the right thing.

22
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.400
Sometimes I've heard the saying,
like, no news is good news, right?

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.869
So not getting feedback
means you're doing okay.

24
00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.760
That doesn't really resonate with
me I wanna know what's going well.

25
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.666
And where I stand with my manager or my
team stands with my leadership or partners

26
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:34.281
it's good to get positive reinforcement so
just wanna call that one out but

27
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.897
general growth feedback too I like to
separate not meeting expectations,

28
00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:43.560
feedback to grow feedback and
I'll even talk about that with my team.

29
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.324
When you hear me say, I think you
could have done better at this or

30
00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:49.085
that those are growth areas.

31
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:52.733
I'm not looking at it as in what, I'd
like you to try to get better at it, but

32
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.868
I'm not like you aren't meeting
expectations type feedback and

33
00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.410
that's more what I would
call the critical feedback.

34
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.680
And that one's the hardest.

35
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.581
There's so many reasons that can go wrong,
but it is important for your team to

36
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:11.413
know the difference between general
growth feedback and critical feedback.

37
00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:15.970
Critical feedback is something drastically
needs to change or it's not working out.

38
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:22.330
So, another thing is, yep.

39
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.933
&gt;&gt; Do you have experience or have seen
peers giving feedback on prompted

40
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:32.857
within your team, or do you feel
like it goes kind of to you and

41
00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:39.061
then down through other team members and
like since you're their manager.

42
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:42.819
&gt;&gt; So I'll reframe it a bit
is like does the feedback

43
00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.219
come to me like mark on my team
is frustrated with Sally and

44
00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.083
I hear the feedback and
then I deliver it to Sally?

45
00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:53.396
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, yes,

46
00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:55.840
it will often come to me in that form.

47
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.660
My first reaction is, hey Mark,
did you give Sally that feedback?

48
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.250
A lot of times is, no, I haven't.

49
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.900
I'm like,
I think you should give that feedback.

50
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.970
The reason why I do that too.

51
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.420
Is it's helping build that muscle first
for Mark to be able to give that feedback.

52
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.525
But, also,
it feels escalated now if I go to Sally.

53
00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:23.136
It could also erode some trust
between the team members, right?

54
00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.688
They're like, man,
now Ryan's coming at me on this.

55
00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:27.710
It's cool that I know about that.

56
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.324
I might bring it up with Sally, I know
Mark had feedback for you, how did that

57
00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:34.729
go, did that land, did it resonate
with you, how do you feel about it.

58
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.239
Like there might still be, it's not
hidden that I know, I don't try and,

59
00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.521
be secretive about it, but

60
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.340
I'm absolutely gonna push the person
to give them that feedback first.

61
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.548
It's also an opportunity for
me to maybe help coach on like, well,

62
00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:49.366
here's maybe how I would
approach giving that feedback and

63
00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:51.960
make Mark feel more
comfortable to do that.

64
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.240
And oftentimes, what I like about it too,
is those peers giving each other feedback.

65
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.394
I know when I've given feedback,
even when it's a tough conversation,

66
00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:03.430
it ends up building more trust.

67
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.637
If it's done well, I mean,
it can erode trust to but oftentimes,

68
00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:08.946
you're building that
trust with one another.

69
00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:12.405
So that does happen but
that's how I typically approach it.

70
00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:16.449
If it's really getting bad and
like I need it needs to be escalated yeah,

71
00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.675
then I might have to go speak
with that other person.

72
00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:21.405
But that's usually my first approach.

73
00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:25.393
So I have a question to you
to think about is like,

74
00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:27.499
should you give feedback
in a group setting?

75
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.464
Personally no on like any
of the critical side, no,

76
00:04:32.464 --> 00:04:35.280
I'm not going to do that
in front of others.

77
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.506
Even some of the growth feedback,

78
00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:41.730
I'm probably not going to
give that in a group setting.

79
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.060
But the positive reinforcement,
absolutely, that's a good one.

80
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.710
Sometimes people don't
feel comfortable though.

81
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.086
So it is good to know to understand
how people on your team like to

82
00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:53.530
receive feedback.

83
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.400
If you overpraise someone
they may not like that.

84
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.206
And so it is something to be aware of.

85
00:04:58.206 --> 00:04:58.956
But right away,

86
00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:03.030
I'm not gonna give people constructive
feedback in front of the team.

87
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.075
And another thing is since
we're in such a remote world,

88
00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:08.110
what about giving feedback in Slack?

89
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.331
For me same thing applies
giving maybe some growth

90
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.293
feedback through a direct message.

91
00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:21.056
I'm comfortable enough to do that but
also recognize that if there's a lot of

92
00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:25.617
back and forth going I might say hey
let's actually have a conversation.

93
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.132
Positive feedback, team channels, great,

94
00:05:28.132 --> 00:05:31.934
surface that like that might be a good
one or I'm honestly a lot of times

95
00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:36.074
sending direct messages to my team
where they've presented on something.

96
00:05:36.074 --> 00:05:40.060
I wanna give them in the moment feedback
and I'll just send them a nice message,

97
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.284
saying like, wow, this really great, I
love to see more of that, keep doing that,

98
00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:47.920
I see how this has showing up, and
then being impactful for the team.

99
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.735
But there again,
the constructive where, hey,

100
00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:55.296
you're not meeting expectation thing,
it doesn't end working well in Slack,

101
00:05:55.296 --> 00:05:59.200
the tone, everything, it's really
hard to get that message across
