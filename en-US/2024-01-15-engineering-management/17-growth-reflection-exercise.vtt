00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.624
So I mentioned, I like to give my
team a growth reflection exercise.

2
00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:10.168
It's not fun, or in my opinion,
it's not fun because I don't like

3
00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:14.013
talking about myself, but
I like to give this exercise.

4
00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:18.132
It's a couple of questions,
really to reflect on growth and

5
00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:22.260
to better understand what
growth means to them.

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.410
Like I said,
I give them this exercise ahead of time.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
I bring it up in a one-on-one that's like,
let's circle back in a future one-on-one.

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.252
I've often said like I'm not
putting time on the calendar,

9
00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:36.442
we have to have it done by this time,
but let's circle back,

10
00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:40.980
give them time to think about it and they
usually will just bring it back to me.

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.541
And it helps, I read through it, they read
through it, we talk about it, and then we

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.750
have a really good engaging conversation
on what growth looks like for them.

13
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.110
So I do have an exercise that you
all can take some time to fill out.

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.396
I will show you kind of
some of the questions,

15
00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:00.350
it does follow a framework called GROW.

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.430
I think it's actually does a pretty
good job at getting across some of

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.754
the things that the acronym GROW, is like
your goal, reality so where you are today.

18
00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:15.321
Options of how you could
possibly get there, and

19
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.250
then the will being like,
what will you do next?

20
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.858
And so some of these things can
really help the conversation and

21
00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:26.613
also help you as a manager know
where you might be able to help out.

22
00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:30.342
Or maybe where you can't, or
maybe where you can make suggestions, or

23
00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:33.589
find material, courses,
things like that to help someone.

24
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.820
We'll take a break and
take some time to do the exercise.

25
00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:48.194
Well, now hopefully you've all had some
time to reflect on your own growth and

26
00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.380
be able to fill out that form.

27
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.230
And then be able to leverage
that with your manager and say,

28
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.169
here's some things that I wanna grow in
and have a really engaging conversation.

29
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.015
So let's recap,
we covered why partnerships are important,

30
00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:07.024
how to build strong partnerships.

31
00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:10.793
What are high-performing teams,
how do you measure them, how do

32
00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:15.655
you help build the high-performing teams,
and then having growth conversations.

33
00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:18.419
Now, this is, yep.

34
00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:25.688
&gt;&gt; What are some good growth questions to
ask in these one-on-ones or on the forum.

35
00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:29.013
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a good question I
like to think about it as like,

36
00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:33.318
I'm not a fan of the even though yu have
to think a little bit far ahead, right,

37
00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:35.167
like what's your ten year plan?

38
00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:39.922
I have no idea,
I barely know what my one month plan is.

39
00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:44.228
But you wanna try and think about
outward of where do you wanna be?

40
00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:49.186
And so I think engaging questions like
that of thinking about where you wanna get

41
00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:53.354
to And then, that kind of starts to help
to think about some of the things in

42
00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:54.695
order to get you there.

43
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:59.674
I think about, too, is like it might be
if you are the person who wants to get to

44
00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:04.657
the next level in said company, it might
be asking your manager for that, and

45
00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:07.131
understanding those expectations.

46
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:09.875
What are things that I
need to do to get there?

47
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:14.161
Because oftentimes, there's probably
some expectations there and

48
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:18.022
you wanna make sure that you
are clearly aligned and know that.

49
00:03:18.022 --> 00:03:20.270
So it's those types of conversations.

50
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.940
And to me, also asking yourself,
what does growth mean to you?

51
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.703
It may not be ladder climbing, it might
be that you just want new challenges or

52
00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:33.678
to learn a new technology,
that's awesome and that is growth.

53
00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:36.128
So I think it's really just
about reflecting on that.
