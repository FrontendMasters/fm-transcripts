00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.697
All right, so,

2
00:00:01.697 --> 00:00:07.772
I had to do on like performance of
measuring performance in your team.

3
00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:11.425
Because there's a lot of bad
metrics that you can look at for

4
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:15.736
measuring performance, and
I'm sure I'm not covering them all, so

5
00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:19.410
definitely audience,
people on stream, shout them out.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.840
We've all seen the bad ones out there.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.340
Lines of code is not a good measurement,
remember that.

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.330
No, it's not great.

9
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.920
That's not efficient doing that or
number of commits.

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.590
All right, if that's it, I'm just gonna
commit every little line of code I wrote.

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.512
And that's a commit,
like these are metrics that just don't

12
00:00:39.512 --> 00:00:42.097
really give you any insights
into high performance and

13
00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:44.598
not really something that
you should be measuring.

14
00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:49.220
Time-based metrics,
time spent in the office.

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.990
I mean, why?

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.170
I mean, as long as someone's getting
their job done effectively, that's great.

17
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.381
A lot of teams have or
companies have unlimited vacation.

18
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.250
It's I love that.

19
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.580
You're not paying attention
to the time that people take.

20
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.600
People need vacation in
order to perform well.

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.690
They need that time out of the office.

22
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.039
And so, you don't need to measure how much
time it is, granted, if they're never

23
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.600
there and never delivering, okay,
maybe that becomes a problem.

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.550
But time-based ofbhow much time you spend
on something may not be a great metric.

25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.617
&gt;&gt; One pitfall I've seen with unlimited
PTO that I think actually does warrant

26
00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:35.610
a time-based metric is making sure
people are taking some time off.

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.056
I, for example,
have an employee who asked me for

28
00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:44.388
two weeks off a couple of weeks ago,
because he'd only taken three days off so

29
00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:47.835
far this year, and
that's through my filters and

30
00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:53.333
told me that I should probably be checking
in on that every quarter with folks and

31
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:58.093
figuring out, who's maybe not taking
the breaks that they need, so

32
00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:01.993
that I don't have an unexpected
two-week off period.

33
00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:05.773
Where I want him to take the time off,
he clearly needs to take the time off, but

34
00:02:05.773 --> 00:02:08.582
I would rather know about it
a little further in advance and

35
00:02:08.582 --> 00:02:11.740
also be able to plan for
it a little more effectively.

36
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.520
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

37
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.412
I like the, like sometimes companies
will do like the minimum, like minimum,

38
00:02:16.412 --> 00:02:17.760
is like that's a good one.

39
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.485
It's like it's forcing people
to take that time, and

40
00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:24.680
actually that is one time I might be
paying attention to like time office.

41
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.439
This person hasn't taken time off.

42
00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.344
I'm not watching, but you kinda know when
you're like, I feel like it hasn't been

43
00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:33.710
and you can ask them,
when was the last time you took time off?

44
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.135
You thinking maybe you should at some
point and nudging them, but yeah,

45
00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:39.780
you can kind of get ahead of that,
I love that call out.

46
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.794
That is a really good one.

47
00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:46.040
Quantity over quality.

48
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.878
It's like just cuz someone does a lot
of something doesn't really necessarily

49
00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:52.043
mean it's great.

50
00:02:52.043 --> 00:02:53.561
Maybe in some cases, but

51
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:58.709
I think you can kinda run down weird areas
of trying to measure that for performance.

52
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.960
So these are some of the items I had.

53
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.487
I'm curious, what are some of the other
horror stories you've all seen, or

54
00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:08.925
things that managers probably shouldn't
be measuring for performance?

55
00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:13.500
Jem, you're smiling.

56
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.430
&gt;&gt; We have a section coming up.

57
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.020
I don't wanna steal my own thunder.

58
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.770
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fair.

59
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.320
That is fair.

60
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.090
Anything else that people have seen
companies maybe pay attention to or track?

61
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.330
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Associating card points to hours.

62
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.350
&gt;&gt; That's a good one too.

63
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.309
So if anyone's done like the card points,
and figuring out for

64
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.090
the tracking to hours.

65
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.320
Also, if you're given like
30 hours to do something,

66
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.031
oftentimes people fill that time with 30
hours when it might have taken 15 and so

67
00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:46.330
thinking about that as tracking to hours,
that's a good call out.

68
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.920
Dustin, I saw, yep.

69
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.200
Yeah for you in the chat, PRs,
your tickets completed, meetings attended,

70
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.080
how many stories you've completed in a
sprint or how many spill overs you've had?

71
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.690
Yes, all good ones.

72
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.510
Man, I must be performing really well.

73
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.240
I'm in a lot of meetings
as an engineering manager.

74
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.959
Yes, I'm doing well.

75
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.190
Yes, all those things.

76
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.110
It's like that's not something to measure.

77
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.530
You might have to be in a lot of meetings.

78
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.241
You might not need to be in meetings,
it all depends.

79
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.041
And that should definitely
not be a measurement,

80
00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:22.850
number of pull requests you have,
it doesn't really tell me much.
