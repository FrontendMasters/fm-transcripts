00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.808
All right, let's talk about some mistakes
to try and avoid when giving feedback.

2
00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:11.288
I think it's always good to think about
the mistakes that I've absolutely made.

3
00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:13.952
But yeah,
what are things to kind of avoid,

4
00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:17.775
especially just specifically
around the critical feedback?

5
00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:22.891
I think about it, is don't pile
on a ton of feedback all at once.

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.765
You may need to see
a lot of changes happen.

7
00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:28.869
But piling on a ton of
things that need to change,

8
00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.066
I don't think people
are gonna be as successful.

9
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:36.242
And maybe it is that there's too many
things for this person to change and

10
00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:38.372
address to meet your expectations.

11
00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.757
And maybe that is where you
might have to let someone go, or

12
00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:46.470
it's not the right fit for the team, maybe
they are a better fit in another team.

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.270
It might be that there's
just too many things,

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.490
but piling on a bunch of
feedback is really difficult.

15
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.621
It gets muddy,
they only hear certain things, or

16
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.389
also just becomes hard
to address them all.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.978
Avoid using harsh or hurtful language.

18
00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:05.761
You can be direct without being harsh.

19
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.656
Direct is important,
you want it to be clear,

20
00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:11.417
concise, but you don't wanna be hurtful.

21
00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:15.039
Avoid making the feedback personal.

22
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.608
It's more about the work or the outcomes.

23
00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:19.456
It's not like, you suck at this.

24
00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:22.427
It's like, okay, well,
that's kinda not helpful.

25
00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:25.592
But hey, I'm seeing that you're
not able to deliver this or

26
00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:27.716
maybe you don't have the depth in this.

27
00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:31.559
It's a little bit
different in that scenario.

28
00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:35.920
And avoid being vague with
the feedback there, again, clear,

29
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.876
concise, make that clear.

30
00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:41.383
I honestly, when I'm having
to have these conversations,

31
00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:45.386
I sit back and think about it before
going into those conversations.

32
00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:46.573
Sometimes I'll write it down.

33
00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:50.459
I don't read it as a script, but I find
it helps to just write it out and think

34
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.682
about like, how is this message gonna be
interpreted, how can it be very clear?

35
00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:58.700
Because ultimately,
having these really hard conversations,

36
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.571
the best outcome can happen is
that you set the expectations and

37
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:05.435
then the two of you can
work on those together.

38
00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:09.048
And ultimately, I've been there,
where it's like, it got better,

39
00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:10.143
things are working.

40
00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:12.530
And that's where I wanna be as a leader,

41
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.463
is, how can I get someone to where I need
to see them, get you, and things are good?

42
00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:20.793
Don't wait to get feedback.

43
00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:24.506
I mentioned that, yeah,
six months ago, you did this.

44
00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:25.192
.Don't wait.

45
00:02:25.192 --> 00:02:31.188
Sometimes you may not see
it as a problem right away.

46
00:02:31.188 --> 00:02:35.032
I've found sometimes where I'm giving
a little bit more of the growth feedback,

47
00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.271
where I'm like, yeah,
this could be better.

48
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:40.518
You could be a little bit better
about prioritizing your work or

49
00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:44.086
thinking about timelines,
doing a little bit better on estimates.

50
00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.869
But over time,
it might start to become like, wow,

51
00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.475
you're just not meeting
expectations on that.

52
00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:52.074
And so that one's a little
muddy where it's like, yeah,

53
00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:55.628
I've given a little bit of feedback, but
it might not be the critical side, and

54
00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:59.369
that's okay, it's like, but you're
still giving in-the-moment feedback.
