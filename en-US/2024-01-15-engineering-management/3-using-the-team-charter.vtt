1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.450
All right, so we've built an amazing
team charter now, we all have clarity.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.460
[LAUGH] So what do you do, what now?

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.410
I think it's important that
you've now have this asset and

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.270
that you have clarity on your team.

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.510
But so what do you do with it?

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.630
You wanna share it with your team?

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.165
And what I mean by obviously, I emphasize
bring your team along this journey.

8
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:29.079
When I recently had done this with my
newest team, we pulled in breakouts,

9
00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.224
it's about a 20 person team and
so we did smaller breakouts.

10
00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:37.986
And then there is obviously about, I think
we did four to five people breaking out so

11
00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:41.523
you have about four or five exercises or
sheets that we have and

12
00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:45.260
I pulled them together and
I look for common patterns.

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.120
I even use ChatGPT to pull out some
of the common themes from them.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.523
And then started to wordsmith some
of the details of, really one to

15
00:00:55.523 --> 00:01:01.100
two sentences of, why do we exist and
making that very clear and concise?

16
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.280
And I did that for each of them and
I brought it back to the team.

17
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.460
And there's a little bit back and
forth, well, I disagree with that.

18
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.311
And so we started to get a little
more clarity and wordsmithing and

19
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:13.580
that tightens it up.

20
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.240
Then share it with your leadership team,
do they agree with it?

21
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.540
I hope they do, but maybe they don't.

22
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.698
And that can be even just tightening
up alignment if you all aren't aligned

23
00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:29.460
on what a team does or exists,
that's important to get alignment.

24
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.430
Share with your partners, very helpful.

25
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.123
They know why your team exists and
it's clear and

26
00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:39.310
that's also why being at
that high level is good.

27
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.280
No one's gonna read a 20 page
doc on what your team does.

28
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.738
They might, but
they're not gonna remember it and

29
00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:47.378
you want them to at least be
able to remember it, Mark.

30
00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:50.950
&gt;&gt; That reminded me of
something Jem said yesterday,

31
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.775
people find reward and
doing something difficult and challenging.

32
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:58.294
&gt;&gt; Yeah it shouldn't be easy, right,

33
00:01:58.294 --> 00:02:03.270
it's sometimes taking the step back and
doing something is rewarding.

34
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.750
I feel like my team was happy with it,
I mean, I guess I should ask them,

35
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.454
I wish I have.

36
00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:11.959
I'm, how was that exercise,
what would you do differently,

37
00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.314
always be looking for feedback on it,
share it with customers, granted,

38
00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:22.676
allright For me right now being in
productivity engineering my customers

39
00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:26.679
are people like Jem, his team and so
I can share it with them for clarity.

40
00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.085
When I worked on the acquisition UI team,

41
00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:32.750
my customers were a lot of you
if you're Netflix subscribers.

42
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.304
I'm not gonna share it with all
the people subscribing to Netflix, so,

43
00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:40.001
a grain of salt there
on the customer side.

44
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:45.406
And then this is an important one,
revisit it, revisit 1 to 2 times a year,

45
00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:49.749
you do not need to do it every
other week or anything like that.

46
00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:54.113
But just have some sort of cadence where
you're going back to it and saying,

47
00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:56.620
are we still on this charter?

48
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.480
Maybe you're not, and that's okay,
sometimes teams evolve.

49
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.010
So you can revisit it, say maybe we need
to adjust or maybe we've gotten off path.

50
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.520
And so you can start to have
conversations around that.

51
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.113
There again, bring your team along for

52
00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:15.510
that journey and
have those check-ins with them.

53
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.530
All right, let's recap, Jem, go ahead.

54
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.449
&gt;&gt; On the charter one, the what don't we
do, is one of the most important things

55
00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.560
for my team, who I talked about yesterday,
but we own so much stuff.

56
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.391
And it's like defensive for me cuz I share
with partners and customers and I'm,

57
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:38.380
hey, this is the contract that we were
providing and people, okay, okay, okay.

58
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.000
So a lot of people don't read it.

59
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.065
But later, it saved me so many times in
this first year of taking over this new

60
00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:47.510
team, which is just, hey, Jem,
your team owns that, right?

61
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.550
And I'm, nope, you see right here,
see that thing I showed you?

62
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.933
We don't own that,
we can have a conversation about it, but

63
00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.680
we're gonna have to change this contract.

64
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.990
And I wanna make it really clear
about what we do and don't do.

65
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.032
So, it's one of those
as a software engineer,

66
00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:01.610
I didn't appreciate
a charter as a manager.

67
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.477
It's so important to be, here's what my
team does and here's what we don't do..

68
00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:09.239
&gt;&gt; I wanna also touch on 100% agree
with all the things you said, Jem,

69
00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.883
but I also wanna touch on
as the engineering part.

70
00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:15.697
Is I think that it's like it does help
your team maybe be that first line of

71
00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:18.270
defense if they're asked for
something, too.

72
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.838
It's, they might get asked to
go do something, they're, no,

73
00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:22.160
that's not part of our charter.

74
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.320
So it might not even hit your plate as
the manager, so that's also helpful, Mark.

75
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.153
&gt;&gt; Natalie says a documented charter
is a great contract between you and

76
00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:37.200
your partners for when you find yourself
veering off the path to get back on it.

77
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.146
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and like Jem said,

78
00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.600
you can have a conversation
that maybe it needs to change.

79
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.357
Maybe you should own whatever
they're asking you to own,

80
00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:48.740
but you need to have conversations.

81
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.013
You should not just de facto go own
something else because maybe you need more

82
00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:54.330
resources.

83
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.280
Maybe it comes at the cost of something
else you have to reprioritize.

84
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.324
These are the conversations
you wanna have,

85
00:05:00.324 --> 00:05:03.029
I think the charter does help
these conversations, Mark.

86
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.973
Is the creation and modification of the
team charter, a team exercise or something

87
00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:14.770
that the manager creates and sort of
dictates or is it somewhere in between?

88
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.460
&gt;&gt; I think it's more in between,

89
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.680
I've seen it done where it is a little
more top down from the manager.

90
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.953
I think that's okay.

91
00:05:21.953 --> 00:05:26.845
But I think it misses on things where
maybe the managers writes it up first and

92
00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:29.915
then shares it with the team
to get their input.

93
00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:35.016
But I really think it is a good shared
exercise, so that you can get that clarity

94
00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:40.130
and alignment in a team setting, and
you will have people that disagree.

95
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.228
And so you wanna have those
conversations and hear them out,

96
00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:45.000
maybe you are missing something.

97
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.790
So I absolutely believe her that it
should be a shared experience.

98
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.260
And not just, here's what we do, just take
it at face value and that's what it is.

99
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.031
So, it can kind of start
from maybe in the manager or

100
00:05:57.031 --> 00:06:00.260
you can do what I've done of
doing breakouts with the team.

101
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.083
But ultimately, I think you want
your team's input on it, yeah, Mark.

102
00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.553
&gt;&gt; Daniel asks, if you're a manager and
you have both internal and

103
00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:15.146
external employees, do you include the
external ones in the charters, one on one,

104
00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:16.331
growth plans, etc?

105
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:19.000
&gt;&gt; Its good question,
contractors or things like that.

106
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.660
I think it depends, it definitely depends.

107
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.302
I've managed teams where I've had
contractors that are very far removed from

108
00:06:28.302 --> 00:06:29.700
the team.

109
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.599
I may not include them on the brainstorm
meaning getting that clarity,

110
00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.730
but I'm sharing it with them.

111
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.126
I think that's really helpful for
them to have that context and

112
00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:42.600
understanding of why the team exists.

113
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.040
I think it will help
them be more effective.

114
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.400
But it really depends, I've had also
contractors that are embedded in my team.

115
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.774
They may not be a full time employee,
but they're pretty embedded, so

116
00:06:53.774 --> 00:06:57.650
I'm gonna treat them very much so and
want their opinion and thoughts on it.

117
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.174
So I think it just depends, and
I think use your judgment on that,

118
00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:03.430
but it does help for them to see it, Mark.

119
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.580
&gt;&gt; How often do you revisit the charter,
and how often should we recalibrate it?

120
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.650
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

121
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.797
I typically, in the past, and
probably sometimes even forget to do this,

122
00:07:15.797 --> 00:07:18.490
but one to two times a year is good.

123
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.306
Or in Jem's case, when someone brings
something to your team and you're,

124
00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.820
no, we don't do that.

125
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.560
But then you're, but who does?

126
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.586
And maybe that opens up the door
again to revisit the charter or

127
00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:32.825
have those conversations.

128
00:07:32.825 --> 00:07:35.155
So I think it's a living and
breathing document.

129
00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:39.347
I mean, you can revisit it every week if
you want, but I don't think it should be

130
00:07:39.347 --> 00:07:43.865
constantly changing because then that's
not bringing clarity to your team.

131
00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:47.676
You don't have that path and
you can veer off a path, it's okay, but

132
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.265
you wanna be explicit and
thoughtful on that.

133
00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:54.720
So I usually say, 1 to 2 times a year,
maybe once a quarter even,

134
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.840
that seems like a realistic
check in point on it
