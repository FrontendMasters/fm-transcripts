00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.680
Now, it is time for
you to take it for a spin as well.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.941
Let's see,
let's go over here into basic practice.

3
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:14.843
Which is to take this page,

4
00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:19.246
there's a file called basic
practice that will go to the page.

5
00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:23.656
At this point we want to type
something in the input field,

6
00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:28.156
that button is disabled when
there's nothing typed in it,

7
00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:31.945
it is enabled when there
is something typed in it.

8
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:34.707
The other cool thing, that you can
kinda find out for yourself or

9
00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:35.743
you take my word for it.

10
00:00:35.743 --> 00:00:39.174
Is if you click on a button and
that button is disabled,

11
00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:43.740
it's the same thing as looking for
a element that's not there, right?

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.100
So the act of something not doing what
you thought it did is a failure, right?

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.878
So add a new item, again your job
basically is to go in here, kick the tires

14
00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:58.062
on this application, it might be helpful
to pull up the application yourself.

15
00:00:58.062 --> 00:00:59.827
And just click on things and

16
00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:03.370
then try to basically write
a set of tests around this.

17
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.939
The kind of exercise that in that way, so

18
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.500
you can kind of get comfortable
with some of these things
