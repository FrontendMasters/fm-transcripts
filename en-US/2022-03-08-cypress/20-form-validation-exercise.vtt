00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.404
Your job is to look to see there's
actually an email address,

2
00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:10.340
to make sure the password is present when
the email has been filled in, right?

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.767
And then to look at that
sign up button as well and

4
00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.568
make sure we're navigating
to the page there as well.

5
00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:19.780
So try some of these out for yourself too.

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.965
And so you can, whichever method
is most appealing to you, if

7
00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:27.515
you like checking the property, great, if
you wanted to read the message, also fine.

8
00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:28.381
But go through and

9
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.149
figure out how to make sure that the email
address is really an email address.

10
00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.239
And that they do fill an email address and
they hit submit,

11
00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.040
then we should yell at them that they
need to include a password as well.
