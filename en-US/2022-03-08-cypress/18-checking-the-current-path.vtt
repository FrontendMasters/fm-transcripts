00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:04.946
Let's talk a little bit about some of
the other parts that are not necessarily

2
00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:05.708
on the DOM.

3
00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:09.308
One of things I think I alluded to
earlier, I think I said it while we were

4
00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:13.089
recording, might have been during a break,
but if not so I'll repeat it.

5
00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.766
Is that there are other parts of
the page in the browser that aren't

6
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.155
necessarily in the DOM.

7
00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:22.781
So like querying for them is not always
going to be the be all and end all.

8
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:28.012
Luckily, we have a bunch
of different abilities

9
00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:32.739
to get other information from the browser.

10
00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.661
Namely, we do have access
to the window object.

11
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.996
We do have access to the document
object itself, right?

12
00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:44.230
And like document.title is
whatever the name of the tab or

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.602
the window title is,
the title attribute, right?

14
00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:48.984
That's not in the body.

15
00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:52.186
But it is a thing that we
can kinda get ourselves.

16
00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:58.585
If we wanna figure out whether or
not navigator has that online or

17
00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:04.049
not, checking like the battery
status API whatever.

18
00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.508
If you needed to check those things or
set them or as we'll see later, mock or

19
00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:13.037
stub them to be different values, you do
have access to all of those things for

20
00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:15.219
the purposes of writing your tests.

21
00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.565
We're gonna stick it out with some of
the more common ones that you might use,

22
00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:21.150
right?

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.839
So I have the situation where as they
navigate through the app it's a client

24
00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:30.239
side app, I want to make sure that
the title of the page is meaningful.

25
00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.327
It shouldn't just say
10 portal at the top.

26
00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:33.839
It should say 10 portals and

27
00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:37.897
maybe it's your workflow executions or
your event history or whatever page and

28
00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:41.664
that should change as you navigate
around this single page application.

29
00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.045
Also doing certain actions, right?

30
00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:49.097
We have it, so
we have a bunch of filters like you saw

31
00:01:49.097 --> 00:01:52.982
in the previous secret item menu thing,
right?

32
00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:57.665
I have it set so that if you change any of
the query for sorting and filtering your

33
00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:02.114
workflow executions, you change them on
the filter, it changes the query pram.

34
00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:04.688
If you visit that page,
it sets the filters automatically.

35
00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:09.001
That way if you'd like hey,
I only want workflow executions

36
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.581
from the last seven days,
sorted by search and search, right?

37
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.180
And you want to share that as a bookmark
it as if you go back to or share with one

38
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.970
of your co workers or something along
those lines it's serialized in the URL.

39
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.264
So I need to be able to test
that these things work.

40
00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:27.990
Because even managing the query params as
you navigate around is actually a little

41
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.399
bit trickier than one might want it to be.

42
00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:35.833
So we have access to site title,
which is document.title.

43
00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.260
There is site a document,
site out window, right?

44
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.320
All of the use cases would
be very contrived, but

45
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.109
like if you do need access to something
on there, you can absolutely get it.

46
00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.175
But we'll look a little bit at
site.title and site.location.

47
00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:56.890
Location does require an argument which
is basically an alias to window.location.

48
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.787
But it's like which one of
those properties do you want?

49
00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:02.152
So you say site.location you can get like.

50
00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:05.399
In a lot of cases I almost always
want either the path name or

51
00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.065
the search params which are similar
to query params in this case.

52
00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:14.121
But if you did want something else
along the way, you can get that and

53
00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:17.444
two string are effectively the full URL,
right?

54
00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:21.141
So you can be like hey,
it should include this piece in it.

55
00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:23.940
So if we're on this page,
it should include this, right?

56
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.625
Or the query params should have
this key equal sign, this value.

57
00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:30.544
If I've manipulated the page
in such a way, right?

58
00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.134
You test all those things
to make sure that they,

59
00:03:33.134 --> 00:03:36.116
there's other things that
are quietly break, right?

60
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:40.889
And then all of a sudden your app
is not behaving as you expected.

61
00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.817
So let's go take a look at that.

62
00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:46.719
We'll go into yet another application.

63
00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.897
This one's got a bunch of things.

64
00:03:47.897 --> 00:03:51.899
Let's take a quick second
to just admire it.

65
00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:06.578
So this page, it does have
the ability to sign in and sign out.

66
00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:09.158
And we have the different pages so
on and so forth,

67
00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.744
where we might want to see
are we on the right path.

68
00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:16.627
There will be cases where if they
go to slash posts and they are not

69
00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:21.795
logged in they will get redirected
back to the sign in page, right?

70
00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:25.993
So functionality like that is not always
a thing that you maybe, you'd be like,

71
00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:28.230
okay, they should see the sign in button.

72
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.007
And that is correlated with
them being on the sign in page.

73
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:36.126
But not really right versus
no there on the URL for

74
00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:39.955
signing in is a much
better test in this case.

75
00:04:39.955 --> 00:04:43.152
So how would we go about doing that?

76
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.011
So let's take a look.

77
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:52.295
So we'll go over seven and
I will do a few of them and

78
00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:56.344
then you can take a look as well.

79
00:04:56.344 --> 00:04:59.839
The other part that we're going to
look at is form validation, right?

80
00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:05.946
Either you're using the native
DOM validation logic.

81
00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:10.233
If you put a require they can't
submit the form without it or

82
00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:15.909
you have some bespoke maybe your server
side rendering apparatus is doing it.

83
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.447
Something along those lines to make sure
there's different customizations in there.

84
00:05:19.447 --> 00:05:22.205
I'm going to just for
the sake of this workshop,

85
00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:26.665
I'm gonna assume that we're gonna use
regular built in DOM form validation.

86
00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:33.421
But the same principles apply if
you were doing it by hand as well.

87
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:39.142
So what we want to see is that
when we go to echo chamber

88
00:05:39.142 --> 00:05:44.619
that it shouldn't just
be like cybers workshop.

89
00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.985
It should be like echo chamber and
then like that's part of this like,

90
00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:48.851
cybers workout.

91
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:52.697
This is a social media app where you
can only talk to yourself, just FYI.

92
00:05:52.697 --> 00:05:55.840
It's a database,
you just yell into the void.

93
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.858
You can make multiple accounts and
get into fights with yourself.

94
00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.032
But there's nobody else listening.

95
00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:06.965
And so as opposed to just either,
admit some stuff to yourself that

96
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:11.736
maybe something you got to think about or
just really just rant.

97
00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:15.394
You can have it, you can use this
application as much as you want.

98
00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:17.138
You have my blessing.

99
00:06:17.138 --> 00:06:22.253
So let's go make sure that
the title is what we think it is.

100
00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:26.957
This is simply as simple as doing
site title which is going to in that

101
00:06:26.957 --> 00:06:29.653
chain give us back the title, right?

102
00:06:29.653 --> 00:06:34.368
So in this point we're
gonna say that it should,

103
00:06:34.368 --> 00:06:39.083
I just care that it should
contain echo chamber.

104
00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:42.608
Now there might be a world
where it's like hey,

105
00:06:42.608 --> 00:06:47.290
they're on it's like account
colon in the username, right?

106
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.182
You could use a regex in here and you
would use match instead of contain, right?

107
00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:53.099
And you would pass it a regex,

108
00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:58.029
I think depends on what you want to do
as you let autocomplete be your friend.

109
00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.977
So you just type this, just start
typing whatever you think it is.

110
00:07:02.977 --> 00:07:08.450
And you'll probably find what you
were looking for at some point.

111
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.478
So we've got them there as well.

112
00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:11.330
We're gonna go with contains in this case.

113
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.322
So make sure that that passes, so
we'll need to go back to Cypress.

114
00:07:17.322 --> 00:07:18.888
I'll stop it.

115
00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:23.221
Let's go back to echo chamber
in this case, let us start up.

116
00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:27.679
All right, so it should have
the title the application there.

117
00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:29.454
So go visit echo chamber.

118
00:07:29.454 --> 00:07:33.268
Expected echo chamber/Cypress, front and

119
00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:37.493
masters to include echo chamber and
that it does.

120
00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:42.266
Other thing that we're going to deal
with a little bit as well is you

121
00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:46.969
can also see that this made
an API call at some point, right?

122
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:51.120
So you'll be able to see all those without
looking at your network tab as well.

123
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.684
And we'll talk about how to either
intercept those, mock them out or

124
00:07:54.684 --> 00:07:57.765
just watch them and spy on them and
stuff along those lines.

125
00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:00.635
And as we go through as well.

126
00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:04.983
The other thing we wanted to do
was when they click on sign in,

127
00:08:04.983 --> 00:08:07.809
it should take them to the sign in page.

128
00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:09.677
And you can guess who's
gonna do the other one?

129
00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:11.067
I'm not, I won't ruin it.

130
00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:16.580
I won't ruin the surprise for you,
but I'll do the first one real quick.

131
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.484
And so they're going to
navigate to just the core page.

132
00:08:20.484 --> 00:08:23.399
As they do that, let's see what happens.

133
00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.106
Just click on that, okay?

134
00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:31.112
You end up just the raw HTML the raw page
where you're asked to go sign in sign up.

135
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:35.580
So you could write a test that says like
does this have this page on it, right?

136
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.737
That they weren't redirected does it
say the right thing so on so forth.

137
00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:41.178
We're not going to do that right now.

138
00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:46.968
We're just going to say, let's go take
a look at what this button is called.

139
00:08:46.968 --> 00:08:50.461
That's cool,
it's called data test sign in.

140
00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:52.246
That's a good name.

141
00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:53.838
So we'll go in there.

142
00:08:53.838 --> 00:08:56.931
And we'll say, go ahead and
click on that link.

143
00:08:56.931 --> 00:09:02.587
And then we say hey, Cypress,
we're gonna say go get the location.

144
00:09:02.587 --> 00:09:08.584
And nice that autocomplete
is your friend here,

145
00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:15.028
will say that the path name
now you got some choices.

146
00:09:15.028 --> 00:09:21.074
You can go with exactly to equal that,
right?

147
00:09:21.074 --> 00:09:22.898
How's that?

148
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:35.335
Should equal no What I
would probably do for

149
00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:37.729
this one is like it should just end with,
it should contain.

150
00:09:37.729 --> 00:09:38.811
Or I think there's an ends with.

151
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:42.283
Let's try that one a second
echo chamber/ sign in.

152
00:09:46.457 --> 00:09:52.009
So that was the test that we had in this
case, what it says to only just verify.

153
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:53.739
So you can see I'm on that page.

154
00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:55.516
That's what the URL is.

155
00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:57.484
I believe I can do.

156
00:09:57.484 --> 00:10:05.447
So thought there was an worth, maybe not.

157
00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:10.066
But you could theoretically also
make sure that just has yeah.

158
00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:17.714
If you don't necessarily, cuz equal not
work like the query parameter, right?

159
00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:19.692
So if you have a query parameter
something along those lines,

160
00:10:19.692 --> 00:10:20.688
not gonna equal that anymore.

161
00:10:20.688 --> 00:10:22.294
At which point you just
