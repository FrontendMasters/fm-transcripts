00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.990
There is a file called 03-Aliases.Spec.

2
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.282
Your job is to kinda take some of
the stuff that we're doing manually by

3
00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:16.760
hand every time and just kinda get
comfortable using some aliases.

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.447
So in this case,
you will make an alias for

5
00:00:18.447 --> 00:00:21.290
the filter input,
you'll type a search term in that filter.

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.917
You'll verify that only the items that
match that filter are shown on to

7
00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:25.891
the page, right?

8
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.827
Or if you wanna try something else
like moving one from one to the other,

9
00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:33.172
you can make an alias for
the patch, unpack list, click it,

10
00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:35.680
whatever seems the most
interesting to you.

11
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.460
If you don't have something
you can think of, do this.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.978
If there's something you
wanna just do on the page,

13
00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:45.400
these are not the only places aliases will
work, you can do whichever one you want.

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.760
These are probably the ones
that review though
