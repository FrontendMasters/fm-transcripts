00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.492
So, now it is time for

2
00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:07.962
you to try a few things out.

3
00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:12.037
Actually I have one other thing to
kinda show you, and then I'm gonna pass

4
00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:16.723
the baton over to you, which is, this is
taking a static page and viewing it, yeah?

5
00:00:16.723 --> 00:00:20.033
&gt;&gt; Quick question on the,
talking about get.

6
00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.967
So am I understanding correctly
that the line on Line 9 where we

7
00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:29.449
see cy.get(),
that will pull every form on the page.

8
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.782
And it will look if every form contains,
so if it's one or more, is that right?

9
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.353
&gt;&gt; It depends, right?

10
00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:39.559
That's a really great question.

11
00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.790
The question was, basically if we're
thinking outside of jQuery, where

12
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.641
everything is a document query selector or
is a document query selector all, right?

13
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:53.243
This is one of the places where despite
the fact that that Cypress is using

14
00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:57.402
jQuery under the hood,
it does behave a little bit differently.

15
00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:03.520
So jQuery, for instance, will get you
a collection with almost any selector.

16
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.513
And if we go back and
look at the test in this case,

17
00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:11.122
let's see if it's, I don't think I
saved the file, so we should be good.

18
00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:14.306
Well, that's from the form.

19
00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:16.782
Let's actually save the file.

20
00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:19.444
I'm just gonna delete
this piece real quick.

21
00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:22.288
It will find the first one in this case.

22
00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:27.400
Now, theoretically there's
abilities to iterate over things so

23
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.324
on and so forth, right?

24
00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:31.478
But if you just make an assertion,

25
00:01:31.478 --> 00:01:35.432
it's going to assume that you
want the first one that it found.

26
00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:39.933
Which again is why we,
probably, generally speaking,

27
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:46.421
wanna have better data attributes and
selectors versus go find me an H1, right?

28
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:52.558
Or hoping that the structure of the DOM
doesn't change, so on and so forth.

29
00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:56.640
But in this case, if we say should
have a form, we go view that it

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.362
is definitely this one that it thinks
that we're talking about as well.

31
00:02:01.362 --> 00:02:05.829
So one other thing that I might want
to do in this case is, this is great,

32
00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.594
I've validated and things are on the page.

33
00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:14.041
But again your users a lot of
times are gonna do stuff, right?

34
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:18.763
And your tests should be well aware
that they might want to do stuff.

35
00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:25.997
So the other kind of piece there is for,
let's say, this input field.

36
00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:28.705
We can grab it and
I can hit copy real quick.

37
00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:41.273
Input field,
that seems like good name for a test.

38
00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.298
And here we do cy.get(),
paste that in, and then we can type,

39
00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:55.543
yeah, one of the things I
should pack is a good attitude.

40
00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:58.646
As well, you can see as it runs to
the test it will type that into

41
00:02:58.646 --> 00:02:59.560
the input field.

42
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.425
I'll leave it as a,
to your imagination, what click does.

43
00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:10.196
For all the other fun input fields,
we will deal with them in a little bit.

44
00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:12.273
The ones that you can
click on like a checkbox,

45
00:03:12.273 --> 00:03:13.987
you can actually check it or click it.

46
00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:15.419
It will simulate a click event.

47
00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.885
For some of the other fun
ones like a range slider,

48
00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:21.185
that's why there's a thing there
called input obstacle course.

49
00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:24.856
As well,
kind of play around with some of those,

50
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:28.364
but we can go ahead and
we can type into a field.

51
00:03:28.364 --> 00:03:34.570
We can click on a given button, we can
start to manipulate the page itself.
