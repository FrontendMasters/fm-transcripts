00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:03.035
Now your mission is that
is the signup process.

2
00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:07.299
Luckily for you, the sign in process is
effectively half of this test, right?

3
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.827
Instead of resetting the database, we
want to seed it with known users, right,

4
00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:14.438
and they don't need to sign up for
an account.

5
00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:16.517
Now extra things that we could do,

6
00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:21.477
like here's where you would also take
this test, which you'd see the database.

7
00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:25.630
And then you could theoretically go try to
sign up with a user that already exists in

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.715
the database, and
you should get the error that you expect.

9
00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.709
There's many additional ways
that you could take this, and

10
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.759
obviously if you're doing full
if you're doing the happy and

11
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.414
unhappy paths you would test for
all of those things.

12
00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.354
But it's mostly I should see this
error it's versions of things

13
00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:42.706
we've already done at this
point multiple times.

14
00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.524
But the kind of new piece is just,
yeah, setting up for

15
00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:49.325
our test where you seed the database
using a seed task and then you only have

16
00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.970
the part when you sign up, and
they should already exist in this case.
