00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.445
You get one that you don't have to do is
kind of there as an extension that if

2
00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:07.816
we have time, we'll talk about or
at least allude to but

3
00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:09.914
if we go in to the obstacle course.

4
00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:17.631
You can see that there
are a whole bunch of input fails,

5
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:21.681
you got your good old fashioned
text input, you've got a select,

6
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:26.044
you've got a bunch of checks boxes
that then should render like a list.

7
00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:28.885
You might wanna play around
with it first and see,

8
00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:33.012
exactly what should come out the other
end, you've got a radio button,

9
00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:36.209
you've got a color input,
good luck typing into that.

10
00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:38.848
You've got a date input and

11
00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:44.015
careful viewers will notice
that the localization,

12
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:48.735
I'm currently in Minnesota USA,
is American.

13
00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:54.010
But the actual value that it stores Is so
we've got that rating filter and

14
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.398
you do not this'll
technically set a string.

15
00:00:57.398 --> 00:01:01.793
So you could theoretically set it by with
the value with invoke there's a plugin

16
00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:04.951
later that we can talk about for
actually loading files.

17
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.051
So this is technically becomes a string,
so

18
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.108
there's kind of the answer there as well.

19
00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:11.259
But basically going through and

20
00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.194
getting the tests to basically show
the value over here that they should,

21
00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:20.829
given for whatever you choose to do for
the input fields themselves.

22
00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.803
The goal here is just kind of learn how do
you control different input fields, and

23
00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:28.425
stuff along those lines but I kind of
gave you most of the answers in the last

24
00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.780
section, so
now it's just about applying it.
