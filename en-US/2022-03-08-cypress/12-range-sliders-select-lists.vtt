WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.667
One of the things that we kind of
just alluded to that we haven't

2
00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.496
really talked about is input fields.

3
00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:13.954
Yeah, the normal one is super easy,
you type into it, right?

4
00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:19.603
What do you do with a range or
like a select, right?

5
00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:25.999
Clearly, you're going to need
to be able to use these.

6
00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.804
And so, there's different kinds
of ways for each of them, and

7
00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:37.072
then there's the kind of there's typing
into input field, super easy, right?

8
00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:40.716
Maybe we need something for checking
a checkbox or radio button, right?

9
00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:46.090
Or something along those lines, probably
a select, like a drop down, right?

10
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.021
And then we have the kind of nuclear
option, right, for changing one.

11
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:57.532
So let's I'm gonna do a few of them and
then I have that input

12
00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:02.838
obstacle course where you can
try a number of other ones.

13
00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:06.005
And then we'll kinda look at them and

14
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:10.817
see how we might work with a few
of these as we go through.

15
00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:17.467
So, if I go into other inputs, specs,
let me just swap that over in Cypress.

16
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.419
And these will pass, right?

17
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:30.393
Here I found some data set that
the reference sources at the bottom of

18
00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:33.981
the page,
if you wanna find the data set itself.

19
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.413
But I found this data set,
and it was apparently,

20
00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:42.095
all of the secret menu items at
a number of fast food chains, right?

21
00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:47.840
So not only will you learn Cypress today,
you will learn that Chick-fil-A

22
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.315
has an ice dream, which is a different
kid's meal prize, apparently,

23
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:58.997
just getting a two cheeseburger meal
is the McDonald's secret menu item.

24
00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:01.630
I grew up in a world where that was
just on the menu, apparently, it's not.

25
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.945
But anyway, at your leisure, during lunch,

26
00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:08.770
after you've eaten or
something along those lines,

27
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.191
you can peruse this list and
possibly, learn something new.

28
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:14.996
The more important part for

29
00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:19.795
our purposes is it's got a few of
those squirrely input fields, right?

30
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:24.939
It's got me filtering just
by a restaurant, right?

31
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:33.381
Or I've got some checkboxes
where I can hide columns or

32
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.630
I can filter by a minimum rating.

33
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.930
I believe that the only thing
reading it's popularity that

34
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.018
only a Butterbeer Frappuccino
reaches the tier of a level

35
00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:52.219
seven is popularity rating,
nothing else reaches that.

36
00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.183
Again, I will leave it to you to probably
spend more time exploring the list itself

37
00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:58.259
than the Cypress implications around it.

38
00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:03.287
But what I am going to seek to
do right now is at least control

39
00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:10.797
these three sets of different inputs, and
you can guess where this goes next, right?

40
00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:15.217
But this should cover most of the things
that you need to know in order to kind of

41
00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:16.238
work with these.

42
00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:20.323
So let's try it out.

43
00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:25.345
So if I go over,
they pass cuz they're not doing anything.

44
00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:28.027
So, yeah, no ops are great.

45
00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:30.314
I do have some aliases, right?

46
00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:35.962
I did grab on to the minimum rating
visibility that was that range filter,

47
00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:42.172
as well as the drop down, which is that
select, which is the restaurant filter.

48
00:03:42.172 --> 00:03:46.884
There's a bunch of textboxes, so like
what else, just grab one at some point.

49
00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:49.479
So we have that in place.

50
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:55.267
So actually, we're gonna do these
a little bit of a reverse order.

51
00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.230
Let's do the select, right?

52
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.707
Cuz that probably gonna be the first,
yeah,

53
00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:05.651
with checkboxes you can
text them to click on them.

54
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.294
But as you saw, we did before with the
labels and that's how it kind of works,

55
00:04:10.294 --> 00:04:12.948
but let's go with
the select of this point.

56
00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:18.336
So I can do side I get, and
we'll say restaurant-filter, right?

57
00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:23.379
Which is that alias that
we made up at the top, and

58
00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:28.053
we will select I'm not ready for
the tweets,

59
00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:33.467
the best fast food chain
in existence don't ask me.

60
00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:38.645
Tanner is making faces like getting
vegan Taco Bell is a matter

61
00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:44.234
of personal pride even when I'm
not eating vegan, it's doable.

62
00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:48.777
So we wanted to go ahead and
we want to select it, right?

63
00:04:48.777 --> 00:04:53.040
And then you might want also
verify that in this case,

64
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.944
if you select it,
that's the value that it has.

65
00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:59.032
Sometimes you want the act
of changing it and

66
00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.803
sometimes you want to assert
that it hasn't given value.

67
00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:05.216
In a later one, we will literally create a
battalion of tests that goes through each

68
00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:07.675
one and then verifies that
the stuff on the page is correct.

69
00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.527
But for now, I want to set it and

70
00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.603
then I wanna verify that
Cypress didn't lie to me.

71
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:18.804
And that it actually if I go get that
value, that it's what I think it is.

72
00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:23.663
So then we'll go and
we'll get the same restaurant filter.

73
00:05:23.663 --> 00:05:27.983
And then I want to say, listen, if I
select Taco Bell, it should have the value

74
00:05:27.983 --> 00:05:34.645
Taco Bell Right?

75
00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:39.056
So that's both how to change a select
field and then how to read it.

76
00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:41.764
It was verify that I didn't lie to you,

77
00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:46.276
you can argue you said Taco Bell was good,
thereby you lied to me,

78
00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:51.389
that's I'm not doing that right now,
I'm only talking about Cypress.

79
00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.570
So we can also do something
with the checkbox, right?

80
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.518
So this is kind of interesting, because
I might want to, again, assert things.

81
00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:05.513
We know that we can click on the checkbox,
but you might also wanna assert.

82
00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:09.365
Like in HTML, a checkbox has an action
accurate attribute called checked or

83
00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:11.304
it's either checked or not checked.

84
00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:15.009
And when we get to the other thing later,
we'll see that radio buttons,

85
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.000
you might wanna know different
things about them as well.

86
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.672
So in this case, I'm just gonna get
a checkbox, I don't really care which one.

87
00:06:23.672 --> 00:06:28.393
And careful viewers will notice I'm
gonna do something tricky with the alias

88
00:06:28.393 --> 00:06:30.800
as well that I didn't show you before.

89
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.404
So go ahead and
get me an input of the type checkbox,

90
00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:39.487
in this given case,
I don't care which one.

91
00:06:39.487 --> 00:06:43.843
Save it cuz I'm gonna need
to look at it later, right,

92
00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:47.263
as a checkbox, and then check it, right?

93
00:06:47.263 --> 00:06:52.515
So the active saving as an alias is
effectively almost like a tap or

94
00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:54.816
a pass through, all right?

95
00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:58.645
And so, I can continue
chaining it along like this.

96
00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:00.656
And then I could say,

97
00:07:07.814 --> 00:07:11.445
The actual checkbox, and

98
00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:15.741
I could say should be checked.

99
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:20.404
If you check the checkbox, if I didn't
make up this check method, right?

100
00:07:20.404 --> 00:07:27.722
Then the act of calling it should in fact,
check the checkbox in this case, right?

101
00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:33.004
Cool, so we've got that in there as well.

102
00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:38.577
One of the things I'm kinda curious
about if I could do is, again, slowly,

103
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.486
It gonna chain it like that, you can
argue, who knows why I would do that?

104
00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:47.499
But, yes, that'll work as well.

105
00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:51.079
So this chaining all the time is kinda
interesting, you can a lot of times keep

106
00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:53.739
the chain going, you can verify,
you can do more stuff.

107
00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.444
You can make another assertion,
you can do some more stuff,

108
00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:57.941
you can make another assertion.

109
00:07:57.941 --> 00:07:59.968
And that's what we're
talking about before,

110
00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:03.110
the thing you were told the unit test
is break them down into small pieces,

111
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.966
one little setup, one little action,
one little verification.

112
00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:08.993
Here we can go through an entire
user flow in a chain and

113
00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:11.631
kind of what work through
everything as well.

114
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:15.340
So sometimes alias is the right choice,
sometimes getting comfortable with

115
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.004
the chain, but sometimes you start
with alias and you refactor it, right?

116
00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:20.555
Like these are all options.

117
00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:22.595
My job is to tell you that they exist, and

118
00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:25.183
kinda point you in the different
set of trade offs.

119
00:08:25.183 --> 00:08:31.400
All right, now the problematic one.

120
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.466
So some of them, yeah, it was great that
a select field had a method called select.

121
00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:38.871
Awesome, neat.

122
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:46.665
It was wonderful that the checkbox
had the method called check.

123
00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:51.304
I don't even know what you
would name one on range, right?

124
00:08:51.304 --> 00:08:53.569
And so, this one's a little bit tricky.

125
00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:58.104
And even if you were writing react or
something along those lines or spelled or

126
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:01.940
what have you, you would probably
listen for a change event, but

127
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.703
you'd have to set the value.

128
00:09:03.703 --> 00:09:07.481
Well, that's kind of the answer, right,
and how you were doing your regular code.

129
00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:10.541
There isn't a useful helper
method out of the box later,

130
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:12.718
we'll talk about you can make your own.

131
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:18.977
But there isn't one in this case, so
effectively when all else fails and

132
00:09:18.977 --> 00:09:24.534
you do not have a check method or
a select method or what have you.

133
00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:29.400
It is basically not dissimilar from
what you would do in your react

134
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.630
spelled Angular code, or whatever,
but we'd like jQuery, right?

135
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.174
Or what would you do with jQuery, right?

136
00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:41.968
Which is effectively set the value and
then trigger the event, right?

137
00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:46.158
And that should update the terms, code,
to kinda make all of those things happen.

138
00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:51.189
So now we just have to talk
about how we will do that,

139
00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:57.040
and so, in this case,
we'll just cy a get writing filter.

140
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.966
And we will say, we know that invoke
calls a method on the other underlying

141
00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:04.436
object but puts it back in the chain.

142
00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:08.961
So we'll say invoke val,
which is the jQuery method for

143
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:15.508
with no argument getting you the value
with a second argument setting the value,

144
00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:20.631
cuz we don't talk about enough,
jQuery has the best API ever.

145
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:27.026
No, I do not want to install
Docker desktop every day.

146
00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:29.745
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And then I can trigger,

147
00:10:29.745 --> 00:10:33.894
it's kind of up to you, depending on the
implication is you have trigger change or

148
00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.232
you could trigger input.

149
00:10:35.232 --> 00:10:42.268
I'm going to trigger input, but
try them both out, they should work.

150
00:10:42.268 --> 00:10:44.525
And so, I wanna trigger it and

151
00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:48.601
then I could go ahead and
say that we did the checkbox.

152
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:53.830
Go ahead, get that rating filter,
and then it should,

153
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.125
Have a value.

154
00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:03.945
Of, in this case seven.

155
00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:07.640
Because input fields even if
there are a number field,

156
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.658
you always get it as a string.

157
00:11:09.658 --> 00:11:16.406
So, yeah, cool, and so all of those work,
you can actually see it for a second.

158
00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:20.427
If I do the only there for this one test,

159
00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:26.989
You can see that it did move it to seven,
only the Butterbeer remains.
