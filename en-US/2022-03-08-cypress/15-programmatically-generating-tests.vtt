1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.118
So one of the other things that's
cool about Cypress is that at

2
00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:12.190
the end of the day, everything that
you're doing is just JavaScript, right.

3
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.060
And so though describing it our methods,
you've got the chains,

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.960
you've got the methods for
assertion, so on and so forth.

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.670
So for instance, if we have.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.772
We wanna generate a lot of tests and

7
00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:29.150
really kind of get our
code coverage very high.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.990
One of things we can do is,

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.538
like use the JavaScript programming
language to generate our tests, right.

10
00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:40.393
So if we wanted to kind of test out
all the different permutations of each

11
00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:42.202
restaurant that you could pick.

12
00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:45.461
We could just iterate
over that array right,

13
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:50.605
we could find all the checkboxes based
on an array go check each one on and

14
00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:55.354
off and make sure it does the thing
that we think it's going to do.

15
00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:58.406
We could have all
the different ratings and

16
00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:03.760
adjust the input field to make sure
the ones we expect on the page are there.

17
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.413
And that seems silly, but actually for
things like server side rendering,

18
00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:14.094
at first, you could actually find
a bug where if someone starts

19
00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.740
moving stuff before JavaScript loads,
right.

20
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.744
Or if they have JavaScript turned off,
right, or something along those lines,

21
00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:22.438
it won't actually behave
the way you think.

22
00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.935
Right, and so you've got to figure out
do you want to show those things after

23
00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:27.040
the JavaScript loads.

24
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.540
Like what is your progressive
enhancement like, strategy around this.

25
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.630
So like, there are different things
that actually like some of these

26
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.717
things are useful because like I see
that as somebody who found a bug in

27
00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:43.490
their fake app preparing for
this workshop, right.

28
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.370
So there are definitely situations
where this kind of behooves us.

29
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.694
So what we wanna do is we
basically we have these values and

30
00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:56.004
I'll do one or two and I'll give you
about five minutes to try one as well.

31
00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:01.488
Is, basically use a programming
construct to see how that kind of

32
00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:07.391
manifests itself in the actual cypress
tool once we go about using it.

33
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:13.302
So we've got properties,
we've got the restaurant filter and

34
00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:19.220
we've got the rating slider we
know how to manipulate selects.

35
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.230
We know how to manipulate range sliders.

36
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.361
We know how to manipulate checkboxes.

37
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.200
So it doesn't really matter which
one I do wish when I leave to y'all.

38
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.917
I think I'm gonna go with the checkboxes
because it's a little bit trickier because

39
00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:36.248
there's just more of them and you've
got to like interpolate the selector.

40
00:02:36.248 --> 00:02:40.090
And I'm just feeling like somewhat
extra generous right now.

41
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.850
So I will go ahead and do that one.

42
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.840
Now, let's go over into the tool.

43
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.279
And we'll go back and
we'll pick a secret menu spec.

44
00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:59.730
Or that fire up instead, so we've got
yeah show name for the actual checkboxes.

45
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.449
We're using IDs in this case.

46
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:07.386
So we can grab any of those, and so
what we could do is since we have all

47
00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:11.818
the different properties here,
we can basically just say.

48
00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:17.324
For cars properties,
right just use a regular and

49
00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:21.527
you want to use a radar for each go for.

50
00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:23.209
It's just JavaScript.

51
00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.026
You do what you want.

52
00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:26.985
So we'll go through each one of those.

53
00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:31.899
And we'll basically say,

54
00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:37.032
it should have a column for.

55
00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:41.578
Property.

56
00:03:41.578 --> 00:03:44.740
All right, I'll just change
that to a template string.

57
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.145
And so now as we go through,

58
00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:54.140
I can say in the DOM.

59
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.404
There's a name column or
where to order column,

60
00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:03.530
each different property
dash column has an ID.

61
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.057
And so I can start by just verifying
that all those exist, and so

62
00:04:08.057 --> 00:04:12.706
I could say.

63
00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:15.352
Property column.

64
00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:20.308
And what you'll notice is that I have
taken some of the tedium of making

65
00:04:20.308 --> 00:04:25.250
all of those by hand, hope we
are getting yelled at is made the test.

66
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.080
We can see where I made the mistake.

67
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.933
I'm pretty sure I didn't put the # for
the ID.

68
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.940
Right, so it's going through.

69
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.196
And like yet we've generated a test for
each one of those columns, right ,that

70
00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:41.930
they exist on the page, and we have
everything that we think we should have.

71
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.686
Right, let's say you have
an API theoretically,

72
00:04:44.686 --> 00:04:47.569
you could take that object and
iterate over the keys or

73
00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.205
object to make sure that all rendered on
the page, especially as you're pulling in.

74
00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:55.417
Data from other places you could take,
for a lot of stuff.

75
00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:58.730
We're doing it to portal,
I've got protobuf definitions, right.

76
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.592
And so I generally know the structure
of the data that I'm getting

77
00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:02.432
back from the API.

78
00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:05.170
So I can go ahead and then verify that.

79
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.906
Like if I'm iterating through all
the pieces, everything's on the page, or

80
00:05:08.906 --> 00:05:10.980
something went wrong or the API change.

81
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.370
Some of these are.

82
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.490
We do seek to a lot of times test.

83
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.540
There's a test wide mock out and
stub out all of my network requests those

84
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.200
are useful for
is my UI doing the thing I wanted to do.

85
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.697
I also have some tests that
are like hitting existing things so

86
00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:28.520
just to make sure that things
change I'm aware of them.

87
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.671
That's an option as well,

88
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:32.131
I think our focus is going to
just be in our zone of control.

89
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.090
Which is our UI and make sure that if
it gets back the network requests,

90
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.610
we're expecting that it does
the thing that we meant to do.

91
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.210
But that's an option as well.

92
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.487
So we can go basically just make
sure that each one of those exists.

93
00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:49.531
Now, if we click the appropriate
input field then we

94
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:54.587
should make sure it's not
on the page right, so it.

95
00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:03.245
Should hide column if unchecked.

96
00:06:08.862 --> 00:06:11.959
And here we'll go ahead and

97
00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.814
we will find that particular input field.

98
00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:19.749
We'll say, what was it again, was it?

99
00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:31.913
Pretty sure it was show and
then the property name, cool, show.

100
00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:37.930
Property, right and

101
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.587
we will check it, sweet.

102
00:06:46.036 --> 00:06:47.828
We can also click it to write,

103
00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:52.580
and then we wanna make sure that the given
column should be hidden in this case.

104
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.544
So we'll grab that.

105
00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:01.527
Should be hidden.

106
00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:03.138
And now we'll go through and

107
00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:06.890
you can see that it's iterating
through all of our tests.

108
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.054
It's clearly not working
on that one percent,

109
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.670
which is probably gonna be
all of them in this case.

110
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.792
So looking for
that property column should be hidden.

111
00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:23.141
So the big question is,
Maybe not on the checkbox,

112
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:24.438
go ahead and click it in this case.

113
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.677
It might be the thing where
I had the wrong element.

114
00:07:29.677 --> 00:07:31.744
But in this case now,
they're all passing when I click on it.

115
00:07:35.342 --> 00:07:36.728
We go through each one.

116
00:07:36.728 --> 00:07:38.226
We should probably name
the property in here.

117
00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:46.680
We should hide the,
Property column if unchecked.

118
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.430
And so yeah,

119
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.954
with honestly two tests we're now
checking every single situation, right.

120
00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:53.920
And if one of them fails for
some reason, right.

121
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.040
Now, these are all roughly the same code
path but you could theoretically have

122
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.110
a bunch of different options and
stuff along those lines.

123
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.223
The major point is that anything
that you can do in JavaScript

124
00:08:04.223 --> 00:08:05.390
you have here as well.
