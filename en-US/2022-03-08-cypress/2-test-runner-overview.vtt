1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.100
Let's actually go back to this view
where you can run all the tests,

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.398
you can run an individual tests
kind of suite in this case so

3
00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:14.100
each one of these files you can run,
as you kinda go through.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.798
So let's go ahead and let's just pick
this very first one right here and

5
00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:21.243
kinda get a sense of the experience.

6
00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:23.338
So it's gonna open up Chrome and

7
00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:28.227
while I am running dark mode on my
computer right now simply for lighting and

8
00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:33.760
stuff along those lines, this is actually
a slightly different version of Chrome.

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.767
If you fire this up, you might even
see two, if you are on Mac OS,

10
00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.450
you might see two Chrome
icons in the dock.

11
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.642
And if you command tab, you will see
two of them on the window, cuz there is

12
00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:48.990
your regular Chrome and then you can
kind of see at that banner at the top.

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.930
Chrome is being controlled
by automated test software.

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.733
This is a Chrome is getting
spun up in testing mode.

15
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.080
What are the core differences here?

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.650
One is, none of your extensions
are there that can kind of add,

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.335
different chaos into your testing.

18
00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:09.541
You're not logged in, it's like a fresh
version of the Chrome browser for

19
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:14.180
the sole purpose of being driven
by cypress or a similar tool.

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.371
We have basically our application
in this iframe to the right

21
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:22.901
as well as our test suite and
kind of the status of all those tests.

22
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:27.520
Now, if one breaks clearly,
there's a little bit more data in here.

23
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.571
But a few things to
kind of point out here.

24
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:35.534
So we can go ahead and kind of see each
step, and you'll notice as well that

25
00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:39.478
I can kind of see each part of
the test as I hover through it.

26
00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:42.170
You can open up your developer tools.

27
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.691
And so
if something was logged to the console,

28
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.950
it's not like some black box that
you can't see into, it is a browser.

29
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.503
This is your application running in
the browser that you are probably

30
00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:56.450
testing it in, as you were working on it.

31
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.903
So you can kind of pull up all of the
browsers, just some extra accoutrements

32
00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:05.420
around it to kind of give you a sense
of what's going on with your test.

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.637
You'll also notice that as
you run the test suite,

34
00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:13.770
it runs through all the tests,
and then it stops.

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.655
It doesn't say everything was good and
closes the browser,

36
00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:22.868
it just stops either at
the last successful test, or

37
00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:27.040
if something failed at that failure,
right?

38
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.990
And this is so that if you're working on a
test you kind of run up to the steps that

39
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.192
you have, right?

40
00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:37.181
Figure some stuff out, if you need
to like open up the console, and

41
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:41.400
like inspect the elements on the page or
something along those lines.

42
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.284
And we'll talk about another way to do
that in a second, that you can do all that

43
00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:49.986
things and kind of like build
up your tests as they go along.

44
00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:54.439
The other interesting part is, for
the most part, we are going to be writing

45
00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.960
tests usually for our own applications
that we're working on, right?

46
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.939
But you'll see that despite the fact that
this is in that create react app lipo that

47
00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.846
I made, this is actually going to a page
on Cypress's website that has a to do list

48
00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:12.401
and it's kicking the tires
on that application, right?

49
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.050
And so, when I say that is
anything that runs in the browser,

50
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.788
you can test, this is a really great
example of it, like this isn't our code.

51
00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:22.484
This isn't the code base,

52
00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:26.334
this is simply their site that we
kind of have in place as well.

53
00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:28.684
So you can kind of go through the test.

54
00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:33.230
The other really interesting one
that we're gonna use a lot today is

55
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.094
the selector playground, which we'll
go ahead and kind of give you what

56
00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:42.850
is likely the best possible selector
to use as you write your tests.

57
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.381
So, this is again that advantage of
basically the test suite stops whenever it

58
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:51.776
was finished, and hands back control
trolled to you because you can go ahead

59
00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:54.330
and kind of poke around a little more.

60
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.780
Question?

61
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.118
&gt;&gt; Can you customise
the Cypress open app or

62
00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:01.330
add features or is it a closed extension?

63
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.218
&gt;&gt; You can, right?

64
00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:07.495
So the question was, can you customize any
things kind of working with Cypress or

65
00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:11.297
is it just a kind of closed
ecosystem you get what you get and

66
00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:13.330
you don't complain about it?

67
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.348
If we go back into those four folders and
we'll kind of just gloss over a little bit

68
00:04:19.348 --> 00:04:25.471
say, we have this plugins directory, and
in here there is on and config, right?

69
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:30.980
So right now it exports a no app function
that is basically gets two things,

70
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.036
on, config.

71
00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:36.209
Config is your actual Cypress
configuration that you or

72
00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:40.035
any plugin that you install
can modify at runtime.

73
00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:45.030
So for instance, you might want to be like
if we know that we are in a development

74
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.891
environment I want to point it
against this set of API's, or

75
00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:50.882
something along those lines.

76
00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:55.376
Any configuration that you might need
to do for different environments,

77
00:04:55.376 --> 00:04:59.289
you want to do it programmatically,
you can do in here and modify

78
00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.305
the configuration using the full power
of the JavaScript programming language.

79
00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:09.108
And as well as on which we will play with
a little bit today allows you to either

80
00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:11.296
a call functions that run in node.

81
00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:13.596
So if you need to seed the database,

82
00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:18.735
you can kind of like create a set of tasks
they're called, to see the database,

83
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:23.646
clear out the database, reset any of
the infrastructure you need to reset,

84
00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:26.823
also that on has a whole bunch of events,
right?

85
00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:32.141
Before you run any of the tests, before
you run a given test suite after, right?

86
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:33.477
So you can go ahead and

87
00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:37.795
basically you have a lot of hooks
into the way that Cypress operates.

88
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:42.379
Other things you can do in this file,
is you can install, like we said before,

89
00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.838
this version has no, none of your
Chrome extension's installed, right?

90
00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:51.032
But you could, if you were testing
a Chrome extension for instance,

91
00:05:51.032 --> 00:05:55.370
you probably want it in loaded into
Chrome to see if it's working the way

92
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.189
you expect it to,
here's where you can kind of

93
00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:03.136
customize that browser itself by loading
extensions so on and so forth, right?

94
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:05.951
We'll talk about some of
the plugins that exist,

95
00:06:05.951 --> 00:06:09.370
we won't get all the way into
like writing a bespoke plugin,

96
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.143
we will talk about some of those
testing like ceremonies, right?

97
00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:16.670
Like seeding a database,
clearing it out, resetting things,

98
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.708
if you need to spin up a user, right?

99
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:23.472
Those things get a little bit tricky,
we'll talk about some of the trade offs,

100
00:06:23.472 --> 00:06:27.940
but this is where we will be
doing that at some point as well.

101
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.313
As well as in support, you have just other
functions that you might want to like

102
00:06:32.313 --> 00:06:35.379
bring in and add to your
ability to test things as well.

103
00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.530
The other things you can do in this window
as well is you can change the viewport.

104
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.960
You can do that programmatically as well,
as you can see like in your Cypress JSON

105
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.193
or actually like for a given set of tests,
you can change it to an iPhone size or

106
00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:51.148
what have you, and
test it in different views to see.

107
00:06:51.148 --> 00:06:55.390
Make sure like things that should be
hidden, if you really love your hamburger

108
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.311
icons, and you want to make sure that
they're there in the mobile view,

109
00:06:59.311 --> 00:07:02.370
you can set the viewport
like that as well.

110
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.371
You can do that for
the entire test suite in cypress.json,

111
00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:07.237
which we'll talk about in a second.

112
00:07:07.237 --> 00:07:11.560
Or like I said before, you can modify that
configuration in a given test as well.

113
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.637
So we have that there,
the other interesting part here is,

114
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:20.246
you can kind of see a version
of the kind of location bar.

115
00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:25.439
The one caveat is that, to get a browser
that is hooked into some code,

116
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:31.090
driving it to work, there is a certain
amount of magic that needs to happen.

117
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.910
For most cases you can visit
any site that you want.

118
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.734
It is visiting HTTPS example .cypress.io,
you can see that Chrome's

119
00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:46.032
actual location bar is not particularly
pleased about this, but it does work in

120
00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:51.359
Cypress actually controlling and driving
this page that's not on its origin.

121
00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:57.500
The caveat is, it does all of this
magic at the first domain that you hit.

122
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.859
So if you want to jump into driving
your Gmail and then jump over,

123
00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:08.010
in a given test,
you can't necessarily do that, right?

124
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.282
But now we're kinda trying to use it for
automating the browser,

125
00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.603
we're using a testing
tool that could do it for

126
00:08:13.603 --> 00:08:16.540
reason it wasn't necessarily
intended to do it, right?

127
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.105
And so you're kind of,
that's not particularly surprising.

128
00:08:20.105 --> 00:08:25.320
The other interesting part is we saw
those selectors before that cy.get.

129
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.136
If we use a selector playground,
it will, again it tries to get the best

130
00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:36.270
possible selector, and it will tell you
how many elements in the page match it.

131
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.322
And, it'll allow you to copy that
selector right to the clipboard.

132
00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:43.614
So this is an easy way as you're again,
as the pauses and

133
00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:48.310
you're trying to figure out like how to
go and drive through your application,

134
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.934
that copy to clipboard is a really helpful
way to help you use your test runner,

135
00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:55.062
to help design your tests, right?

136
00:08:55.062 --> 00:08:57.688
So that's again,
incredibly helpful as well.

137
00:08:57.688 --> 00:09:02.582
And as you can see, you are more than
welcome to pull up just the regular Chrome

138
00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:05.460
tools and
do whatever you need to do, right?

139
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.176
You might want to look at the network
tab in the same way you would debug your

140
00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:14.076
real application,
you can debug your tests in the same way.

141
00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:19.424
Cool, so we've got that in place,
you can go back to your tests, right?

142
00:09:19.424 --> 00:09:22.467
It's running in Chrome,
if I need to stop it,

143
00:09:22.467 --> 00:09:25.910
I can stop that kind of
automated version of Chrome.

144
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:31.367
I can run all the tests, I can run a given
test, I can open that test in the IDE.

145
00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:36.500
We'll get into runs at the end of
the workshop, settings is effectively,

146
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.388
all the things that can change
the settings in your Cypress situation,

147
00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:45.080
this is a way to see how
they all come together.

148
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.099
One of the other files outside of
the Cypress folder that was created for

149
00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:53.525
us is a cypress.json,
in this case it is an empty

150
00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:58.060
object cuz it has not been configured
in any way, shape or form.

151
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.767
This is a place where you can
kind of put some of those things.

152
00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:11.529
The most common one that you might add
in is what your base URL is, right?

153
00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:17.000
So you do not have to type in
a full domain name all the time.

154
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.987
So you can for instance, And type in
like local host 3000 and so on and so

155
00:10:21.987 --> 00:10:22.968
forth, right?

156
00:10:22.968 --> 00:10:24.652
Anything along those lines.

157
00:10:24.652 --> 00:10:28.292
I will show you that in
the other application as well.

158
00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:30.840
And you can kind of go ahead and
drive stuff around.

159
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.780
Like I said, if you're setting it for
the first time and

160
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.190
you no longer want any of this, you can
say no thanks, delete the example files.

161
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.314
The other interesting part about this is
it will only delete ones that you haven't

162
00:10:42.314 --> 00:10:43.341
modified, right?

163
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:47.654
So if you've played around with some,
you want to keep those, you actually can,

164
00:10:47.654 --> 00:10:51.593
I will leave it as an exercise to the
reader to kind of go through some of these

165
00:10:51.593 --> 00:10:55.866
and just kind of familiarize yourself
with some of the common patterns, right?

166
00:10:55.866 --> 00:10:58.373
So, there's an example
around local storage.

167
00:10:58.373 --> 00:11:00.102
We will cover an example around,

168
00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:03.806
look making sure that the path in
the location bar is what it should be for

169
00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:07.451
where you are, especially if we're
doing like client side routing or

170
00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:11.014
something along those lines,
network requests so on and so forth.

171
00:11:11.014 --> 00:11:14.768
So, we'll occasionally pop in there and
just look at a few examples as they

172
00:11:14.768 --> 00:11:19.130
come up, there's questions around them,
so I'm gonna leave these files here.

173
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.691
But you can see definitely that probably
testing examples that cyprus.io is not

174
00:11:23.691 --> 00:11:27.322
probably what you installed
Cypress to do in your application.

175
00:11:27.322 --> 00:11:30.666
So we'll leave them here for
our purposes, but

176
00:11:30.666 --> 00:11:36.107
you would probably delete them at this
point, you'll also see the version.

177
00:11:36.107 --> 00:11:41.630
Version 9.1 is the current version
at the recording of this workshop.

178
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.454
It will tell you if there's
a new version out and

179
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.148
you should consider upgrading, question?

180
00:11:47.148 --> 00:11:50.589
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to run
tests on real mobile devices,

181
00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:53.399
something like browser stack or plugin?

182
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.956
&gt;&gt; I think via some of the plugins, but

183
00:11:55.956 --> 00:12:01.253
like the driver itself is taking
a version of Chrome in this case, right?

184
00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:05.940
But yeah, I think when we look at
some of the plugins you can like

185
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.980
hook it up to those as well.
