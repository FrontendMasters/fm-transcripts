1
00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:04.624
So for these they're very similar
to what we just did together.

2
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:09.234
Some of the more interesting pieces
if you go through the DOM is that,

3
00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:12.973
instead of getting an issue
where the value is missing,

4
00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:16.260
when you type in a not real email address.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.870
You don't get that,
you get a type mismatch, right?

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.334
So you can kind of just validate like,

7
00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:27.340
what kind of error that way if you don't,
because even theoretically, this

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.440
one relies even on the browser including
the same validation method, right?

9
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.659
Message across all the different browsers,
across time, right,

10
00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:42.150
the checking the validity object, which is
standardized is probably a better choice.

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.300
But again, it all kind of depends as well.

12
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.911
And the password is, again pretty
similar where we'll type in an email,

13
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:52.240
and then we'll submit the form.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.056
The one thing that I want to point out is,
there's the occasion

15
00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:04.250
we might need to type things that
aren't actual letters, right?

16
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.760
And so Cypress has a syntax for that.

17
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.304
So in this case,
this is totally valid email address,

18
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.540
valid@gmail.com, and
then hit the enter key,

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.950
which the normal behavior of a form
at that point is to submit the form.

20
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.013
And so that will cause a submit
event as opposed to calling submit

21
00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:28.980
on the form object itself, or
clicking the sign up button.

22
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.630
We can actually just hit enter.

23
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.660
So you might be wondering,
what are the other options?

24
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.700
And that's a great question.

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.750
I'm so glad that you asked it
simultaneously with your faces obviously.

26
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.118
It is in the kind of cyber stocks
backspace, delete all the other buttons

27
00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:51.530
on your keyboard that don't have letters
or numbers or symbols attached to them.

28
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.414
So even like the move to end which
is like command arrow on Mac iOS.

29
00:01:56.414 --> 00:01:59.233
Something else and
other operating systems to be clear,

30
00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:02.694
the only reason I use a Mac is because
I don't know how to make an M dash or

31
00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:06.593
I have the muscle memory around like
the Emacs key bindings that's really it.

32
00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.287
Select all so on and so forth, and

33
00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:14.580
then also the ability to have
any modifier characters as well.

34
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.110
So anything you need to do there,
you can also trigger those as well.

35
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.540
Enter is the one you'll
probably mostly use but again,

36
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.293
I'm mostly just putting this in
your brain, so that when you.

37
00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:32.187
No we hit command K to open up
a palette to switch between things,

38
00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:36.009
right you can begin to like
figure all of that out.

39
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.630
All right, so this was the app that we
had had the signup and sign in form.

40
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.640
And that's great.

41
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.600
At one point I was signed in and
we saw that there were some posts, right?

42
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.660
And if you don't, if you're not signed in,
then you would have to you get redirected.

43
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.040
So you have to both, before you can sign
in you got to make an account, right?

44
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.561
But once you make an account,
you can't make a duplicate account again,

45
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:04.288
because that account exists, right?

46
00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:08.847
So what do you use keep making
junk accounts every single time.

47
00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:13.316
The other option that I've seen a lot of
companies do, it's just like there is

48
00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:18.450
a user pool and you kind of check in and
check out users, right, for each test.

49
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.860
And that means you can almost
never paralyze your tests, right?

50
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.933
Because we've evolved that user
being in the right condition.

51
00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:31.171
And if a test ever fails and doesn't
clean up, then you end up in a situation

52
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:35.764
where you have to manually go in there or
else all the bills break.

53
00:03:35.764 --> 00:03:38.192
The other thing that you notice is
we've used a lot of before each and

54
00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:40.290
you'll see that we've never
really used anything else.

55
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.300
Because like, even the cleanup
stage should happen before, right.

56
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.243
Because if a test fails or stops for

57
00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:51.100
some reason that after will never the
runner goes down or something like that.

58
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.575
Cleaning up before makes a lot of sense
because you're kind of coming into

59
00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:56.730
the test with a clean slate.

60
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.380
But I digress, what we really need is
a way to create users and sign in.

61
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.043
Now, the naÃ¯ve, not correct,

62
00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:10.290
bad implementation that
we'll start with is this.

63
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.480
I will get some way to make
a random email address.

64
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.158
Right, this guy's I'm gonna use Date.now
we can just like use a uu ID or

65
00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:24.390
what have you, I will go and literally go
through the process of signing them up.

66
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.960
Then I will go through
the process of signing them in.

67
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.100
And then maybe I can see
the page that I wanted to see.

68
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.246
Now this we're not doing this, right, but

69
00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:36.399
this is like until we
learn a few new tricks.

70
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.350
What we're going to need to do, right?

71
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.158
The few problems is I'm using
hack to generate unique users,

72
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.180
not cleaning up anything
that I'm generating.

73
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.360
Mostly because like you can't
delete users from the browser.

74
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.740
When you're not logged in, and
that's a feature not a bug.

75
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.180
And, I'm manually creating
by dragging the UI.

76
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.760
And even the act of doing that is very,
very tedious.

77
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.192
Now, I could put that before each, but

78
00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:09.028
even those before each is limited
to a subset describe block,

79
00:05:09.028 --> 00:05:14.620
which is limited to a file, which means
you'd have to have one giant test file.

80
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.413
Or do some really wild stuff with your
requires in ways that will probably hurt

81
00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:20.970
your feelings, right.

82
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.835
And so there are better ways
to do all these things so

83
00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:26.580
we're going to kind of
need to tease this apart.

84
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.153
Now what the better way
does matter somewhat

85
00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:36.676
around your constraints, right.

86
00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:41.945
For instance if you are maybe it's a,
an older Ruby on Rails application and

87
00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:46.080
its server generated pages,
you're just using Cypress.

88
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.208
Cypress doesn't necessarily know that
you're using some fancy schmancy react

89
00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:50.270
application.

90
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.290
It could be used for anything, right?

91
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.135
You might need to like seed your database
and reset like a test database or

92
00:05:56.135 --> 00:06:00.490
local database development or
something along those lines, right?

93
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.680
That's one option.

94
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.560
Another option is to just
mock out the world, right?

95
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.840
That works but
is it really an end to end test?

96
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.648
And you might be like, I don't care,
right, like so it comes down to like,

97
00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:16.250
what set of trade offs
are you willing to make?

98
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.561
And what thing are you trying to test,
you might have some way you do set

99
00:06:19.561 --> 00:06:23.605
the database and as a true end-end test,
you might have somewhere to like, listen,

100
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.030
I just need to make sure
this filtering works.

101
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.460
I need to get them onto that page, I
don't care what I have to do to get them.

102
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.590
No, that's not what I'm trying
to test at this point, right.

103
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.637
So depending on what you want to do,

104
00:06:32.637 --> 00:06:38.120
which strategy of the next few strategies
we look at is going to depend, right?

105
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.440
So we will kind of figure that out.

106
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.920
Now let's go back to that kind of like
half tongue in cheek comment that I made.

107
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.438
That is a feature not a bug,

108
00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:51.800
that a unauthenticated user cannot delete
existing users in our application.

109
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.341
It's true and so what would we do,
if we did need to like reset a database or

110
00:06:56.341 --> 00:07:00.077
see the database,
this whole idea of like, hey, Cypress,

111
00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:03.000
it just hits things in the browser.

112
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.170
Could become somewhat limiting.

113
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.860
Now I've been in this
industry long enough.

114
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.614
I know what the natural first move is,
which is,

115
00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:17.030
not I will just run some bash
scripts before we run the tests.

116
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.580
We'll just shell out every time, right?

117
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.106
Yeah, I've been, I've lived that
life that's probably not necessarily

118
00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:30.910
the way forward because we wanna be able
to do it programmatically in our tests.

119
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.960
We want to be able to do
it in a describe block.

120
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.420
We want to be able to do all these things.

121
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.872
But the idea that we might have to do
stuff outside the browser is a reasonable

122
00:07:38.872 --> 00:07:40.690
thing that we might need to do.
