00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.360
So we have it on the page and there's
a bunch of stuff we could do here, right?

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.406
We could verify that there
are things on the page, right?

3
00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:12.587
You might wanna say like,
is our company name on the page somewhere?

4
00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:15.944
That seems like a reasonable
thing to check for.

5
00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:19.097
You can verify the certain
elements on the page again.

6
00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:22.939
The side get is effectively just jQuery.

7
00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.526
And any selector is fair game so
if you wanna make sure I give an ID

8
00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:32.477
a given even class if you needed to,
is on the page, you can do that.

9
00:00:32.477 --> 00:00:38.834
The other really useful one
is side dot contains, right?

10
00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:43.937
And side dot contains will let
you give it a string of text,

11
00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:49.364
and basically say is this text
somewhere on the page, right?

12
00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:53.632
So either one of those will work
in this case and let's do both.

13
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:59.444
So for instance, I might wanna verify
that there is a form on this page, right?

14
00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:03.338
Sure, eventually, I think a lot of
times when I'm writing the test,

15
00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:05.714
I will a lot of times
write tests like this.

16
00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:09.311
And then I will delete them later cuz
like I'm kind of building up that

17
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:10.252
understanding.

18
00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:14.853
A lot of times you do not especially
because integration tests are slower than

19
00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:15.647
unit tests.

20
00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:20.167
Like there's definitely like a new test
you like test every little thing in

21
00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:23.408
a really granular it's like one assertion,
right?

22
00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:29.287
There's a cost to spinning up visiting
the page, so on and so forth, right?

23
00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:33.604
Which is I might start with a test
verifies that there's a form there.

24
00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:37.399
But then once I have the test that
fills in the form and submits it,

25
00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.310
that test is gonna fail if
it can't find the form.

26
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.825
So I don't need that first test anymore,
right?

27
00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:47.585
You think more in terms of like things
that a user would do rather than

28
00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.347
every other small unit.

29
00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:52.883
But, I would be lying to you if I
didn't say that when I'm writing

30
00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:55.711
the test a lot of times,
I will start very small, and

31
00:01:55.711 --> 00:02:00.171
then I will delete some of those tests as
I have the more complicated things built.

32
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.964
And especially because we're learning,

33
00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:09.240
it makes sense to do that so
it should, have a form, right?

34
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.453
This will allow us to kind of see
that first selector side I get.

35
00:02:14.453 --> 00:02:17.343
Let's just say it doesn't have
a form element at all audit, right?

36
00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:21.611
We could make sure it has the right one
with the test ID that we're looking for,

37
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:22.653
so on and so forth.

38
00:02:22.653 --> 00:02:28.631
And I could say should exist, right?

39
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:33.080
So get this and
assert that it exists on the page.

40
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.646
All right, so the next caveat.

41
00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:41.535
When I hit save on this test file, Cypress
will automatically rerun the tests for me.

42
00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:46.762
However, when I go change my code,
Cypress doesn't know about that, right?

43
00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:52.153
Because it's just visiting a URL,
it doesn't know that that button lives

44
00:02:52.153 --> 00:02:58.073
in whatever component in your components
directory, so on and so forth, right?

45
00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:01.920
So when I'm working on my tests,
it will automatically run them again.

46
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.833
There's a refresh button.

47
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.119
It's not a big deal when you're
working on the other stuff.

48
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.116
Let's be honest,
you are already cmd tabbing or

49
00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:13.428
ctrl tabbing into the browser and
hitting cmd+R all the time anyway,

50
00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:17.247
you might also have,
hot module reloading so on and so forth.

51
00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:20.847
So we can run that and go back over.

52
00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:25.479
And you can see that it was on the page
you can see all the different classes I

53
00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.869
got added on to it, you highlight it,

54
00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.861
you will see what form it was
talking about, so on and so forth.

55
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:36.745
Again, here we have this selection
playground where I can hover over anything

56
00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:39.932
and I can get a slightly
kind of more granular view.

57
00:03:39.932 --> 00:03:43.445
You can see I did a very good
job putting data attributes for

58
00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:45.308
all the things that I might, or

59
00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:49.914
you might want to use as we get to the
exercise part of the show in a little bit.

60
00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:53.578
But we can also verify that,
the button says, add item on it or

61
00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:55.422
something along those lines.

62
00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:59.298
Next we will not use side I get,
we would use contains.

63
00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:03.939
So we can flip back over and
we could say like it,

64
00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.781
I don't know, should have the words.

65
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.763
In the beginning they're
gonna be a little contrived,

66
00:04:12.763 --> 00:04:18.169
add item so here we do side I get or
decide I contains Add item,

67
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.681
it doesn't matter if it's a button
like you might use this for

68
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:29.422
the name, your application,
the company, so on and so forth.

69
00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:34.660
In this case, it will go ahead and say do
these words appear anywhere on the page.

70
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.280
In this case, you can see that it does and
I'll even highlight where.
