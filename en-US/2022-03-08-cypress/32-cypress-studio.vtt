00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.621
So we're gonna look at two
more little things one, and

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:11.559
this is kind of just a fun kind of piece,
which is this tool called Cypress studio.

3
00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.684
And it's an experimental feature,

4
00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:24.208
It's any kind of other cogeneration
thing where it's useful to an extent.

5
00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:29.159
I don't know how to rely on it fully, but
I think especially if you have a QA team

6
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.473
you're trying to go for,
we have no test coverage.

7
00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.646
Because whatever something something
WebDriver thing was abandoned for

8
00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:42.579
a really long time and we just need
to get some test coverage real fast.

9
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:49.659
I think cyber studio is really good for
this, so this is my my test file so

10
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.733
and when I'm clear what
this code does nothing does

11
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:59.581
nothing right, so
let's fire this test suite.

12
00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:17.332
And that one second and we will go into

13
00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:22.069
of these cypress studio specs.

14
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:28.956
Again, not that interesting now,
if we go into my configuration real quick,

15
00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:38.135
You can see I have experimental
studio turned on cool,

16
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:41.116
so I'll go back in to here.

17
00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:45.762
And you can see very
subtly when I hover over

18
00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:50.549
the kind of ID statement, this magic wand.

19
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.829
I mean, who doesn't like a magic wand and
their UI, all right and

20
00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.250
so check it out I'm gonna
hit that magic wand, right?

21
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.228
I'm gonna turn this thing up to five and
say I only want things from KFC and

22
00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:11.338
then I'm gonna right click here
I'm gonna add an assertion.

23
00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:16.999
They expect this to have
the text KFC cool and

24
00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:22.970
then I don't really know
what else to do here.

25
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.136
I can click on that and expect the URL to
change I can do some other stuff as well,

26
00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:29.995
but I think that I made my
point I'm going to hit save.

27
00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:33.402
It's going to run my test.

28
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:41.124
I like that it had
the same jQuery problem,

29
00:02:41.124 --> 00:02:44.626
that I had earlier where did the text.

30
00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:48.368
That's clearly like I'm thinking
if I messed up with my test and

31
00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.251
it messed up, it's my markup.

32
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:55.564
But slightly to climatic, but
consider we saw human make the same

33
00:02:55.564 --> 00:03:00.602
mistake earlier,
we'll take it we'll go back to that file.

34
00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:08.178
And you can see that it generated some of
the driving and the assertions, right?

35
00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:10.803
And again did it make a mistake sure,

36
00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:14.455
did you make the same mistake
that I made also sure.

37
00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:19.849
[LAUGH] So yeah, it'll actually
let you kinda click through and

38
00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.107
drive through your application, and

39
00:03:23.107 --> 00:03:27.607
start generating a series of tests for
you, right?

40
00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:33.075
I said even with this example
I as the best selector,

41
00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:37.050
do I maybe need to tweak it a little bi,

42
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.421
did it get me like 80% of the way there?

43
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:46.997
Yeah, it did like this it's
also kind of interesting where

44
00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:54.702
goes through selects KFC I'm not clear
that like it got the range selector right.

45
00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:58.366
So it's not a perfect tool
hence the word experimental but

46
00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:00.697
I think also somewhat interesting.

47
00:04:00.697 --> 00:04:05.850
Especially hey,
click through this app pieces right and

48
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.677
do this set of things I think
it'd be interesting to go

49
00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:14.233
back to one of the earlier ones as well.

50
00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:21.319
For instance, let's fire this one up and

51
00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:26.380
add a new test, we'll type in

52
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.440
stuff add the item go ahead and

53
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.737
move it over expect
that one to be visible.

54
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:42.788
Yeah see some of the classes are going
to need a little bit of work stuff along

55
00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:45.248
those lines, but
you can give it a test name.

56
00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:53.008
And it will go through,
we go back in here that it does okay,

57
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:55.937
I'll go in there, it'll clear it.

58
00:04:55.937 --> 00:04:58.435
We'll type stuff,
we'll click on that button,

59
00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:02.611
some of these things right that's a very
specific ID that you might need to adjust.

60
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:05.264
But it gets you part of the way there,

61
00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:08.870
which I think is really
really interesting as well
