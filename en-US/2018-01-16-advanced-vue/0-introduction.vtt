&gt;&gt; Evan You: I am Evan.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.290
I am the author of VJS, and so

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.720
this workshop today is titled
Advanced Features from the Ground Up.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.012
So, I'm gonna go into
cover a lot of stuff.

5
00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:19.460
And just I wanna make it clear,
that if you've never worked with

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.560
Vue to a certain capacity, you might find
some of the exercises a bit challenging.

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.960
Because the whole thing is
designed assuming you have

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.840
decent experience with view and kind of
know the basic APIs, and ins and outs.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.770
But that said,
if you have experience with say, angular,

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.370
in the past, probably a lot the knowledge
could transfer, the basic stuff.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.760
So, but this workshop is not really
about teaching you how to use Vue.

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.640
It's really about some of
the more fundamental stuff,

13
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.750
the ideas implementations and
how that kind of

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720
understanding Vue better in order
to build things on top of it.

15
00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:05.430
So, our agenda comprises of, first,

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.180
we'll talk about reactivity and how the
reactivity system is implemented in view.

17
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.570
We're actually going to follow through a
few exercises that allows you to implement

18
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.360
a small reactivity system that sort of
resembles what view does under the hood.

19
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.489
And then we're gonna talk about
running plugins, a few plugins.

20
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.270
Because a lot of times we
use third party libraries.

21
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.220
You've probably used to field
them with Vue.use, the API.

22
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.070
So, you might be wondering how
do these plug ins actually work.

23
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.650
How do you write one yourself?

24
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.730
If you run into a lot of common
tasks in your daily development,

25
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.580
you might wanna extract them out.

26
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.480
And we'll use them to share between teams,
between projects,

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.550
so that's a good thing to learn.

28
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.870
And then we'll talk
about render functions.

29
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.570
So, if you internally use
a virtual dome similar to React,

30
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.600
if you don't have React experience before,
you'll not be familiar with

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.130
the concept of JSX or render functions,
so we'll talk a little bit about that.

32
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.082
And kind of walk you through how to use
render functions in the Vue context,

33
00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:15.162
because it's actually a pretty critical
feature if you wanna implement some

34
00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:16.622
of the advanced features.

35
00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:24.130
And then, that'll probably be
enough to occupy our morning.

36
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.980
And after lunch we'll talk about
some more advanced features,

37
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.210
state managements and routing.

38
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.310
If you've used a Vue x,
a view router before,

39
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.020
we're gonna sort of explain the problem,
build very, very simple versions of them.

40
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.580
[LAUGH] Hopefully we have
enough time to go through that.

41
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.470
And then we'll talk a bit about form
validation and internationalization.

42
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.660
Also very simple versions of plugins,

43
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.780
just to get a taste of how it might
look in a real production environment.
