00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Evan You: Obviously,
this counter component is less

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.160
pleasant than something like this, right?

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.851
So you might be wondering why
can't we just do this instead.

4
00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:15.611
&gt;&gt; Evan You: Right,
that looks much nicer and easier.

5
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:23.030
Well, in fact, if we change the way we
think about this object, we can do that.

6
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:29.940
&gt;&gt; Evan You: So the next exercise,
&gt;&gt; Evan You: Is about

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.300
changing this into, so
template is still the same.

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.105
But if we go into 4.3, we'll reduce,
&gt;&gt; Evan You: The previous exercise.

9
00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:46.120
&gt;&gt; Evan You: And instead,
our state is now a Vue instance.

10
00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:52.090
&gt;&gt; Evan You: And still,
all the expectations are the same.
