00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Evan You: So,
our goal in this exercise.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.954
So we still have full bar and not found.

3
00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:10.090
The differences is we want foo
to have a dynamic segment,

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.790
&gt;&gt; Evan You: Right?

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.690
So, if we visit the hash
with like /foo/123,

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.980
our foo component here takes an id prop.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.624
It takes a prop,
it expects an id prop and well,

8
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.500
&gt;&gt; Evan You: It will render that id out,

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.386
which means if we're at /foo/123,

10
00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:44.439
this id will be 123 here, okay?

11
00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:47.560
And we still have the route table.

12
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720
The raw route table that is.

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.404
So this raw route table essentially
should look like this, 'foo/: id': Foo.

14
00:00:58.404 --> 00:01:02.471
So this route table is exposed to users,

15
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:06.190
this is essentially our public API.

16
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.400
And I should probably just
list this as part of the,

17
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.250
you should not be implementing this.

18
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.520
It's required to look like this, okay?

19
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.102
So our goal is we have an app here.
&gt;&gt; Evan You: And

20
00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:31.590
we've already done most of
the basic work for you.

21
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.020
So what you need to do, so the render
function is largely filled out for

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.553
you.
&gt;&gt; Evan You: We get the path and

23
00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:43.650
we have two things we need.

24
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.150
First is to determine
which component to render?

25
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.860
The second is to determine what
props to pass to this component?

26
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.460
And our render functions
are also already written for you.

27
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.749
So it's rendering the component to render
and passing it to corresponding props.

28
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.670
And we have a few links as well.

29
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.660
So your job is to implement this part to
figure out which component to render.

30
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.380
And figure out what props
to pass to that component.

31
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.691
And with this route table configuration.
