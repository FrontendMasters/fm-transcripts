00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt; Evan You: So
let's move onto the next exercise and

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.290
it's going to be very similar, but
with slightly different requirements.

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.269
So 3.2.

4
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.140
Instead of dynamically rendering tags,

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.550
we're now trying to dynamically
render different components.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.390
So the goal is to first implement
two very simple components, Foo and

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.370
Bar, and
all that you should render is just Foo and

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.510
Bar inside a div, and
do that with a render function obviously.

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.550
And next we're again going to
implement an example component.

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.190
And this time this example component
is going to take an ok prompt.

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.800
If ok is true, this example component
will simply render the Foo component.

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.690
And if ok is false,
it'll render the Bar component.

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.110
And then in the root component,

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.750
we want a button that allows us
to toggle between Foo and Bar.

15
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.585
And the boiler plate looks like this.
