00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.329
&gt;&gt; Evan You: This is pretty
straightforward, but

2
00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:08.166
we notice that our configuration
is essentially hard-coded.

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:15.050
Ideally, you have an app and
you have some routing configurations.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.260
You want this routing to
be somehow hoisted out so

5
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.500
that you can have a routing
table you can look at.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.530
You know which path corresponds to what,
which this example does not have.

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.859
So our next exercise is essentially
building it on top of that,

8
00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.017
I need to switch back.

9
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:46.900
&gt;&gt; Evan You: 5.2, now we have a bit
more boilerplate written for you.

10
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.353
We have a foo component,
have a bar component, and

11
00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:54.705
we have a not found component,
okay, and we have a route table.

12
00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:58.950
We want to implement the route table so

13
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.726
that the rendering is the source of truth,

14
00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:12.880
how your path to correspond to components
should be from this route table.

15
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.914
And the behavior should remain
the same from the last half except for

16
00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:21.326
when you are at a hash that is not foo or
not bar it should display not found.

17
00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.100
&gt;&gt; Evan You: And just as a hint it's
probably a good idea to use render

18
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.940
functions for this exercise.
