00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;&gt; Evan: So
let's go back to exercise here.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.800
So for the first thing is
that a very simple scenario.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.500
We have a parent component,
a common parent component, and

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.180
two to three child components.

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.080
Then we run into a scenario
where we want to

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.490
share a piece of state between
these two child components.

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.160
So naturally,
a very straight forward solution is simply

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.570
hoisted this common share
state into your parent and

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.790
pass them down to these child
components as prompts, right?

10
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.130
So if you look at this template, we have
three instances of the counter component,

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.470
and we're passing the same count,

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.906
this same data down to these three
instances via the count prop.

13
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.597
And then when you do incrementing
in the parent scope,

14
00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.846
all of these will be effected.

15
00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.151
So, yeah,
this exercise is essentially done for

16
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:05.860
you because the template
sort of explains everything.

17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.550
So let's just implement
the counter component.

18
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.470
That's all you need to do, yeah.

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.830
So one small thing.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.890
There was something missing in
the util.js that we're gonna need later.

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.370
If we go into util.js again.
&gt;&gt; Evan: So create test case.

22
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.549
We need to add a third argument here.
&gt;&gt; Evan: Extra.

23
00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:40.818
&gt;&gt; Evan: After adding that argument.

24
00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:48.799
&gt;&gt; Evan: Before this load event, just call

25
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.050
the extra with a [INAUDIBLE]
the window objects.

26
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.280
So this is necessary for
the routing tests later.

27
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.194
I forgot to include this in the branch.

28
00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:16.034
&gt;&gt; Evan: And I should probably

29
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.295
&gt;&gt; Evan: Let me just quickly reupload

30
00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:22.462
again.

31
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.277
&gt;&gt; Evan: Fix util.

32
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.130
&gt;&gt; Evan: Let's drop it in Dropbox.

33
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.928
Okay, so Dropbox is updated.

34
00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:52.043
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Evan: Okay,

35
00:02:52.043 --> 00:02:54.630
so let's go back into
the example just now.
