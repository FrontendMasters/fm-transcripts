00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; Evan: The next exercise,
what we're gonna try to do is the template

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.260
is almost the same, except that these
components do not take props anymore.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.950
But we need to maintain the same
behavior from our previous exercise.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.810
When you click the button, and
it caused the increment method of the root

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.170
component, and all these child
components should update together.

6
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.140
So we need to find a way to make

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.400
first make all of these child components
share the same piece of state.

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.300
Second, our root component should be
able to update that piece of state.

9
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.320
And how can we do that?

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.208
So the hint is that we can use
a shared object to serve us as

11
00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.606
our common piece of state.

12
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.561
&gt;&gt; Evan: And many of you probably have
run into this warning before, like,

13
00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:04.900
if you write a component like this,
what warning would you get?

14
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.785
Anyone?

15
00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:11.260
&gt;&gt; Evan: Yeah,
data must be a function, right?

16
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.590
So most of you have probably
run into that before.

17
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.680
The reason that data must be
a function is because most of the time

18
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.520
we want each component instance to have
its own separate unique piece of data,

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.070
instead of all of these components
sharing the same piece of data.

20
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.960
But in this particular case,

21
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.250
what we want to achieve is to make all
of them share the same piece of data.

22
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.520
So how can we achieve that?

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
So let's try to do that.
