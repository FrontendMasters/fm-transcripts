00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.992
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I have a section in
there that mentions code comments.

2
00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:07.458
This is one that people actually thank me
for putting in, cuz a lot of people don't

3
00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:11.424
actually do this very often, or
they don't have this habit very often.

4
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.809
But I think it's a habit
that you should get into.

5
00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.190
If I declare something like
var a = 42 in my program, and

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.620
that's just a number that
comes out of nowhere.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.970
If I come back later, and
I'm like where does that number come from?

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.710
If I don't remember why I
assigned it the value 42,

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.520
then my program is less understandable.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.120
So a way of making a program more
understandable is to write better code,

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.290
but another way of making a program more
understandable is to put code comments in.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.382
And what code comments are, are things
that are ignored by the JavaScript

13
00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:46.428
compiler, the JavaScript engine.

14
00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:49.854
And they're only there for
a developer to read.

15
00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:54.083
It's like a cheat sheet if you took
it into an algebra test, or whatever.

16
00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.213
It's just there for you.

17
00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:57.914
It's not there for the computer.

18
00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:03.354
So if I said something like 42 is the
meaning of life as a code comment, then

19
00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:09.054
later when I come back and I've explained
what the heck I was doing her, right.

20
00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:13.585
Code comments are an incredibly
important thing to put into your code.

21
00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:19.657
They come in two forms, there's the form
here where it's a single line comment,

22
00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:26.120
there's another form where I can literally
put multiple lines into the same comment.

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.960
So if I had two different
statements like b = 12,

24
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.010
and I needed to say something longer
about it, I could do a multi line comment

25
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.090
which starts with /* and
I have to have another */ to end it.

26
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.700
And I can have as many
lines here as I want.

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.780
Line 1, line 2 line 3, and
the syntax highlighting in my editor

28
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.607
suggests to you where those
boundaries between comments are.

29
00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:56.695
So the slash slash is
always a single line.

30
00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:58.960
It takes over everything from then on.

31
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.069
So I can either have it on its own line,
or

32
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.279
I can put it on the end
of an existing line.

33
00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:11.415
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: A multi-line comment can
appear anywhere, so I can literally put

34
00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:16.629
a multi-line comment right inside
of the middle of another statement,

35
00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.320
if I really wanted to,
cuz it can appear anywhere.

36
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.730
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
you might do it like that.

37
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.060
This would be silly, but
you could say something like 42

38
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.073
is,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The meaning

39
00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:40.504
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Of life.

40
00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:45.151
You can do it multi-line like that, okay?

41
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.521
Well, believe
