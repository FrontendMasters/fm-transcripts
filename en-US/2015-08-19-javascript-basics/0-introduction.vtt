00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.530
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It is a fantastic
honor to be back for, as he said,

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.640
the fourth time.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.889
Frontend Masters is,
holds kind of a special place in my heart,

4
00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.520
I've said this before,
I think, on my other videos.

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.030
But almost three years ago,
when I was moving from being

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.380
a developer into being a teacher,
I had gone independent.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.710
But I was moving to become a developer, I
mean to become a teacher from having been

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.790
a consultant and developer, and I was kind
of trying to get into this teaching thing.

9
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.070
Or at least had thought about this
teaching thing, and it was fortuitous that

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.090
at that same point in time Mark reached
out to me sort of unbeknownest.

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.940
I hadn't really known him or
followed a lot of his stuff.

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.980
I had heard a little bit, but not a lot.

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.770
And he reached out and asked if I would
want to come up and teach a workshop, and

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.310
that was sort of sight unseen I hadn't
done formal teaching like that before.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.010
Certainly done a lot of
conference speaking but

16
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.690
teaching is quite a bit different and
so I credit Mark for

17
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.540
giving me my start if you will,
in this whole teaching thing, and now,

18
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.370
three years later that's what I do for
a living full time.

19
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.660
I travel all over the world teaching
about JavaScript and related things.

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.810
And so
I owe a lot of that start to Mark and

21
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.588
I appreciate it and
definitely am honored to be back.

22
00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:19.220
So today, and
I wanna just take a few moment before

23
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.850
I even sort of officially get started
just to kind of level some expectations.

24
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.304
Mark already kind of mentioned this but

25
00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:26.600
I wanna make sure everybody's
on the same page.

26
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.880
This is a change of pace from what I
typically teach but I think it's every bit

27
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.210
as important if not more important
that we teach from this perspective.

28
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.010
And I think there are lots and
lots of great materials,

29
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.220
there are great books, there are great
blogs, there are great websites out there.

30
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.300
I have recommended many of them before.

31
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.010
There is a fantastic website called
JavaScript for cats, jsforcats.com.

32
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.250
If you haven't checked that out,

33
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.938
it's a fantastic website by a really
smart dude named Max Augden.

34
00:01:55.938 --> 00:02:00.490
And then there's great books on the topic.

35
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.980
Like for example I think a really
good book once you've gotten

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.970
at least somewhat of a foundation with
JavaScript and you wanna go further.

37
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.500
I think a great book is
Eloquent JavaScript, and

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.840
that's a really great place to start.

39
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.390
So there's lots of resources,
I'll probably spend lots and

40
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.570
lots of time talking to you about the
different resources that I've found and

41
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.720
that I believe in and endorse.

42
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.290
But one thing that I think has been a
little bit lacking, and that's kind of why

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.980
I was so insistent on wanting to do
this part of this workshop today.

44
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.870
Is a lot of times they start with
an assumption that you already understand

45
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.690
the concept of what a variable is, or

46
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.890
what a function is, or
what a loop actually means.

47
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.950
In fact with my own book series,

48
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.430
which I'll talk about in just a moment,
I kind of made that assumption.

49
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.850
I made the assumption that there was
this cliff that you showed up to

50
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.060
the books already knowing
something about programming.

51
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.080
And I got a lot of feedback from
people saying hey this sounds great.

52
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.320
Books are really cool.

53
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.100
But I wasn't ready for them yet.

54
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.350
I needed something else first.

55
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.030
And so long after I have already started
that book series, I went back and

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.510
said well what could I do
to create that footbridge.

57
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.820
What could I do to help people get up and
going, and

58
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.530
I decided to write the book for
the book series called Up and Going.

59
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.220
So for this first half of our discussion
for this discussion that we're going to go

60
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.650
through in the next couple of hours, the
goal is to go through that book content.

61
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.140
It's a rather short book, about 60 or
70 printed pages worth of book content.

62
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.170
But it starts from assumption of
no programming experience at all,

63
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.830
talking about the basics,
like even what a code editor is.

64
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.269
So if you're watching this, and
you feel like that's too basic for you,

65
00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.945
I promise that as we progress
we get more and more into it.

66
00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:46.306
And we'll pick you up somewhere along
the way so don't feel too bored or

67
00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:47.520
too tune me out.

68
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.200
But we don't wanna lose people.

69
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.900
If you've shown up today or
to this video, if you've show up and

70
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.790
you don't have anything I wanted to make
sure, if there wasn't another resource

71
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.820
that had ever done this I wanted to make
sure to provide that resource for you.

72
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.910
So both in written form certainly go over
the book, because we will go over that and

73
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.700
that is essentially the written form
of this part of today's workshop.

74
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.079
But I also encourage you to check out
all those other resources that i was

75
00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.741
mentioning too, and you kinda put all
of these different pieces together and

76
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:17.618
get a good foundation of programming.

77
00:04:17.618 --> 00:04:21.584
It is much more important to get
a foundation in programming than I think

78
00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:23.313
a lot of people give credit to.

79
00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:28.557
I started programming when I was
a teenager, way back in the early 90s and

80
00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:31.830
I didn't have any kind
of formal education.

81
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.210
And I figured it out the hard way,
and when I came back later and

82
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.930
did formal education,
I had to relearn an awful lot of stuff.

83
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.960
And I'd like to encourage you not
to necessarily take that path

84
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.010
of learning it the wrong way over and
over and over and

85
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.430
eventually finally picking
it up the right way.

86
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.820
It's a good idea to get
those good foundations, so

87
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.660
even though it may not look super
impressive on a resume to say I took

88
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.250
an intro programming course or whatever.

89
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.500
That's really, really important.

90
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.070
I'm willing to bet, even if you have some
programming experience, you know, for

91
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.340
instance, what a loop is.

92
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.930
I think when we start to talk about loops,
you may see that there's some slightly

93
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.740
different concepts related to loops
than maybe you've seen before.

94
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.080
Maybe you've only thought about it
as a syntax, and not as a concept.

95
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.780
So even for the experienced programmer, I
think there's little tidbits here that can

96
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.370
kind of tweak your mindset a little bit,
and that's really the goal,

97
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.230
is to make sure that that foundation
is as firm as possible, so

98
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.000
that all the other stuff
that we do makes sense.

99
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.360
So as we go throughout the rest
of the content material

100
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.365
through both halves of today,
and the other courses tomorrow,

101
00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:34.370
we'll progressively build
upon that understanding.

102
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.210
We'll want to make sure
that that is solid.

103
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.030
So that's kind of an expectation of where
to start is that we'll start with the zero

104
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.970
knowledge.

105
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.770
By the end of this first half of today,
having gone through the up and

106
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.540
going, it's essentially equivalent
to the knowledge of say one, two,

107
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.660
maybe three months of
experience with JavaScript.

108
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.490
Okay, you're not an expert programmer.

109
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.360
You're not expected to
be an expert programmer.

110
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.350
You're not even expected to know how to
write a complete application from scratch.

111
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.710
But you should at least feel comfortable
with that and that will be our goal today.

112
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.670
So, interrupt me and ask lots of questions
because there won't be hardly any lecture.

113
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.900
There will be an awful lot of,

114
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.480
I will read through a portion of the book,
or talk about a portion of the book,

115
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.830
illustrate some of that stuff,
take some of the code samples and

116
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.060
expound upon them in my code editor and
then let you practice those things.

117
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.970
And there will be a lot of back and forth
with that so, If I skip over something, or

118
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.390
if I say something a little bit too quick,
or you'd like to go back, make this a very

119
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.290
interactive thing, because I don't
want it to just be a boring lecture.

120
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.790
Okay, so that's kinda some ground rules
for what to expect with the course,

121
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.530
by the end you should have two,
three months experience equivalent.

122
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.310
And then the second half of what we'll go
through later today will be more applied,

123
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.050
so there won't be as much
theory discussion, but

124
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.380
more application discussion.

125
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.340
And we'll walk through a little
simple site application and

126
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.106
apply some of our knowledge to that.
