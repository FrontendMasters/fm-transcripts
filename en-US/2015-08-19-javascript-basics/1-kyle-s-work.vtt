00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.967
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Without any further ado
I probably should have started off with

2
00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.859
this but, I'm Kyle Simpson,
getify, known as getify online,

3
00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.344
you can follow me on Twitter if you're
into that whole online stalking thing.

4
00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:13.150
Getify.me lists all
the different places online.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.330
Essentially I'm getify everywhere,
from Gmail,

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.110
to everything else that you can imagine.

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.910
If there isn't a getify registered
somewhere then that site just

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.060
doesn't matter.

9
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.893
I'm kidding of course.
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]

10
00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:26.335
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: But all the places that I

11
00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:28.943
can be found, I can be found under Getify.

12
00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:31.850
I will mention a couple of things.

13
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.760
So, I said earlier that I teach for
a living and

14
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.510
that means that I'm available for
teaching.

15
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.780
If you have an event, if you have company,
an organization, a club,

16
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.030
that would like to bring me in to teach
something related to JavaScript, related

17
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.490
to the language itself, I'd love to do
that, so please feel free to reach out.

18
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.910
I'm always looking for
more opportunities to spread that.

19
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.900
I'm sort of a, so my self title,
since I'm self employed,

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.030
my own made up title is
Open Web Evangelist.

21
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.460
That's one of the best parts about being
self employed is that you get to make up

22
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.110
your own title, and it can be as
fluffy as you want it to sound.

23
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.560
So open web evangelist,
I just made up, and

24
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.250
essentially what that is
intended to imply is that my goal

25
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.430
is to evangelize the open web platform
to as many people as possible.

26
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.540
And by evangelizing, that means
both inspiring and teaching, and

27
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.580
those goes hand-in-hand.

28
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.480
I hope through the teaching it inspires
you to learn more and do more with the web

29
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.920
platform, and so those are sort of two
sides of that same coin, if you will.

30
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.230
So open web platform and any of its
associated technologies with a particular

31
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.220
focus on JavaScript is what I spend
most of my time trying to figure out.

32
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.370
And I will fully disclose,
that even with all of my experience,

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.830
I don't know JavaScript.

34
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.380
And that's why I called that book series
that we'll talk about in a moment,

35
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.540
I called it You Don't Know JS,

36
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.790
because I think all of us are in various
states of coming to terms with what we

37
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.320
don't know, trying to figure
out what we need to learn next.

38
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.060
So it's an ongoing process rather
than a fixed point in time.

39
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.610
So, in addition to being in classrooms and
teaching corporate workshops or

40
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.770
speaking at conferences of whatever, I do
a fair amount of open source development.

41
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.160
Most of my open source development these
days is designed to aid in my teaching but

42
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.880
I'll just quickly highlight
a couple of projects.

43
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.660
So you can get a sense of
the code that I try to write, and

44
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.390
I open-source pretty much
all the code that I write.

45
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.022
So LABjs is a script loader,

46
00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:27.224
dynamic script loader for
performance optimization.

47
00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:30.517
Purpose is it's just designed to replace
the script tag with something that

48
00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:34.650
will load it more performantly and give
you more control over the loading profile.

49
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.260
A lot of people think that script
loading is sort of a dead or

50
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.460
dying sort of technology.

51
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.350
I predict that there are changes that
are happening with the way our industry

52
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.310
works right now.

53
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.660
Script loaders are gonna
have a renaissance,

54
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.890
they're gonna make a comeback.

55
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.080
And I'd say within the next 12 to 18
months you're gonna see more attention

56
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.770
given to that topic than has been
given over the last several years.

57
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.860
LABjs has been around for
almost six years now, stable for four.

58
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.950
That's its most important feature is that
it hasn't changed cuz it hasn't needed to.

59
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.110
Although it will, if these changes
coming down the pike necessitate it.

60
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.270
And it's been battle tested on
the big sites like Twitter and

61
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.830
Vimeo and Zappos and so forth.

62
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.670
So you can know and
rely upon that technology.

63
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.760
Grips is a templating engine.

64
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.700
And actually the second half
of the second day, when we get

65
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.930
into shared JavaScript between client and
server, and talk about that, when we get

66
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.855
to that part of the course, we're
gonna talk slightly more about grips.

67
00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:35.540
But, it's a templating designed to
approach this problem differently than

68
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.720
what I've seen almost every
other templating engine do,

69
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.700
cuz most fall into two extreme categories,

70
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.030
either it's all about no logic,
zero logic like mustache,

71
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.380
or it's all about a full programming
language inside of the templating engine.

72
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.950
And both of those have
significant drawbacks to them.

73
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.140
And so,
to try to address some of those drawbacks,

74
00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.070
I tried to ask, I think, a better
set of questions about templating.

75
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.440
I don't propose that grips is the best
solution, that it's the right answer.

76
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.140
But I think it's the right set of
questions to be asking about what we

77
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.740
should expect from templating.

78
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.770
How we should organize our
approach to templating.

79
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.590
And I am approaching that not only from
the text and HTML sort of templating

80
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.850
world, but I'm also approaching CSS
pre-processing from the same perspective.

81
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.580
So there is CSS preprocessing

82
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.400
somewhat like less that's
built into that whole concept.

83
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.020
So if those are pain points
that you've ever dealt with,

84
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.810
you might check out grips.

85
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.690
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you say you're gonna

86
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.980
discuss that tomorrow?
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We'll just briefly

87
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.575
talk about it,

88
00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:36.090
cuz it is one of the technologies that
we'll use in the demo tomorrow here.

89
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.350
[COUGH]
So even if you look at it and

90
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.940
you hate the syntax or

91
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.050
the actual approach that I took, I think
those questions are the right questions.

92
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.150
How can we find the right balance
between those two extremes?

93
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.480
And finally asynquence, this won't be
something we cover in this course, but

94
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.470
I do have other courses that
cover asynchronous programming.

95
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.770
This is a little library that I built to
weave together lots of asynchronous flow.

96
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.210
Concerns, like promises, and generators,

97
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.550
and higher-level patterns like reactive
programming, and things like that,

98
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.780
they're all sort of lightly woven
into this little, a single library,

99
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.840
instead of having to get lots of
different libraries all paired together.

100
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.360
So that's just a quick summary
of some of the stuff I work on.

101
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.650
There's probably about two dozen
projects that I've gotten up on GitHub

102
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.280
in various states.

103
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.270
I do a lot of conference speaking as well,

104
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.850
so I'm not gonna talk at all
about these conferences.

105
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.300
But there's lots of videos, and

106
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.820
other things,
the slides are all up at my speaker deck.

107
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570
There's also on my lanyard account,
there's lots of Links to videos and

108
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.420
audio recordings and things like
that from these conference talks.

109
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.000
So if you'd like to hear more about some
of the stuff that I've talked about at

110
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.460
conferences, there's probably two dozen
different talks that I've given over

111
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.050
the last six or seven years out there.

112
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.320
I've mentioned several times now, so

113
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.450
we'll specifically talk about
the You Don't Know JS book series.

114
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.440
If you go to YouDontKnowJS.com, it
redirects to the repo for the book series,

115
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.470
cuz I'm writing all of these books in the
open for free to freely read and access.

116
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.230
And they are also being
professionally edited and produced and

117
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.420
published through O'Reilly, so
you can purchase the e-book or

118
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.240
print book form of
the books if you prefer.

119
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.680
And I always appreciate that.

120
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.750
But I encourage you to check out
the content first to see if you like it.

121
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.390
It's a series of books,
six books in the series.

122
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.870
Five of them are done, four and
a half of them are on shelves.

123
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.840
So the up and going one,
the one that we're talking about,

124
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.360
will literally be on shelves
in the next few days.

125
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.720
It's already been off to the printers for
a couple weeks.

126
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.750
So five books done, the sixth book,
which is talking about ES6,

127
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.380
the new changes to the language and
beyond.

128
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.686
ES6 and Beyond is about 50 to 60% done.

129
00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.580
Of course, you can see it online,
it's about 50, 60% done.

130
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.960
And I expect it to be on shelves,
my goal is to have that on shelves

131
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.990
around the middle of June, which coincides
with the final ratification vote for

132
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.820
approving ES6 from the Ecma committee.

133
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.650
So hopefully this book will
land at exactly that same

134
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.310
period of time on shelves.

135
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.380
So that's the book series,

136
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.740
the goal of this book series was
to try to attack this mindset.

137
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.370
And if you're just starting to learn,
please don't adopt this habit.

138
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.820
You will see lots of people in this
industry that take the habit that all I

139
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.370
need to do is learn just enough
to get this one feature down so

140
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.400
my boss is happy and
then I don't go any further.

141
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.640
And I know we can chuckle about and
say yes, but there is truth to this,

142
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.770
that in our part of this industry
that in the JavaScript world,

143
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.734
there is a lot of that
mindset that prevails.

144
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.320
In fact our industry rewards
that type of mindset.

145
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.080
Just learn enough about this
framework to get a feature done.

146
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.250
And that's when you get rewarded
by bigger and bigger projects, and

147
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.470
promotions at work, and better and
better job titles, and things like that.

148
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.600
And there isn't a built in reward for
truly learning the thing,

149
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.220
there's a built in reward for
applying the thing.

150
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.660
So my goal with the books,
with the trainings,

151
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.050
with everything I do basically as
a career, is to try to provide or

152
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.950
fill in that other side of the puzzle,
to provide deep learning.

153
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.680
That's what these books are about,
that's what the trainings are about.

154
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.650
So if you were try to compare, for
example, the You Don't Know JS book

155
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.190
series to something more well known
like Douglas Crockford's The Good Parts.

156
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.400
I would say,

157
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.290
essentially, by the way that's a great
book I'm not knocking the book at all.

158
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.710
We owe a lot of our industry to the fact
that that came out at a really critical

159
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.529
time when JavaScript could
have been forgotten.

160
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.010
And Doug Crockford's a big reason why
JavaScript survived and began to thrive.

161
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.930
So all due to credit to it, but
it also taught an entire generation, and

162
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.640
now we've got a second whole generation
of developers, at least, maybe more,

163
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.290
that have come along with
this perspective that

164
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.340
You only need to know a little
bit of language to be productive.

165
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.030
And my approach is the opposite.

166
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.060
You need to know all the language.

167
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.410
So, if you're looking for

168
00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:02.180
comparison instead of The Good Parts,
You Don't Know JS is the opposite,

169
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.090
it doesn't mean it's the bad parts,
it's means it's all the parts.

170
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.225
Looking at all the parts
of Java Script and

171
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:10.161
making proper use of those
through real understanding.

172
00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:10.661
Okay.
