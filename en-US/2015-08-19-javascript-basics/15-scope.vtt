00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.290
&gt;&gt; Kyle SImpson: Can I give
a default value to the parameter?

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.310
In JavaScript ES6,
that's the coming version of JavaScript,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.620
we do have a syntax for
default parameter values.

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.810
That doesn't exist in your current
JavaScript, but the next version has it.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
do you have another course on that?

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.980
&gt;&gt; Kyle SImpson: There is a course on ES6,
so.

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're asking
about a function callback.

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.844
&gt;&gt; Kyle SImpson: That's more
than we'll get into right now.

9
00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:29.230
We'll probably come back
to that after lunch.

10
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.870
But that's more than we'll get into now.

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.428
What I wanna do in our last couple
minutes is talk about the difference

12
00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:39.908
between this variable a which exists
outside of the functions, and

13
00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:44.730
this variable b which exists
only inside of the function.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.656
You'll notice I have another
variable called b here, and

15
00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.398
these bs are entirely different.

16
00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:51.230
Does everybody see that?

17
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.450
There's a variable b,
it's almost like there was a var in here.

18
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.910
There isn't, but
it's almost like there was a var in here,

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.890
that declarative b that exists
only inside of that function.

20
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.788
So if I took this part out,
and I just tried to access b,

21
00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:10.020
what we expect to have happen is an error

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.659
because there is no b available to line 9.

23
00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:20.900
&gt;&gt; Kyle SImpson: The b exists only inside
of the function, not outside of it.

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.910
Identically, too, if I said var c = 42,

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.440
if I put a variable inside of my function,
it's not available outside.

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.932
And if I said var c,
if I take that program and I run it,

27
00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:42.560
we're gonna expect to get a reference
error because c doesn't exist.

28
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.916
And in fact, we get a reference
error that c is not defined, okay?

29
00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:57.238
&gt;&gt; Kyle SImpson: So putting a variable
outside versus inside a function changes

30
00:01:57.238 --> 00:01:59.180
where it is scoped.

31
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.450
Scope is this technical term for, you can
think of it as sort of there's a bubble

32
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.710
around the internal contents of foo,

33
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.440
and then there's another bubble around
the outer contents of our whole program.

34
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.590
Those are two different scopes.

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.840
There's one scope here and one scope here.

36
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.300
Notice that there's no a inside of our
foo, and yet we didn't get a problem.

37
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.280
And the reason for
that is that you can always

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.419
access variables above you or
outside of your scope.

39
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.530
But you can never reference
variables that are further down.

40
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.030
So that's a one-way street.

41
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.930
When I ask for

42
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.650
a here, it first looks to see if it
sees an a inside of foo, but it doesn't.

43
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.320
And so where it goes next is it
goes out one level of scope.

44
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.520
And it finds an a there,
so it's able to use it.

45
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.510
But the reverse was not true.

46
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.306
We could not take a variable
that was inside of it and

47
00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:56.875
access it from the outside.
