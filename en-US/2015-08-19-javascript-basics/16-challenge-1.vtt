&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I mentioned before our
break that there's this practice section

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.744
at the bottom of chapter one.

3
00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:08.937
And essentially it's building on that
metaphor that this whole chapter

4
00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:13.265
goes through, asking you to write
a program to calculate the total price of

5
00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:15.286
your phone purchase or whatever.

6
00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:20.040
I'm not gonna bore you by repeating this
but I will point you specifically to this

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.250
section of description there ,including
also the bonus challenge if you like.

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.900
And what I'm going to do here is

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.210
suggest that you try that before scrolling
down and looking at how I did it.

10
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.470
And that may feel a little
uncomfortable to you,

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.790
especially if you're slightly more on
the beginner side of this, but just try.

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.450
There's more value in
the attempt than there is

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.910
in the successful completion of something.

14
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.640
So just try to take what
I've described here and

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.540
construct a program based upon what you've
learned and there are hints in terms of,

16
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.740
you wanna use a variable here,
you wanna use a function there.

17
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.910
And so what I'm gonna do is essentially
stop talking for a little bit and

18
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.135
I'll probably give about five or
ten minutes here for

19
00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:04.600
you to work on this practice exercise,
available for questions either for

20
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.410
those of you online or for
those of you here in class.

21
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.140
I expect that there will be several
questions, and if I need to come back and

22
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.760
address something to everyone we'll break
back in and address it to everyone.

23
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.250
But we're gonna actively
work on this exercise and

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.780
I'm gonna encourage you to try it.

25
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.730
It's a big enough exercise, not big,

26
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.460
it's like 20 lines of code, but
it's a big enough exercise but

27
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.212
I'm gonna encourage you to write it in
a code editor like I've been doing.

28
00:01:28.212 --> 00:01:31.059
Write something in a code
editor like sublime or

29
00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:35.614
a text file whatever you wanna do, and
then copy and paste that into a console

30
00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:39.330
to run it rather than trying to
write yourself in the console.

31
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.486
Because it's very easy to be on four or
five lines of code in your console,

32
00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:47.307
it's very easy to get mixed up and
accidentally hit enter to early or

33
00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:50.415
something so I encourage you
to try it in a code editor.

34
00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:53.937
And so we'll take some time to
work on the exercise and if there

35
00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:58.568
are questions let me know but definitely
read through this sort of description.

36
00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:02.709
Your goal is essentially to write a
program that simulates parts of purchasing

37
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.710
a phone and
calculating the price and so forth.

38
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.330
So, go for that and
let me know if you have questions.
