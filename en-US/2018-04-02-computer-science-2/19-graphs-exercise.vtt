00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:06.026
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna have you do
exactly what I was talking about which is

2
00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:11.116
to find the most common job in your
job network or your follower network.

3
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:20.495
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna give you
a function called findMostCommonTitle.

4
00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:25.269
Excuse me, [COUGH] give you function
called findMostCommonTitle.

5
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.300
It's gonna take in some ID.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.185
This is gonna be a getUser function
that you give it an ID, and

7
00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:31.782
it's gonna give you back a user.

8
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.938
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then how many degrees
of separation I want you to go away

9
00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:37.582
from the user.

10
00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:44.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So just to show you
where the data is actually coming from,

11
00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.700
it's just a different code
pen that I abstracted out.

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.789
But I can show you what it looks like, and
if you wanna look at it, feel free to.

13
00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:55.147
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's just this huge list.

14
00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:58.076
I think it's a thousand
users that I put in here.

15
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.748
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.147
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So 0,
or no, it's 1 to 1,000.

17
00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:11.955
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
you'll see here that it'll have a name.

18
00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.731
By the way, these are all
totally randomly generated, so

19
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.460
if there's something unsavory in there,
I apologize.

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.836
[LAUGH] Company which you can just ignore.

21
00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:27.220
The title which is what I want you to
find the most common title within these

22
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.715
degrees of separation.

23
00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:30.476
And then it's going to have connections.

24
00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:36.878
And this is going to be one to ten people
that this person is connected to, right?

25
00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:40.518
There might be duplicates in here because
again it was randomly generated and

26
00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:41.308
I did not check.

27
00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:44.115
[LAUGH] But that shouldn't matter, right?

28
00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:46.899
Because we shouldn't be
checking a person once anyway.

29
00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:52.782
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But so
that getUser if you give 987 it's going to

30
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:56.323
return to this particular person, right?

31
00:01:56.323 --> 00:02:01.956
So that's how that is working-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Behind the scenes.

32
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:05.251
So that's what that getUser
function here does.

33
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:07.579
So you give it a number and
it gives you that back.

34
00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:11.973
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah,
degrees of separation, if I give you two

35
00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:16.696
then you should check your connections and
your connection's connections.

36
00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:20.120
Three, you should check all those.

37
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.975
[COUGH] So
you do two degrees of separation.

38
00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:28.530
I also made sure that there was
one answer to these, right?

39
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.219
So in this particular case you don't
have to worry about if there's equal.

40
00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.762
There is one correct answer
to each one of these.

41
00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:40.014
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then down here
at the bottom, for extra credit,

42
00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:44.148
if you do seven degrees of separation,
you will get everyone in this

43
00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:48.812
social network except five people that
are not connected, which is #sad.

44
00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:50.879
But I'm sure they're fine.

45
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:58.271
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
let's give you maybe 30 minutes,

46
00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:05.397
and then we'll regroup and
go through these together.
