00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Moving
on to tree traversals.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.010
This is pretty important, and

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.050
if there's one thing that I would say pay
attention so you can understand what we're

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.250
going to talk about for the rest of
the day, everything builds on this here.

5
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.080
They're all just different
applications of the same algorithms.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.448
Or at least for the next six hours.

7
00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:31.570
[LAUGH] So, cool.

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.980
Let's talk about trees, because
computer scientists really like trees.

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.850
And I do too.

10
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.470
So imagine I give you a problem that
I want you to take this tree and

11
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.580
I want you to make it into a flat array.

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.360
I'm gonna talk about four different
ways that you can choose how to do this.

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.370
So let's just briefly
touch again on trees.

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.056
I talk a lot about it in
part one of this course.

15
00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:02.762
A lot.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's

16
00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:07.280
binary search trees and
then ABL trees and all that stuff.

17
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.630
So, what you have here pictured in
front of you is a binary search tree.

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.071
I got this graphic off Wikipedia,

19
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:17.682
thanks Wikipedia.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The basic gist

20
00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:19.990
is that you have a node, right?

21
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.220
Every one of these circles
is considered a node, right?

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.910
This node has a value, right?

23
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.090
And it has a left child and a right child.

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.240
Now because this is a binary search tree,
That specific thing,

25
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.050
binary search tree, also known as BST.

26
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.740
So if I say BST, we'll try not to but
it just comes out sometimes.

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.720
Binary search trees have special
properties in the sense that everything in

28
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.730
the left sub tree,
if we're talking about eight right here,

29
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.230
everything in this part of the tree.

30
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.160
Also known as a subtree,
because this is still a tree right?

31
00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.190
If I take off everything over here
it's still valid tree, right?

32
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.960
So everything in the left
sub-tree is smaller

33
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.340
than eight everything in the right
sub-tree is larger than eight and

34
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.280
that's always true for
everything in the tree right?

35
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.079
So if we go down to six, everything
in the left sub-tree is smaller,

36
00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.996
everything in the right
sub-tree is bigger.

37
00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:16.365
Right, we follow?

38
00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.389
Cool.

39
00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.580
That's it,
that's all a binary search tree is.

40
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.680
They call it a binary search tree
because- binary, it has two children.

41
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.100
Because there are trees that
have more than two children.

42
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.700
At most two children, I should say.

43
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.880
And then it's a search tree because it's
designed to be very searchable right?

44
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.550
So if I am looking for seven,

45
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.350
I don't have to go through everything
in the array to get to seven.

46
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.550
I can just go through some of
them also known as log end.

47
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.220
Right?
That's where the log end parts

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.050
come into it.

49
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.720
If we are talking about Big O.

50
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.100
Which if you don't know about Big O,
again please go watch the other parts.

51
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.250
Because I talk a lot about that.

52
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.030
Okay.

53
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.730
Questions about BSTs before we move on?
