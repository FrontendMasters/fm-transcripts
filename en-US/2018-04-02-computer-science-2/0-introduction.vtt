00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:05.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I am so
stoked to be back here.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.996
I love teaching in Front End Masters, and

3
00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:11.936
today we're gonna talk about four
semester of Computer Science.

4
00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:13.722
In five hours, in four hours,

5
00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.545
however long it takes before
people just start leaving, right?

6
00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:19.470
[LAUGH] We'll find out.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.190
This is part two, not version two which
I have had some people be confused about

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.700
which is probably terrible
branding on my part.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.457
This is in addition to the other one,

10
00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:34.020
whereas other courses have done revisions,
right?

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.110
This is not revision, this is more
content, like Mark alluded to earlier.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.450
You don't have to take part
one before you take this.

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.050
They're more or less bite sized modules,
hence then how you'd qualify a bite size.

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.870
Let's go self contained modules.

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.350
Part one will help because we'll
be talking about trees and

16
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.180
stuff like that, which part one covers.

17
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.620
But I will at least touch on it enough
that hopefully you can still get by,

18
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.670
even without having taken part one.

19
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.630
In any case, part one is really great.

20
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.400
I put a lot of time into that course,
I think it's worthwhile.

21
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.080
I'll leave you to be the judge of that.

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.360
I have up here the course website.

23
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.987
Which is a long URL, so
I made this bit.ly right here, bit.ly/fem,

24
00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:33.050
Front End Masters, -4cs, all lowercase,
should get to this particular page, so.

25
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.680
These are all my notes,
literally what I have up here,

26
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.950
literally what I'm teaching
you from are these notes.

27
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.380
So if you get behind,
this is a good thing to refer to.

28
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.100
This will be open source,
well it is open source,

29
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.242
it will be forever so
feel free to share this with people.

30
00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:53.060
Front End Masters is really,
really nice about stuff like that,

31
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.110
they're all about getting
knowledge to the people, so yeah.

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.870
This is open source,
you can definitely share it.

33
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.770
In fact, I would encourage you to do so.

34
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.190
Cool, so, let's just start diving into it.

35
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.045
We have ten sections here today, and

36
00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:19.330
I'm pretty excited about this.

37
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.800
So, a little bit of background on me.

38
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.490
I'm a college dropout.

39
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.590
So if you're thinking why am I

40
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.680
taking college level material from
a college dropout, that's a good question.

41
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.220
I'm not actually sure of the answer
to that, but let me try my best.

42
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.930
I went to college for about three years,
mostly doing computer science.

43
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.720
And I absolutely love learning
about data structures, algorithms.

44
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.630
I was doing Java which is
not my favorite thing but

45
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.200
you know what, even Java is fine,
it was a good time.

46
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.550
Some point, I found out,

47
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.460
someone would pay me instead of me paying
these universities so I chose that path.

48
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.990
But nonetheless,
I still got a lot of these

49
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.480
computer science concepts down
while I was learning in school.

50
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.240
Then I transitioned into the development
world, I was a backend developer.

51
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.720
Taught wrote PHP for a while.

52
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.300
And then I kinda transitioned to the front
end space and had some opportunities to

53
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.426
know some really really amazing
engineers that were all self-taught.

54
00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:33.072
That didn't have the same opportunities
that I did to learn these sorts

55
00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:35.170
of computer science concepts.

56
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.526
And that isn't to say at all that they
were bad developers or anything like that.

57
00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:44.514
I mean many of you here are already web
developers, you don't necessary have to

58
00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:48.466
know these things to be able to
write React or things like that.

59
00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:52.647
But knowing these things will make you
a better developer, I can assure you that,

60
00:03:52.647 --> 00:03:55.869
computer science to me is
the science of trade-offs, right?

61
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.171
So it's a science of analyzing
some strategy or algorithm or

62
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.735
something like that to say.

63
00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:03.834
I can either choose to go fast but
take up a bunch of memory,

64
00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:06.442
or I can choose to use no memory but
not go as fast.

65
00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:09.050
And these sorts of trade-off things right?

66
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.440
It's kind of given you language to
describe these problems, right?

67
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.650
And all those sorts of things,
so that's why I really encourage

68
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.380
people to go through and actually go learn
these sort of computer science concepts.

69
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.300
Cuz it will make you a better developer,
it will make your apps better.

70
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.990
And let's be honest,

71
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.475
it will help you get better jobs
because most of these stupid companies

72
00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:33.130
wanna ask algorithm questions that have
nothing to do with what they're doing.

73
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.498
So this is also kind of
a FU to the companies,

74
00:04:36.498 --> 00:04:40.666
it's like I'm gonna teach everyone how
to pass your damn interviews [LAUGH].

75
00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

76
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.502
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's kind of

77
00:04:43.502 --> 00:04:45.430
the kind of the idea here.

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.258
Yeah stupid gate keeping, I can't stand
that people ask some of these questions.

79
00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:57.185
But now you're gonna be able to pass
them so screw them, okay, I'm not upset.

80
00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.298
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

81
00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:01.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This course is entirely

82
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.230
in JavaScript.

83
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.400
That's primarily cuz I know JavaScript,
if we're being totally honest about it.

84
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.310
But that's secondarily because
it's the language of the web.

85
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.128
This is primarily targeted
at web developers.

86
00:05:13.128 --> 00:05:17.034
That isn't to say if you wrote Ruby,
you couldn't take this,

87
00:05:17.034 --> 00:05:19.410
but that's why it's in JavaScript.

88
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.033
If you are not super familiar with
JavaScript already Front End Masters has

89
00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:24.767
amazing, amazing material on it.

90
00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:28.844
Just sit down and
just cuddle up with old Kyle Simpson and

91
00:05:28.844 --> 00:05:33.630
just download everything that
man has to say, it's fantastic.

92
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.360
That's what I do.

93
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.460
He taught me a lot about JavaScript,
a lot about how it teaches.

94
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.205
I'm not gonna say borrows,
it's stolen from him.

95
00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:45.000
So yeah, so
Kyle's books are all really great as well.

96
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.630
I will be using modern
JavaScript like ES6 and beyond.

97
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.666
I will try and explain those things as I'm
going through cuz I don't expect you to

98
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:53.930
necessarily know those things.

99
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.621
But again please check out all of
Kyle's material, it goes into ES6 and

100
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:03.277
beyond stuff really, really well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Last here,

101
00:06:03.277 --> 00:06:06.850
I have a correction to
issue from the last course.

102
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.520
I said that Cormen's Algorithms was free,
that is not true.

103
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.980
I was basically telling you to pirate
things which I'm not telling you to do.

104
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.280
You should buy the book
because someone wrote it and

105
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.590
someone deserves to get paid for it.

106
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.420
Anyway, so Cormen's algorithms,
it's a book from the MIT press.

107
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.985
It's a textbook in every
sense of the word.

108
00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:31.892
It's really long, its really dry,
its kind of boring but

109
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:37.578
if you go through Cormen's Algorithms and
you understand everything in that book.

110
00:06:37.578 --> 00:06:40.550
You'll understand everything that you
need to know for the rest of your career.

111
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.865
So I do suggest it,
I've done it one and a half times.

112
00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:48.079
[LAUGH] It's worth it though.

113
00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.170
So anything else I wanted to go over?

114
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.540
There's other great
algorithm books as well.

115
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.790
I know Cormen himself
wrote a shorter book.

116
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.350
I think it's Algorithms Unleashed or
something like that.

117
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.280
I've not read it, but if it's from Cormen,
it's probably pretty good, too.

118
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.600
So, cool.
