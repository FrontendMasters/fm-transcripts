00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.387
&gt;&gt; Mike North: In this next part of the
course, we're going to focus on solving

2
00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:07.913
the problem of a disorganized
collection of seeds and

3
00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:12.925
get back into the mode of domain modeling
and interviewing a domain expert or

4
00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:17.778
collaborating with a domain expert or
an LLM to figure out, like, what is

5
00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:23.160
the most productive direction we could go
for solving this problem for our user.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.190
Before we get into this, though, let's
talk a little bit about some tips for

7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.850
having conversations with domain experts,
and then we're gonna have a conversation.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.289
First, it's very important to
develop a shared vocabulary with

9
00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:44.490
all of the people you're collaborating
on discussing a problem space with.

10
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.850
What this helps.

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.800
What this makes sure that is
avoided is things that end

12
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.460
up being lost in translation.

13
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.206
And you want to make sure that you
have an opportunity or you give less

14
00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:05.620
technical people an opportunity to
correct misconceptions you have.

15
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.793
So if you're talking to your gardener
about your plans to help organize

16
00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:15.875
their seed catalog and you say, well,
what we can do here is we can take

17
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.959
these objects and we can put them
into an elasticsearch collection and

18
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.380
we'll have different dimensions
that we can use to search.

19
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.820
Put some denormalized data into
elasticsearch, you've already lost them.

20
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.132
It's not that difficult to take the names
of classes and the names of variables and

21
00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:46.340
tie them to this common language that you
share with your subject matter experts.

22
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.309
When you're working with
agentic coding tools,

23
00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:54.118
this also helps make sure that that you're
encoding more of the business problem

24
00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:56.620
right into the source code of your app.

25
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.606
So you can have conversations that
are much more in line with like,

26
00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:07.860
tell me about this seed packet, do we have
an estimated weight for the seed packet?

27
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.068
And it's going to be able to go and find
some terminology that joins the words used

28
00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:18.220
in the problem space with the words that
are used in the solution to the problem.

29
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.828
So, tips for having discussions
that are conducive towards

30
00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:27.380
developing a shared language.

31
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.219
You want to understand terminology that's
being used, ask clarifying questions,

32
00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.887
make sure you really pin these things
down, and take the time as these

33
00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:43.797
words are mentioned for the first time or
the second time, coming up with

34
00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:49.210
a nice glossary of what do we mean when
we say this is very well worth it.

35
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.268
Use visual tools like this little
diagram tool that I've been using,

36
00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:54.930
which is called Whimsical.

37
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.810
You could use a whiteboard, you could
use a notebook, whatever you wanna use.

38
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.330
Slides are great for diagrams.

39
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.345
This helps make visual
concepts more tangible and

40
00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:09.891
try to avoid technical logic and
sorry, technical terminology such

41
00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:15.055
as referring to database indices or
instances of classes like,

42
00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:19.837
you want to see if you can
articulate the shape of how you're

43
00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:25.090
thinking about the problem
in solution agnostic terms.

44
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.210
Tip number two, stay curious and open.

45
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.210
There's a failure mode for
these conversations which well

46
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.290
intentioned people that want
to collaborate can fall into.

47
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.006
If you're talking to a gardener and
you listen to them say a few things and

48
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:47.260
then immediately you propose, you're like,
here's how I think we could solve it.

49
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.020
And then you sort of blurt something out.

50
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.242
What's going to happen is the gardener
is going to listen to this and

51
00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:54.051
they will pattern match against it and

52
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:58.300
they'll assume like you're a software
engineer, you're probably pretty smart.

53
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.100
The words you're saying
mostly make sense to me.

54
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.452
But sometimes you get into this trap where
they'll kind of accept that description of

55
00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:11.508
a solution at a point in the conversation
where you haven't reached alignment,

56
00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:15.744
where you haven't gotten to the point
where you can both say, yes,

57
00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:18.791
the way we're thinking
about this is the same and

58
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.269
we've actually explored all
of the details in this case.

59
00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:28.221
All right, I can give you a list of your
seed packets and you can use command F and

60
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:29.670
you can find basil.

61
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.170
Great.

62
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.910
I guess I can find all of
the basils I can advance.

63
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.179
If I have Thai basil and
sweet Genovese basil and all of this,

64
00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:43.279
I guess I could control F and
all right, that's fine, but

65
00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.544
what if there's incremental
data loading and

66
00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:51.550
everything's not on the same page or
something like that.

67
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.793
You've offered a solution where sometimes
people accept it without knowing

68
00:04:56.793 --> 00:05:02.040
that there will be inherent limitations
to what they're validated to.

69
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.880
So tips for avoiding falling in this trap,
focus on the business problems.

70
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.098
But what we mean here is like
focus on the problem space,

71
00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:15.560
the business here is doing
something useful for a gardener.

72
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.608
Ask open-ended questions, right?

73
00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:25.657
You wanna understand the why
behind the ask, like what?

74
00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:32.130
What is the core pain that is experienced
which the solution is aiming to develop?

75
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.470
It's like aiming to mitigate that pain or
take that pain away entirely.

76
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.292
Document and respect nuances,
right, sometimes edge cases and

77
00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:43.730
corner cases turn out
to be really important.

78
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.631
And while there is a point when you're
implementing a minimum viable solution,

79
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:55.179
you can start to say, all right, we
know we will eventually need to do this,

80
00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:58.940
but for now let's not worry about it.

81
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.860
An example of this would be, well, we've
got this carnation plant in Our database.

82
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.414
And we want to represent that
you can affect the color of

83
00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:13.260
a carnation based on
the factors of the soil.

84
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.505
So if you say, I want a blue carnation or
red carnation,

85
00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:19.830
that's not necessarily about
planting the right seed.

86
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.710
That's about additives in the soil.

87
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.590
And so, all right, but
let's worry about that when we come to it.

88
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.455
Like, for the most part, we at least
need to capture this dimension of, like,

89
00:06:31.455 --> 00:06:33.510
there are different species of plants.

90
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.030
Let's worry about that first.

91
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.950
Soil additives can come later.

92
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.470
It'll layer on, but
it's important to not lose track of it.

93
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.430
Request concrete examples for
complex scenarios.

94
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.182
And what I mean by this is have
your domain expert walk through

95
00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:54.410
what they do in the absence of
your solution, step by step.

96
00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.023
So if, for example, this is an accountant
trying to perform some calculation,

97
00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:04.641
like literally get on a whiteboard or
get in a doc with them and say,

98
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:09.610
take me through, like, step by step,
you start with this number.

99
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.490
Then what happens?

100
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.250
Then what happens?

101
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.441
Okay, you consult this spreadsheet,
who makes that spreadsheet, and

102
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:19.920
just walk through that process that can
become what is called a user journey.

103
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.280
That is the user journey of today.

104
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.046
The process your user goes through to get
from the beginning of having the problem

105
00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:32.480
to scratching their own itch, if there
is a way to scratch that itch today.

106
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.406
And that lets you avoid missing things,

107
00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:40.975
that lets you make sure you at least
understand the world of today and

108
00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:45.306
especially complex scenarios as
you hear about these nuances,

109
00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:51.420
dig into them, understand them, and
then obviously show active interest.

110
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.220
Sometimes you'll be dealing
with a dry subject, dry topic.

111
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.380
Some people get really excited about.

112
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.780
Well, I'll say I get really excited about
financial concepts, which is great.

113
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.396
I work at Stripe, it fits really well,
I'm genuinely excited when I go to work to

114
00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:12.190
sort of wrap my heads around different
business models and things like that.

115
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.390
Other people would consider
that to be incredibly dry.

116
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:20.529
But you do want to make sure that you're
trying to tease out these details

117
00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:25.430
in a way where you're sort of feeding
energy into the conversation.

118
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.211
And remember, presumably you all
are excited about building software, and

119
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:30.910
ultimately that's part of this.

120
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:37.380
And so try to tap into that enthusiasm,
iterate and validate regularly.

121
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.936
A key part of domain driven design that
I think is definitely worth keeping is

122
00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:43.940
the idea of refining knowledge.

123
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.180
I know we all have probably
in our careers dealt with.

124
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.620
Somebody puts a big document together and
they say, this is the plan.

125
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.754
And then as you start working on the plan,
it changes course and

126
00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:00.730
that document is like
no one's updating it.

127
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.290
It's just sort of rot.

128
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.943
It's important to sort of take a look
at the information you have as

129
00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:12.810
you make progress on implementing
things and thinking through things.

130
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.724
And sometimes you have to write some
code in order to figure out like, well,

131
00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:19.330
I have a set of new questions now.

132
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:24.376
Refine that knowledge, go back and
keep a nice concise source

133
00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:29.530
of truth that you're willing to
keep up to date as you iterate.

134
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.867
This could be just like a one page
document with your glossary of terms or

135
00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:37.771
a simple diagram like this where
we changed temperature range,

136
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:41.770
we combine that into a single
monthly temperature range entity.

137
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.922
Instead of having that intermediate
value object here, have something you're

138
00:09:46.922 --> 00:09:51.630
willing to keep up to date, and
that is usually not a 30 page design doc.

139
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:59.550
A big tip here is summarize and
reflect concepts back to experts.

140
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.630
This is easier than ever with LLMs.

141
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:06.910
If you have taken a ton of notes, you can
feed it into something like chatgpt and

142
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.350
say give me the most
important bullet points here.

143
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.590
Focus is important.

144
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.274
At the ends of these conversations
there's an important step to take and

145
00:10:19.274 --> 00:10:24.336
that is like you'll have a bunch of notes
and I want you to sort of like if you have

146
00:10:24.336 --> 00:10:29.477
a half hour discussion with someone, what
you want to do is save the last three or

147
00:10:29.477 --> 00:10:33.777
four minutes to with your
collaborators ask the question, what,

148
00:10:33.777 --> 00:10:38.680
if anything, we've discussed is
worth keeping and carrying forward?

149
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.629
It's likely not all of it.

150
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:44.801
You've gone into some avenues
where it didn't yield anything.

151
00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:49.894
Or you have a very elaborate carnation
related topic here that could

152
00:10:49.894 --> 00:10:54.806
really be boiled down to for
now we're focused on plant species,

153
00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:58.578
although other variations
of plants will exist.

154
00:10:58.578 --> 00:11:00.289
Maybe that's all you need to do.

155
00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:03.908
And that's the important
gem to mind in the org of

156
00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:06.650
the full conversation that you had.
