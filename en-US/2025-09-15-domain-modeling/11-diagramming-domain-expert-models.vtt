WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do we need, like,
a value object that represents or

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.560
that can contain information about
a given stage and a duration of time?

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.600
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Cool.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.520
Okay, tell me more.

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.308
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well, if you know, you could
represent the indoor growing time and

6
00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:19.668
the hardening time with
the same value object,

7
00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:24.880
those two entities can be, or
maybe could be discrete things per plant.

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.892
Unless hardening is, like, all with
seven days for every single plant,

9
00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:32.440
you can use the same sort of
value object to represent.

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.800
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Great.

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.840
Okay.

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.240
And I'm not a gardener anymore, so
using the word value object here is fine.

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.200
But, like, what would we call this thing?

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.160
Like, how do we give this a name
that makes sense to our gardener?

15
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The plant's name?

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.480
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This is the class.

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.520
This is the class.

18
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.030
I think what you're trying to
capture here is there's some.

19
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.310
Something here, right.

20
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.990
Like, I've drawn little boxes here.

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.070
That's a signal, Right.

22
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.108
If your gardener gets up and
they say, like, this is a thing, and

23
00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:07.390
they circle a thing and they say,
here's what I'm describing here.

24
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.590
Like, that's teasing that up.

25
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Planting stage or
something like this.

26
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.870
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, like plant stage.

27
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280
Yeah, we could call it that until
we come up with a better name.

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.960
But those are words like, you know.

29
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Do we need to know more?

30
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880
Are there more stages
than really just the.

31
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.840
Like, would you call it the germination
stage where it's inside?

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.360
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, there could be.

33
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.560
Let's start with this, though.

34
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.480
I mean, realistically, there are.

35
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.400
There's like you plant the seed and
then it's in the hydroponic thing.

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.280
And then you put it in a red party cup.

37
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.960
Cause it's too big for the hydroponics.

38
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.320
Like, it goes deeper.

39
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.280
But I think we have enough here.

40
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.000
We've got a plant stage, and then we've
got a time period on it probably.

41
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.840
Right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

42
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.520
&gt;&gt; Mike North: How should
we represent that?

43
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.000
What is the time period?

44
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Days
are probably the easiest.

45
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.960
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Cool.

46
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.810
And describe to me in words, like,
what's an example of a time period?

47
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is it like a range of days?

48
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.170
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It could
be a range of days.

49
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.090
Like specific dates,
like March 27 through April 9.

50
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
a start date and a length.

51
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.930
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think it's
a start date and a length.

52
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.780
Right, right.
Like, this is a duration.

53
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.180
It's a time duration.

54
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.980
It might already have
duration in there somewhere.

55
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.194
But, like, let's say and

56
00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:01.368
it's a value and

57
00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:06.140
a unit days or whatever.

58
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.870
Okay, great.

59
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.550
And so this is a time duration.

60
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.390
So now we can model a plant stage.

61
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.030
We could say, all right,
here's the germination time.

62
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.310
Here's when you're planting things
now what do we need on this?

63
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.543
Great.
We can model durations,

64
00:03:27.543 --> 00:03:28.950
maybe give it a name.

65
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.760
Okay, so great.

66
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.467
You could say,
here's some kind of tomato, and

67
00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:44.167
there's like a germination duration
that's this many days, and

68
00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:48.923
then a hardening duration that's this many
days, and then replant it in the ground,

69
00:03:48.923 --> 00:03:53.240
presumably, then it's growing and
then it fruits, and then I can harvest.

70
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.256
So it's that many days, and

71
00:03:55.256 --> 00:04:00.470
then it's continuing to fruit until
it gets cold and gets knocked out.

72
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.270
This is great.

73
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.750
Let's pop back up to seed packet, though.

74
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You need a start date
in there somewhere, don't you?

75
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.230
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Mm.

76
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.746
Interesting.
On seed packet.

77
00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:09.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: On the plant stage.

78
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.830
Plant stage has the start date and
the duration from that start date.

79
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.310
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm so
glad you brought this up.

80
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.670
So this is where, like,
we're talking about the seed packet here.

81
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.110
I'm not.

82
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.988
There's also gonna be
a concept of a plant, like,

83
00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:29.150
you put a seed in and
the plants growing, and that has.

84
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.750
There's some state there, right?

85
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.048
Like there are 200 seeds in
the tomato seed packet, and

86
00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:38.550
those can become each an individual plant.

87
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.390
But we're trying to model the packet here.

88
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.950
Does that make.

89
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Does the difference
make sense, Mr. Gardener?

90
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.675
Does every plant have a indoor planting,
a hardening, and

91
00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:50.990
a plant in the ground phase?

92
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well, the start date
would depend on the location.

93
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Start date is very.

94
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.650
All of those things.

95
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.410
Plant stage and time duration are very
much derived state from the seed packet.

96
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.930
They're not their own entities.

97
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.506
You're going to pick the date, the
germination time, all the information in

98
00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:11.370
the seed packet, and create those things
as value objects based upon that data.

99
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.570
We're not going to store that.

100
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.990
If everything has those three stages, and

101
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.110
if we have the data to determine
what stages they have.

102
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.390
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This is great.

103
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.270
This is great.

104
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.310
A very productive conversation here.

105
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.454
Seed packet is almost like
the template for a plant,

106
00:05:33.454 --> 00:05:35.750
if you want to think about it that way.

107
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.150
When we say we have a time duration for
germination, that's like.

108
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.270
That is sprouts in seven to 14 days.

109
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.350
That's what we're trying to capture here.

110
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.454
Now, once it's planted,
there's a time where it's planted, and

111
00:05:51.454 --> 00:05:55.554
there might be a specific,
like a date time, a date and a time where,

112
00:05:55.554 --> 00:06:00.153
like, we've entered the beginning of
that range, we've left that range,

113
00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:04.150
and that's gonna be a different
concept that we're gonna model.

114
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.110
But, like, these seeds sprout in
seven to 14 days the first year,

115
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.690
midway through the Year,
the next year it's still seven to 14 days.

116
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.050
Right.
It's sort of.

117
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.570
Does that difference make sense?

118
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.770
All right,
let's jump back into this though.

119
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.850
What else do we need to know?

120
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.090
So I like this.

121
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.770
We have plant stage and
there's kind of a many relationship there.

122
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.610
Actually it's at least.

123
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.210
Sorry, I keep picking the wrong one.

124
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.220
It's one or many plant stages and
then each of these has a time duration.

125
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.740
What else goes on the seed packet?

126
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.620
Quantity.

127
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.500
Let's start there.

128
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.580
That's a number.

129
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Variety.

130
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.620
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Great.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Plant family.

131
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.300
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I like that word better.

132
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.860
Plant family.

133
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You mean a name then, right?

134
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:10.900
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Name.

135
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.420
Great.

136
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.380
So let's use our tip of going
through a concrete example here.

137
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.740
So That's a name.

138
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.180
200 C's in a packet.

139
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.080
Tomato.

140
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.200
And then some date.

141
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.760
Some date.

142
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.400
That's appropriate.

143
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.361
That's one I would probably choose
not to model because expire

144
00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:48.000
date is what matters to me.

145
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.840
Maybe seeds have different shelf lives.

146
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.680
And really what I care about is there was
this story of, we didn't document it.

147
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.750
I want to plant seeds before they expire.

148
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.720
But like purchase date, I would argue
there we're getting a little bit close to

149
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.320
that trap of just like modeling more
than is necessary on the seed packet in

150
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.190
order to solve this problem.

151
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.864
Now if I were accounting for
my seed purchases and

152
00:08:20.864 --> 00:08:25.350
I wanted to like deduct them from taxes or
something, absolutely that matters.

153
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.430
But that wasn't part of the pain there.

154
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.924
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You bought a whole bunch of
seeds last year at a discount that were

155
00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:33.830
almost expired, so
it doesn't really matter.

156
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.550
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There you go.

157
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.110
Yeah.

158
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.630
Yep.

159
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.270
Yeah.
Or I could have bought them from a friend.

160
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.070
Yeah, like, exactly.

161
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.430
They're about to expire and so
the purchase date is unknown to me.

162
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:49.073
But I do know like,
I do look on this real seed packet and

163
00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:51.910
they have a sell, sell by.

164
00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:57.010
And like here you can
see evidence of that.

165
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.090
Remember I said it's like a year based
expiration kind of thing packed for 2024.

166
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.730
There's a clue right there.

167
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.570
It's packed.

168
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:11.850
These are made for a season and
it's less like, look, 12 31-34.

169
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.210
Like really,
does it expire on New Year's at 11:59?

170
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.690
Like it's really about sort of
the seasonal rollover there.

171
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.401
So this is why looking at concrete
examples often yields some great

172
00:09:24.401 --> 00:09:25.270
insight here.

173
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.619
It would have been totally easy for us to
overdo the expiration date and been like,

174
00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:35.550
let's filter by expiration date and
let's let you put in a day, month, year.

175
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.170
But really,
if we were building this feature,

176
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.390
you just have a dropdown with years,
and it would be fine.

177
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.910
That's probably as complicated
as it needs to get.

178
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:53.180
Okay, let's shift into taking some of
what we've learned and implementing it.
