1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.680
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now let's dig into
another domain modeling exercise.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.320
We have this concept of a garden and
we have this concept of raised beds.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.544
Just remember that photo I showed where
it's like those metal things filled

4
00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:16.000
with dirt plants in them.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.400
I have some statements here.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200
These are user testimonials.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.399
These are things, pieces of pain or

8
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.460
elements of pain that
a user has to deal with.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.060
Or they reflect something they wish to do
that is difficult for them to do today.

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.678
I made these intentionally vague and

11
00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:43.900
I have used maybe some terms
like square foot, garden.

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.205
I'm not sure everybody who's taking
this course understands exactly what

13
00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:47.780
that means.

14
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.500
Perhaps some of you in the room
don't understand what that means.

15
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.875
This is a cue for you to tease out more,
ask questions, see if this needs

16
00:00:55.875 --> 00:01:01.260
to be part of the common language we
use in this gardening domain model.

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.703
So your task, let's do the domain

18
00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:14.060
meddling exercise around this app.

19
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.110
Sorry, I mean, we kind of already know
like a little bit about where we're going.

20
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.630
Oops, sorry,
I keep going back to the other one.

21
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.470
We kinda know that we're going here.

22
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.470
But actually, better still,
let me take you back to this.

23
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.058
I'm trying to get organized
around these things and so

24
00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:38.790
let's see if we can have a conversation.

25
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.350
How do we represent this in software?

26
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.790
What's at the essence of this?

27
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.790
The things that we need to capture.

28
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.846
And let's start with the things
that we feel are necessary for

29
00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:53.350
any valid solution to this problem.

30
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.731
And to be clear, like, we're departing
from seed packets now and we're focusing

31
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:05.670
on the layout of plants in a garden that
is mostly focused around raised beds.

32
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.153
So I'm gonna start us off.

33
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.710
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Clearly
we're gonna have a garden.

34
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.910
That's the easy part.

35
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.710
This is for sure an entity,
like a garden has an id.

36
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.950
Maybe I have many gardens.

37
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.244
Maybe this turns into a garden
organization as a service app where

38
00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:37.830
neighborhoods can rally around this.

39
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.293
How can we try to represent in entities,
value,

40
00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:47.600
objects, relationships, constraints.

41
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.505
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Raised beds inside that?

42
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.510
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Raised beds.

43
00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.490
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Each raised bed have plants.

44
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.890
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep,
what do you mean by plant?

45
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.404
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Array of plant.

46
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.553
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So clear,
like we'll need a plant.

47
00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:15.370
What does a plant mean?

48
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.981
&gt;&gt; Student 1: You're dropping a seed and

49
00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:21.930
then you can add multiple
seeds in a raised bed.

50
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.796
And then-
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

51
00:03:22.796 --> 00:03:27.850
this is like one plant planted in
the ground at a particular time.

52
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.550
Great.

53
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.620
Not the abstract concept of like, there
exists this concept of a blueberry plant.

54
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.897
And I can sell you many of these things,
but

55
00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:40.420
this is like I've handed you one, right?

56
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.182
&gt;&gt; Student 2: What about a planting
area for the raised bed?

57
00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:47.620
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Is that, sorry,
a new concept or renaming this concept?

58
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.860
&gt;&gt; Student 2: That would be
a new concept of value entity.

59
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.047
The raised bed has.

60
00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.820
&gt;&gt; Mike North: A planting area, okay.

61
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.420
A value object or entity.

62
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.380
Tell me about the difference between
planting area and raised bed.

63
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.705
&gt;&gt; Student 2: I mean, I guess the width
and height could just be with height and

64
00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:16.260
depth could just be
properties of the raised bed.

65
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.980
Unless you're planting things in
the garden outside of a raised bed.

66
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.010
And then a planning area could apply
to anything that isn't a raised bed in

67
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.206
addition to describing the areas
contained within them.

68
00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:31.800
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now we're thinking
critically about this problem space.

69
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.440
So I'm going to say I actually
call those things on the ground.

70
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.480
I call them beds.

71
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.160
I have some raised beds, but I also
have these little beds on the ground.

72
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.910
It's sort of a space that plants go into.

73
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.910
So maybe the fact that it's raised
doesn't need to be modeled.

74
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.910
Now this really makes things interesting.

75
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.630
Depth.

76
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.870
Like what is the depth
of a bed on the ground?

77
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.350
Well, is it the radius
of the planet Earth?

78
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.750
Like what are we talking about here?

79
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.479
So I love this and because I actually
intend to use this app and like at the end

80
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.486
of this I wanna show you some tickets
that I've prepared if people want as

81
00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:23.170
like a final project to do something
interesting in the context of this app.

82
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.335
But like depth starts to become really
interesting if you're planning something

83
00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:29.809
like bulbs where you can
have different layers,

84
00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.848
you have ones that can be planted deep and
then ones that can be 6 inches above and

85
00:05:33.848 --> 00:05:36.770
they'll sort of all pop
up at different times.

86
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.010
This is like a lasagna of bulbs.

87
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.770
If you want to think about it that way,
let's stick with width and height.

88
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.690
Right now I notice it's a top down view
as far as we're concerned right now.

89
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.090
And we're not trying to
get into depth quite yet.

90
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.850
But a real solution, a robust one,
would certainly model it that way.

91
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.453
Without making final
decisions here of any kind,

92
00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:08.210
what other things do we
want to incorporate?

93
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.370
So garden clearly has many raised beds.

94
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.150
&gt;&gt; Student 3: I guess location
could be on the garden.

95
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.870
There might be some sort of like X and Y
situation for the beds within the garden.

96
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.350
I don't know if that's important to this.

97
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.110
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah,
well, absolutely right.

98
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.122
Like thinking back to the first exercise
we did, like, if I want to answer some of

99
00:06:38.122 --> 00:06:41.910
these questions around, like when is
the right time to plant these things?

100
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.870
Location is absolutely critical.

101
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.630
I'm going to bend your X and Y point here.

102
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.901
I'd argue at the very least
we need to know on plant,

103
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:55.310
like in the context of a bed, where is it?

104
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.950
And we're going to need a position here.

105
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.839
We happen to have already a value
object called XY coordinate which will

106
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.130
give us a good indication there.

107
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.010
&gt;&gt; Student 4: So does a planting
area have a position within a bed?

108
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.650
In which case would you want to tie the
plant to the planting area and position?

109
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.881
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, so stepping into
my subject matter expert role here,

110
00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:28.090
I'm going to say I can't really tell
the difference between these two things.

111
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.650
Like to me a bed is a way to
describe a planting area.

112
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.816
&gt;&gt; Student 4: Is the planting area not one
of the tiles within a bed we can drag it

113
00:07:38.816 --> 00:07:40.066
into?

114
00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:42.140
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's a good question.

115
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.260
Let's forget that we have seen
a peek at a solution there.

116
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.921
But if you were to ask me that
same question in the context of

117
00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:52.500
like how I think about a garden.

118
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.580
Well, I have my garden.

119
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.915
It's like the big photo I showed you and
then I've got beds,

120
00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:03.525
some of which are on the ground, some of
which are in those metal containers and

121
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:07.260
then plants are positioned
within those beds.

122
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.159
And like, while it's true that each of
those beds has a position within my

123
00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:15.340
garden, really what I'm trying to.

124
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.854
The problems I'm trying to
solve here have to do with like

125
00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:23.020
tracking how much sun each bed gets.

126
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.756
Or am I planting things
too close together or, or

127
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:30.270
am I needlessly planting things too
far apart and I'm wasting space.

128
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.115
And if you just show me like some
list of little bed diagrams,

129
00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:39.950
like a lot of my needs are met and
I don't need it to be.

130
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.950
I don't need to be at a two scale,
real diagram of my garden.

131
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.390
Although that would be very cool.

132
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.070
I'd say we're going
well beyond the basics.

133
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.498
If we go all the way there.

134
00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:54.541
&gt;&gt; Student  5: Would we have any
plants that exist outside of a bed?

135
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:55.940
Seedlings or.

136
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.180
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, great question.

137
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.580
I think I can simplify that by
saying whatever plant exists in.

138
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.138
I'm going to call that a bed.

139
00:09:07.138 --> 00:09:12.580
If it's one of those hydroponic things,
that's a bed too.

140
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.940
If it's in a red party cup, maybe that's
a bed of width one and height one.

141
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.260
And I'm just going to call that a bed.

142
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.180
It's a good starting point.

143
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.867
I think maybe what we can get
out of that is plant always,

144
00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:32.900
always has a pointer to a bed.

145
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.020
Beds can only exist within
the context of a garden.

146
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.791
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to combine these

147
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:46.260
because your subject matter
expert says I'm Confused here.

148
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.070
&gt;&gt; Student 3: The plant would have a size.

149
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.270
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay,
say more like how big it gets.

150
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.595
&gt;&gt; Student 3: How big it gets
&gt;&gt; Mike North: How big it gets.

151
00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:00.871
Maximum,
&gt;&gt; Student  5: How many positions.

152
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.710
&gt;&gt; Student 3: When the-
&gt;&gt; Student  5: The planting distance.

153
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.310
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The planting distance,
right?

154
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.190
&gt;&gt; Student 3: Yeah.

155
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.159
&gt;&gt; Student  5: Now wouldn't the plant
just have kind of plant metadata,

156
00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.310
which is all of the stuff that the plant.

157
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.430
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're gonna see?

158
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.170
It turns out we're going to use the same
plant metadata concept, I'd say.

159
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.210
Yeah, absolutely.

160
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.170
It has a planting distance for sure.

161
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.182
And, you know, I'm going to tell you,
I only care about feet

162
00:10:30.182 --> 00:10:37.290
here because I mentioned I want to embrace
the concept of a square foot garden.

163
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.774
So really, like in reality,
when we say there's this plant distance,

164
00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.270
it's a circle.

165
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:49.789
It kind of represents like,
how big the plant's going to get,

166
00:10:49.789 --> 00:10:56.630
how competitive it is for
nutrients with the things around it.

167
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:02.230
But gosh, a real simple way
to draw this out is squares.

168
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.183
And so we're gonna approximate it.

169
00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:11.728
Square foot garden is a term people use
where you can allocate a square foot and

170
00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:17.710
sometimes that means you can plant nine
carrots in there in a three by three grid.

171
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.430
Or if it's a tomato, it's like a two
foot by two foot square in your garden.

172
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.710
It takes up all four of those spots.

173
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.390
And that's sort of like the crude
way of getting it pretty much right.

174
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.710
And a lot of people do it this way.

175
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.840
All right, plant has a position,
it has a planting distance.

176
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.800
I'm actually going to do this.

177
00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.680
Come on.

178
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.040
You're not going to let me scroll.

179
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.120
I'm going to say a plant
comes from a seed packet.

180
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.080
Ultimately it comes from a seed packet.

181
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.640
And I, I think we already put
planting distance on here.

182
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.520
I'm going to refine.

183
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.280
I'm going to refine our domain model here.

184
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.040
We've made a change.

185
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.661
We actually added this already and

186
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:29.480
we can just refer to the seed
packet as the source of truth.

187
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:36.670
For that's sort of our, like,
it's our plant factory.

188
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.350
Right.
It's the template for a plant.

189
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.059
And we don't need that
data to be stored on every

190
00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:44.950
single plant that's in the ground.

191
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.910
Like, If I plant 40 snow pea vines,
I can point to the same.

192
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.910
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Seed packet maybe outside
the scope of the exercise, but like, with.

193
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.039
I don't know a lot about gardening, but

194
00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:58.736
I have heard the concept of like
permaculture, right, where certain

195
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:03.970
plants planted near each other can be more
cooperative and effective and grow better.

196
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.370
You as a master gardener with
the master gardener hat on.

197
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.090
Do you care about that relationship for
plants in how you plant things?

198
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.770
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Absolutely.

199
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.690
But I think it goes
beyond the basics here.

200
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:19.647
I would love for that to be eventually
part of this app, but for now, let's,

201
00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:23.410
like, let's focus on plant
spacing as the core problem.

202
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.072
Plant spacing and

203
00:13:25.072 --> 00:13:31.170
how that is dealt with in the layout
of plants in a bed of some kind.

204
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:35.650
We can also assume the beds
are rectangular for now, you know, and

205
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.810
we'll see where this takes us.

206
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.490
So I think this is a good starting point.

207
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.010
We'll revisit this if,
as we're implementing,

208
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.770
we discover that there
are things that we're missing.
