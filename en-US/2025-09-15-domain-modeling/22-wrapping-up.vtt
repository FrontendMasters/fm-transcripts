&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thanks for watching
this course about domain modelling and

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.040
collaborating with humans and AI.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.780
I hope you learned some tips and
tricks for

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.103
having useful conversations with users and
aligning around a shared language so

5
00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:16.703
that you can bring that
language into your software and

6
00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:21.968
increase the likelihood that you will
solve important problems for your user.

7
00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:26.504
And you avoid lossiness in communication,
which can result in overly complicated or

8
00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.270
misaligned software products.
