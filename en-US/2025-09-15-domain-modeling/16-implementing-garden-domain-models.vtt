00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.800
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's transition
back to implementing this.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.433
We're gonna need some new types and
we're going to need some new entities.

3
00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.160
And let's get cooking.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.160
So we're going to go
back to our types folder.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.520
We have entities to create.

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.560
Not our dist folder,
our source entities folder.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.520
And I'm going to close out some of
the stuff from the last exercise.

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
Let's see, we have a little
bit of a starting point here.

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.010
We have a garden and I think it looks
like there's something complicated here.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.010
A function that generates a type.

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.250
So we're gonna create a WorkspaceSchema.

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:44.113
Oops, this is actually not right.

13
00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:47.888
But it's a good opportunity for
us to go and fix this.

14
00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:54.900
What we want is to build
on this concept of zone.

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.740
So zone, if we think about
our other bounded context.

16
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.678
I'm going to go back to this, right,

17
00:01:02.678 --> 00:01:08.180
We've got workspace,
that's the garden zone.

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.900
That's the bed within the garden.

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.230
Item placement, we'll call that the plant
item is kind of the seed packet, right?

20
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.870
It's the source of information for
what is this thing all about?

21
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.910
Let's look at workspace,
not zone, workspace type.

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.510
It says create workspace schema for
item type.

23
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.350
We can see great takes in some arguments.

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.696
That's like the item type, the metadata
for the workspace, the metadata for

25
00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:45.560
the zone, it's got an array of zones and
then it's got some metadata.

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.999
So we have opportunity for
metadata on the garden and

27
00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.061
then a zone below that
we've got placements.

28
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.920
So those are like ItemPlacements.

29
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.199
To put like a placement would have to
have an XYCoordinate of some sort.

30
00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:00.920
And let's see if that looks right.

31
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.320
Hey, look, we've got a position
with an XYCoordinate and an item.

32
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.770
And this might.

33
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.491
This might be a seed packet or
something like that.

34
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.690
And then what does it belong to?

35
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.650
Yes.

36
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.027
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Have you tried using, sorry,

37
00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:23.650
have you tried using Cursor to
scaffold some of these types before?

38
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.410
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Absolutely.

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.330
Cursor is quite good at
scaffolding these types.

40
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.972
And especially, my big pro tip here
would be if you have an entity that's

41
00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:38.220
related to this, leave that
information in the code comments.

42
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.412
Leave yourself a little path relative
to your project route to follow so

43
00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:48.230
that if Cursor finds itself updating this,

44
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.300
one of the first things it does
is it reads the entire file.

45
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.097
And if you've left notes, whenever
you update this, make sure to go and

46
00:02:57.097 --> 00:02:59.648
check that it threads
through this other thing,

47
00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:02.440
Cursor will be pretty good
at figuring that out.

48
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.219
I'm not doing that right now because
I would just start typing a couple

49
00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.678
characters and it would just be
spitting out a lot of things, and

50
00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:14.040
it gets a little bit more difficult
to kind of follow what's going on.

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.720
So we've got item placement,
we've got zone, and we've got workspace.

52
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.522
So let's back up here and go to garden.

53
00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:24.750
Great.
So we've got create workspace schema for

54
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.538
item type, we pass in the plant schema,

55
00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:31.720
we pass in some object that
represents metadata on the zone.

56
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.410
I believe that's what this is.

57
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.794
Zone metadata schema is the first one, and

58
00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:44.410
then workspace metadata
schema is the second one.

59
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.730
Just double checking that.

60
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.225
Yep, zone and workspace, great.
