00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.120
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's discuss this
problem of organizing seed packets.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.240
And I've deliberately given you all
more information than you should carry

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.760
forward because I want you to practice
this, sort of identifying the core value,

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.280
teasing that out, building what's
necessary without going overboard.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.027
So I'm gonna give you a couple
pieces of information to use and

6
00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:32.774
then I want you to spend a couple
of minutes just thinking about

7
00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:36.810
questions to ask and
then we'll have a discussion.

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.730
By the way, so
let's go through the information.

9
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.299
I also have a way you can have
a discussion if you're watching this

10
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:46.010
course on video.

11
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.859
I've built an LLM prompt for you that
can simulate a gardening expert and

12
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.289
you can ask ChatGPT or

13
00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.480
an LLM of your choice the same kinds
of questions we're gonna discuss today.

14
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.320
And it should give you something
useful enough for you to engage with.

15
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.679
First, let's look at what
a seed looks like in a catalog.

16
00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.320
This is a huge image for this thing.

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.040
This is a little snippet of one
of those seed catalogs we've got.

18
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.210
This is for a tomato.

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.090
We've got San Marzano Heirloom, 80 days.

20
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.850
Then a description and then this is
a weight and there's some words here.

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.690
And then we've got different quantities
that you can buy for a price.

22
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.690
And here's the front and
back of a seed packet.

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.170
So we've got the front where got
some information up here and

24
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.050
then in the back this is even information.

25
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.420
And then we've got some measure of days,
some planting instructions.

26
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.940
And then don't forget to look on the side
here, this vertical edge information here.

27
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.620
Sprouts in 7 to 14 days.

28
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.336
There's an ideal, hey,
a temperature range, seed depth for

29
00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:08.260
planting, whether it's frost hardy,
something called plant spacing, right?

30
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.590
So do not attempt to model
every detail of the real world.

31
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.206
You have to keep track of
the fact that you are trying to

32
00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:24.270
build a useful software product.

33
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.615
This is not the matrix where you're
trying to create a seed packet and

34
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.670
a seed that will actually grow a plant.

35
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.740
And that is a perfect representation of
this thing as it exists in the real world.

36
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.533
And I've given you a seriously overkill
data source here that you're going to have

37
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.220
to pick and choose from.

38
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.860
This represents one seed.

39
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.780
So we've got some spacing stuff.

40
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.657
We've got some environmental needs,
like how much sun does it like,

41
00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:57.192
how much water does it like, we've got
some soil characteristics that it wants,

42
00:02:57.192 --> 00:02:59.180
some temperature ranges, right?

43
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.050
So you're gonna wanna look at this and
let's say, you had access to

44
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.270
a government data source that has
a ton of this information about seeds.

45
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.401
I want us to work on what do we really
need to tease out in order to make this

46
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.310
useful?

47
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.710
Clearly, there's some stuff back here.

48
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.870
This is mostly placeholder stuff.

49
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.339
We can tweak it based on our discussion,
but

50
00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:28.310
you're not gonna fit all of that back
here on the back of the seed packet.

51
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.086
We'll have to refine that.

52
00:03:32.474 --> 00:03:38.306
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, finally,
if you're watching remotely or

53
00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:42.996
if you're watching this as a video course,

54
00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:48.064
this is an LLM prompt that
you can plug into a chat

55
00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:54.890
AI of your choice and
it will be your gardening expert.

56
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.450
It'll have a garden
that's similar to mine.

57
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.400
So you'll get hopefully some kind of
similar answers that I would give.

58
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.997
But this is a way you can sort of have
a discussion even if you're watching this

59
00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.000
course at home.

60
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.797
So with that, let's take a few minutes
to sort of look through some of this

61
00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:19.200
information I've provided you and then
let's come up with some good questions.

62
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.190
And what we're gonna do is go back
to this tool and we're gonna try

63
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.290
to model what exactly is a seed packet and
how do we break that down?

64
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.890
What are the value objects, etc.

65
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.141
There is a file in your repo
that I'll give you a path to,

66
00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:43.930
packages &gt; server &gt; data &gt; seeds.yml.

67
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.463
And that is this path is where you're

68
00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:57.540
gonna find a huge data file.

69
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.980
That's kind of our source of truth for
seed data.

70
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.946
If you look at that,
here's that tomato plant and

71
00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:11.741
VS code makes this nice because
you can still see the IDs and

72
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.300
the path, but it goes pretty deep.

73
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.110
This is a 12,000 line yaml
file with a ton of data.

74
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.234
All right, let's say two or
three minutes and

75
00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:33.211
just process some of this and
let's prepare to have a conversation.

76
00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:39.509
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm now putting
my gardening expert hat on.

77
00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:45.290
So the scenario is, I have a problem.

78
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.687
I have a ton of envelopes
of seeds at home,

79
00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:58.970
and I have reported to you that
it's an unmanageable pile.

80
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.170
And that is painful for
me, that is difficult.

81
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.395
So how can we go from that to
identifying kind of a problem to solve,

82
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:14.917
a more specific problem to solve,
and then going over here and

83
00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:19.377
figuring out how that
translates into entities,

84
00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:23.380
relationships, values, constraints.

85
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.340
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Can you describe
what specifically you struggle

86
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.500
with a little bit?

87
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.460
Do you have trouble knowing
what seeds you have on hand?

88
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.450
Do you struggle with remembering
what specific time you need to plant

89
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.790
certain seeds and
be some more information like that?

90
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.454
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So the question was like,
can I go into more detail?

91
00:06:41.454 --> 00:06:44.967
Are there specific things
that I struggle with?

92
00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.350
You had some good prompts there.

93
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.630
Are there things I need to know
at a particular point in time?

94
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.270
So you're fishing at like,
is there a life cycle here?

95
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.790
Is there a sequence of
time based operations?

96
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.110
And it turns out there are.

97
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.488
So when I use a different color here,

98
00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:07.302
cuz these are not entities, but

99
00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:11.539
I wanna plant stuff in the ground and

100
00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.930
this happens when the time is right.

101
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.970
You should probably ask
me more about that.

102
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.970
So we plant in the ground and
then like before that we harden.

103
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.230
Harden plants and this means gradually
expose them to the outdoors.

104
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.285
They're really delicate when
you start them inside and

105
00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:37.523
you wanna give them a few hours of real
outdoor sun and wind so they get strong.

106
00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:43.548
And then there's a part before that,

107
00:07:43.548 --> 00:07:47.319
which is grow indoors.

108
00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:52.710
And there is time here, right?

109
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:59.520
So I wanna know how long
these things take to mature.

110
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.080
Well, it's almost like time
that works backwards, right?

111
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.200
I wanna know when does this
plant go in the ground?

112
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.920
And this one's pretty known.

113
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.000
7 days, harden for a week.

114
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.400
This one depends on the plant.

115
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.285
Some things like mint
will just shoot up and

116
00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:26.720
some things take a really
long time to develop.

117
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.720
Like peppers.

118
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.770
Peppers take a lot longer
to grow than squash,

119
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.444
which kind of just takes over everything.

120
00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:45.105
You start it inside and
it's unwieldy as you're carrying it out.

121
00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:47.040
So there's a timeline here.

122
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.640
There's a sequence of things I wanna do.

123
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.970
And because there's a variable here,
we can call it t, right?

124
00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:00.090
The time it takes to grow and then there's
a variable here, let's say that's temp.

125
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.370
Sorry, too many Ts.

126
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.570
There's a time and there's a temp.

127
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.236
And so based on when this goes outside,
I'm looking for

128
00:09:08.236 --> 00:09:12.690
particular things at different
points when I'm growing indoors.

129
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.530
It's almost like a work back plan,
if that makes sense.

130
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.580
We want to launch on a particular date.

131
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.980
There's a fixed time thing here.

132
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.780
And then I need to work backwards and
figure out when do I start this inside.

133
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.584
Some things I have to start really early.

134
00:09:32.584 --> 00:09:36.826
And then some things I can start later and
it'll be fine.

135
00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:41.800
So that's one of the things I wanna do.

136
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.450
So let's capture this just like that.

137
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.430
There's a life cycle,
there's a time based sequence.

138
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.310
All right, and there's something else,
seeds also expire.

139
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.070
Sometimes I order too much.

140
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.620
Part of it is,

141
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.480
I'm legitimately disorganized
with this collection of seeds.

142
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.520
I forget that I have a thing and
I order more of it.

143
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.190
And now I have an old seed packet and
a new seed packet and

144
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.120
I wanna go through the old stuff first.

145
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.834
So there's some sense of like,
show me if these things are getting

146
00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:24.040
close to where the seeds
aren't gonna grow as easily.

147
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.875
And I wanna go through those,

148
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.920
I wanna make sure that I use those
up rather than use the new thing.

149
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.843
And then finally, if I wanna look through
what I have, so I don't double or

150
00:10:33.843 --> 00:10:35.040
triple order things.

151
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.566
So just being able to easily find what
I have quickly rather than rifling

152
00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:44.400
through a big box of envelopes,
that's pretty important.

153
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.320
So there's search by name or plant type,
there's a time-based sequence.

154
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.640
And so
I wanna understand when to start indoors.

155
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.480
And then there's sort of
a favorites concept here.

156
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.520
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Stock,
how much you have stock of?

157
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.651
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep.

158
00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:19.240
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's great.

159
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.320
How many seeds of a given type do I have?

160
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.060
&gt;&gt; Female Student 1: Do seeds tend
to expire sort of at the same?

161
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.100
Is there different expiration dates for
different seeds?

162
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.300
How long they'll last?

163
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.540
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah,
that's a very good question.

164
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.103
I'll give you the first level of insight,

165
00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:41.820
which is there's the date
that's on the packet.

166
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.578
And I'm not sure what the answer
to that is, but if we dug deeper,

167
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:53.965
it's something like, well, the way
you get seeds is you grow a plant and

168
00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:59.440
you wait for it to mature and
sometimes it'll fruit, right?

169
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.144
You get a pepper, but
instead of eating the pepper, well,

170
00:12:03.144 --> 00:12:08.199
maybe you also eat the pepper, but you
collect the seeds from inside the pepper.

171
00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:11.440
And so
that's happening at a predictable time.

172
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.280
That's usually happening with seasons.

173
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.057
And so when I think about expiring,

174
00:12:18.057 --> 00:12:23.250
it's usually less about it's on
March 27th that this expires.

175
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.970
And I don't wanna use it after that
point but it's a softer signal there.

176
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:32.010
Look, these are getting old and
I'm really looking at expiration dates.

177
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.450
Kind of around this part
of the time period.

178
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.549
When I'm planting things indoors,

179
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:41.210
I will totally plant seeds that
are past their expiration date.

180
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:46.203
But I'll put two or
three of them in those little hydroponic,

181
00:12:46.203 --> 00:12:49.350
those baskets that we talked about.

182
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.430
And I don't know, maybe one grows.

183
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:58.070
Sometimes none grow, but
I'd say we're kind of honing in on.

184
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.197
It's more of a year that it expires on and

185
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:03.590
it's something I only evaluate
at the beginning of the season.

186
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.630
&gt;&gt; Male Student 3: Someone online said,
yeah, reminders.

187
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.950
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I need a reminder,
that's great.

188
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.830
That's great.

189
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.632
So we do want a reminder anytime
there's a time based thing.

190
00:13:13.632 --> 00:13:16.828
Remember I've got 40 of those raised beds.

191
00:13:16.828 --> 00:13:18.860
I keep saying it's like 38 or 40.

192
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.500
I legit have lost count,
it's a lot to manage.

193
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.460
A lot of different plants going on,
a lot of things starting at the same time.

194
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.098
And really I'm well
beyond the point of just

195
00:13:29.098 --> 00:13:32.809
putting a calendar event
somewhere manually and being like,

196
00:13:32.809 --> 00:13:36.890
this is the day where I'm performing
this activity for my garden.

197
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.170
It's just all these things
have different timelines.

198
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.370
So, yeah, great.

199
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.090
Reminders.

200
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.890
Yeah, yeah, there's a time based sequence.

201
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.090
This is the reminder right here.

202
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.210
I want to understand
when to start indoors.

203
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.330
I want to understand when to transplant.

204
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.610
Okay, I think we're good.

205
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.290
I'm gonna stop us here.

206
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.090
So back to seed packet.

207
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.494
And as we look at these things,

208
00:13:58.494 --> 00:14:05.070
what are some pieces of data that we
need to associate with the seed packet?

209
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.750
And let's think about are they value
objects, are they other entities?

210
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.470
Let's explore.

211
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.910
Okay, maybe you understand the pain.

212
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:24.270
Let's start thinking about how to
describe the related concepts here.

213
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.216
Not in code yet, but just you're still
on the whiteboard with the gardener, or

214
00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:32.422
you're using whimsical with the gardener.
