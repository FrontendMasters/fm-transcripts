1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.376
Okay, so far, we have, for now,
we're still using a package.

2
00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:09.004
We've seen how we can share everything
that we said in your package between

3
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.581
different files, which is expectable.

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:17.211
And for now, we have just functions and
variables pointing,

5
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:21.550
and we have already
imported our first packet.

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.062
And by the way, I mentioned that
typically, you've done this manually,

7
00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:31.613
because if you start typing here print,
okay, like that, or

8
00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:36.180
fmt and you press Enter or Return,
it adds the import for you.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.357
So you don't typically do it manually,
okay, you just go and start typing and

10
00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:42.020
it will add the import for you.

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.558
And if you don't add the import also, but
you call the function, you have an error,

12
00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:51.859
of course, because it doesn't
know in this file how that works.

13
00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.188
And by the way, imports are not per
package, they are per file, okay?

14
00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:02.848
Because functions.go are already
importing fmt, okay?

15
00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:05.638
And it's in the same package as main, but

16
00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:08.844
that you still need to
import that here as well.

17
00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:10.281
Does it make sense?

18
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:13.691
So imports actually works per file.

19
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:18.702
You will see an error and
this error has the light bulb.

20
00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:23.487
And if you click there, you have a quick
fix that it will add the import for you.

21
00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:25.036
Okay, make sense?

22
00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:29.572
And by the way, if you look here,
sometimes, you see an error,

23
00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:34.868
you solve the error, you add a quick fix,
and I'm still seeing the error.

24
00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:38.184
Also, you will still see the error here.

25
00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:44.787
This is important, so
save this in your brain, you have to save.

26
00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:49.972
If you don't save the file,
the linter is not taking the changes.

27
00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:56.821
So I need to save the file to
actually remove those errors.

28
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:00.277
That takes time as well, because when
you start typing, you see the error,

29
00:02:00.277 --> 00:02:03.632
you solve the error, and the error
is still there, the same error, why?

30
00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:05.947
You didn't save.

31
00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:10.611
If you are brave enough,
you can enable Auto Save, okay?

32
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:14.269
That's just centennial for me,
so it's not gonna work for me.

33
00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.876
But if you want, in that case,
every once in a while, it's saving, but

34
00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:20.243
sometimes it saves when
you're not finished,

35
00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:23.575
so then you get errors as well that
you are not expecting, so yeah.

36
00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:26.180
Anyway, if you wanna try that,
it's there, okay?

37
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.240
Do you have any questions so far?

38
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.527
No, so far, it's pretty simple, yeah.

39
00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:40.593
&gt;&gt; So when you export things,
since we're all in the same folder and

40
00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:45.602
everything's in the same package-
&gt;&gt; As of now.

41
00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:46.327
&gt;&gt; For now,
&gt;&gt; For now, yeah.

42
00:02:46.327 --> 00:02:47.721
&gt;&gt; So when you're exporting,

43
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:51.735
that's when you're trying to put stuff
into other folders, that's the point?

44
00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:52.799
&gt;&gt; I mean, let me do that quickly.

45
00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.919
Now, we will start a new project and
we will do that from scratch, but

46
00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:57.852
just quickly.

47
00:02:57.852 --> 00:03:03.264
If I create a new folder here, and I say,
I don't know, data, it just a folder.

48
00:03:03.264 --> 00:03:05.670
I create a Go file within the data.

49
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.830
I can call this, i don't know,

50
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.523
collection or, let's say, constants.go.

51
00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:18.504
This is a file, constants.go,
any name, within the data folder, so

52
00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:24.415
it's going to read the package data, not
the package main, the name of the folder.

53
00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:28.543
And now, I can create a constant for,

54
00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:32.416
for example, my maxSpeed=60.

55
00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:36.680
And now, I can go to main.go and
try to access that.

56
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.123
How to access?

57
00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:42.875
If I wanna print maxSpeed,
okay, it's not gonna work,

58
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:46.445
because it's in a different package now.

59
00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:47.923
What do I need to do?

60
00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:53.216
To import the package, even if it's in my
same module, in my same project, okay?

61
00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:56.994
Now, it's in a different package,
so I need to import the package.

62
00:03:56.994 --> 00:03:58.814
Is it data?

63
00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:01.626
No, but it's called data.

64
00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:05.364
When you look here, it's data.

65
00:04:05.364 --> 00:04:08.935
Because it's my own package,

66
00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:14.150
I need to add here
the prefix of my project ID,

67
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.069
so it's going to be like that [SOUND],
right there.

68
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:26.311
Look at this, if I save now,
I'm going to save, it disappears.

69
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.787
You say, [SOUND] why?

70
00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:30.344
Because I'm not using it.

71
00:04:30.344 --> 00:04:32.876
You say, but, yeah, I'm trying to use it.

72
00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:36.900
Well, the thing is that I
should say data., and why data?

73
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.102
Because it's taking
the last part of the URL as

74
00:04:41.102 --> 00:04:45.642
the name of the object to
reference things there.

75
00:04:45.642 --> 00:04:49.707
If you wanna change that,
you can put another name here, okay,

76
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:53.789
something like that, like an alias,
but for now, it's okay.

77
00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.174
But it's giving me an error,
do you know why?

78
00:04:57.174 --> 00:05:02.744
So I'm trying to print the maxSpeed
that it's actually constant,

79
00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:08.325
60, in data, but it's not working,
it's giving me a problem.

80
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:09.108
Do you know why?

81
00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.633
Does anyone know why?

82
00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:12.469
What's the problem?

83
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.296
Look at the error.

84
00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:14.429
&gt;&gt; Not a string.

85
00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:16.513
&gt;&gt; No, that's not a problem.

86
00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:19.140
&gt;&gt; Cuz it's lower case m.

87
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.081
[SOUND] maxSpeed is not exported, why?

88
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.337
It's lowercase m, visibility.

89
00:05:27.337 --> 00:05:29.885
So I need to change that.

90
00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:31.401
Is there any way to export?

91
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:37.016
No, if you wanna export a constant,
a function, or

92
00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:42.519
a data type, or a variable,
it must be title case.

93
00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:47.593
And now, I can't even see it.

94
00:05:47.593 --> 00:05:49.493
All right, does it make sense?

95
00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:52.408
Again, maybe that's not the right
question, because if I say,

96
00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:55.747
does it make sense, some of you will say,
no, it doesn't make sense, but

97
00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:56.766
that's how Go works.
