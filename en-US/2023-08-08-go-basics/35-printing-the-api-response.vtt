00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.165
We were playing brave here,
because we haven't tested this.

2
00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:09.149
But now, we can go to main.go,
that is still completely empty and

3
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.399
try to use this.

4
00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:11.873
So what do I wanna try first?

5
00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:16.684
Well, I will try to go and call my api.

6
00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:18.990
So what's the name of the package, api?

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.463
Should I use cex?

8
00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:23.939
I don't know if it's cex or cex.

9
00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.358
Cex sounds complicated.

10
00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:33.099
Anyway, for cryptocurrencies at least,
but anyway, cex, let's say.

11
00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:36.656
Should I start writing cex.?

12
00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.006
&gt;&gt; api.
&gt;&gt; api., that's the name of the package,

13
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:39.528
correct.

14
00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:42.157
And then I have the GetRate.

15
00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:47.003
It's going to import API, and
then I can parse on BTC and

16
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.211
try to receive BTC, it's Bitcoin.

17
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:57.293
So I can try to receive the answer that is
going to be a rate or a possible error.

18
00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:00.638
And for that, I will just bring both.

19
00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:04.845
It was just a quick print for
debugging purposes.

20
00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:10.482
I'm not going to use this
as the final version.

21
00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:14.387
So let's try this, so go run..

22
00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:19.611
First, look at this.

23
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:20.839
This is Lulu.

24
00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:21.518
Who is Lulu?

25
00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:24.378
Lulu is a firewall that
I have to on my Mac

26
00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:28.296
that I'm going to disable
right now you will see why.

27
00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:33.244
Because it's detecting a new app in
my Mac trying to get to the network,

28
00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:36.058
and let's say it's okay, this is new.

29
00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:36.842
We won't allow that.

30
00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:37.803
I can say Allow, okay?

31
00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:43.409
That means that something's happening,
it's going into the network, okay, and

32
00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.714
something will happen also.

33
00:01:44.714 --> 00:01:45.469
There is a timeout.

34
00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.116
So at one point, if the firewall is,
and there we have it.

35
00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:53.391
We have something that we are receiving.

36
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:56.070
Probably, I don't know how to read that,
okay?

37
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.127
That's probably my print that I have here.

38
00:02:00.127 --> 00:02:05.055
So it went to the network and
we received something.

39
00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:09.692
If I try again, If Lulu is again

40
00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:14.200
giving me an alert, I say Allow, okay?

41
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.636
Now, I try again.

42
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.669
LuLu gave me an alert.

43
00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:18.305
Why?

44
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:24.591
Lulu, my firewall is giving me, I'm saying
allow, and that should stay forever.

45
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:26.088
And did I change the rule?

46
00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:30.913
Why is Lulu giving me the same alert
on every time I run in the app?

47
00:02:30.913 --> 00:02:32.239
Does anyone know why?

48
00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:41.239
Go is a binary, and
actually we are running.

49
00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.615
But if you remember, running is not
actually like running the same app.

50
00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:51.374
It's building a new app every time in
a temporary directory that I'm not seeing

51
00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:52.375
and running it.

52
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.631
Every time I'm executing run,
it's building a new app.

53
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:58.379
So from an OS point of view,

54
00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.110
it's a new app that is trying
to get to the network, okay?

55
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.388
And also now, we got the JSON.

56
00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:07.511
Why the JSON wasn't there the first time,

57
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:12.991
it was because Lulu was blocking it for
a while and then it goes to a timeout.

58
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:16.443
But we see the JSON as a string,
so it's working.

59
00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:20.728
And what we see here,
the the the rate and the error.

60
00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:23.854
And yeah, that they're pretty bad, okay,

61
00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:27.155
because the rate is
actually a memory address.

62
00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:31.632
It's a pointer, so we will need to
do something better with that, okay?

63
00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:36.238
But in fact, I just tried to
show the price of the rate and

64
00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:39.586
I will explain something interesting.

65
00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:44.635
I will delete Lulu from memory for now,

66
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:49.686
okay, and this is my output, my rate.

67
00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:54.826
It's not probably the notation that I
expect, okay, but we'll make that better.

68
00:03:54.826 --> 00:03:56.973
So what's going on here?

69
00:03:56.973 --> 00:03:58.603
Rate, what's the type of rate?

70
00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:03.117
So if I write right here, what's the type?

71
00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.524
It's not my structure.

72
00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:07.155
It's a pointer to my structure, okay?

73
00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:11.972
But then I used dot and
it worked, so I didn't need

74
00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:16.790
to do something like this,
get into the object and

75
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.630
then called price or
something like that, okay?

76
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.723
Well, that is because the dot syntax,

77
00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:29.038
when the dot operator actually
works with pointers and

78
00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:34.592
it goes to the object, it goes to
the instance to make our life easier.

79
00:04:34.592 --> 00:04:41.457
So if we have the structure instance or
a pointer to the structure instance,

80
00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:47.036
how you call methods or
how you access properties is the same,

81
00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:51.135
just the dot, it's like a shortcut, okay?

82
00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:52.016
Make sense?

83
00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:58.041
Cool, so, so far I have my code
working in terms of I'm receiving

84
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:03.423
a JSON from the server, but
we need one more step, right?

85
00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:06.762
So we need to parse the JSON,
because right now, it's just a string.
