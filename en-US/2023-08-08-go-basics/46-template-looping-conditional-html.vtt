1
00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:01.838
Template gets more complicated.

2
00:00:01.838 --> 00:00:06.958
There is a whole language that you
can do over templates but first,

3
00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:12.092
what I need, I don't need to
render only one exhibition, right?

4
00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:13.529
I want all of them.

5
00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.264
That's why I have a slice of exhibitions.

6
00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:21.243
So instead of Sending, 1,

7
00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:25.394
I'm going to send, O.

8
00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:30.137
Now if you try these now it will give
us an error because the template

9
00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:34.964
will not actually work because we
don't have a title in the slides,

10
00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:37.945
we need to actually get into one element.

11
00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:42.490
But what we need,
we need to repeat this article.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.895
We want one article per exhibition.

13
00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:47.376
Make sense?

14
00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:52.322
To do that we are going to open
a control structure for the template.

15
00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.580
It's called Range.

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.384
So we are gonna arrange for
the current value and

17
00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:00.554
we use the dot here because
the dot is the collection.

18
00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:08.528
And the range has a corresponding end
where you express where that ends.

19
00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:14.632
And within that range, dot is actually
the element that we are looping.

20
00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:16.824
It's actually each element.

21
00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:24.563
So we don't need to change the template
that we have within the article.

22
00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:26.679
So this is a for loop.

23
00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.724
We don't use the for key, we use range.

24
00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:35.877
Does it make sense?

25
00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:45.941
So if I try this, remember I need to
stop the server, run the server again.

26
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:48.183
And I refresh.

27
00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:54.293
I have now my front end
museum server rendered.

28
00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:58.862
That right now is a static,
the data is static but

29
00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:03.656
it can be received from databases,
from a socket,

30
00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:09.019
from whatever, and
you can see it is written in the HTML.

31
00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.409
And if you compare that with
the one we have in the root,

32
00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.393
that is not server-side render,
it's client-side render,

33
00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:21.362
the main has only one article, the first
one, the rest are coming from jaskin.

34
00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:25.032
So this one is better for performance.

35
00:02:25.032 --> 00:02:29.325
&gt;&gt; If we were to wanna change some
of the style this way would we just

36
00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:31.274
use like inline styling or?

37
00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:35.715
&gt;&gt; Let me see if I get what you want.

38
00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:41.430
You say for example that you wanna,
have here a change in the one we need.

39
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.967
No, this is the JSON, sorry, here.

40
00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:47.644
So you wanna have a color thing, and

41
00:02:47.644 --> 00:02:53.172
then each exhibition should
have a different color.

42
00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:57.587
Let's say this one is red,
this one is green.

43
00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:06.528
This one is blue and there is
a color salmon that exists in CSS.

44
00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:10.765
I have my missing trailing commas,
trailing commas.

45
00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:11.769
There we are.

46
00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.943
So now we have the color as a type.

47
00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:17.607
How can we apply this into HTML or CSS?

48
00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:21.194
Well, in the template,
you can just work with the strings.

49
00:03:21.194 --> 00:03:25.583
So something that I can do, for
example is go to my article and

50
00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:27.488
add a style declaration.

51
00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:30.265
And I can say that I
wanna change the border,

52
00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:32.902
I'm not sure if it's going to look nice.

53
00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:38.273
Let me go back to the UI.

54
00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:41.673
Well, let's try a border top.

55
00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:44.616
10 pixels solid and it goes to color.

56
00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:49.196
And there we say okay, we're going to take

57
00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:53.784
the color from what we
have here like that.

58
00:03:53.784 --> 00:04:00.450
Okay, I'm closing this there.

59
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.834
Think it's fine.

60
00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:04.547
It give me an error.

61
00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:08.709
It's give me a CSS error because we are,
that's okay.

62
00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.738
It's not CSS in this case, it says,
you cannot use calibrates on CSS but

63
00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:16.303
that's the template, not the CSS.

64
00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:21.000
We are the different metaverse, okay?

65
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.622
So because we are we are using
HTML here for the parser.

66
00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:29.150
If I change this to go template, then
we won't see the error anymore anyway.

67
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.579
So let's try it.

68
00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:37.289
I'm not saying that you
need to use this technique,

69
00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.478
but now we have red,
green, blue and salmon.

70
00:04:41.478 --> 00:04:45.462
Actually, that look pretty good.

71
00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:46.275
So that's one way.

72
00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:48.507
This is inline styling, yeah.

73
00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:53.067
The other solution is to change a class
based on that and you can use if,

74
00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:57.240
like I don't know, you can have
a class here and you can say, for

75
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.799
example, we can add another property
saying if it's open or closed,

76
00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:05.383
if it's a future exhibition or
it's currently open.

77
00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:11.613
So you can say currently open,
it's a bull, okay?

78
00:05:11.613 --> 00:05:15.664
So then I can add currently open,

79
00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:20.302
we have true, let's make one false.

80
00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:25.725
I'm doing this wasn't originally part of
the exercise but I think is pretty cool.

81
00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:32.256
So currently open now we have a ball and
then we can use an if here.

82
00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:37.116
How if work in templates if you don't
know how it works, well, remember,

83
00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:38.284
we have the docs.

84
00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:43.833
So you go to go.dev,
you search for templating.

85
00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:47.838
This is in the standards library.

86
00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:50.000
You search for template.

87
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:57.780
Then here, I think at one point,
you can search for if.

88
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.257
See if I can find, it's here,
I need to do the search.

89
00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:06.381
If template go, it's called if else.

90
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:09.506
It's not a big deal by the way.

91
00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:10.552
It is here?

92
00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:11.993
No.

93
00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:13.170
I think that's the one I opened before.

94
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.244
Okay, so here, you can see an example.

95
00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:19.147
It's pretty straightforward.

96
00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:24.257
If that put that value,
if not put that other value, end.

97
00:06:24.257 --> 00:06:26.212
So we can actually do
something similar here.

98
00:06:26.212 --> 00:06:32.312
I can go to a new line and say if.,
and then I use my property,

99
00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:37.718
currently open,
that's a Boolean so that's okay.

100
00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:41.453
I'm going to set the class as opened.

101
00:06:41.453 --> 00:06:47.212
Else, I can create another class,
closed and

102
00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:53.414
you can add spaces if you
want it's not a big deal,

103
00:06:53.414 --> 00:06:58.583
that I think it's okay, let me try this,

104
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:03.328
just to see if classes are appearing.

105
00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.155
So I'm going to refresh.

106
00:07:05.155 --> 00:07:10.471
If I inspect this,
we have class open, class closed.

107
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:13.385
So from the HTML point of view, it's okay.

108
00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:17.854
So now I can go to CSS and
change that a little bit.

109
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:21.821
So, I'm going to change the style CSS, and

110
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:27.289
I'm going to add .opened,
not sure if all of you are on CSS,

111
00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:32.649
.closed, and .opened, well,
maybe I can just keep it,

112
00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:37.718
I can just change closed,
and say that opacity 0.5.

113
00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:39.636
Quick question for you.

114
00:07:39.636 --> 00:07:41.472
I need to try it now.

115
00:07:41.472 --> 00:07:43.130
Do I need to restart my server?

116
00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.247
I just changed the CSS file.

117
00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:53.173
No, I didn't change the server,
just the asset.

118
00:07:53.173 --> 00:08:00.980
So if I refresh, you can see that I
have commonly known is semi-transparent.

119
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.790
So it's applying the the class.

120
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.719
So that's another way you
have to to change the styles,

121
00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:09.398
in this case with an if.

122
00:08:09.398 --> 00:08:13.926
So far we have a working
server-side application, but

123
00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:18.274
I wanna highlight something
that you might not like.

124
00:08:18.274 --> 00:08:22.659
I mean it's not a big deal,
it works, it's perfect, but

125
00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:28.028
if you see here at the class declaration
there are some spaces before and

126
00:08:28.028 --> 00:08:33.779
after the class name which when we go to
the template can we like change that?

127
00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:39.007
Well, I could remove those spaces
from here which is okay maybe

128
00:08:39.007 --> 00:08:44.333
those where the spaces if I,
first I've changed the template,

129
00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:47.508
do I need to restart the server or not?

130
00:08:47.508 --> 00:08:51.081
That's not so
clear as the previous question.

131
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.440
Let's see, if I refresh, now it worked.

132
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.522
I don't have those spaces.

133
00:08:56.522 --> 00:09:00.920
So the answer is no,
I don't need to restart the server,

134
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.699
the template, but is been accessed
at every time you need it.

135
00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:09.507
So if you change the template,
the server will know that.

136
00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:10.621
Anyway, it worked.

137
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:18.456
But yeah, it's kind of I like those
spaces to make the code clearer, right?

138
00:09:18.456 --> 00:09:23.546
So sometimes you wanna make
that you don't want everything

139
00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:30.593
to be like within the expressions but I
don't want that space in the final output.

140
00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:32.370
Well, to solve that,

141
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:38.181
we have a special syntax is a trimming
syntax over the double curly brace.

142
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:45.068
It's just a hyphen that you can add
on each side of the declaration.

143
00:09:45.068 --> 00:09:49.758
Like this, in this case,
it's saying that it should

144
00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:54.145
remove spaces after or
before that declaration.

145
00:09:54.145 --> 00:09:55.224
Just that.

146
00:09:55.224 --> 00:09:57.127
So then I can keep a lot of spaces here.

147
00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:02.278
Even I can send enters as well,
like new line.

148
00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:03.597
So if I refresh now,

149
00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:08.108
I don't have any space in the class but
I still have them in my template
