00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.704
So, to summarize the Visibility part.

2
00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:07.304
So, what we write in
a module in a package,

3
00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.980
if it's camelCase, camelCase,
it starts with lowercase.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.671
So lower case c, it means it's
private to the package for example.

5
00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:24.840
If it's TitleCase,
it's public and exported, right?

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.270
So, variables and lambda functions,
lambda functions, what's that?

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.770
Gimmie a sec.

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.830
They can be module scoped,
function scoped, or block scoped.

9
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.959
Something that we already mentioned.

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.650
So, lambda functions are just functions.

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.544
Sometimes we name the functions as we
did so far, such as the main functions,

12
00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:52.010
and also we have a way to treat
functions as a special kind of variable.

13
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.211
So maybe we can create a function that
has no name, but we can attach a link

14
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:04.360
to the function that's a variable,
that's kind of a function anyway.

15
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.550
So for example, here, notExported,
it's private to the package.

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.230
It can only be used in the package.

17
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.968
Remember, that means it can be used
from other go files in the same package,

18
00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.220
but not from other packages.

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.110
And if it's TitleCase, it's public and
exported to other packages.

20
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.868
That's the only thing
you need to remember.

21
00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:28.455
Simple, right?
