00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.662
My name is Maximiliano, Firtman.

2
00:00:01.662 --> 00:00:04.370
So let me go quickly about what I'm doing.

3
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.062
So I've been a web developer for
a while now, from 1996, okay?

4
00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:12.756
And then, of course,
we didn't have JavaScript at the time,

5
00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:14.790
then I have the JavaScript.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.644
But before that, I started doing
a backend with different languages.

7
00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:23.306
I have even created scripts with Perl,
in case you have even

8
00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:28.169
heard about that,
before getting into ASP, with VBScript.

9
00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.760
And then PHP and ASP.NET,
Node.js lately and,

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.360
of course,
a lot of other server side languages.

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.626
I have started working with Go, around
four to five years ago to some projects.

12
00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.920
So I have a mix of projects
in different languages.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.810
So I'm a frequent author on books and
courses.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.622
Here at Frontend Masters,

15
00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:58.979
you will find lots of courses on mobile
app developments with Kotlin, Flutter,

16
00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.060
and also on JavaScript and things
around web development, PWA and APIs.

17
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.191
And I'm from Argentina.

18
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.670
I actually came from Buenos Aires.

19
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.340
I live there in Buenos Aires,
so I'm a frequent traveler.

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.855
So I've been to 73 countries for
work, okay?

21
00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:17.500
And I'm FIRT on Twitter.

22
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.930
So that's introduction, really quick.

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.255
So we are going to cover what's Go and
also why Go.

24
00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:28.639
So why are we talking about Go,
why are you here today?

25
00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:34.310
So better we just say what's Go,
why Go is important today?

26
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.046
Then the fundamental, so
we'll get into the fundamentals.

27
00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:39.620
This is a basic course on Go.

28
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.900
So we will start from
scratch with the syntax.

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.040
So let me tell you good news and
bad news around Go's fundamentals.

30
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.133
So the good news is that
it's pretty simple.

31
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.140
It's actually pretty simple.

32
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.581
The language is pretty simple.

33
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.190
And the bad news is that
it's pretty simple.

34
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.074
So when you think about, okay,
how am I going to create?

35
00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:05.889
When you're coming from other languages,
mainly, you're expecting more.

36
00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:12.588
But that bad news, we will convert those
bad news in actually good news anyway.

37
00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:14.820
But it's a very simple language.

38
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050
We're going to get into
the standard libraries.

39
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.460
The standard libraries are actually
built-in libraries with the language.

40
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.529
So we don't need to
actually download more,

41
00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.359
a lot of packages for
just what we use on a daily basis.

42
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.579
We will talk about Go routines and
concurrency in Go, so how that works.

43
00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.690
That's pretty cool.

44
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.190
Then we will get deeper with some
packages such as format, HTTP.

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.333
So we are going to consume
data from the web.

46
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:53.305
We are going to see how to get information
from an API, how to parse the JSON,

47
00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:55.182
how to manipulate the data.

48
00:02:55.182 --> 00:03:00.610
And also how to create web servers and
web services, and templating.

49
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.034
So for those of you that were
using a template system before,

50
00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:07.650
we're going to see how that works.

51
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.511
So how you can mix, for example, HTML with
Go in the middle, something like that,

52
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:15.250
okay, for serving files server side.

53
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.330
So prerequisites,
you will need to download Go.

54
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.944
I will give you the instructions,
but it's pretty simple.

55
00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:25.642
You go to go.dev, that's the website,

56
00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:28.875
and download Go for your OS.

57
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.630
We will get there anyway.

58
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.500
And we are going to use Visual Studio Code
with some tools that I will

59
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.430
show you in a minute.

60
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.163
There is a URL there on GitHub,
GitHub.com/firtman/go-fundamentals,

61
00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:45.480
where you will find a copy
of what we're going to type.

62
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.098
Actually, you don't need to actually
get it or clone it for the workshop.

63
00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:52.584
We are going to code
everything from scratch.
