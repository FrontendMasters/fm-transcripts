1
00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:05.113
So the website today,
let me get out of the slides for a minute,

2
00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:08.573
it's not Golang anymore, it's go.dev.

3
00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:14.154
So around six, seven years ago,
Google has acquired

4
00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:20.368
the generic top-level domain
gtld.dev that you can buy.

5
00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:23.786
In fact,
my personal website is also third.dev so

6
00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:26.254
you can actually buy a .dev domain.

7
00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.422
A lot of languages and frameworks,

8
00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:34.181
they moved their .com or
.org websites into .dev.

9
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.847
When that happened,
we lost the lang on Go.

10
00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:43.407
So five years ago, around five years ago,
now we have go.dev,

11
00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:46.786
we don't need to actually
use Golang anymore,

12
00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:50.599
even if you're making
searches about the language.

13
00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:54.960
So I mean if you try even to,
Use ChatGTP or Google Bard to ask

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.844
questions about Go there is no
problem with that, when you say Go,

15
00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:05.193
it knows what you're talking about not,
it's not the old Go language.

16
00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:05.868
Okay, makes sense?

17
00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:12.545
So now we know that the website is go.dev
here you will find all the documentation.

18
00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.353
So let me go quickly about
some important things.

19
00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:18.407
The documentation, I can say,

20
00:01:18.407 --> 00:01:23.168
it has three important
sections on the dark side.

21
00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:29.100
So when you go to docs there we have
effective Go that I think is pretty cool,

22
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.785
effective Go and my job and
that in the new tab.

23
00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:36.805
It's a way that you have you can
start with introduction, okay, and

24
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.480
it has all the information.

25
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.630
It's well written as
some kind of fun ebook.

26
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.845
I think it's good.

27
00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.576
So if you try that it's good.

28
00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:50.866
The user manual, on the other hand,
is kind of mean that's a personal opinion.

29
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:55.768
But sometimes it's not really well
written or is really techie, or

30
00:01:55.768 --> 00:02:00.326
too geeky to actually if you're
not actually part of the team,

31
00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:05.841
writing the language, you're done,
get exactly what's going on there.

32
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:11.287
And then the standard libraries is okay,
I mean, can be better, but it's okay.

33
00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:16.990
We will actually list all the,
I don't wanna say technical terms yet,

34
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.997
but let's say for
now all the objects available.

35
00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:24.932
It's a wrong term, but anyway all
the abilities available in Go and

36
00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:29.006
all the functions, properties and
methods that we have on each part so

37
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:30.885
you get each standard library.

38
00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:35.979
You can pick the library for example and
increase the font size a little bit,

39
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:41.401
we have a library for manipulating HTML,
for example for the operating system.

40
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.879
And when you get there,
you have an overview, and

41
00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.717
you have the list of variables,
functions, and types.

42
00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:48.402
So this is complete.

43
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:51.244
So it's good.

44
00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:54.650
But when you're learning,
for the first time,

45
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.733
it's kind of overwhelming if
you actually get into that.

46
00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:03.761
That's why we have on the Learn
curve of the website, here you can

47
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:09.628
download the latest version of Go,
by the way you can start downloading it.

48
00:03:09.628 --> 00:03:14.098
When you go to download,
you can download the one for your version.

49
00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:19.239
Have in mind if you are on a Mac,
be careful to pick the right one,

50
00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.381
so it can be the old Intel Max,
if you have a, let's not say old,

51
00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:28.762
but the previous MacBook,
MacBook villa or Mac Mini,

52
00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:32.024
if it's Intel, you download this one.

53
00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:35.730
If you're having the Apple chip,
the M1 or M2,

54
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.915
you need to download the ARM 64 version.

55
00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:40.568
If not, it's not gonna work.

56
00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:45.385
So if you download the Intel,
even if Apple has a compatibility layer

57
00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:50.036
that will actually run Intel app for
Go because it's a compiler and

58
00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:54.705
this is some special things from the US,
it won't work properly.

59
00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:56.673
So you need to download the other one.

60
00:03:56.673 --> 00:04:01.149
Okay, well Linux and
Windows are the ones you have here.

61
00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.886
And the latest version that
we have today is 1.20.

62
00:04:04.886 --> 00:04:09.981
We'll talk about versions in
a minute in terms of stability and

63
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:14.991
how frequent do we get updates and
if that's a problem or not.

64
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:16.104
So we will get there.

65
00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:18.133
But I wanna go back to Learn.

66
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.573
When you get into Learn I
wanna emphasize this section,

67
00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:25.758
I think it's pretty cool for
those of you learning Go from scratch.

68
00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:30.402
Of course we are here today doing
this workshop during this course so

69
00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:33.253
you don't need to go
over the tour of go but

70
00:04:33.253 --> 00:04:37.008
if you wanna play with that later,
you can take a tour.

71
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:41.789
Actually, it's a step-by-step
process with an online

72
00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.210
text editor where you can play with this.

73
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.160
So you can change that.

74
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.791
And you can run it locally
without downloading anything.

75
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:56.201
So actually,
this is using a cloud compiler.

76
00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:00.888
But anyway for learning the basics,
and also you have a menu so

77
00:05:00.888 --> 00:05:05.321
you can go directly to talking
about generics or structs.

78
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:07.277
We don't know what those are yet.

79
00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:11.487
But then we see the code and
we can try, we can change.

80
00:05:11.487 --> 00:05:13.353
You can edit the code so
you can play with it.

81
00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:14.684
It's a playground.

82
00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:21.116
So, it's actually pretty cool and
it's well organized, and it Go wise.

83
00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:26.182
Probably 100% of the language
because as I mentioned before,

84
00:05:26.182 --> 00:05:28.179
Go is it simple language.

85
00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:31.230
It's small compared with other languages.

86
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.546
Okay, so
the three of go I think it's pretty cool.

87
00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:38.449
It's a good idea for those of you
to Go over the whole door after

88
00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.367
after the course to see if you
got all the ideas, for example.

89
00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:45.471
Okay, make sense?

90
00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:50.906
Finally, you have the full documentation,
that's the one that, yeah,

91
00:05:50.906 --> 00:05:56.876
I mean, there are tutorials, but sometimes
I feel that's my personal opinion.

92
00:05:56.876 --> 00:05:58.933
They can improve how it's written.

93
00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:03.433
So if you're new to Go,
if you're new to the ecosystem, or

94
00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:08.474
even if you're not yet
working in the development space, it might

95
00:06:08.474 --> 00:06:14.431
be still weird to read some of those
articles, because they're really hard.

96
00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:18.771
They're talking to someone
with lot of experience, okay?

97
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.040
So, but the tour of Go is, is cool,
so go ahead with that one.
