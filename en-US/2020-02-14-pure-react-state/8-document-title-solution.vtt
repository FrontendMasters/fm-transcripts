00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, so
our mission is to set the document title.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.580
Let's do this in the kind of like
simplest possible way first.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.830
And then we'll kinda look at how
we could refactor a little bit.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.536
So I could say something along
the lines of document.title.

5
00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:19.514
I'll just use, let's say,

6
00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:24.899
Count is this.state.count.

7
00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:29.916
All right, so let's try it out [SOUND].

8
00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:35.616
You see it's count 15.

9
00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:39.580
If I reset it, It goes up with increment.

10
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.320
Now, if we wanna do it for

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.710
all three, we don't wanna write
the same function three times.

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.680
What we probably want to do is
figure out a way to abstract this.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.620
So, I think I alluded to it before, right?

14
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.428
We could do something like,

15
00:00:56.428 --> 00:01:02.614
update, UpdateDocumentTitle.

16
00:01:07.548 --> 00:01:10.131
Equals this.

17
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.352
Yep, state.count.

18
00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:17.109
We'll have to do the same
thing we did up here,

19
00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:25.910
which we'll do this.updateDocumentTitle,
Bind(this).

20
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.582
Great, and now we'll just put
that in all three places.

21
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.530
Once.

22
00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:49.229
So this was so using the object notation,
but that is totally fine, it will work

23
00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.558
either way, we don't have to do
the other just to update document title,

24
00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.359
We'll flip back over.

25
00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:09.784
And it's changing along with the,
I didn't do the count this time,

26
00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:11.309
it was just the row number.

27
00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.797
Because it's changing as I incremented
as I decrement in both cases.

28
00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:20.236
All right, so that concludes kind
of all of the different kinda

29
00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:23.941
kicking at the tires of
the API of the state.

30
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:28.039
You can now also put that on your resume
as well, that is not, I don't know,

31
00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.552
if that's really gonna
rake in the big bucks.

32
00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:34.057
But you never know, it's worth it.

33
00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:37.550
So, let's talk a little bit more
just some patterns around state.

34
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.610
And then we're gonna dive into how
it differs from hooks a little bit.
