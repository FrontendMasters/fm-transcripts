00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.460
So your job is to change
this a little bit.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.600
I will save this code and I will push
it up, so you can kind of refactor it.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.040
What I want you to do is,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.120

document title with JavaScript.

You can say something along the lines of

the state has changed in increment,

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.710

update the document title as well.
