00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.029
What I want us to do for

2
00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:04.133
this exercise is we've set
the document title use a useEffect.

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:09.331
What we'll do in this case is we're also
now going to set local storage as well,

4
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:09.884
right?

5
00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.124
And there'll be a few things here.

6
00:00:11.124 --> 00:00:14.974
One, is that we can just register a second
effect and without having to have a second

7
00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:18.387
method and the callback, which will be
nice and we just do it in one place.

8
00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:22.040
So what we wanna do is we are gonna need
to kinda refactor this code slightly,

9
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.996
we are storing the full object in there.

10
00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:27.966
Which means we could do something along
the lines of changing this for count.

11
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.109
In this case we'll change this to
count and store as an object as well.

12
00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.429
So you're gonna that from state
as initial value, you're going to

13
00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.620
use useEffect to store it, and
then we'll take a look at it together.
