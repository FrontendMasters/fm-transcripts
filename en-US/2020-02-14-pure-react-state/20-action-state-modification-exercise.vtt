00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
What I'd love for you to do,
is try to now dispatch

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.756
an action when the forgiven
checkbox has been checked.

3
00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:13.720
Right, so what's Forgiveness to
actually doing the state management,

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.820
to just announcing, hey,
forgiveness has been issued.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.580
We have issued a pardon for whoever parts
too close to me in the parking lot.

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.250
It's not really that person's fault,
it's the parking lot spaces,

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.250
it's not important.

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.500
We're gonna issue
forgiveness to that person.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.080
We'll basically,
instead of actually doing it all in there,

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.360
we want to move it up into the reducer,
and we want to just say that it happened.

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.620
So we added the ability add a grudge,
all right?

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.680
It would be great if we could also forgive
the graduates and notice that like

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.390
I took on adding the graduate level
to you to deal with forgiveness.

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.890
I am a small person and
you're all better than me.

15
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.460
And so, what we wanna do is in
the same way that we refactored

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.340
addGrudge to instead of dealing
with the fact that grudge changed

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.610
to simply announce that it happened, and
take this entirely very easily testable,

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.900
JavaScript function,
to deal with what that means.

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.980
I would implore you to do the same.

20
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.830
Right, we'll get the idea in here,
to do the same, to say, okay,

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.650
a grudge has been forgiven, your job is
to dispatch that announcement, right?

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.870
And then in the reducer,
which receives announcements like okay,

23
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.590
if this is an announcement that a grudge
has been forgiven, go ahead and

24
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460
we're gonna manage our
state appropriately, right?

25
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.621
And some of the inspiration of how to do
this can be found right in here as well,

26
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:37.267
like you'll have to do
a little bit of change, right?

27
00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.770
Here we call it state,
which we have it and we rename grudges,

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.430
if you want, there's reasons why
we might not want to later on.

29
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.460
The same basic idea,
just pull that through as well.
