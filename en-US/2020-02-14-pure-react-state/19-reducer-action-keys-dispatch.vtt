00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
Now one thing that you will see is,
and you don't have to do this,

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.941
you live your own life,
you might see something like this.

3
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:08.133
const GRUDGE_ADD.

4
00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:14.784
GRUDGE_ADD, and then the other thing
we can do is we can FORGIVE, right?

5
00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.096
Why do we do this?

6
00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:27.258
To be clear,
could you just use a string everywhere?

7
00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:32.309
You could, and when you make a typo,
you will get no error.

8
00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.784
And then you will lose your morning again,
and

9
00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.332
I don't want you to lose your morning,
right?

10
00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:41.577
If you misspell the constant, everything
will explode and you'll get a line number

11
00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:45.489
where you misspelled the constant and
you'll move on with your day, right?

12
00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.609
And that is way better
than sitting there and

13
00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.328
trying to figure out where
you mistyped something.

14
00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:54.502
So you can avoid this part,
you can ignore it if you want.

15
00:00:54.502 --> 00:00:57.970
If it stresses you out,
you don't need to do it, but it is there.

16
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.181
Especially if you find yourself live
coding in front of people on recording,

17
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:06.651
you probably wanna do things that don't
get you weird errors where you don't have

18
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:07.586
error message.

19
00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:12.880
So, now we have this idea
of adding a grudge, right?

20
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.182
When you need to announce that
something has happened, right?

21
00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:18.256
We're not gonna do the state
management any more in here.

22
00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:21.992
We're just gonna say, hey,
they've submitted a new grudge.

23
00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:27.080
I would love to announce it to the world
that they have submitted a new grudge.

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.390
They have forgiven one?

25
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.934
I loved to announce to the reducer
that this has happened.

26
00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:37.609
So now all we do in this case,
Is when a grudge has been added,

27
00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.963
right, we'll say, The only requirement for

28
00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:46.930
an action, And this is actually
isn't even true in userReducer, but

29
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.697
let's make believe it's true,
is that it's some kind of object and

30
00:01:49.697 --> 00:01:54.396
that it has a type,, Right,

31
00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:58.189
Redux will actually tell you,
this won't, but let's pretend.

32
00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.642
Now everything beyond that is up to you.

33
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.323
I have recommendations.

34
00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:05.120
There's this thing called
the flux standard action,

35
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.014
which is just a convention, right?

36
00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:11.960
It says that you basically only
have a few top-level keys, right?

37
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.707
type, this one that says payload.

38
00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:20.616
There's another one that I've never use.

39
00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:22.470
We use this in our applications, meta.

40
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.013
I think you can do error is true or false.

41
00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:27.973
To be honest, we don't use these.

42
00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:29.152
But everything is type, and

43
00:02:29.152 --> 00:02:31.520
then all the other data about
the action goes in payload.

44
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.693
Otherwise it's like,
what keys are there on the object, right?

45
00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:38.054
It's just a way to kind of namespace it.

46
00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:39.970
The only requirement is
as an actual object.

47
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.200
It doesn't actually matter.

48
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.744
But this is a very sane way of doing it.

49
00:02:43.744 --> 00:02:47.156
And without a convention,
if you have a big enough team,

50
00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:51.505
people make up seven conventions and
then nothing makes sense anymore.

51
00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.359
So just having some convention
is better than anything else.

52
00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.648
So we'll say that the payload in this
case is the, we'll just destructure this.

53
00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:03.725
We'll say, person, reason.

54
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.191
Person, reason, and we'll also say
that a definition has got a forgiven.

55
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.061
If we're adding into the list,

56
00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:17.186
I thin it makes sense that
they start out unforgiven.

57
00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:24.401
And we'll give it that, Right,
all that id() function does,

58
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.990
I'm importing that up here,
is it gives me a unique id, right?

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.851
If you had a server, the server
would probably give it an id, but

60
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.291
I don't have a server just yet.

61
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:40.683
So all that happens is now,
this add_grudge function,

62
00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:43.985
all it does is dispatch some information.

63
00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:47.284
Like, hey, a grudge has been added, right?

64
00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:50.422
And this is the information about it,
right?

65
00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:55.408
And then what we can do is we can go
in here and say, all right, reducer,

66
00:03:55.408 --> 00:03:58.740
you're being called into action.

67
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:07.075
We'll say, If the action.type,
Is GRUDGE_ADD.

68
00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:11.088
No, that's not a thing.

69
00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:14.158
Then do effectively what we did before,
right?

70
00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:20.648
We'll say, return, It's called state,
we can call it grudges.

71
00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:24.147
Right, they're the same thing,
right, it's an array either way.

72
00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:32.624
So return everything else in there,
Along with the, action_payload.

73
00:04:32.624 --> 00:04:34.744
That should do the trick.

74
00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:37.397
We got this extra comma,
that can't go well.

75
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:41.297
All right so put the new payload in there,
which is, again, the person, reason,

76
00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:43.384
whether or not they're forgiven, right?

77
00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:48.278
The individual grudge, and
the rest of the Grudges, right?

78
00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:50.988
It's very similar to what we had before,
right?

79
00:04:50.988 --> 00:04:54.966
So now we can separate the, how do you
manage to state versus the thing happened?

80
00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:00.311
Awesome, let's see if that works.

81
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.949
Right, hello world is
added in there as well.

82
00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.680
Forgiveness is not gonna work
because we commented that out.
