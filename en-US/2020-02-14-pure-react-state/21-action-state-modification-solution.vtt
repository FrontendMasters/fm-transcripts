00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.970
Right, so I'm gonna do it.

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.200
And what I'm gonna do first is,
steal the actual kind of mechanics here.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.193
So I'll grab this grudges, and

4
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:18.605
we'll say if action.type
*** GRUDGE_FORGIVE.

5
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.685
Then what we're gonna wanna do,

6
00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:30.790
is not get too carried away with
the commenting on commenting of the code.

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.800
We'll change this to state.

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.760
But really,
we just want to return this new array.

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.280
So, you'll notice the actions,
every action flows to the reducer.

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.740
We're just caring about certain ones.

11
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.130
If it's a grudge ad here's what we do.

12
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.520
If it's a grudge to give,
here is what we do.

13
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.400
And I prefer if statements that return,

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.530
you might also see case
in switch statements.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.100
I don't like them.

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.830
I think this is just easier to kind of
like reactor later on and break stuff out,

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.680
rather than having the middle
part of us which statement.

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.545
So I'll put that in there as well.

19
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:10.765
So there we've got the mechanics and

20
00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:14.855
now we replace this with dispatch.

21
00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:21.191
And we'll say that the type is, we have to
change something else up there as well.

22
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.623
Type is GRUDGE_FORGIVE, and

23
00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:29.640
then the payload will be
an object to that ID.

24
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
And so that is one change before
we're just doing it with the ID.

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.888
Now it's gonna be action.payload.id.

26
00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:37.714
So go back and fix that as well.

27
00:01:41.012 --> 00:01:47.176
Great, let's verify that, that works.

28
00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:49.816
Everything works.

29
00:01:49.816 --> 00:01:52.710
Now you know we still
defending all the place.

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.200
Now, if you think about it before,

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.630
like grudges are the only
thing that are changing.

32
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.880
It'd be great in some cases for
instance, the individual grudge.

33
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.740
If it got a new grudge, yeah, re-render.

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.300
But just for the dispatch part,
that should be fine.

35
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540
A new grudge,
it's only getting an action, or

36
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.980
it's only getting
a function that adds one.

37
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.320
It's not re-rendering just
cuz someone hit forgive.

38
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.940
But it is rendering, but it shouldn't.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.620
And dispatch is very much like use ref,
in so

40
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.480
far that it is the same
reference function every time.

41
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.250
That dispatch function has the same
memory reference on every render.

42
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.660
Which means it'll be the same one.
