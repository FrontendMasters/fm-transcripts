1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.380
One of the things that we get from
kinda having reducers allows it,

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.040
we saw that we could, effectively create
an abstraction over to listen for

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.680
actions and
then dispatch later things right.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.220
We can also start to do more complicated
state management patterns with a reducer,

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.180
that we could ever do with use state.

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.080
And so one of them is, if we wanted to
implement effectively what we might call

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.310
time travelling,
the ability to undo and redo.

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.710
And effectively,
it's just going to be two stacks, right?

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.940
The hardest part of all of this
will be understanding time travel.

10
00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:46.800
And so the time of this recording, it's
been seven months since Avengers Endgame

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.280
came out, so I will be following
the time traveling rules of Endgame.

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.600
Spoiler alert,

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.270
this time traveling in Endgame, also
Darth Vader's Luke Skywalker's father.

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.640
Bomber, right?

15
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.670
So we are going to follow the the timeline
which is you can go back in time, but

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.270
if you make any changes that branches
off into a new time line, okay?

17
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.850
Again, the hardest parts of
this will unfortunately be

18
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.930
just wrapping your head
around time travel.

19
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.480
I am like, DM me on Twitter.

20
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.340
I'm happy to talk about this way more
than you're comfortable with, so

21
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.800
we can figure it out.

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.480
So we are following Avengers Endgame
time traveling rules.

23
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.240
And we'll get into the code, but
at the end of the day, we're simply gonna,

24
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.480
instead of having that list of grudges,
right?

25
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.780
What we're gonna do is, we're gonna have
the list of grudges, we are also going to

26
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.160
keep track of all previous states, right,
cuz we're always dispatching an action.

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.910
We're not necessarily setting the state by
hand like we were doing with used state,

28
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.010
we're announcing that a thing happened,
right?

29
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.713
And so when we announce that
a thing happened with dispatch,

30
00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:57.052
what we're gonna do is, we're gonna
take the present state of the world,

31
00:01:57.052 --> 00:02:00.060
we're gonna put it on to
an array of all previous states.

32
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.660
Then we're going to create the new state
of the world in our reducer, all right?

33
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.580
And use that.

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.415
If someone says undo, we take the present,

35
00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:11.540
we move it into the future,
because it's now a new future.

36
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.120
And we take the most recent past,
we move it to the present.

37
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.190
If they do something from the past and
that creates a new branch of the future.

38
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.250
Again, Avengers Endgame rules.

39
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.070
Like we can get real
complicated with this and

40
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.350
then you end up as your own grandfather.

41
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.722
It's not interesting.

42
00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:28.830
So we'll have a past,
a present and a future.

43
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.480
Past and future are arrays,
present is the present state of the world.

44
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.020
Basically present is what we
currently have in our reducer.

45
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.520
And we'll just keep track of past and
present states of the world.

46
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.658
All right, so go back into grudge bin,
or grudge list, or

47
00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:45.388
whatever I'm calling it these days.

48
00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:51.980
And we'll see that we can just start
to refactor this a little bit.

49
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.093
And we'll start as our
kind of our initial state.

50
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.141
All right,
our initial state is gonna change,

51
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.485
instead of this one that we pass and
we'll take the one that happens.

52
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:09.180
And we go into the grudge context,
you can see that the one we pass in here.

53
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.470
Where is that user?

54
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.140
There it is.

55
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.900
This initial state.

56
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.830
We're going to take the dummy
data that we have, but

57
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.620
that's only the present initial state.

58
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.670
That is not all previous timelines.

59
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.084
So what we'll do is we'll say,
I don't know, we'll call it defaultState.

60
00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.539
And that will be past.

61
00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:37.631
The present is gonna be that initialState.

62
00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:44.883
And then the future is a series of,
yeah, future states,

63
00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:47.580
assuming we don't mess with the timeline.

64
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.560
Feel very strongly about this.

65
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.310
And will pass it in there, cool.

66
00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.030
So now we've got,
our reducer's effectively broken, right?

67
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.600
Because state is now state.present, Right?

68
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.750
So we need to fix that.

69
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.870
And to be really clear,

70
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.870
I've done this enough times to know that
as I am live coding, I will mess up.

71
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.600
So if you see like,
didn't he forget a dot present?

72
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.937
He did, just tell him, right?

73
00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:19.910
[LAUGH] It's not that he's got some
crazy thing that he's about to do.

74
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.960
He made a boo boo [LAUGH] right?

75
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.504
Cool, so we'll start out by
just we've got the state,

76
00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:32.760
we'll just give it a default state again.

77
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.010
So now the action type is GRUDGE.ADD,
we need to return.

78
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.658
We'll start out just by saying
cut that and we'll say present.

79
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:50.592
And this will be state.present.

80
00:04:50.592 --> 00:04:53.260
So we're just kind of realizing
it's gone one layer deeper, right?

81
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.880
All the previous what we thought about is
the only only timeline is now present.

82
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.667
And then here we'll say state.

83
00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:05.517
I'm actually just gonna pull this out
to make it a little bit cleaner for us.

84
00:05:05.517 --> 00:05:06.499
I'll say.

85
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.030
Const newPresent.

86
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.204
We'll say, state.present.map and

87
00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:18.030
then we'll return.

88
00:05:22.984 --> 00:05:27.551
Past, present is that newPresent

89
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:37.258
future Is an array.

90
00:05:37.258 --> 00:05:42.120
And then finally,
getting the actual component.

91
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.469
This is gonna be the full state and
the grudges.

92
00:05:49.668 --> 00:05:50.401
Actually it's gonna be.

93
00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:01.310
Grudges will be state.present.

94
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.950
All right,
let's see if I broke anything, shall we?

95
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.677
Let's actually make sure that's spun up.

96
00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:19.525
All right, they load, I can forgive.

97
00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.213
I can say hello to Word.

98
00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:30.690
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Live-using

99
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.730
an app that you've coded
is also fraught with peril.

100
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.720
Cuz basically,
we've just moved everything down, right?

101
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.700
We haven't actually
implemented any of this yet.

102
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.592
Here, we can also say, let's go ahead and

103
00:06:43.592 --> 00:06:45.750
do the same pattern that we did before,
here.

104
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.388
We'll actually pull this
out to const newPresent.

105
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:10.916
And we'll say, past.

106
00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:15.443
So sorry, we'll implement
the time traveling in a second.

107
00:07:15.443 --> 00:07:18.318
Maybe we'll even include a comma.

108
00:07:25.136 --> 00:07:26.310
Cool, everything still works.

109
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.410
We don't have any time traveling yet.

110
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.030
We've just made everything
slightly more complicated.

111
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.266
So that's cool.

112
00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:38.320
All right, so we're almost all
of the way there, strangely.

113
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.060
All we need to do now is whenever
the present changes, we need to

114
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.050
add what was the present
to the list of past worlds.

115
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.550
So we can do that.

116
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.632
And we'll say, so
we've got the new present.

117
00:07:53.632 --> 00:07:56.680
We'll just say that the past is
anything that was in the past,

118
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.840
cuz there could be stuff in there.

119
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.226
But before that, we'll say.

120
00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:05.956
State.present, so
the past is now what was the present and

121
00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:07.960
anything that was already in the past.

122
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.810
There's some Kylo Ren quote in there.

123
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.112
We'll do the same thing here, as well.

124
00:08:22.227 --> 00:08:24.670
Cool, so I'll have that.

125
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:33.020
Now, we probably love to have some way
to actually go into the past, right?

126
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.929
So we'll do that and

127
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:42.440
we'll create

128
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.740
another one here called, just an action
creator and this is a really simple one.

129
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.240
And it will be.

130
00:08:59.002 --> 00:09:06.180
A function that's just gonna dispatch
an action of the type, UNDO.

131
00:09:09.771 --> 00:09:11.057
I will parse that in as well.

132
00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:18.600
And we're using use Callback here,
just to not create a brand new one.

133
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.020
But if you're asking,
I should do that, right?

134
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.160
We could just be a function too.

135
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.080
This would make a new function every time.

136
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.320
I'm mostly doing it to keep it in my, we
know that the contacts API broke most of

137
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.460
our caching, but I'm using it just for
consistency at this point.

138
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.125
But all it does is dispatch
this type of undo.

139
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:39.170
Now, it's just conditional
logic in the reducer.

140
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.480
So if you can dispatch any
kinda action you want and

141
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.980
if the reducer doesn't know about it,
it'll just flow through, right?

142
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.365
So we'll put that in there and
then in application.

143
00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:55.438
Or actually, let's do it in.

144
00:09:55.438 --> 00:09:58.018
Yeah, we'll do it here.

145
00:09:58.018 --> 00:09:59.207
We'll say.

146
00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:05.600
We'll undo and then we probably.

147
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.100
Let's actually also just
parse in all of the state,

148
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.680
in this case,
just to keep it simple for ourselves.

149
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.740
We could refactor later.

150
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.670
We probably won't, but we could.

151
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.710
So we're back into GrudgeContext.

152
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.787
I'm also gonna, you have the grudges.

153
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.401
Which is now gonna be grudges is.

154
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:27.506
We just make it, grudges is going
to be state.present by the way.

155
00:10:31.308 --> 00:10:32.714
So grudges.

156
00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:36.499
Got undo.

157
00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:43.111
Cool.

158
00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:59.750
Feel like we have a problem cuz I feel
like it shouldn't work right now.

159
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.340
So we've got a grudge in the present.

160
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.710
I also wanna know,
is there a past at all, right?

161
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:10.190
Because basically we just wanna disable
the undo button if there's no past to undo

162
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.510
and is there a future.

163
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.150
So we could say something
like const isPast and

164
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:22.200
that will be state.past.length.

165
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.140
And really if it is zero than it is false,
right?

166
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.503
If there's nothing in the past, then we
don't want it and if there is something,

167
00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:33.010
then we do.

168
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.710
So if there is a past,
just turn that into a Boolean.

169
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.061
Then const is future.

170
00:11:49.136 --> 00:11:52.606
Cool, so we've got those in place as well.

171
00:11:56.517 --> 00:11:58.666
Cuz we want disable to be true,

172
00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:03.310
it might make sense to do the opposite
here, so we'll say no past.

173
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.220
That feels weird, we'll flip it in.

174
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.260
It feels not semantic.

175
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.900
So we'll pass those into
the context as well.

176
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.930
We'll pass in that undo action.

177
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.489
We'll say is past, or
we'll code is there a past, but we didn't.

178
00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:20.410
So is there a past and is there a future?

179
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:27.452
And application, I'm just gonna put in
here for now to make sure it looks right.

180
00:12:27.452 --> 00:12:28.507
I'm gonna do like a.

181
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.357
Hold &gt; Undo and let's just check that out.

182
00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:40.131
It's a little gross, but it'll work.

183
00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:45.921
A little button called undo and
we'll have another one called redo.
