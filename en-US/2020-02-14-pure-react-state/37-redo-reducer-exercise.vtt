00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.430
I implemented the ability to add stuff
back to the past and shifted around.

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.543
Your mission is to then do the opposite,
right?

3
00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.059
When we have undone something we
wanna take the current present and

4
00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.704
move it to the list of futures.

5
00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.713
And when we want to redo,
we simply take the most recent future,

6
00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:19.730
make it the present.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.210
Take the present, and
make it the most recent past again.
