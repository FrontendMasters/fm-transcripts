1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.881
So the next step to finish our app is to
create the bottom bar navigation with some

2
00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:06.700
kind of tabs.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.870
So we can actually change sections.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.548
We can go from one page to one
section to another section, okay?

5
00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:16.589
We wanna do the menu page where we can
see all the coffees that we are selling,

6
00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:17.994
and then the orders page.

7
00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:21.519
So how to work with navigation bars?

8
00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.041
We need to go back to main now.

9
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:29.593
And by the way,
if you're following the companion website,

10
00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:33.752
we are now,
if I go in to the table of contents,

11
00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:38.372
we will do 3.3,
Setting up Bottom Navigation.

12
00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.417
And we're going to create the bottom bar,
that's what we're going to do.

13
00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:46.630
So actually, what we need to do is
to create into the scaffold option.

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.170
There is a scaffold widget here,
let me rearrange my windows.

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.696
We have a scaffold, the scaffold widget
represents actually some kind of

16
00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:01.350
an app user interface that has a top bar,
a bottom bar.

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.977
If you have many things that looks like
an app, that's the scaffold widget.

18
00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:09.773
The scaffold, which right now has an app
bar, that's actually the top bar and

19
00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:12.546
the body, but
they can have more arguments.

20
00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:17.382
And one of those arguments is
bottomNavigationBar, okay?

21
00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:20.829
And it can create a bottom navigation bar.

22
00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.576
That is another widget with many,
many properties,

23
00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:27.920
such as the items that I'm going to use,
okay?

24
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.184
That's like the first time, the first
thing that I wanna add there, okay?

25
00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:36.290
So what are the items that
I need to create there?

26
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.250
The item is an array.

27
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.380
An array of what?

28
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.790
An array of, let me create one so
we can actually create the other ones.

29
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.720
It's an array of BottomNavigationBarItem.

30
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.120
So it's an object that has the icon and
the name, okay, make sense?

31
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.204
So we are making the little icons that
will appear at the bottom in the tab,

32
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:01.610
okay, make sense?

33
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.590
So icons,
where should I get the icon from?

34
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.380
Of course, I can go and
create my own icon, like PNG or whatever.

35
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.357
But Flutter includes
automatically an icons gallery,

36
00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:22.924
it's a material icons gallery.

37
00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:30.160
And we can take the icon from Icons.,
and we have a large list of icons.

38
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.990
Of course, looking at the icons here is
kind of, okay, I don't see the icon, okay?

39
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.253
These icons are actually part
of the Material icons gallery.

40
00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:46.424
It's available at material.io/icons,

41
00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:50.475
and here you can search and look for

42
00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:54.535
all the icons in this collection.

43
00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:57.460
Okay, but if you want, you can use
your own icons, your own images.

44
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.451
So for example,
there is an icon for coffee.

45
00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:09.220
So I can create one material with the
Icons.coffee, and then can have a label.

46
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.620
It's actually the name that will be
with it, such as "Menu", okay, like so.

47
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.060
So we have one BottomNavigationBarItem,
it's complaining about the const as well.

48
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.780
So where, in the items, like so.

49
00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.840
So we have one BottomNavigationBarItem.

50
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.196
And the icons, what I'm missing is
that I need to wrap the name of

51
00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:44.773
the icon within an icon constructor,
there we are.

52
00:03:44.773 --> 00:03:48.008
So I need three items of this.

53
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:51.503
I'm going to jump to full screen for
a second, so

54
00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:54.157
we can actually see all the options.

55
00:03:54.157 --> 00:04:02.110
So I have three, Menu, Offers, and Order,
or My Order, however you wanna call that.

56
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.950
For Offers, we do have one called
local_offer, that's one icon.

57
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.190
I have already searched for icons,
so I already picked a couple.

58
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.642
And for here we can use shopping_cart,
there are a couple of shopping_cart,

59
00:04:14.642 --> 00:04:18.310
outline, rounded, sharp,
you pick the one you prefer, okay?

60
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.805
But something like this,
I think, will make the trick, so

61
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.991
that's my bottom navigation bar.

62
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.296
Remember, if you wanna
see these in new lines,

63
00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:32.529
the simplest way is to
add the trailing comma.

64
00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.185
You pick the one you prefer,

65
00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:39.320
if you wanna do like this, because here
we see the constructor in just one line.

66
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.028
Remember, this is an array of items.

67
00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:46.456
Okay, I can even add a trailing
comma here, so then I can go back.

68
00:04:46.456 --> 00:04:51.237
Right now it's not doing anything,
because there is an error here,

69
00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:54.131
because there is a missing parenthesis.

70
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:59.644
Let me balance this,
think this is closing the icon,

71
00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:04.925
and not closing the navigation bar,
there we are.

72
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:09.313
So now you can see it goes to
a new line because it doesn't fit.

73
00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:13.345
So the IDE is smart enough
when you do all the format.

74
00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:17.283
Because, I mean, the icon name is really
large, it doesn't fit in one line,

75
00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.267
it goes automatically to a second one.

76
00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:26.110
Every time you save, it's applying this
prettifier system, okay, make sense?

77
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.050
Any question at this point?

78
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.740
So let's see what happens within Chrome.

79
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.073
Look at the bottom, we have menus.

80
00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:44.699
So just by adding an array of icons,
the navigation bottom bar appears,

81
00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.937
it doesn't work, that's the problem.

82
00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:53.582
So it's not doing anything, okay?

83
00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:56.832
I mean, by default,
that's Material Design guidelines, okay?

84
00:05:56.832 --> 00:06:00.770
To use the primary color swatch for
the selector menu,

85
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.658
for the selector icon, that's
the same color as we have at the top.

86
00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:07.270
But if we want, we can change that.

87
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.471
So, in the bottom navigation,
apart from items,

88
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:14.005
we have more properties that we can set.

89
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:18.657
And we have backgroundColor,
we have a selectedItemColor.

90
00:06:18.657 --> 00:06:21.872
So we can change for
the backgroundColor, and

91
00:06:21.872 --> 00:06:26.332
say that we want the primary color
from our theme, for example.

92
00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:33.035
So we can take the primaryColor,
so now it looks like this.

93
00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.319
But now we need to change the foreground
color of the icons, okay?

94
00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.325
And we have two,
we have a selectedItemColor.

95
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.218
And I can use a yellow one.

96
00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:53.402
Remember we have several versions
of several shades of yellow,

97
00:06:53.402 --> 00:06:58.768
let's try 400, and unselectedItemColor.

98
00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:04.872
And I can take here from
one of the browns, like so.

99
00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:07.170
So now it looks better.

100
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.920
So we need to make that bottom bar to
work, right now it's doing nothing.

101
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.240
That's because we'd actually
need to do it manually, how?

102
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.916
The bottomNavigationBar
has two properties,

103
00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:23.579
the one property that will
let you know exactly,

104
00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:29.724
The current index, okay?

105
00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:34.001
That will tell you where we are, for
example, if I wanna be in offers,

106
00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:36.113
it's actually 1, 0, 1, 2.

107
00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:37.762
Let me do this so
we can actually see that.

108
00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:39.560
So now Offers is selected.

109
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.432
And then we have some events,
such as onTap.

110
00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:50.483
And also we have an event that is
actually much better than onTap,

111
00:07:50.483 --> 00:07:54.234
but with onTap, typically, it works.

112
00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:58.496
onTap will receive
the index as an argument.

113
00:07:58.496 --> 00:08:02.453
So with this in mind,
we have the currentIndex,

114
00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:09.640
we have the active tab index, and we have
an event that will give us the new index.

115
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.360
What we can do here?

116
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.326
What do you think that we can do
here to change the selected icon?

117
00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:26.084
Again, we have a variable here for
defining the current active tab.

118
00:08:26.084 --> 00:08:31.277
And also we have an event that
will give us the new index,

119
00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:33.939
we need an a state variable.

120
00:08:33.939 --> 00:08:39.278
Fortunately, by default,
the homepage was in a StatefulWidget.

121
00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:42.664
Because it's already in a StatefulWidget,
I can create a state variable.

122
00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:46.128
Remember, state variable is
a variable that I can change,

123
00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:48.720
I will trigger a rerender.

124
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.706
So within my state, remember the state
is this one, the private class,

125
00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:55.600
I can create the property.

126
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:04.824
selectedIndex, selectedTab, so I'm gonna
start with 0, with 1, it's up to me.

127
00:09:04.824 --> 00:09:11.850
And then, instead of 1,
I need to use that property, make sense?

128
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.457
What do I need to do in onTap?

129
00:09:14.457 --> 00:09:21.028
Should I directly change the property,
Like so?

130
00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:25.127
Let's see, I'm changing and
nothing happens.

131
00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:26.278
Does anyone know why?

132
00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:30.897
I'm changing the state.

133
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.544
But there was one rule for
changing the state,

134
00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:43.408
that change must happen
within a set a state call.

135
00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:50.250
If not, it will change the variable,
but it's not going to reveal the tree.

136
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.950
So it's not going to reveal the UI,
so I need to call setState.

137
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.160
setState has as an argument a function,
and

138
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.120
I need to put my changes in the function.

139
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.810
So now if I change, it's changing.

140
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.469
Does it make sense?

141
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.184
Yeah, so that's how we make
stateful widgets with a stateful

142
00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:22.183
variables that are updating the UI,
okay, makes sense?

143
00:10:22.183 --> 00:10:26.010
So now we need to change
the body of the scaffold.

144
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.060
The scaffold has a body that is
right now is rendering OffersPage.

145
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:37.720
Well, now, based on,
I can do a switch, right?

146
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:44.500
And actually, based on what we have
at the top, I can do something.

147
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.060
The problem is that body is a property.

148
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:57.330
I'm actually executing, this is Dart
what I'm doing here, what is this?

149
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.084
This is a constructor, do you see this?

150
00:11:00.084 --> 00:11:01.593
This is a constructor, okay?

151
00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:03.457
So I'm constructing a scaffold.

152
00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:08.395
I cannot put a swift or
an if within one argument of the scaffold,

153
00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:11.740
because that's not an expression.

154
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.250
Does it make sense?

155
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.230
So maybe what I want is a variable,
I wanna render in the body.

156
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.361
And I can call it the currentWidgetPage,
or something like that.

157
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.584
It's a property,
a variable that I need to create here.

158
00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:30.014
And I can do the switch to know
what to render before the return.

159
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.806
Does it make sense?

160
00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:37.990
So let's call this the currentWidgetPage.

161
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.673
And I can, I mean, just through for
playing with this quickly,

162
00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:49.587
I can just make a dummy text,
Like so, and then I can do a switch.

163
00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:55.685
And based on the selected index,
I will render one page or the other.

164
00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:57.120
What is a page?

165
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.660
A widget,
everything is a widget here in Flutter.

166
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.560
So if it's 0, by the way, the switch is
the same switch as in Java and JavaScript.

167
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.607
So if it's 0, I'm

168
00:12:10.607 --> 00:12:16.232
going to say that the currentWidgetPage,
or the selectedPage, or

169
00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:22.265
however you wanna call that variable,
it's one that I don't have yet.

170
00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:27.396
But let's say that it's going to be
the Menu page, and it's a constant.

171
00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:29.160
Okay, makes sense, we need a break.

172
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.879
If it's 1, we already have the page for
that, remember,

173
00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:40.551
it's Offers, the OffersPage widget, break.

174
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:48.682
And if it's 2, it's another one that
we don't have, the Orders page, break.

175
00:12:48.682 --> 00:12:53.513
So now, I have an error here,
because I need to import offers,

176
00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:56.260
because it's in a different file.

177
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.611
Quick fix, Let me see,

178
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:08.026
prefer const, okay,
I know that you prefer const.

179
00:13:11.962 --> 00:13:15.613
The programming that they have
here is that this is a text.

180
00:13:15.613 --> 00:13:19.270
So it's an implicit type.

181
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.787
The type of the current widget
is expecting a text, and

182
00:13:21.787 --> 00:13:24.594
I say no, you know what,
I'm expecting any kind of widget.

183
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.317
Something like that, okay, makes sense?

184
00:13:29.317 --> 00:13:31.811
So when you say this, you're saying hey,

185
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.806
I don't care about the widget
that you're using.

186
00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:40.339
Any widget will make the trick,
does it make sense?

187
00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:45.271
Now it says, well,
maybe we don't need to find a variable,

188
00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:50.130
but I will do it again because
I'm writing something else.

189
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.535
I will do this part again.

190
00:13:51.535 --> 00:13:56.057
So what we need to do is we'll define
an explicit type, because by default,

191
00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:58.047
it's implicitly taking a text.

192
00:13:58.047 --> 00:14:03.480
So instead of var, I need to say this
is a Widget, any kind of Widget.

193
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.970
And now we have a Menu page,
the Offers section, the Order section.

194
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.440
So my bottom bar navigation is working.

195
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.080
Does it makes sense?

196
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.027
This is not the only way to
make navigation, in fact,

197
00:14:17.027 --> 00:14:20.530
there are some navigators and
routing systems more complicated.

198
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:26.180
But for simple to understand solutions,
this actually makes the trick.

199
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.170
You can see there are some animation
cells at the border if you look there.

200
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.842
The icons, they have animations, like the
selected one has a little glow animation,

201
00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:35.897
everything happens automatically.
