WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.301
The next step is to download real data and
see if magic happens.

2
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:08.131
For that,
we need to go to the network, okay?

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:13.339
And to go to a network,
the good news is that Flutter

4
00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.831
is actually giving us one solution, okay?

5
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.018
We do have an HTTP tool to go and
grab this, so

6
00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:24.301
we don't need to use
an external framework.

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:29.347
But it's not included with
our project by default.

8
00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:33.114
So we need to make a really,
really, really tiny process here.

9
00:00:33.114 --> 00:00:41.103
So that process is we need to
open our pubspec.yaml, that file.

10
00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:46.360
And in the pubspec.yaml,
there is a section

11
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.766
at the top that says dependencies,
that one.

12
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.850
So we are going to add a dependency.

13
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.449
How to add the dependency here?

14
00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.561
So right now, the dependency is flutter.

15
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.438
Yeah, we know we're using flutter.

16
00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:05.767
So at the same level of flutter, we are
going to add the name of the dependency.

17
00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:09.415
What's the name, http:.

18
00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:10.292
What's the colon for?

19
00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:13.303
After the colon,
you can express one special version,

20
00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.426
one specific version of that library.

21
00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:20.382
But I want the latest one,
so just http: save.

22
00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:23.764
And you will see at the bottom right,

23
00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:29.342
the IDE will start downloading
that package, that's all.

24
00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:35.954
This is again like package JSON,
like doing MPM install, http package.

25
00:01:35.954 --> 00:01:41.584
So now we are ready to write our code for
this.

26
00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.220
Okay, so now we have the data model,

27
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.402
we are actually rendering some
dummy items on the screen.

28
00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:52.664
We need a place first to
contain all the products.

29
00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:56.579
So our model needs another place,
like a view model,

30
00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.625
a data manager, another class that
will actually be responsible for

31
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:05.630
holding all the products in our menu and
also the cart.

32
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.616
So I'm going to create another file that I

33
00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:15.607
would call that the datamanager.dart.

34
00:02:15.607 --> 00:02:21.446
So the data manager will also be a class,
DataManager.

35
00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:26.167
And remember that you
can move this around,

36
00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:31.665
this little flexible
pop-up panel from Flutter.

37
00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:33.322
I know I need two things.

38
00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:35.197
I need a list of category.

39
00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.540
The category has the products inside.

40
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.233
So we have coffee, tea, frappuccinos,
and those are the categories.

41
00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:45.858
And we have products inside and
that's gonna be the menu.

42
00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:51.125
But because that menu can actually,
it's going to come from the network,

43
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:56.911
I will need, first, let me import the data
model so it's not giving me any error.

44
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:02.584
And I would probably say for
now that at first it might not be there,

45
00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:05.632
so I'm adding that question mark.

46
00:03:05.632 --> 00:03:08.567
Remember, that means it's optional.

47
00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:10.680
And also I will make it private.

48
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.264
So _menu.

49
00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:18.269
Because I will have a getter later because
I will need to fetch the data, okay?

50
00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.817
So I will say that, again, if I don't
have the data, I will get it later,

51
00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:23.094
that's kind of the idea.

52
00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:28.383
And then I have a list of items
in cart that is like our cart.

53
00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:30.067
And they're gonna start
this is an empty array.

54
00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:32.191
I don't need that to be private.

55
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.793
I can, but I think it's fine,
it's not a big deal.

56
00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:40.259
And now, I'm going to add a couple of
functions that we will use later in

57
00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:44.884
the cart for a simple logic function
such as adding something to the cart.

58
00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.997
Of course,
I can do this in a separate file.

59
00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:50.784
I can do two data managers, one for
the cart and one for the menu.

60
00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:55.682
But just to keep things simple here,
I have a cartRemove,

61
00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:03.739
And then I can have a cartClear that will
clear the whole cart and maybe a total.

62
00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.313
So we can actually get
a double as an answer.

63
00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:12.389
Okay, so I mean, the amount of money,
the total for the order.

64
00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.919
So for the add, and
we are receiving the product, and

65
00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.569
it's not just adding that into
the array because we have a type issue.

66
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.548
The product is the product and
this is an item in cart.

67
00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:28.046
If you remember, item in cart has
a product and a quantity, okay, so

68
00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:31.319
it's not as simple as just
adding it to the array.

69
00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.112
We actually need to do
something such as check first

70
00:04:36.112 --> 00:04:41.022
if we have it, so
I'm going to search in every item.

71
00:04:41.022 --> 00:04:46.796
In fact, it's a good moment to actually
go over some basic loops here.

72
00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:51.677
So if the product,
we can check the ID or just the product,

73
00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:57.866
it doesn't matter, is the same as
the one that you're asking for to add.

74
00:04:57.866 --> 00:05:01.999
It means that the product that I'm
adding is already in the cart,

75
00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.317
so I just need to increase
the quantity by 1, okay?

76
00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:07.984
So we are adding products one by one.

77
00:05:07.984 --> 00:05:11.773
So I will take the item.quantity++,
make sense?

78
00:05:11.773 --> 00:05:17.069
And I will say that I have just found it,
so there is no need to add it.

79
00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.593
Because now I will say if it's not found,

80
00:05:19.593 --> 00:05:23.861
what I need is to create a new item
in cart for that particular product.

81
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:29.834
So I will say cart.add,
we add a new item in cart.

82
00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:32.147
Remember we don't use a new key word.

83
00:05:32.147 --> 00:05:37.312
And it has the product that is p,
and the quantity that is 1.

84
00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:39.568
What happens if I add new here?

85
00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:43.200
You receive a warning say,
hey, unnecessary new keyword.

86
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.789
And I know that your brain says that is
not unnecessary, I need a new, but anyway.

87
00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.852
So we don't need a new, okay?

88
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:53.761
Cool, so that's add, that's pretty simple.

89
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:58.687
Remove, I think it should be even
simpler because we can do some kind of

90
00:05:58.687 --> 00:06:00.614
functional programming.

91
00:06:00.614 --> 00:06:05.461
So we can removeWhere,
I received a lambda expression.

92
00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:08.106
I receive an element or
an item in the cart and

93
00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:10.615
I need to say if I wanna remove that or
not.

94
00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:15.236
And I will check if the product.id
is equal to the ID of

95
00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:19.772
the product that you're
sending me as an argument.

96
00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:20.694
Makes sense?

97
00:06:20.694 --> 00:06:24.695
cartClear, will just clear the cart,
that's simple.

98
00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:29.870
And cartTotal is just a basic,
have a semicolon here missing.

99
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.898
This is just plain algorithm
programming from programming 101, but

100
00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:40.934
we just need to go over all
the items on create calculation and

101
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.522
total, let's call it total.

102
00:06:43.522 --> 00:06:46.367
And we will go through all the items.

103
00:06:46.367 --> 00:06:51.392
For each item in the cart,
we're going to say

104
00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:56.551
that total += item.quantity multiplied by

105
00:06:56.551 --> 00:07:02.782
the price of the product,
and then in returning total.

106
00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:06.435
And I will still have problems here,
types problem.

107
00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:09.108
Let's see if you know what's going on.

108
00:07:09.108 --> 00:07:13.989
It says a value of type int can't be
returned from the method cartTotal.

109
00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:17.030
But it's a no, I want to double, why?

110
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.117
It's complaining this int, say what?

111
00:07:19.117 --> 00:07:20.954
&gt;&gt; You got int run in doubles.

112
00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:25.007
&gt;&gt; I have integers, but
why do I have an integer, right?

113
00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:31.170
I'm using implicit type here and
I'm starting with a 0.

114
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.118
And by default, you think it's double.

115
00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:39.238
So sometimes,
implicit typing gets you in trouble.

116
00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:41.206
So there are two ways
to solve the problem.

117
00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:46.345
One is instead of var,
I can explicitly put the type int,

118
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:51.394
I'm sorry, double, not int,
or you can keep the bar.

119
00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:54.331
I'm forced to double by saying 0.0.

120
00:07:56.359 --> 00:08:01.156
I have a missing semicolon as well and
now I think we are good.

121
00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:04.513
We're good to go with the file, okay?

122
00:08:04.513 --> 00:08:08.348
But is this downloading
data from the network?

123
00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:09.828
No, not yet.

124
00:08:09.828 --> 00:08:14.758
But before doing that,
going back to our main.dart,

125
00:08:14.758 --> 00:08:19.809
we try to remember that we have,
let's go full screen.

126
00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:26.731
We have pages here,
menu, offers, and order.

127
00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:32.901
So who needs the data manager for
rendering the contents?

128
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:36.468
It seems like the MenuPage because
it's going to render the menu, and

129
00:08:36.468 --> 00:08:39.262
the OrderPage because it's
going to render the cart.

130
00:08:39.262 --> 00:08:44.126
So what I need then is to
hold that data manager

131
00:08:44.126 --> 00:08:48.609
here in the app or in the homepage, okay?

132
00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:49.583
Make sense?

133
00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:50.712
So you pick where.

134
00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:55.340
You can probably put it at the top
level app, or at the homepage,

135
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.018
in this case are two widgets, okay?

136
00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:01.681
But if you put it at the top,
you need to start passing it by.

137
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.755
Make sense?

138
00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:04.661
It's the same.

139
00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:08.780
So someone needs to
actually hold the variable.

140
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.329
It's better if it's an StatefulWidget
because changing that will

141
00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:16.130
probably trigger some changes in the UI.

142
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.037
Make sense?

143
00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:22.621
So for example, I can add that
into the State of HomePageState.

144
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.437
There is no need to do it here, okay?

145
00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:28.646
As I mentioned before,
we can also do it somewhere else.

146
00:09:28.646 --> 00:09:30.061
We can also do it page by page.

147
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:31.348
But if you do it page by page,

148
00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:34.363
we have a problem because each page
will have its own data manager.

149
00:09:34.363 --> 00:09:36.249
So they're not going to share data.

150
00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:40.808
And I have the cart in one side,
so the menu is adding to the cart.

151
00:09:40.808 --> 00:09:45.913
So I need that data to go to the cart,
to the OrdersPage.

152
00:09:45.913 --> 00:09:50.663
So what I need then is that both sections,

153
00:09:50.663 --> 00:09:54.477
Menu and Order to share the data.

154
00:09:54.477 --> 00:10:01.263
So I need to store the data in a widget
up in the top level that can access both.

155
00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:02.438
Does it make sense?

156
00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:04.890
So for example,
we can add the data manager.

157
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.641
Here I'm going to create a new one.

158
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:11.515
The data manager is just the class that
we have just created that has the list

159
00:10:11.515 --> 00:10:12.015
inside.

160
00:10:12.015 --> 00:10:17.838
And then I need to pass them by argument
to the menu, you pass down into the tree.

161
00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:19.019
How to do that?

162
00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:22.489
Well, in the MenuPage, I need a property.

163
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:25.954
A final property, DataManager.

164
00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:27.033
Does it makes sense?

165
00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:31.606
So I'm going to receive it,
it's of type DataManager.

166
00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:35.105
And I'm going to receive
it as an argument.

167
00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:44.295
So I will say required this.dataManager
with a lowercase here.

168
00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:48.543
Like so and
I probably I need to import, sorry,

169
00:10:48.543 --> 00:10:53.227
have a type okay I'm writing
a different language.

170
00:10:53.227 --> 00:10:56.423
It's dataManager, like so.

171
00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.218
Okay, now it's working.

172
00:11:01.218 --> 00:11:03.860
So on something similar, we need for

173
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.966
the orders page even if it's
empty at this point, okay?

174
00:11:07.966 --> 00:11:15.789
The OrderPage, I need to receive
the same property dataManager.

175
00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:18.553
I need to import the library, and

176
00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:23.904
then I need to received that
here required this.dataManager.

177
00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:28.712
The final step is to
pass them by argument.

178
00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:35.648
I'm just passing objects from one
object to another object, okay?

179
00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:36.821
Does it make sense?

180
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:43.194
So it's saying that now it's
not a constant anymore.

181
00:11:43.194 --> 00:11:43.775
Make sense?

182
00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:45.751
Because I'm passing an argument.

183
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:51.059
So that OrderPage or those menu page
might not be the same every time so

184
00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:55.369
I cannot add the const declaration,
the const prefix.
