00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:03.695
If you're following the companion website,

2
00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:08.695
we will actually now go into
reviewing two, three, chapter two,

3
00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:11.838
lesson three, our first widget, okay?

4
00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:16.501
So I'm going to create another
widget with the name Greet, okay,

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.344
to show you a little bit about the state.

6
00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.243
Because so far,
we have this stateless widget but

7
00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:25.150
we don't actually
understand what's going on.

8
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.146
So if I add another one, st less,

9
00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:34.143
remember stateless st less &gt; Enter,
the same on Android Studio.

10
00:00:34.143 --> 00:00:37.411
I'm going to create a Greet widget, okay?

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.944
So I will call it Greet, and
here it has a container.

12
00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:43.999
Okay, we still don't know
what the container is.

13
00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.370
But what I want is to do something like
the HelloWord but with a variable now.

14
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.721
So I will have a name here.

15
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:55.914
So this is my name, actually my name is
Maximiliano, I will type it completely.

16
00:00:55.914 --> 00:01:02.490
And how can I render, That text inside,
like Hello Maximiliano?

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.368
Well, you use Hello and then $name,

18
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.600
okay, like we did before.

19
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.489
Do I need to add const?

20
00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:20.830
Actually, if I add const here,
I have a compilation error, why?

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.845
You know why?

22
00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:28.100
I mean, we had const before and
it was working, but not now.

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.290
&gt;&gt; There's a variable in it.

24
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.069
&gt;&gt; There is a variable inside.

25
00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.700
So it's not constant.

26
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.569
It may change, somehow we don't know how.

27
00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.240
But the system,
the compiler will say, hey, hey,

28
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.510
this is not a constant text widget,
it might change, okay?

29
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.767
So now, instead of, let me scroll it down,

30
00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:54.186
instead of HelloWord,
I'm going to add Greet, okay?

31
00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:59.527
So what I see here now
says Hello Maximiliano.

32
00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:01.651
It actually work, okay?

33
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:08.995
But what if I wanna let the user
type his or her name, okay?

34
00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:09.535
Makes sense?

35
00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:12.363
So we can actually ask the user for

36
00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:17.014
the name instead of hard
coding the name in a variable.

37
00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:20.418
Well, first,
how can we return two widgets?

38
00:02:20.418 --> 00:02:24.091
Because we need the text on
some kind of a text field so

39
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:26.520
the user can type something on it.

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.819
There is no way to return an array or
multiple elements.

41
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.210
We always need to return one widget.

42
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.750
But we do have widgets that
are acting as containers, okay?

43
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.569
That they can contain more
than one widget inside.

44
00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.519
And typically, we are going to
arrange those widget with a layout.

45
00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.799
For example, how do we wanna render this?

46
00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.817
Do we want to have a text and
then a text field below?

47
00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:57.620
Do we want a text and
a text field at the side?

48
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.729
Based on the layout that we want,
we need to pick the container.

49
00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:08.079
For example, there is one
container with the name column

50
00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:15.670
that is actually going to stack children
widgets vertically in a column, okay?

51
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.019
So column has a lot of properties in
the constructor, all of them optional.

52
00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.524
So I pick if I wanna set the value or
not for those properties.

53
00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:34.716
And one of the properties that I want,
that I care, is this one, children.

54
00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:35.654
And what is children?

55
00:03:35.654 --> 00:03:39.587
A list of widgets, so
it's an array of widget.

56
00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:40.349
Make sense?

57
00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.010
So I'm going to implement or define
the value for children, and it's an array.

58
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.546
So in the array, I can put the text,
I can put many text so

59
00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.440
you can see what's going on.

60
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.519
First, I copy and pasted,
and I have a problem.

61
00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.850
The problem is the semicolon, why?

62
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.200
So here you need to get used to
this syntax, I know it is tricky.

63
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.217
This is an array, so we separate
elements in the array with comma,

64
00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:13.520
not with semicolon.

65
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.229
The semicolon goes at the end.

66
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:23.726
And now, all of this, okay, they need to
be commas, including a trailing comma.

67
00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:27.069
So if I save this,
you can see a lot of Hello Maximiliano.

68
00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.919
Makes sense?

69
00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.042
So, well, I don't want a lot of
text widgets, I want a text and

70
00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:42.261
I want another one that is
called a TextField, okay?

71
00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:46.599
A TextField so
the user can actually type a text.

72
00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.867
Now, I can type a text here.

73
00:04:51.142 --> 00:04:54.569
So when I saved,
I'm not sure if you realized,

74
00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.840
when I saved,
it put all the list in one line.

75
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.097
That's because I don't
have a trailing comma.

76
00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:03.548
If I add a trailing comma in the array and
I save again,

77
00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:06.790
it's doing the multi-line auto format,
okay?

78
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.229
So check that, you pick what you want.

79
00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.399
Typically, we do multi-line
unless it's really simple, okay?

80
00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:20.689
So before actually talking about
padding and UI, let's make it work.

81
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.119
So I want the TextField to
change my variable, okay?

82
00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:26.456
Make sense?

83
00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:27.949
That's kind of the idea.

84
00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.386
So it's not Maximiliano when I
start with an empty text, and

85
00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:36.480
I wanna render the name of
the user as the user is typing.

86
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.029
Well, how can I detect
that the text has changed?

87
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.804
There is an argument, onChanged,

88
00:05:42.804 --> 00:05:48.359
that if you're coming from the web,
it's straightforward, right?

89
00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:53.021
So it's self explanatory,
onChanged, it receives a function.

90
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:56.003
I can define the function in two ways,
arrow function,

91
00:05:56.003 --> 00:05:58.869
when it's just one expression,
or with code block.

92
00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.069
Remember that from the Dart syntax.

93
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.220
So in this case, it's pretty simple.

94
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.369
So I can just say that the name is equal
to the value that we receive, okay?

95
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:14.319
So I save, I say Hello,
I type my name, and

96
00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.219
nothing happens, why?

97
00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.044
Because this is a stateless widget.

98
00:06:21.044 --> 00:06:24.980
The stateless widget will never change.

99
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.424
It doesn't contain a state.

100
00:06:26.424 --> 00:06:30.800
It's not going to
re-render itself magically.

101
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.840
That's why it's a stateless widget.
