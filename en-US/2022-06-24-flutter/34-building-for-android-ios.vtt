WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.330
So, now that we are done,
what's the next step?

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.096
Well, to compile the apps, it's actually
pretty simple, you need open a terminal,

3
00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:12.300
and you type flutter build and the name
of the platform that you wanna build.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.272
Android will actually let you
build AABs or APKs, actually,

5
00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:25.943
if you go to the last section
of the compiling website,

6
00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:29.370
compiling for Android, okay?

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.013
You can actually compile
using flutter build APK or

8
00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:37.910
flutter build appbundle and
that will give you the file.

9
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.741
The problem is that by default
you don't have icons, so

10
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.030
you actually need to define your icons.

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.990
Okay, for Android and for iOS,
the same happens on both sides.

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.708
So compiling is actually pretty simple,
if you wanna compile for the web,

13
00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.310
you just say flutter build web.

14
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.265
And it's going to give you the final
version that you can publish

15
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:03.129
in your web server, but
also icons are a problem.

16
00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.581
So the next steps, before polishing
is setting up the icons, so

17
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:13.710
let me do that quickly on both Android and
IOS, and then finish with BWS on the web.

18
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.622
So to actually work with Android,
you need to use Android Studio,

19
00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:25.338
and you need to open your projects
Android sub-folder, okay.

20
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:29.294
So you need to go to your
project Android sub-folder,

21
00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:31.876
I'm going to think it's this one.

22
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.699
There is an Android sub-folder, so

23
00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:39.511
you need to open that
folder with Android Studio.

24
00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:44.629
Even if you were not using Android Studio,
it doesn't matter for

25
00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.510
creating your Flutter app, okay?

26
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.561
Now we are actually opening
the Android Studio project that

27
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:56.624
is actually,
you won't see any Flutter code here, okay.

28
00:01:56.624 --> 00:02:00.250
But here in the res folder
in the mipmap folder,

29
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.708
we do have a launcher,
the launcher is actually the icon.

30
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:11.220
By default, it's the Flutter logo, the
Flutter icon, we don't want that, okay?

31
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.170
So to actually replace this
launcher with a new one,

32
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.080
you need to right click over
the mipmap &gt; New &gt; Image Asset.

33
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.240
Okay, and here, you will be able
to design your icon for Android.

34
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.071
What we want typically is to take
first for the foreground layer,

35
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.220
I mean the foreground layer.

36
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.934
I wanna take an asset that
I have in my computer, so

37
00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:45.331
I need to just select
the Path that I wanna use.

38
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:50.650
In the assets that you downloaded,
you have a section for icons.

39
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.902
So for example, it says icon PNG,
if you've got one,

40
00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:58.990
this is how your Icon
finder will look like.

41
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.331
So it looks really bad, as you can see,

42
00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:08.300
because Android today supports
different shapes for icons.

43
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.929
So what you need to do is remove
this sidebar until you are happy,

44
00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.865
you need to add more padding to the icon.

45
00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:19.813
And to remove that the green
borders that we have,

46
00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:25.641
we need to click on the Background
layer here, and then select the Color,

47
00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:31.290
and we can use the color picker
to just pick the right color.

48
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.750
And this is how our icon will look
like on different versions of Android.

49
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.738
If you select Next, it will tell you that
you will replace to the existing icon, and

50
00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:43.840
we want that because we
don't want the flutter logo.

51
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.826
And now if you come back here,

52
00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.380
you will see that your icon
is actually the right one.

53
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.384
So now you're ready to make the final
compilation, you can make the final

54
00:03:55.384 --> 00:04:00.227
compilation from here, from
Android Studio using the build menu, and

55
00:04:00.227 --> 00:04:05.169
you can build an APK or a bundle if you
select Build APK it will just build.

56
00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:11.860
Or you can build it from the terminal
asking flutter to create that APK for you.

57
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.889
It's just the same thing, but
we have already save the icons, okay,

58
00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:16.790
any question?

59
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.829
Icon for Android?

60
00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:24.376
Nope, now the APK is ready,
I can locate the APK and

61
00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:31.060
that's actually the Android app Okay?

62
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.673
On iOS,
we need to do something similar, so

63
00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:38.494
I need to open Xcode,
you need a Mac remember.

64
00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:44.360
So I need to open from the iOS
folder of my flutter project.

65
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.558
I need to open then on the iOS folder,

66
00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:55.280
I need to open the one that says,
runner workspace.

67
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.548
So I open that runner workspace in Xcode,
and

68
00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:05.500
here there is a file with the name assets.

69
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.075
And within there I can click
on the Icon by default,

70
00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:14.900
we have another set of flutter icons.

71
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.334
iOS needs a lot of PNGs in
different file sizes, so

72
00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:23.250
you can select all of them and
press Delete.

73
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.930
So we delete the flutter logo, and you
can see here all the sizes that you need.

74
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.082
There are many tools out there
that can take your icon and

75
00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:37.860
create all this version for you.

76
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.098
I already have in the companion website
assets, also a folder that says,

77
00:05:45.098 --> 00:05:50.249
icons iOS,
where you have all the versions, okay?

78
00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.878
I'm not going to do it one by one,
but you can do that,

79
00:05:53.878 --> 00:06:00.194
I will do that on 1024 here at the bottom,
the most important ones are 120 and 180.

80
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.432
So 120 will go here,
180 will go there for example,

81
00:06:07.432 --> 00:06:12.490
and now you can compile your app for
IOS as well.

82
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.550
You can do it from Xcode or
from the Flutter terminal, it's up to you.

83
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.485
But if you don't change the icons, or

84
00:06:19.485 --> 00:06:22.944
other metadata that you wanna change
It will have the flutter icon.

85
00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:28.908
Of course here, it helps if you have some
experience on iOS and Android development.

86
00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:32.222
Okay, and for that here for the Masters,

87
00:06:32.222 --> 00:06:36.970
you have two other workshops
that I did on Kotlin and Swift.

88
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.170
And you can get some ideas on how to
improve more things around that app.
