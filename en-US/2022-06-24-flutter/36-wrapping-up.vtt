1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.640
So that's all for today's workshop.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.370
So, we've been doing
a lot just in one day.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.380
So, you now know something about Dart,
the language also Flutter.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.680
How Flutter works,
you know that everything is a widget.

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.620
So, you will end up working
with a lot of widgets.

6
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.326
A little bit about the UI, the layout
we've mentioned a little bit about

7
00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:24.700
responsive design as well and
how to deal with data.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.810
And how data works, and remember we have,
a stateless widget, and a stateful widget.

9
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.757
So, I hope that's useful, and now you can
start doing apps, both for the store, for

10
00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:38.400
desktop, or for the web,
with progressive web.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.747
See you next time.

12
00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:44.188
