>> So that's all for today's workshop. So, we've been doing a lot just in one day. So, you now know something about Dart, the language also Flutter. How Flutter works, you know that everything is a widget. So, you will end up working with a lot of widgets. A little bit about the UI, the layout we've mentioned a little bit about responsive design as well and how to deal with data.

[00:00:24]
And how data works, and remember we have, a stateless widget, and a stateful widget. So, I hope that's useful, and now you can start doing apps, both for the store, for desktop, or for the web, with progressive web. See you next time.
