1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.479
Okay, so we are really close to
have our app, up and running.

2
00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.767
So the premise that we have is
that if we add elements and

3
00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:11.778
we go to the order we see nothing.

4
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:17.685
So it's not being added because we have a
bag, the bag has to do with it one other.

5
00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:21.139
Okay, so we are actually adding
to the cartAddproduct, but

6
00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:23.929
we are not receiving
the product as an argument.

7
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.730
And the bag is actually adding
a product is not there.

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.874
So, we need to receive from the menu item,
the product we can call it B if you

9
00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:39.770
want or added product, so we don't have,
we don't mess up with the variable names.

10
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.790
And now if I add a black Americano and
a cappuccino and

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.530
I go to order, voila, we have the card.

12
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.870
What happens if I try to delete this,
we added the code to delete.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.406
So if I press delete.

14
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.050
Nothing happens.

15
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.472
But anyway, do you see that there is some
kind of a glow effect when you click,

16
00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:06.070
we will receive that automatically.

17
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.630
One effect when you click on a button,
there is an animation going on there.

18
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.050
So let me show you this.

19
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.270
I go to offers.

20
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.140
I go back to order.

21
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.250
Again, I'm going to delete a cappuccino,
I'm going to refer back to order.

22
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.425
So if deleting the data
from the data manager.

23
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:33.535
But it's not updating the UI, why?

24
00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:34.632
How can we solve the problem?

25
00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:43.765
State, so if we go and see our page, our
order page is actually a stateless widget.

26
00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:47.825
So nothing that happens
within that widget.

27
00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:52.640
The whole page will be updated
because it's an a stateless widget.

28
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.800
So first we need to update or
convert this into an stateful widget.

29
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.526
If I try this now,
we still have the same issue because

30
00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:12.280
the current remove call is the one
that can trigger a change.

31
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.922
Must be executed within a set
statement because if not,

32
00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:20.810
it won't trigger a change.

33
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.450
Does that makes sense?

34
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.943
So if I add the black Americano and
the cappuccino and

35
00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:29.708
then go to order, now It works.

36
00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:35.038
so if your widget is a stateless,
it will never change you need

37
00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:40.368
to change that to a stateful and
changes that you do inside that

38
00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:45.414
will trigger updates must be
done within a set state call.

39
00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:47.291
Does it make sense?

40
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.640
So something that we can do here also,
just to finish this is in the order page.

41
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.590
We can put an image here.

42
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.258
So, because yeah,
we don't have a message saying that,

43
00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:09.250
we can have a container, for
example, wrap this with a container.

44
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.721
And then we can actually say something
like if, can we do an if here, let's say.

45
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:18.075
So if data manager,
by the way data is data manager here,

46
00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:23.639
now that we are in a stateful component
the data manager is in the widget.

47
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.273
We have two classes when we are doing
a stateful from the state to access

48
00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:33.390
the properties of the widget,
we need to access with widget.

49
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.360
So if widget, and
then we have data manager, okay.

50
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.116
Blah, blah, blah blah.

51
00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:45.060
We can also do is before the return.

52
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.120
That's probably going to be easier.

53
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.098
So, when I'm going to ask if
the length of the card is zero, so

54
00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:57.800
if it's zero, maybe I want to return
a text saying your order is empty.

55
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.881
And if not, I'm going to return that maybe
I don't need the container actually, so

56
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.190
I can remove the unnecessary container.

57
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.759
So like, so I need to return this text.

58
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.976
And then this is a constant text.

59
00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:19.120
And here it's complaining because there
is already an empty property in arrays.

60
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.690
So instead of asking for length equal
to zero, you can just say is empty.

61
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.187
Like so, we are missing a semicolon, And

62
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.630
let's see what else do
we need to adjust here.

63
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.260
Okay, so
I balance my parentheses and braces.

64
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.330
And now we are back here.

65
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.830
Order, okay?

66
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.604
It looks fine.

67
00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:46.360
And if I delete this,
it says your order is empty.

68
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.021
We can attach, adding,

69
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:53.730
center wherever we want over the text
that says your order empty, okay?

70
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.850
So, two more things quick things,

71
00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.500
what about the numbers it says
1.5 doesn't look like perfect.

72
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.948
So if we wanna add two decimals here,
in the order item,

73
00:05:04.948 --> 00:05:09.640
this case in the menu page,
we go to the product item.

74
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.870
And when we were showing the price
here we can call two string as fixed.

75
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.100
So doubles.

76
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.832
They have a method, two string as fixed,

77
00:05:21.832 --> 00:05:26.850
where we can actually say
how many decimal we want.

78
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.004
And also in the order page,
we can add in the last view if we want

79
00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:37.570
the total because we have already
calculated the total in the car.
