1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.490
So the next step is to
create the other two pages.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.708
So instead of rendering text,
I wanna render here a menu page,

3
00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:14.350
and I wanna render an orders page,
order page.

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.323
What is a page?

5
00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:17.970
A widget?

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.661
So for organization purposes,
I'm going to create them here, and

7
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:27.190
if you want,
you can create more folders within lib.

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.480
More packages.

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.256
Every folder is a package.

10
00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:34.002
So I can create one for pages or
page views or page widgets or

11
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.520
whatever you wanna call this.

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.390
So I can drive this one, Okay?

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.858
And also I'm going to
create junior files here

14
00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:53.950
menupage.dart and orderpage.dart.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.651
And for now inside, I'm going to create
a stateless widget with that name,

16
00:00:58.651 --> 00:00:59.980
like the order page.

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.400
Every time you do that you need to import,
okay?

18
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.788
So be careful because you need
to import material dart, and

19
00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:13.111
that we get rid of all the hundred
errors that you will see.

20
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.070
And menu page,
I also need to create a stateless widget.

21
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.908
Manual page, okay?

22
00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:21.168
Makes sense?

23
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.790
And also remember to import material dart.

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.779
So now main dart is giving me
an error because menu page,

25
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:32.815
an order page are in a different package,
so we need to import,

26
00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:42.171
From our pages folder.

27
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:49.708
So now we are back here, yeah, menu and
order are empty but it's working.

28
00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:54.549
We already have various set up all
the files that we need for now.

29
00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.608
Do you have any question?

30
00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:57.813
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Max, I'm sorry if you repeat this.

31
00:01:57.813 --> 00:01:59.080
&gt;&gt; That's fine.

32
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.870
&gt;&gt; The index on that
bottom navigation bar.

33
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.235
Does it automatically
create new index numbers

34
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:07.880
for-
&gt;&gt; No.

35
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.568
This is a variable that I have set.

36
00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:11.900
This one is a state variable.

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.440
How do I know it's a state variable?

38
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.060
Because it's a property
within my state class.

39
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.200
I'm the one changing it, where?

40
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.560
Here in the on top event
of the navigation bar.

41
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.660
So the navigation bar will
execute you a function.

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.240
Say, hey,
the user has just tap on a different icon.

43
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.670
That you're getting that new index and
you're changing your own variable with it.

44
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.168
So I'm taking here,
the new index received by argument, and

45
00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:47.390
I'm saving that in the selected index but
by defining a new state.

46
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.444
That set state is the one
that is making the magic,

47
00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:54.105
and it's going to automatically
re-render your widget.

48
00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:58.160
And that's why you see that
something is changing on the screen.

49
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.145
&gt;&gt; But there's no real index.

50
00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:04.367
I mean, menu is not 0,
office is 1 and order-

51
00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:07.264
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the order is like an array, so

52
00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:09.886
it goes for the menu 0 verses 1.

53
00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:11.817
You don't usually find that anywhere.

54
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:16.539
Because it's an index,
it will give you automatically from 0.
