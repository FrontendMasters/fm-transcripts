1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.310
Now, what do I need to add
apart from the categories?

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.600
The product, right?

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.460
So, the category has products.

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.960
Remember?

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.195
So, how you do that?

6
00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.309
What do we need to add here?

7
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:19.530
&gt;&gt; Another ListView.

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.012
Another lease view, but where should I add
another ListView in the other lease view.

9
00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:26.013
Can I have to leave your
one inside the other?

10
00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:29.260
We can with one special warning
because they was intimidated.

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.818
Because they will be fighting for
the scroll when you have two ListView at

12
00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:37.200
the same time, and
that will give you an error.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.003
But we can talk to the nested ListView and
say, hey,

14
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:45.350
you're not going to be responsible for
the scroll.

15
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.540
So, like remove the scroll,
and it will work.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.730
Okay, it makes sense?

17
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.900
We will see how to do that in a minute.

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.784
But before doing that,
we have a padding here for

19
00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:59.804
each category and we will need a column or
something to actually

20
00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:04.374
put first the name of the category and
then the ListView.

21
00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.184
Makes sense?

22
00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:09.990
We always need containers.

23
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.320
So, we go to the padding, right click, and

24
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.010
here we are going to say the refactor,
wrap in.

25
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.840
For some reason, it's not showing me,
Column I'm going to add it manually.

26
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.470
So in the column Column
has children not child.

27
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.668
So, I need to put this in an array, that's
why it's better to you use the tool,

28
00:01:35.668 --> 00:01:38.865
and we have a padding and
also another ListView.

29
00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:45.055
And this ListView will also
contain a builder because it's

30
00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:48.415
a dynamic data, not a static data.

31
00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:49.705
That's the idea, okay?

32
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:52.525
We use a builder every
time we have dynamic data.

33
00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:54.715
The builder needs the count.

34
00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:55.669
So let's start with the count.

35
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.420
Whereas you I get the count of product
categories.index.products.length.

36
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.594
Makes sense?

37
00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:10.990
I'm looping through the structure here.

38
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.540
And the builder is always the same.

39
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.170
It receives a context, And the index of
the current product that I need to render.

40
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.209
And what do you think we
should have render here?

41
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:27.760
A text?

42
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.380
We have our own product either
remember that we did before.

43
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.930
That receives a product.

44
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.350
Do I have a product?

45
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.775
Yeah, it's categories[index].products sub,

46
00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:51.710
we have a problem here,
this is the product index.

47
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.734
We just changed the name, okay?

48
00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:53.234
Makes sense?

49
00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:59.480
Of course, we can create
intermediate variables here as well.

50
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.060
And we also need to define
what you do on OnAdd.

51
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.852
For now, let's put an empty block.

52
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.870
Okay, we need a comma here and
parenthesis.

53
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.110
This is closing that one.

54
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.018
This is closing the builder.

55
00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:21.448
Okay?

56
00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:26.380
We need semicolon for product item.

57
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.072
You can see it's really
complicated sometimes to

58
00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:36.330
find the right, Look at this.

59
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.815
So, we have things like the we
need to return a product item,

60
00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:47.151
so this is going to finish that builder.

61
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:51.230
Like that.

62
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.030
Finally I got it.

63
00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.020
So, now I'm seeing nothing on the screen,
which is kind of boom, okay?

64
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.200
Nothing is on the screen.

65
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.413
What's going on?

66
00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:06.776
Well, typically when nothing is on
the screen and it doesn't well, we have

67
00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:11.548
the navbar but nothing on the mirror,
I thought something before, when something

68
00:04:11.548 --> 00:04:16.416
doesn't seem right, you should check into
the console in the browser for example.

69
00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:21.234
Typically you will see some exceptions
where to find those exceptions here in

70
00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:22.800
builder column as well.

71
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.840
You need to open the debug output window
that you can open that from there.

72
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.898
And you will find the possible
problems that you have errors, okay?

73
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:33.960
In this case,

74
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.713
I think the error has to do with the
ListView that I already mentioned before.

75
00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:45.356
You cannot nest two ListView because
they are fighting for the scroll.

76
00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:50.108
So to follow berm there are a couple
of properties two properties

77
00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:54.244
that you need to put here
it's shrinkwrap you say true,

78
00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:59.173
another property is physics and
you say clamping Scroll physics.

79
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:03.630
And automatically that solved the problem.

80
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.414
The problem is that you cannot
have two nested ListView,

81
00:05:06.414 --> 00:05:08.560
because they're fighting for the scroll.

82
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.821
Unless one of the ListViews say I'm
resigning, okay, I'm not going to scroll,

83
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:14.140
so no worries.

84
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.915
So, if we look at that the final
result that we have here,

85
00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:22.800
we see a snacks so
it seems like it's working.

86
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.638
Yeah, the image is the same image,
but why?

87
00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:32.210
Because our product item is actually
our code in the image, remember?

88
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.451
Well, instead of using
the asset constructor,

89
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.780
there is another constructor
that says network.

90
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.750
As simple as that.

91
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.230
And I can take my product ImageUrl.

92
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.920
And now it's giving me some errors.

93
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.220
Let's see if I tried to see
here failed to load exception.

94
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.970
So, we may have a problem in the URL.

95
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.510
And also, I need to tell you something.

96
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.740
If you want these to work on Android,
we need to add permission.

97
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.950
By default, an Android application has
no permission to access the web, okay?

98
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.011
So, we need to ask permission.

99
00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:18.020
In the documentation,
you have the information on how to

100
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.120
add permission in in the companion
website for an Android app.

101
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.060
Okay, so let's go to our data model.

102
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.500
And let's try to see if these
images are actually there.

103
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.111
So, for example, the black Americana.

104
00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:42.188
It's a 404 so, seems like I had a typo.

105
00:06:42.188 --> 00:06:49.194
Look at that, coffeemasters, okay?

106
00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:52.741
So, we had a typo in the data model.

107
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:58.235
I'm saving and
magically my inner sheets are working.

108
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:01.267
Okay?

109
00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:04.480
So, now we are rendering this section.

110
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.100
The only missing part here
is when I'm clicking Add.

111
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.633
When I'm clicking Add,

112
00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:16.018
remember the product item was lifting
that Inchon event to its parent.

113
00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:18.920
Who is the product item parent?

114
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.770
The product page.

115
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.768
This one.

116
00:07:21.768 --> 00:07:24.691
And here we have the OnAdd.

117
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:28.839
What do we need to do with-
&gt;&gt; Data manager and-

118
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.831
&gt;&gt; dataManager.cart or

119
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.350
directly we have a cartAdd.

120
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.140
We pass the product.

121
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.014
We have the product where?

122
00:07:38.014 --> 00:07:42.286
Well, we didn't create the variable
probably a good idea to

123
00:07:42.286 --> 00:07:43.887
create the variable.

124
00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:50.710
So, such as this, Var product is equals to
this, so we can reuse the same variable.

125
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.610
And if our logic was fine, it should work.

126
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.400
Any question at this point?

127
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.890
This was probably the most complicated
widget that we have created

128
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.620
the future builder and all that stuff.
