1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.516
Now, if I go to the order page,
okay, at least for

2
00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:05.882
seeing quickly if this is working.

3
00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:12.818
I can put the text and try to say,
Cart length dataManager,

4
00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:18.370
we have all ready received
the dataManager with

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.673
either before dataManager.cart.count.

6
00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:28.849
If you look at here,
we should be able to see something.

7
00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.010
So if I'm going to the orders section now,
it says zero.

8
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.679
It's actually really small, okay?

9
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.079
It says zero.

10
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.739
If I add something, I go to order,
it still says zero.

11
00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.381
Why?

12
00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:51.439
&gt;&gt; The data binding is not there.

13
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.090
&gt;&gt; The data binding.

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.310
Maybe has to do with data binding?

15
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.595
Well, we'll see let's start
designing the carts so

16
00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:02.449
we can actually solve
the problem in a minute.

17
00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.604
First, to design the cart,
the cart will have rows, okay?

18
00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:11.299
With the details that we have in the cart.

19
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.705
This is actually doing the same thing
as we did before we create a row and

20
00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:16.836
we add some text.

21
00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:21.194
So something that we can
do is in the companion

22
00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:25.218
website we are actually In the last part.

23
00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:31.620
We have the creating the cart page and
they have an order item all ready for you.

24
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.204
It's just playing with the same
thing it's not actually a big deal,

25
00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:40.490
let me paste that and
actually see that and see what's going on.

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.621
So we have the ordered item will
actually render an item, okay?

27
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:53.142
And it has an own remove because he
will have the delete button, okay?

28
00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:56.669
And then it's a card, so
it's a busy wall card.

29
00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:02.715
The card has a row, and the row has
some charts with an expanded version.

30
00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:05.035
We haven't seen the expanded
version before.

31
00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:10.263
So the expanded version will show
will try to use Flexbox ideas.

32
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:16.239
So in the row, they will be expanded
based on the flex property.

33
00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.897
So in this case it's one,
six, two and one,

34
00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:25.311
totals ten, so actually the first child is

35
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:30.600
a padding with the text
will be 10% of the width.

36
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.210
So this is like CSS saying with 10%.

37
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.689
Does it make sense?

38
00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.462
This one says with 60%,
and so on, all right?

39
00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:43.272
You'll get the idea 20% 10%.

40
00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:44.250
Why?

41
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.308
Because it's using that flex,
actually if you want,

42
00:02:48.308 --> 00:02:51.140
you can use present dashes like this.

43
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.963
If it's clearer for you,
it's actually just the same.

44
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.730
So when you want this to render
this order items here In the cart.

45
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.368
&gt;&gt; If you pass in an item count we
would always render that number if.

46
00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:09.635
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Some are off the screen.

47
00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:11.469
&gt;&gt; But we can answer the question.

48
00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.800
I can answer it now because now
I need to add another of those.

49
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.120
So what do I need to do here?

50
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.720
I need to add a Listview.builder, okay?

51
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.920
And remember,

52
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.559
the builder receives an item builder
that has the context and the index.

53
00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.330
And also we typically need
to pass the item count.

54
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.490
So what happens if we say 100?

55
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.656
It will actually execute item builder
up to 100 times, not necessarily

56
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:46.150
100 times because if the user is not
scrolling, it's not going to ask you for

57
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.579
all the items, all the items
are all ready on the screen, okay?

58
00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.886
But, of course, if you're sitting there
more elements are the ones that you have,

59
00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:57.400
you may have a problem.

60
00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.826
Okay.

61
00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:01.180
Make sense?

62
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.248
So typically here you need
to say now you know what.

63
00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:07.259
We want to pass the length of the cart, so

64
00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:12.586
then we are not passing over this and
then we will have the current item.

65
00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:20.661
So index and what we need to do is to
render we're going to return the item

66
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.135
builder always return the widget.

67
00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:27.503
So we're gonna return an order
item with that item and for

68
00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:30.604
our remove, we need to pass a function.

69
00:04:35.034 --> 00:04:37.075
Okay, something like that.

70
00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.335
So any question on the idea
of what I'm doing?

71
00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:45.210
Does it make sense?

72
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.419
I mean, we have an order item
that is like a program item and

73
00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.871
is just entering one row.

74
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:55.569
It receives the data model for
entering in the row and

75
00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.593
it will lift an event for own remove.

76
00:04:59.593 --> 00:05:04.978
And by the way own remove here should
talk to data manager and ask to remove

77
00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:10.282
something from the cart, that product
that we receive as an argument.

78
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.118
But will it work?

79
00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:17.618
We'll see.
