WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.373
So what about the web and
PWAs, as I mentioned before?

2
00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:10.685
So I already build the web
version with flutter build web,

3
00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:17.420
and now there is an output folder,
so it's build &gt; web, okay?

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.092
And here you have actually
the files that you

5
00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:26.517
need to deploy on your web server, okay?

6
00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:30.961
So actually, if I get in build/web and

7
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:37.156
I start the server, for
example, I can use npx serve,

8
00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:43.913
it's actually a free open
source server available on npm.

9
00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:47.287
Now I have localhost:3000 that I can open.

10
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.588
And this is how the app
looks like on Safari.

11
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:59.307
Yeah, we might need to center things,
but the app should be working.

12
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.749
Okay, this is Safari.

13
00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:08.080
We have a problem, for example,
in the favicon at the top, look at that.

14
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.023
Yeah, it's the Flutter icon.

15
00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:13.140
So I will show you how to replace that.

16
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.091
But what happens if I open this in Chrome?

17
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:20.436
So if I open this in Chrome,
Chrome supports progressive web apps.

18
00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:25.990
So I have that little icon there,
that one.

19
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.392
And also, if I go to the menu,
it says, Install coffee_masters.

20
00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:36.260
If I do that,
I will install a progressive web app.

21
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.250
It has the Flutter icon.

22
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.654
So if I installed the progressive web app,
this is how my PWA mapper,

23
00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:46.070
this is how it looks like today on my Mac.

24
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.176
I have actually now a Mac application
with the name coffee_masters.

25
00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:54.910
It also appears as
an installed application.

26
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.685
And this will work on Windows, Linux,
Chromebooks, and Mac OS devices.

27
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:05.462
It also works on iPhones.
It also works on Android.

28
00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:07.560
So this is the PWA version.

29
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400
It's a web version that can be installed.

30
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.950
And after its installed, it has an icon in
the homescreen or in the, wherever place

31
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.730
you put apps in that operating system,
and it works offline as well.

32
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.790
Everything is done with service workers,
JavaScript, and PWA stuff.

33
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.660
Flutter is creating the PWA for
you automatically.

34
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.638
The only thing that you need to set or
change maybe is the name of the app,

35
00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:35.390
the icon, and where is that?

36
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.720
That is actually in the web folder,
not the build folder.

37
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.460
In the web folder you have
index.html to change.

38
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.050
You can change anything in the index.html,
such as the favicon.

39
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.470
So you need to replace the icon.

40
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.943
And also have manifest.json.

41
00:02:53.943 --> 00:02:58.209
Manifest.json, it's where
you set the metadata for

42
00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.903
your progressive web app, okay?

43
00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:03.740
So for example,
here we have the name of the app.

44
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.878
So instead of coffee_master,
I can use Coffee Masters,

45
00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.670
the best app, whatever, for coffee.

46
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.583
The short_name is actually something
that will appear below the icon,

47
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:19.208
so it should be short.

48
00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:24.673
The background_color is the background
color of your splash screen.

49
00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:29.008
And the theme_color,
it's actually used for the title bar.

50
00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:36.020
Okay, so it's that color that
you see in the title bar.

51
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.298
So you can change this,
you can change the description as well.

52
00:03:40.298 --> 00:03:44.564
Okay, blah blah blah blah blah,
we have description, and your icons.

53
00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:50.005
Here there is a set of icons, that by
default, they have the Flutter icon.

54
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:52.196
So what do I need to do?

55
00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:53.463
Well, replace this icon.

56
00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:59.415
So, from the same assets,
where you have all the icons,

57
00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:05.504
I can take,
the only mandatory one is 512 or 1024.

58
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:11.369
So I can put that one there,
1024, that icon.

59
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.715
I can delete the Flutter ones.

60
00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:16.040
I don't need them.

61
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.152
And now in the manifesto.json,
I will just stay with one icon.

62
00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:25.771
By the way, who is writing that?

63
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:27.300
That's copilot.

64
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.791
Yeah, let me disable the copilot for
a while.

65
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:38.482
So 1024 by 1024, and
this is icons/1024.png.

66
00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:44.880
So if I do this, I think I'm good,
yep, now it's better.

67
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.900
So now my app is installed,
so I need to uninstall it so

68
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.300
I can install it again with a new name and
a new icon.

69
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.856
So in the menu you can
uninstall the PWA in desktop.

70
00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.941
So we can try again, so localhost:3000.

71
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:02.746
We can install the app.

72
00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:09.551
Let me first try to refresh,
I'm still getting the,

73
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:13.796
probably, the cached version.

74
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.866
Let me go to inspect application.

75
00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.093
Yeah, it's still getting
the preview's manifest.

76
00:05:21.177 --> 00:05:26.035
By the way, if you wanna learn more
about manifest and progressive web apps,

77
00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:29.698
there are a lot of content in
the Frontend Master library,

78
00:05:29.698 --> 00:05:32.261
including a workshop that I did on PWAs.

79
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:39.824
And also if you wanna read stuff,
I encourage you to read this,

80
00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:43.834
kind of book, okay, Learn PWA.

81
00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:47.589
I'm suggesting this one
because basically I wrote it.

82
00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:53.612
So it's a book that I wrote it
with the Chrome team about PWAs.

83
00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:57.546
And if you wanna learn everything
that you can put in that JSON file,

84
00:05:57.546 --> 00:06:01.498
if you wanna read about that,
you have this free book, it's free.

85
00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:04.760
Or you can check the videos
on progressive web apps.

86
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.040
So let's refresh that manifest.json.

87
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.690
Let's see if the server is still here.

88
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.899
I don't need to restart the server.

89
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:26.111
Well, that server is using some cache,
so probably I need to first go,

90
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:30.723
and the typical problem
of caching on the web.

91
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:34.314
So I'm gonna clear the cache, refresh.

92
00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:38.838
Let's see if we can get the new manifest.

93
00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:41.560
Yeah, my fault.

94
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.650
I need to rebuild because I'm still with
the old version of the output, okay, yeah.

95
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.200
That is the end of the workshop.

96
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.452
Okay, so I've done it, so now again,
by the way, is this the right one?

97
00:06:57.452 --> 00:07:00.195
No, this is the one, flutter build web.

98
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:06.866
Okay, so now I will get into build web and

99
00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:12.155
I will run, The server again.

100
00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:16.752
Okay, refresh,
now we are getting the new binaries.

101
00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:22.283
So when you're trying to install the app,
it has the right name, the right icon.

102
00:07:22.283 --> 00:07:25.622
And now I have in my Mac, okay,

103
00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:30.750
nice app with the name coffee_master.

104
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.380
This is not a native Mac application.

105
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.760
It's a progressive web app.
