00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.724
Welcome to Introduction to
Flutter Workshop at Frontend Masters.

2
00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:07.132
My name is Maximiliano, I can go with Max.

3
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:12.477
I'm @firt on Twitter, firt.dev my website,
and actually I'm a mobile/web developer.

4
00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.453
So I've been doing web
development since 1995,

5
00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:20.360
and mobile app development since 2001,
that's before Android, before iPhone.

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.980
And I'm from Argentina,
I'm actually living in Buenos Aires.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.542
So before the pandemic,
I was actually a frequent traveler and

8
00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.356
I'm getting back to it.

9
00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:35.419
So we're going to jump
directly into our topic.

10
00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:41.335
So we're going to be making an app today
in this framework known as Flutter.

11
00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:46.704
So we're going to cover first,
the basics of Flutter as a framework,

12
00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:50.080
as a platform, and
also the basics of Dart.

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.358
Dart is going to be the language that
we're going to use to write Flutter

14
00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:55.369
applications.

15
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.104
We are going to understand all
the tools that we need first.

16
00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:03.759
So everything that we need to install
to actually make Flutter applications.

17
00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.234
If you are VS Code developer, so

18
00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:10.367
if you like to use Visual Studio Code,
you can use it.

19
00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:15.288
If you prefer things like JetBrain IDEs,
you can also use Android Studio.

20
00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:19.822
So, we're going to see how to test and
debug your app, so how that works.

21
00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:22.894
How to create and
design your user interface.

22
00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:26.478
So what are the main differences
compared with other frameworks,

23
00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:29.365
including maybe HTML, so
what are the differences?

24
00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:33.901
Then how to navigate between screens,
how to work with data,

25
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.791
including how to access web services.

26
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:41.692
So how to make HTTP requests
using the Flutter framework.

27
00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:46.803
And finally, we're going to see how to
make not just mobile applications for

28
00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:50.116
iOS and Android,
those are our main goals today.

29
00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:54.489
We're going to see also how to
make a progressive web app, a PWA.

30
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.812
A progressive web app for now, as
a quick spoiler, it's actually a website

31
00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:05.222
with some kind of superpowers that can
convert itself into an offline capable

32
00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:10.898
installable app in your device, including
desktop and mobile devices, okay?

33
00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:14.422
But that's a spoiler for
the end of the workshop.

34
00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:21.426
So pre-requisites, I am assuming that you
know programming in any language with OOP.

35
00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:25.796
So if you know what a class is, an object,
an instance, a method, a variable,

36
00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:27.318
okay, you're good to go.

37
00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:32.317
In that website,
firtman.github.io/intro-flutter,

38
00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:38.668
you have a companion website, if you
wanna follow along with what I'm doing.

39
00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:42.892
I'm going to push my code into GitHub but
also you have there all the steps and

40
00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:45.218
the code in case you wanna copy and paste.

41
00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:48.098
The code might not be
100% the same as the one

42
00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:52.783
that I will be doing while live coding,
but it's going to be pretty similar.

43
00:02:52.783 --> 00:02:57.842
So there also we have the slides, in case
you wanna download and see my slides.

44
00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:03.005
That is just for the first part of
the training, most of the workshop

45
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:09.179
will be live coding, and the links for
the requirements that we need to install.

46
00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:13.571
And then I wanna start with that, so
I will get out of the presentation for

47
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.882
a minute and I will go to that website.

48
00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:20.115
Because I want you to start installing and
downloading everything you need,

49
00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:24.686
because it may take time, it depends on
your connection, it might take some time.

50
00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:29.970
So, one good news first is that even
if you have problems installing all

51
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.537
the tools, you can still do Dart coding
and even Flutter coding on the web.

52
00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:39.386
So there are a couple of websites that you
can use to actually even write your user

53
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.848
interface and test your user interface
without installing anything.

54
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:47.082
But of course, we will install all
the tools and run everything locally.

55
00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:49.532
But in case you just wanna play with this,

56
00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:54.435
have in mind that you can play with this
online, and that's not possible on other,

57
00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:57.400
or it's not so
simple on other platforms, okay?

58
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.522
So, if you go to, again,
firtman.github.io/intro-flutter,

59
00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:06.164
you will see here the table of contents,
TOC, and

60
00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:10.536
in inside introduction,
you have here the requirements.

61
00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:14.141
The first requirement is for
you to install Flutter.

62
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:19.118
Flutter, the SDK, is actually
available for Mac, Windows, Linux, and

63
00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:20.461
even Chromebooks.

64
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:26.735
And if you click on this link, you will
go directly to the installation website.

65
00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:33.584
It's just a big zip file for every
platform, it's like 1.5 to 2.5 gigabytes.

66
00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:37.629
You will download that zip file and
you just need to unzip that file, so

67
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.767
there is no installer there, okay?

68
00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:44.755
So you just unzip the contents of
Flutter for your operating system.

69
00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:48.248
And if you click on each operating system,

70
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:53.107
you will also find instructions
on how to update your path.

71
00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:57.403
Because Flutter is heavily based
on a command line interface.

72
00:04:57.403 --> 00:05:02.863
That doesn't mean that we are going to use
that command line interface a lot because

73
00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:07.781
we can use the IDE, but anyway,
we typically need that folder in the path.

74
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:11.374
So if you don't know how to
add a new folder to your path,

75
00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:15.121
to your environment variables
in your operating system,

76
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:18.801
in the Flutter website,
you have all the instructions.

77
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:24.180
After doing that,
then you will need to pick one IDE to use.

78
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.170
I will show you how to use both anyway,
but

79
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.852
you can pick Visual Studio Code or
Android Studio.

80
00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:36.047
In any case, on both platforms, you will
need to download plugins for Flutter.

81
00:05:36.047 --> 00:05:39.571
So by default, they don't support Flutter.

82
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:43.832
So for example, on VS Code,
when you go to your extensions,

83
00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:49.528
you can just search for Flutter and be
sure that you're installing the Flutter.

84
00:05:49.528 --> 00:05:51.761
When you install the Flutter extension,

85
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.598
it will also install the Dart
extension automatically for you, okay?

86
00:05:55.598 --> 00:06:00.171
So that's all you need from this side.

87
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:03.228
What about compiling the apps?

88
00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:06.261
So to compile the apps,
by the way, we didn't yet

89
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:10.608
cover which platforms are compatible,
but I have already mentioned.

90
00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:16.220
And if you're here, you've already know
that Flutter will compile apps for

91
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.132
iOS and Android at least.

92
00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:25.389
But to do that, Flutter relies on the SDKs
and compilers from the official SDKs.

93
00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.679
Meaning that, if you wanna
compile an Android application,

94
00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:32.032
you will need to install Android Studio or
the Android SDK, but

95
00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:34.585
Android Studio includes
everything you need.

96
00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:38.236
So it's available for
Linux, Mac, and Windows.

97
00:06:38.236 --> 00:06:41.454
You also need to go and install and
download Android Studio.

98
00:06:41.454 --> 00:06:45.134
It has an installer, so
it's actually pretty simple,

99
00:06:45.134 --> 00:06:48.046
you just install the app, and that's all.

100
00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:52.777
Even if you're not going to use
Android Studio as your Flutter IDE,

101
00:06:52.777 --> 00:06:56.097
because you can pick Android Studio or
VS Code,

102
00:06:56.097 --> 00:07:01.669
you need Android Studio tools to emulate
and compile the Android application.

103
00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.746
If you don't wanna compile
an Android application,

104
00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.880
then you don't need to install it,
so it's up to you.

105
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.794
And if you want to
compile iOS applications,

106
00:07:09.794 --> 00:07:15.253
the first bad news that I have for
you is that you will need a Mac.

107
00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:19.075
I mean, that's bad news only
if you don't have a Mac, but

108
00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:22.981
to compile an iOS application,
you will need a Mac, okay?

109
00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:24.940
So if you're on Windows or Linux,

110
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.922
you won't be able to use
Flutter to compile the Mac.

111
00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:31.745
But then you can borrow a Mac from
a friend, take your same source code and

112
00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:35.399
then make the compilation there, so
it's not going to be a big deal.

113
00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.824
So in this case, if you have a Mac,
what you need to install is Xcode, and

114
00:07:39.824 --> 00:07:42.667
Xcode is a free IDE
available in the App Store.

115
00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:46.105
So you just need to go to the App Store
in your Mac and download Xcode.

116
00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:51.770
That's for simulating and
also to compiling iOS application, okay?

117
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.148
And the final thing that you need to
download are the workshop's assets.

118
00:07:56.148 --> 00:08:01.244
Just a zip file that you have
here with a couple of images and

119
00:08:01.244 --> 00:08:07.281
some source code that we will use
later today in the workshop, okay?

120
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.389
Just in case you wanna use
Android Studio as your IDE,

121
00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:16.243
let me show you how to install the plugin,
the Flutter plugin.

122
00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:18.628
So when you are in Android Studio,

123
00:08:18.628 --> 00:08:23.413
you don't need to do this if you're
going to use Visual Studio Code.

124
00:08:23.413 --> 00:08:29.639
You go to Preferences, and within
Preferences you have the Plugins section.

125
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:34.008
And within Plugins section, you go to
the marketplace where you can see all

126
00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:39.159
the plugins available, and you just search
for Flutter, I have already installed it.

127
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:43.771
And when you install the Flutter plugin,
it will also install the Dart plugin.

128
00:08:43.771 --> 00:08:48.140
So you have the language and the framework
plugin both at the same time.

129
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.820
So after you have done this, you're ready
to start developing apps in Flutter, yeah?

130
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.411
&gt;&gt; And
you also talked about a Flutter SDK?

131
00:08:57.411 --> 00:09:03.842
&gt;&gt; So the Flutter SDK is actually this
requirement when you install Flutter.

132
00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:08.311
So you always need to install
the Flutter SDK first, and

133
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.699
then the plugin for your IDE.

134
00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:15.064
So the plugin for
any IDE will actually search for the SDK.

135
00:09:15.064 --> 00:09:21.728
So you actually need to download though,
that 1.5 gigabytes of files,

136
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:27.783
and then the plug in your IDE will
actually point to that SDK, okay?

137
00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:32.994
So, at this point, it's a good time
to tell you that compared with other,

138
00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:38.821
let's say mobile UI toolkit frameworks,
Flutter, it's a little bit low level.

139
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:43.734
I mean it's not a problem by itself, but
you will see that there are many steps

140
00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:47.607
that you don't have just one
single style and you're done.

141
00:09:47.607 --> 00:09:52.092
You have to make a lot of stuff up and
running, okay, and

142
00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:56.492
we will get into the details
of everything in a minute.

143
00:09:56.492 --> 00:10:01.128
So at this point, I just want to start
telling you that you should start

144
00:10:01.128 --> 00:10:05.297
downloading these files while
we are talking about Flutter and

145
00:10:05.297 --> 00:10:08.380
what it is and
what are we going through today.
