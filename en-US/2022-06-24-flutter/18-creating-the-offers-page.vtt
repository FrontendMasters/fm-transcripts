WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.610
So now that we have the swatch,
now our app has something.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.132
Okay, so the next step is,

3
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm going to start designing what
is known as the offers section.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.180
So our app we have three sections.

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.920
We have a menu.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.750
Remember we are a coffee shop,
so we are selling coffee.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500
So we have a menu,
we have a section for offers.

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.540
So you can see the recent offers,
and then we have an order.

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.420
Where you can, from the menu,
you can add items to the order.

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.460
That's kind of our roadmap, okay?

11
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.087
For the app.

12
00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:35.442
So we're going to start with that
offers section, and for that,

13
00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:38.614
is the first time where we're
going to create a new Dart file.

14
00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:43.300
I mean we can continue
working on the same file but

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.313
it's not actually the best of the ideas.

16
00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.296
So I'm going to create a new file.

17
00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:56.467
Right click your file and
let's call this, theofferspage.dart.

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.839
It's empty, nothing is there.

19
00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.245
And what do I need to create here?

20
00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:05.787
A widget.

21
00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:08.577
So I'm going to start with
an estate less widget, and

22
00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:11.868
let's see later if I need a state fold,
okay I don't know yet.

23
00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:17.060
So stls, enter on the name.

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.300
Offers page.

25
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.130
Okay, I can save and when I didn't save,
I have arrows everywhere.

26
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.870
What's going on?

27
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.000
We need to import.

28
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.230
So we're going through these many times.

29
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.390
Because it is the first time, I wanna
emphasize on one particular thing here.

30
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.800
When you go over the error you click here,
and you can import the library.

31
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.640
But if I zoom in a little bit, you will
see that I have three versions for import.

32
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.075
I can import Cupertino,
Material, or Widgets.

33
00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:55.976
Widget is some kind of a generic
package that does not contain all

34
00:01:55.976 --> 00:02:00.876
the widgets just the basic one,
padding, okay all of the basics

35
00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:05.525
that has nothing to do with
the UI toolkit that we're using.

36
00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.400
And we are going to use material, okay.

37
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.676
So most of the time you need to
import materials or dart and

38
00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.868
that will solve all the other errors.

39
00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:18.193
Okay if you pick Widget, it it will work
but at one point you will try to use one

40
00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:23.500
widget and it will say that it's not there
because you need to import material.

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.830
So material is a superset
of the widget package.

42
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.083
Okay, I'm going to create
that's going to be the page,

43
00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.840
the page will contain several offers.

44
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.623
I'm going to create
another stateless widget,

45
00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:41.780
stls, with the name offer,
just one offer, okay?

46
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.354
So we're going to render one offer.

47
00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:48.750
Makes sense.

48
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.625
So do you have any question at this point?

49
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.112
Nope.

50
00:02:57.112 --> 00:03:01.500
Okay, so
we're going to work with the offer first.

51
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.550
So what do we need in the offer?

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.940
The offer will have two properties,
a name or a title and a description.

53
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.200
So because it's a property,
it's a property of the class.

54
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.950
So properties are typically final.

55
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.816
So I don't want anyone to change them,
okay?

56
00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:29.960
So, finally remember,
it's the key word for immutable variables.

57
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.510
So I'm going to create here the title and
another property for the description.

58
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.633
If I have two properties
that sets a string and

59
00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:43.610
they're not accepting news,
remember nullable types.

60
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.995
It gave me an error because saying, hey,
your final variables need to value and

61
00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:49.440
I'm not accepting news.

62
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.049
So what I need is to add those
properties in my constructor.

63
00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:55.842
How?

64
00:03:55.842 --> 00:03:59.826
Require these.title,

65
00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:04.770
require this.description.

66
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.520
If I use a trailing comma when
I'm saving it goes to a new line.

67
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.450
Remember the trailing comma will make
the magic for a multi line experience.

68
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.747
Makes sense?
So now what I want is to add to that list,

69
00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:21.185
two text.

70
00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:26.176
One for the title, one for
the description for my offer, okay?

71
00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:28.121
So first how do you do that?

72
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.000
I need a layout container.

73
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.140
You always need a layout container, okay?

74
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.213
So one can be a column.

75
00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:41.090
So I can return a column
that has children.

76
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.630
Okay?
And we are going to start with two texts.

77
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.790
So text, I will take the title.

78
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.354
So these the title, we don't need this but

79
00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:59.504
if you wanna be more explicit
where the description is going,

80
00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:03.810
it's coming from,
something like that, okay?

81
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.970
These are titles, these are description.

82
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.283
Here its complaining because hey, It's
saying you don't need this, I mean it will

83
00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:14.920
work anyway but it's saying hey, you don't
need this actually, as I mentioned before.

84
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.700
So we have two texts there, so
how can I see that on the screen?

85
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.035
We don't have a way to preview, which
is individually like other platforms.

86
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:31.505
So here, we actually need to
put that on the screen somehow.

87
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:35.555
So something that I can do,
is if I go to my offers page,

88
00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:41.191
instead of a container, I can render one
of my offer that receives a title and

89
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:43.675
a description because I said so.

90
00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:45.660
Okay?

91
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.676
So this is my great offer ever, and

92
00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:53.260
the description will be buy one,
get 10 for free.

93
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.560
That's a great offer.

94
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.050
Trailing comma, save multi line.

95
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.160
Why it's complaining?

96
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.004
Pay their cost, so quick fix.

97
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.770
Adds the const, okay?

98
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.670
So that's the offers page.

99
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.710
But the offers page is
still not on the screen.

100
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.920
What do I need to do to
put it on the screen?

101
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.780
Well, let's go to the main.dart file.

102
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.972
And when we were rendering the homepage,

103
00:06:24.972 --> 00:06:30.014
the greet widget,
I need two R, the offers page.

104
00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:35.720
As simple as that and
now I can see my two texts there.
