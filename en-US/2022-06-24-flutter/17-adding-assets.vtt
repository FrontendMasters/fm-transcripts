WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.812
Now that we have that little code ready,
actually,

2
00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:10.091
we're not going to use grid anymore,
we can keep it there.

3
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:12.046
It's not going to be part of our app,

4
00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:15.845
we're going to start start building
our coffee masters application.

5
00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.047
So if you're following along
the companion website,

6
00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:25.753
we will start with chapter three,
creating the offers section.

7
00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:29.733
First, we will need some assets,

8
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:34.684
mostly images that we
are going to use now.

9
00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:38.440
They are not so many, probably three
images only, okay, that we need.

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.370
These are actually part of the assets
that you can download from this website.

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.539
So, how assets work in Flutter.

12
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.100
Where should I put my assets?

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.399
So if I go back to Xcode, [INAUDIBLE]
sorry, if I go back to Visual Studio code,

14
00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:03.210
I don't have like an assets folder or
an image folder.

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.590
Well, actually, I can create one.

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.322
You can create folders
here without any problem,

17
00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:13.932
not in the live, in the root, right?

18
00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:15.853
So be careful with that.

19
00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:19.769
Live is for our data files only,
so such as images.

20
00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:25.096
But how does the Flutter framework know
that we have added that folder and

21
00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:31.460
we are expecting Flutter to include
the assets in that folder for our users?

22
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.407
We need to set up that in the YAML
configuration file pubspec.yaml, okay?

23
00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:46.514
So if you go to pubspec.yaml,
we need to scroll a little bit and

24
00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:51.583
there is a place here that says,
to add assets to your

25
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:56.209
application, add an asset
section like this.

26
00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.208
And it's give you an example here
that you can comment if you want.

27
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:07.479
It's not a big deal, you can just,
it's assets column and

28
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.339
then a new line with several
declarations with a dash.

29
00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:17.178
You can add images one by one or
the whole folder and you are saying here,

30
00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:22.098
hey, when you compile the app, I want
to put all the files that I have here

31
00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:26.710
in the images folder in whatever
container you're using.

32
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.238
It can be the Android application, the AUS
application, the executable Windows or

33
00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:31.890
it can be the output folder for the web.

34
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.770
Okay, makes sense?

35
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.636
So, now what I need when
you save the pubspec.yaml,

36
00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:43.568
it will run a tool that checks if
there are changes in dependencies and

37
00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:49.180
blah blah blah, but in this case,
nothing has changed actually.

38
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.789
So, now that I have the images folder,

39
00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:57.510
I have declare my images in the assets,
I need to put the images, okay?

40
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.059
So, if you go to the zip folder,
that I share with you,

41
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:10.400
I have here this, there is a folder
there with the name assets.

42
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.233
So what we need is to put all
these files in the images folder

43
00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.511
that we have just created.

44
00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:19.041
But before doing that,

45
00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:23.180
I wanna explain to you what are those
folders that we have there.

46
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.511
So, this is going to be our logo, so let
me show you the logo, you can see it, so

47
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:29.569
that's the logo.

48
00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.400
So, the thing is that today on
the mobile space and also on desktop,

49
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.263
but mainly on the mobile space, we have
devices with different resolutions, okay?

50
00:03:38.263 --> 00:03:42.253
So it's pretty common to have a low
resolution ,middle resolution ,high

51
00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:43.410
resolution device.

52
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.124
So, that means that we
cannot use the same PNG.

53
00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:50.292
I mean, if you're a web designer or
web developer,

54
00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:55.787
you know the same problem exists there,
that's why you have SR set,

55
00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:59.610
so SR set for example,
or the picture element.

56
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.669
So you need to provide several bitmaps.

57
00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.038
Flutter lets you define several
versions of the same file for

58
00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:13.091
different resolutions if
you're using these folders,

59
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:18.791
2.0x, 3.0x, 4.0x and
then files with the same name.

60
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.040
Actually what you will do on different
platforms, we'll use different techniques.

61
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.241
It will pick the right one for

62
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:29.737
the particular device based
on the device resolution, so

63
00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:36.420
actually the 4.0x file is bigger,
In pixels, okay?

64
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.620
So we have more resolution for
high resolution Android devices.

65
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.409
Okay, make sense?

66
00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.922
So when you are creating assets for
Flutter,

67
00:04:44.922 --> 00:04:50.940
you need to use PNG most of the time and
you need to provide all these versions.

68
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.665
If you don't provide one version,

69
00:04:52.665 --> 00:04:55.260
it will pick the closest one
to the one that is needed.

70
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.170
Okay, make sense?

71
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.434
So after saying that, then I'm
going to take all these assets and

72
00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:08.158
then I'm going to arrange them,
put them within images, okay?

73
00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:09.869
Like so.

74
00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:14.350
So, now we can actually
use what we have here.

75
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.630
So, you should open a images and
you should see something like this, okay?

76
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.074
Make sense?
Yeah.

77
00:05:21.074 --> 00:05:25.891
&gt;&gt; That background and
black coffee PNG is not gonna be used at

78
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:30.040
all if you have the 2x,
3x ,4x already there?

79
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.144
&gt;&gt; Lemme see if I get it, so the black
coffee is not in the 4x ,3x and 2x, right?

80
00:05:36.144 --> 00:05:37.530
That is what you mean?

81
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.295
So the background, we have the same file
with the same name on different folders.

82
00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:44.788
It's the same file but
in different resolutions.

83
00:05:44.788 --> 00:05:48.088
For the black coffee,
I didn't create different resolutions,

84
00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:51.928
we will take just the same one because
it's just a dummy image that we will use

85
00:05:51.928 --> 00:05:54.320
in a minute ,it's that one.

86
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.206
And because we don't want to
actually make different versions,

87
00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:03.930
that's not worth the time, so
that what I want to emphasize with that is

88
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.200
that you actually don't need to have
all the files in the subfolders.

89
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.294
On each situation you will check,
do you have alternative versions are not?

90
00:06:13.294 --> 00:06:15.301
And if you have them it will use it,

91
00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:18.430
if not it will just use
the only version that you have.

92
00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:21.456
Okay?

93
00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:25.790
&gt;&gt; And what are the sizes of them because
I see, I look there I can't know?

94
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.030
&gt;&gt; The size, it's your size, so
there are no standard sizes.

95
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.360
So it's up to you.

96
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.900
It's up to the design that you're making.

97
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.360
The only thing is that,

98
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.190
the one that says 2x multiplies by two
does the original size by three by four.

99
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.735
Okay, make sense?

100
00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:49.300
&gt;&gt; Is there a resolution
that maps to the 2x?

101
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.376
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately,
that's a good question, so typically,

102
00:06:54.376 --> 00:07:00.470
designer tools prepare for
doing this for iOS native development.

103
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.245
They have the same problem but
they solve this in a different way and

104
00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:11.310
they have tools to export Android PNGs
that are also similar but different.

105
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:17.785
So the main graphic solutions out
there that are Adobe Photoshop or

106
00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:22.999
Illustrator or XD,
experience designer or sketch.

107
00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:24.439
All these tools for

108
00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:29.482
doing mobile app design they don't
have a Flutter export system.

109
00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.744
There are a couple of online
tools that you can use, I mean,

110
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:37.117
you upload the asset and it will return
you a zip file with all these subfolders,

111
00:07:37.117 --> 00:07:41.800
but not from the from the region and
tools, okay, unfortunately.

112
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.255
They prepare for native development but
not for Flutter, for some reason, but

113
00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:47.932
you can do a plugin, I guess.

114
00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:51.453
&gt;&gt; So we just make the 2x 3x and
4x folders and then make the files,

115
00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:54.735
how do we know which device is
gonna use which one or do we not?

116
00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:58.914
You don't need to care actually, so I can
tell you because it depends on the device.

117
00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:03.369
So actually, for example,
on the iPhone side you have here,

118
00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:07.223
you have today, devices on 2x,
devices on 3x, for

119
00:08:07.223 --> 00:08:11.438
example the Pro and
the pro Max will actually take the 3x.

120
00:08:11.438 --> 00:08:16.630
The iPhone, the iPhone 13, the mini,
the SE will take you the 2x.

121
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.510
iPhone will never take 4 this as of today,
as of shooting this video, so

122
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.810
we don't have the issues
with 4x resolution.

123
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.642
On the Android side,
it depends on the device.

124
00:08:27.642 --> 00:08:30.720
The cheaper the device,
the lower the resolution.

125
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.233
So Galaxy s22 will use 4 and
so on, but actually,

126
00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:40.269
you don't need to care too much about
that, so this is managed by platform.

127
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:48.780
Because in terms of pixels on your screen,
they are the same.

128
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.876
You are just changing the resolution, so

129
00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:55.660
how many pixels do you
have within your pixel?

130
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.660
The same happens on the web today,
by the way, if you're doing a website,

131
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.026
unless you're using SVG,
if you want a high resolution logo,

132
00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:06.672
you need to provide several versions
of your PNG file or JPEG files.

133
00:09:09.557 --> 00:09:15.970
We do that with SRC set in the IMG tag,
for example, okay?

134
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.027
Cool.

135
00:09:18.027 --> 00:09:23.561
Well, now that we have those images,
we are ready to start creating our app or

136
00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:27.475
at least to make it look like our app,
okay?

137
00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:31.183
So first, if we go to up,
I'm still on main.dart, so for

138
00:09:31.183 --> 00:09:35.245
a while we are keeping
ourselves in in mind.dark.

139
00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:39.774
So, if I scroll a little bit,
we have my app that has a title and

140
00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:45.100
also my homepage has a title, so
we need to start changing this.

141
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.580
So instead of Flutter demo,
we're going to use coffee masters.

142
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:54.110
The title of the material app is actually
being used in the operating system.

143
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.803
So when you see for example, all the open
windows in the operating system, IOS,

144
00:09:58.803 --> 00:10:02.196
Android or desktop,
that's the title that you will see.

145
00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:06.714
And the title that you see here
it's actually going to be used for

146
00:10:06.714 --> 00:10:10.154
the visible screen, okay,
does it make sense?

147
00:10:10.154 --> 00:10:15.308
What is this title actually?

148
00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:19.449
My homepage does not exist
in the Flutter framework,

149
00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:22.945
it's just in a class
that was created here and

150
00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:28.470
it has a property final, so
it's an immutable variable, okay?

151
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.874
It's a final string title,
it's an immutable variable and

152
00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:36.339
it's receiving that title
as a name argument.

153
00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:40.965
Actually, I'm going to delete it because
this is part of the template, but

154
00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:44.744
I don't think I need it, so
I'm going to delete it from here.

155
00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:50.287
I'm going to delete the reference
in the constructor and

156
00:10:50.287 --> 00:10:52.960
also the property, okay?

157
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.833
So now I'm getting an error here
at some point because it's okay,

158
00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:57.230
we don't have a title.

159
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:03.079
Well anyway, because here what they
want is actually to put the image,

160
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.548
okay, the logo.

161
00:11:04.548 --> 00:11:07.700
I wanna see the logo instead of a text.

162
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.080
How to render an image.

163
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.510
Well, it's not a text, so I don't need the
text with it, I will use an image with it.

164
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:21.229
The image with it has actually
a constructor with a lot of possibilities,

165
00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:26.221
but it also has name constructor,
remember name constructor?

166
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:29.712
I select dot and then they can
create an image, from an asset,

167
00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:32.140
from a file, from memory or from network.

168
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.907
I remember someone asked if we
are forced to use the from prefix,

169
00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:40.410
it's not being used here.

170
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.494
So I can create an image widget from
an asset and I just need to put.

171
00:11:44.494 --> 00:11:50.842
The path suggests emushes/logo.png.

172
00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:54.200
Okay?

173
00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:01.449
If I save this, let's see,
let's rearrange my Windows a little bit.

174
00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:06.596
Like so, I have Chrome here somewhere,
the other Chrome, that one,

175
00:12:06.596 --> 00:12:11.757
it says unable to load assets, so
we are seeing an error there, okay?

176
00:12:11.757 --> 00:12:12.822
So what's going on?

177
00:12:12.822 --> 00:12:17.622
Every time you change assets, so
anytime you change things that are not

178
00:12:17.622 --> 00:12:21.950
actually part of the lib folder,
you need to make a full reload.

179
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.734
So you need to like stop and run again,

180
00:12:24.734 --> 00:12:29.528
because it's not taking the changes
on those external folders.

181
00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:32.251
So if I'm changing the asset, okay,
it's not going to take it, okay?

182
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:35.180
Doesn't make sense and
by the way, I'm here.

183
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.337
If you follow here at the bottom,
at some point you have,

184
00:12:40.337 --> 00:12:45.380
I think it's in the previous example,
you have how to add the image anyway.

185
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.760
So, now I'm going to run this again.

186
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.368
Wait for it,
remember when you see one Chrome instance,

187
00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:59.627
that's your browsing
navigation context and

188
00:12:59.627 --> 00:13:04.490
not actually the one that we
are waiting for, it takes some seconds.

189
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.690
Okay, there we are.

190
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.750
It's slowing, I'm going to open
the inspector has to turn on the device

191
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.020
mode so I can see a smaller window so
it fits there on the screen.

192
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.210
So, you can see that my logo is there,
so it's working.

193
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.864
Maybe it's not the right background color.

194
00:13:26.864 --> 00:13:29.449
So, how to change the background color.

195
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:36.290
By default is that blue, that has to
do with a material, material theme.

196
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.531
Material design,
we are using that design and

197
00:13:39.531 --> 00:13:42.533
it has something known as primary swatch.

198
00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:44.564
These currently on blue.

199
00:13:44.564 --> 00:13:48.743
So of course maybe you're thinking,
well, we can add any color here.

200
00:13:48.743 --> 00:13:54.125
Yeah, we could add any color but
material design wants

201
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:59.048
us to use one of the colors
from the system, okay?

202
00:13:59.048 --> 00:14:01.427
I mean we can create our
own swatch of colors but

203
00:14:01.427 --> 00:14:05.350
I wanna show you that it's
actually pretty pretty good.

204
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:11.120
If I go here to the companion website,
I think I will move to the next lesson.

205
00:14:13.595 --> 00:14:15.310
I think it's here.

206
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.180
Here you how how to create an image.

207
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.990
You have two links here, the material
color website and the material palette.

208
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.260
The first one is official and
the other one is from the community.

209
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.908
This is all the colors that are actually
provided with the material design or

210
00:14:32.908 --> 00:14:38.302
the swatches and they are optimized for
better contrast automatically,

211
00:14:38.302 --> 00:14:41.270
so we don't need to deal with contrast.

212
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.808
But for example, when we put one
of those in the background for

213
00:14:44.808 --> 00:14:47.679
the foreground it picks
one that actually works.

214
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:52.271
So when you said blue it's not
just one blue or the blue,

215
00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:58.054
it's actually going to use one of
these subversions automatically.

216
00:14:58.054 --> 00:15:00.432
So, yeah and
here you can pick one of those and

217
00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:03.198
see how your app will look
like with that one, okay?

218
00:15:03.198 --> 00:15:06.387
And because we are talking about coffee,

219
00:15:06.387 --> 00:15:10.860
we're going to use brown as
our main color swatch, okay?

220
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.674
So that's the one on won,
I just gonna come here and

221
00:15:14.674 --> 00:15:19.130
change color blue with color brown and
now it looks better.

222
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.660
Again, do you wanna create your
own color swatches, you can, okay?

223
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:31.025
But, the advantage of using material
design is that it was already prepared

224
00:15:31.025 --> 00:15:35.933
by professional designers and they,
unless you really have your own

225
00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:41.190
colors from your own company,
it's a good idea to stay with safe colors.

226
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.090
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat that again about how
that automatically chooses to color?

227
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.010
You said something about automatic.

228
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:55.040
&gt;&gt; So, if you look here, I'm not saying
primary color, I'm saying primary swatch.

229
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.130
So what is that?

230
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.240
Every color has a swatch.

231
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.120
Swatch means, it has that same
brown color in different shades.

232
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.254
That it's actually what we see here,
it's the same color in different shades.

233
00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:11.997
Now when we define the swatch,
the material theme,

234
00:16:11.997 --> 00:16:17.199
the material designer will actually
pick the right color on each place.

235
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:21.230
So, here we have examples
on how it will look like.

236
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.543
So if you see here,
it's using one brown at the top and

237
00:16:24.543 --> 00:16:28.018
the header, another kinda brown here,
another here.

238
00:16:28.018 --> 00:16:31.858
So, based on the widget that you're
using and the behavior of that widget,

239
00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:34.329
it will use different
swatches automatically.

240
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.550
Okay?

241
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.311
So you then you select the swatch and then
the framework will do its work for you, so

242
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:44.110
it will look like this, okay?

243
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.814
So you don't need to go element
by element and setting the color.
