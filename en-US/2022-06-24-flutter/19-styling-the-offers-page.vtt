WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.415
So now I need to make a little web,
I'm going to make some designs here so

2
00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:05.590
it will look better.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.570
And I think that you will get
the idea pretty quickly, so

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.629
first, I think these texts they
need a different font size.

5
00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:18.952
So first, so but
before doing the font size,

6
00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:22.330
I wanna show you something that
is actually pretty interesting.

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.866
We know that the typical joke in
CSS is how to center in CSS, right,

8
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:32.230
so centering text well with Flexbox
is simpler but it's always a shock.

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.193
How to center things here
there is a widget for that, so

10
00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:43.380
for example we can take the column or
the text and

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.230
click on that little help and
select Rub with center.

12
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.749
Center is another widget
that receives one child.

13
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.610
And now there are center.

14
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.850
So everything is a widget [INAUDIBLE]
widget, so you can get really messy.

15
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.059
But at any time,
you can extract that into another widget.

16
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.960
In fact there is even an option
here saying, extract the widget.

17
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.419
And also we have, extract which are the
last one, we also have an option to remove

18
00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:24.820
this which for example you say,
I don't want the center.

19
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.460
But you know what, I don't like it.

20
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.116
So then you remove the center,
but it's not just the center,

21
00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:32.824
you need to remove the center and
then the child declaration and

22
00:01:32.824 --> 00:01:35.540
then one parenthesis on the other side.

23
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.118
So instead of doing that,
you can click here and say,

24
00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:40.480
remove this widget, and
it will do that for you.

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.840
So with flutter, we want to use
the tool as much as possible.

26
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.100
Okay, make sense?

27
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.600
It will make your life much easier.

28
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.588
So talking about the font sizes.

29
00:01:57.588 --> 00:02:01.804
Okay, we already mentioned
that the text has a nine

30
00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:05.440
argument Style that receives a text style.

31
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.972
Instead of creating a new
text style as I did before,

32
00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:19.130
I can ask the theme, the material
theme for a previous style, okay?

33
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.710
So to do that you'll use
theme with capital T-OFF.

34
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.834
It receives a context that I
don't know exactly what it is but

35
00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:36.204
it's an object representing where
you are in the widget tree.

36
00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:39.550
And we received that here as an argument.

37
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.264
So we are going to pass
that to theme of like so,

38
00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:54.340
and the theme has many things in such
as text theme, they have colors.

39
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.118
They have a lot of stuff that
you can use directly from here

40
00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:01.810
instead of setting your own size manually.

41
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.050
Okay, makes sense?

42
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.750
So there are many things that
you can get from the theme.

43
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.850
If you wanna get it from here, okay,
it's up to you if you wanna write your own

44
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.928
theme, or you wanna take one of the themes
that you have here, for example,

45
00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:17.930
you have headline one, this is h1.

46
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.150
It's actually really big.

47
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.258
Too much from my point of view but
you can say,

48
00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:30.339
when a wonder how h5 looks better and
for the other one,

49
00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.468
training coma remember
will make the trick.

50
00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:42.955
The other text can also have
a style theme of context,

51
00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:48.755
textile up, sorry,
with all the text theme,

52
00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:52.623
headline six, training, and

53
00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:56.960
now it's looking better though.

54
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.690
You want panning?

55
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.720
Well, I can take the center and
rub these with panning.

56
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.450
I can take the other center and
wrap this with panning.

57
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.670
Save now it's getting better, yeah.

58
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.680
&gt;&gt; So know when you're
adding these headline five,

59
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.928
it's still it's it's already
playing the default text theme,

60
00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.650
right of your theme
&gt;&gt; Is not actually default.

61
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.632
This is actually what you asked me for,
like,

62
00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:32.040
how can we create our own textiles and
reuse them?

63
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.610
This is kind of the way.

64
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.663
In this case, they are storing a theme and
you can replace those.

65
00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:38.540
&gt;&gt; if you don't like, what is the theme?

66
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.489
If you look at the main Dart, the theme
declaration is actually here where it says

67
00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:45.440
material app,
there is a theme declaration.

68
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.350
Can you see that?

69
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.880
So actually you can come here and
change for example, your themes.

70
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.027
So here texting you can actually
declare like global themes,

71
00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:05.050
colors and declarations that you can
use anywhere in the widget tree.

72
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.170
Okay, makes sense?

73
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.852
So here instead of hard coding,
my own text size,

74
00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:17.170
my own phone size,
I'm actually taking that from the theme.

75
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.650
They say global object
injector in the tree.
