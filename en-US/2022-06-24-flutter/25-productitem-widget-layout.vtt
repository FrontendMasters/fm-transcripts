WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.346
Actually, we are going to
download this from the network.

2
00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:11.028
But before doing that, maybe it's time to
start doing something in the menu page,

3
00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:13.393
so we can actually see something.

4
00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:18.637
So I'm going to, again,
really yelled my Windows,

5
00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:22.726
so we can see the preview there, like so.

6
00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.050
And what I have here is the menu page,
okay?

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.165
So, the menu page will render items,
like product items, okay?

8
00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:36.778
So, what I maybe want to
design here quickly is another

9
00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:41.812
widget that will render one
product in particular, okay?

10
00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:45.578
So it's not gonna be a big deal,
he has an image and

11
00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.271
a couple of text, so
it's not really a big deal.

12
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:52.841
But let's make it, so
we can do it quickly,

13
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.939
it's not going to be so problematic.

14
00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:01.381
So, another statement we should
try to do it here in the page or

15
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:06.840
in a different file, at this point,
you make that decision.

16
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.856
If you feel like it's part of
the menu page, you're not going

17
00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:15.582
to use it anywhere else, it's short
enough, maybe you can use it here.

18
00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:20.711
If you feel like it's reusable and you may
wanna use it later, or is this too big,

19
00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:25.473
it has its own unique problems, well,
you separate that in your new file.

20
00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:30.698
So it's actually up to you,
it's another stateless

21
00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:36.164
widget as the last enter,
let's call it product item.

22
00:01:36.164 --> 00:01:41.141
The idea is that this product item
will actually render one item,

23
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:43.776
one product on the screen, okay?

24
00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:48.102
So, because it's going to render one item,
I need the product, right?

25
00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:50.795
Because if not,
I don't know what to render.

26
00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:56.114
So, I'm willing to receive
the product somehow.

27
00:01:56.114 --> 00:02:01.252
Some nature receive it
as a require constructor

28
00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:06.123
Element as we did before.

29
00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:11.074
So we have the product, we probably
need to import the data model to make

30
00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:14.873
it work Like so.

31
00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:22.580
And it's complaining that hey,
that property must be final,

32
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.547
because if not, it's not gonna work.

33
00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:32.419
So widgets, input properties for the
widget must be declared as final, okay?

34
00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.706
Make sense.

35
00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:38.353
Well, now, for here,
I may wanna use a container,

36
00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:41.955
by the way remember the padding widget?

37
00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.851
Actually the container has also a padding.

38
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:50.985
So, sometimes in flutter, we have several
ways to do exactly the same thing.

39
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:53.720
So, we can use a padding widget or

40
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.935
a container with a body declaration,
is the same.

41
00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:01.643
So in this case, I can say that
I want a padding of eight and

42
00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:04.427
the container has a child, not children,

43
00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:09.093
child, only one, only one widget,
the container contains only one.

44
00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:13.769
So, I may wanna use,
remember the card we use before.

45
00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.192
Card is typically being used a lot for
elements that are individual elements,

46
00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:26.729
it carries visual components created by
material theme that has an elevation.

47
00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:31.717
So if I have a card I have an elevation
that makes that little shadow over

48
00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:33.504
the element looks fine.

49
00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:36.371
And then we will put something as a child.

50
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:39.473
For example, let's start with a text,

51
00:03:39.473 --> 00:03:44.779
I wanna see the product name,
something like that, training coma.

52
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.058
Of course, I'm not seeing this, why?

53
00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:51.049
Because my menu page is rendering nothing,
but

54
00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.751
now instead of container,
what I can do is to render a product item.

55
00:03:56.751 --> 00:04:00.109
That one of them, the which of them,
I'm creating at the bottom, okay?

56
00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.347
So I can actually see that on the screen.

57
00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:07.405
So the programming receives and
mandatory product.

58
00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:11.106
So I actually need to pass
a product as an argument,

59
00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:13.958
like a dummy product, it makes sense?

60
00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:21.494
So also I can make the product first,
par p equals to a product with id 1,

61
00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:25.818
name, dummy product, price 1, 25,

62
00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:30.903
image, I don't care so,
something like that.

63
00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:35.837
So I will pass that product
as an argument, p, sorry.

64
00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:44.556
So now I'm seeing that dummy
product on my menu page, okay?

65
00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:47.591
Yeah, it's a sealed pretty this point.

66
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:52.115
So what I want, is I want to see
an image and you must first, and

67
00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:56.569
then the product name, and
the price, okay, makes sense?

68
00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.545
So because I have something, something,
and something, what is that?

69
00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:02.840
A column, okay.

70
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.356
So I will wrap this text into a column,
wrap with column.

71
00:05:07.356 --> 00:05:12.201
So I have the product name,
I will add the product price, and

72
00:05:12.201 --> 00:05:14.959
they said that they want an image.

73
00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:20.241
For that, I have a dummy image in the
images folder, it's called black coffee,

74
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:24.064
because we didn't download
things from the network yet.

75
00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:28.112
We don't have the real URL of the image,
so it's just that one.

76
00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:34.706
So it's image from the assets,
images/black_coffee.png, okay?

77
00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:39.270
Coma, coma, coma, coma,
here is complaining, why is complaining?

78
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.489
The price is not the string, okay?

79
00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:49.660
So it's a double, and
text is expecting a string.

80
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.924
So a simple way to go over
that is to open, in fact,

81
00:05:53.924 --> 00:05:56.472
maybe I wanna add the $ sign.

82
00:05:56.472 --> 00:06:03.064
The dollar sign is for templates,
so actually needs to be escaped.

83
00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:06.869
So this will look like this, look at that.

84
00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:11.161
I have double dollar sign,
hey like that but the first one is escape,

85
00:06:11.161 --> 00:06:15.823
so it's actually the dollar sign character
that they want in the output and

86
00:06:15.823 --> 00:06:18.200
the other one is just the expression.

87
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.478
Now that we render the price,
so if I save this, okay,

88
00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:27.781
it's not loading the images because
I have a typo, coffee, okay?

89
00:06:27.781 --> 00:06:34.472
And this is how it looks like now,
it's getting better, okay?

90
00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:40.054
So first, you can see that by default
its center, okay, interesting, right?

91
00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:44.309
So by default is send the text center,
how can I change that?

92
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:48.994
Columns or rows, they have some
other arguments that they can set,

93
00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:51.715
that can let you change the alignment.

94
00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:55.909
And we have two ways to define alignment,
the main axis and

95
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.888
the cross axis alignment.

96
00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:02.786
So if I'm in a column,
the main axis alignment is vertical, and

97
00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:05.159
the cross axis is horizontal.

98
00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:10.504
If I'm in a row,
it's exactly the opposite, makes sense?

99
00:07:10.504 --> 00:07:17.240
So, in this case, we try and
shoot a change, the main or the cross.

100
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.029
I'm in a column, I don't want the text
to be centered, that's the goal.

101
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:25.806
I see you're doing this.

102
00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:26.644
&gt;&gt; Cross.

103
00:07:26.644 --> 00:07:32.176
&gt;&gt; Cross, so the options available
here are actually part of a class or

104
00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:35.195
constants of cross axis alignment.

105
00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:39.341
So we have a start, okay?

106
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:41.342
And it did the trick.

107
00:07:41.342 --> 00:07:46.617
Remember, so if you're in a row, cross
is going to be the opposite direction,

108
00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:48.997
so we have main axis and cross axis.

109
00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:52.864
Every time you are doing layout
that's how it works, okay?

110
00:07:52.864 --> 00:07:56.496
Well, then I need some paddings,
you know how to add padding, so

111
00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:58.951
I can click on the text and
rob with padding.

112
00:07:58.951 --> 00:08:03.922
The same on the other one,
wrap with padding, save, all right?

113
00:08:03.922 --> 00:08:10.261
It's looking like that, not so bad,
let's say one the text will be bold.

114
00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:15.886
Every property that has to do with font,
it's actually under the style declaration.

115
00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:20.449
It's a text you create a new textile
with a lot of properties and

116
00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:22.957
we have the font-weight, okay?

117
00:08:22.957 --> 00:08:28.043
And the font-weight has a set of options,
such as bold.
