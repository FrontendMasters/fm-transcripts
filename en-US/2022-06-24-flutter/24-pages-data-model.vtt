00:00:00.172 --> 00:00:05.089
Well, now, it's time to work with
the menu, and then the order.

2
00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.743
So for the menu,
we will need to create some data models.

3
00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:14.314
So if you're following along
the companion website,

4
00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:18.995
now we are in chapter four,
creating the model, okay?

5
00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:24.122
So, for creating the model,
what we actually gonna do

6
00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:30.040
is to create a new file,
a new dart file, not in pages, in lib.

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.120
We're going to call that datamodel.dart.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.204
And here we are going to
create a couple of classes.

9
00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:39.967
I'm going to go fullscreen because we
don't need to see the preview right now.

10
00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.891
So, what is the data model?

11
00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:44.990
In this case,
we can use any architecture, but

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.261
I'm going to use the simplest one, they're
going to [INAUDIBLE] Class product,

13
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:55.316
the class category because the products
are actually stored in categories.

14
00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:59.131
And ItemInCart,
because we will have a cart.

15
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.944
The ItemInCart has a product and
a quantity.

16
00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:05.115
So I have two of those,
three of those, okay?

17
00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:09.322
So, the category, let's start with
category, we have a property name, and

18
00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:12.217
also a property that is going
to be a list of products.

19
00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:18.927
Okay, this is playing OOP with dart,
no Flutter here.

20
00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:22.873
So, why it's complaining,
because I'm not using optionals.

21
00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:28.701
So, meaning that I need a constructor that
will receive the name and the product.

22
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:33.775
So I'm going to create
the constructor category,

23
00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:37.198
and I can receive those like this.

24
00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:42.991
In this case, they are mandatory and
they are position based,

25
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:46.941
or I can put these in a code block,
like so.

26
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:48.287
And now other require.

27
00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:49.700
What's the difference?

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.067
That now when you
construct your categories,

29
00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:57.308
they're going to be named parameters,
name arguments.

30
00:01:57.308 --> 00:01:59.610
You pick the one because
this is our model.

31
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.042
So you can use any any solution, okay?

32
00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:08.360
So, ItemInCart will
actually have a product and

33
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.222
an integer for quantity.

34
00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:16.641
And the same thing,
I need to create its constructor

35
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:21.580
that will receive the product,
this product.

36
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.467
Remember that this is a shortcut, so
I don't need to assign or anything.

37
00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:32.031
This quantity will receive that.

38
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:34.324
And for the product,
we have a couple of properties.

39
00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:36.471
We have an ID, let's say integer.

40
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:41.273
We have a name, that is a string,
capital S, remember.

41
00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:44.778
We have a price and we have an image.

42
00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:46.835
And we need to do exactly the same.

43
00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:51.128
So, a constructor that will receive

44
00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:56.252
required this.id, require this.name,

45
00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:01.661
everything is required in this case,
right?

46
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.491
This is actually matching a JSON file,
a web service,

47
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:12.173
that's where you go into,
we'll see in a minute, semicolon.

48
00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:13.147
I think it's fine.

49
00:03:13.147 --> 00:03:16.439
Remember if you use a trailing comma,
when you save,

50
00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.788
it rearrange this in a different way.

51
00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:21.674
Okay, you're trailing
comma after some things.

52
00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:24.372
The only thing that I'm
going to do here also,

53
00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:27.215
this is something that
we haven't seen before.

54
00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:28.192
This is a class product.

55
00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:31.246
Okay, this is a constructor.

56
00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:33.769
I'm going to create another property.

57
00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.571
So I have here Properties.

58
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:41.664
Some kind of a property that is
calculated on the fly, okay?

59
00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:44.682
Like a compute property
on some other places.

60
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:49.018
So I'm going to say this, is a string
property that we have together.

61
00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:51.269
I will call this imageUrl.

62
00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.079
And the code for
this with which you return a string,

63
00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.597
that will be like this, Firtman.

64
00:03:57.597 --> 00:04:00.224
You have this to copy and
paste from the companion website.

65
00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:06.524
Github.io/coffemasters/api/images and

66
00:04:06.524 --> 00:04:09.518
the name of the image.

67
00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:14.281
Let me put this in a new line so
you can actually see that.

68
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:16.781
It will look like this, okay?

69
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.357
So that's the full URL,

70
00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:22.568
the fully qualified URL of the images
that we will download later.

71
00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:25.661
But I'm not creating
another real property,

72
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:29.636
this is a compute property,
okay, that has only a gutter.

73
00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.431
You cannot set the property from here.

74
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:35.039
That's why there is no need to add
this in the constructor, okay?

75
00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:35.802
Makes sense?

76
00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:39.311
That's not our data model,
actually pretty simple, okay?

77
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.290
Not a big deal.
