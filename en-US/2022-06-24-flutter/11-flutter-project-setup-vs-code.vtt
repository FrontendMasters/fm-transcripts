1
00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:04.797
But then I think that most of you will
prefer Visual Studio Code because

2
00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:08.716
you're more used to that IDE,
it's the cool IDE in town.

3
00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:14.117
So, let's see how to do the same, the
project directly in Visual Studio Code.

4
00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:19.349
I can keep it minimized or
something like that, I will close chrome.

5
00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.201
So, back in VS Code,
how do you create a flutter project?

6
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:27.620
First, remember that we need the plugins,
so

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.531
you need to go the extension and
install the flutter extension, so

8
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:37.195
you need to have the flutter extension and
install and enable.

9
00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:41.792
When you have that, you need to go
to the view command palette, or

10
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.574
use the shortcut that we're already
used to in Visual Studio Code.

11
00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:51.799
And you just start typing flutter and
you will see a couple of commands

12
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.951
available for flutter,
including creating a new project,okay?

13
00:00:56.951 --> 00:01:02.139
So I'm going to create a new project,
and I can pick here which kind of

14
00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:08.328
template do I wanna use, application,
module, package, plugin, skeleton.

15
00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:12.412
A skeleton will also give you a List
View Detail View flutter application.

16
00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:16.091
Anyway, we are going to
create an application,

17
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:21.132
it's a default application that
we got in Android Studio, okay?

18
00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:25.072
So application, and
okay where do you wanna store that?

19
00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:28.226
I'm going to store that probably here,

20
00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:33.162
and I will submit, I will publish
this into GitHub in a minute.

21
00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:37.711
So you will be able to get my code or
follow my code from GitHub,

22
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.851
if you want to.

23
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.032
By doing this from scratch,
what's the project name?

24
00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:47.431
I'm going to call this coffee_masters,
that's gonna be the name of our app.

25
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:54.867
You can use underscore or you can join
the two words, it's just the same, okay?

26
00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:58.480
So if you wanna just say coffeemasters,
it will work.

27
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.758
So, you press Enter, and
that will actually create

28
00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:09.825
The project,
you can see it's running something,

29
00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.874
it's using actually the SDK.

30
00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:15.371
The first time you do that,

31
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:21.570
is probably Visual Studio Code will
try to locate your flutter SDK.

32
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.142
If it's not finding your flutter
SDK in the normal places,

33
00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:28.712
it will ask you to locate the SDK.

34
00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:32.941
Remember the SDK is
the flutter downloader,

35
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:39.516
the flutter package that you
downloaded this morning, makes sense?

36
00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:42.847
And here I have something, in fact,

37
00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:48.120
it's the same code that we
have before on Android Studio.

38
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.488
And now instead of looking up,

39
00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:55.872
we need to look down where it says
here a Chrome (web-javascript).

40
00:02:55.872 --> 00:03:01.258
So at the bottom of VS Code,
you can click where it says Chrome,

41
00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:04.625
and you can choose a different device.

42
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:08.773
You can open an iOS simulator
if you're on a Mac, or

43
00:03:08.773 --> 00:03:13.210
you can open an Android emulator
if you are on any OS with

44
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.958
Android Studio installed, or
you can use the Chrome Web.

45
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.134
For now, I think that if we just
select from Web, it's okay.

46
00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:23.890
How do you run the app?

47
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.020
There are many ways, you can use the run,

48
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.148
debug button you have there
at the top right, VS Code.

49
00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:37.179
You can go to the section for
debugging and select run and debug.

50
00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:41.858
Different ways to do the same, or
you can also select the main, you run,

51
00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:43.102
start debugging.

52
00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:45.396
Because we are in our flutter project,

53
00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:48.048
Visual Studio Code knows
exactly what to do.

54
00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:52.350
So, I'll click run and debug,
and this will launch Chrome,

55
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.252
by the way it's going to use a new
instance of Chrome without plugins.

56
00:03:57.252 --> 00:04:00.855
So if you are using Chrome
as your main browser,

57
00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:06.094
you will see now we will have two
instances of Google Chrome running.

58
00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:11.159
The first time it takes some time,
some seconds, and or minutes.

59
00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.674
And finally,
I have the same experience that we saw

60
00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:18.935
before from Android Studio, okay?

61
00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:24.336
We have this little app,
little counter up and running.

62
00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:26.412
In my case, okay?

63
00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:31.209
I can show you that from here
now I have a like floating

64
00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:35.244
toolbar in VS Code that
you can move around,

65
00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:40.481
without floating toolbar you
can pause the current app,

66
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:46.616
you can stop the current app,
you can reload it, or hot reload it.

67
00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:49.749
But hard reload works automatically
every time you save, okay?

68
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.583
So you don't need to go and click on that
light icon, okay, that lightning icon,

69
00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:54.987
it will work automatically.

70
00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:59.540
For some reason you wanna force a reload,
you can use this button.

71
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.954
And this one, it's an explorer,
an inspector, okay?

72
00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:06.955
We're going to see that later.

73
00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:10.414
Anyway, I'm going to
stop this with a stop.

74
00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:16.560
And now I will pick, just to show you
something different, the iOS simulator.

75
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.893
So now it's going to open the iOS
simulator that comes with Xcode.

76
00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:27.003
So if you have a Mac and if you have
already installed Xcode, this should work.

77
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:32.744
And when I have selected this,
I can try to run again.

78
00:05:32.744 --> 00:05:35.706
But now I have selected the iOS simulator.

79
00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:43.046
So, the first time will take a couple
of seconds again, so we need to wait.

80
00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:47.389
If it's not working for you at this point,
I will show you what to do.

81
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.988
How you can see what's missing,
so which steps are missing?

82
00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:55.022
As you can see here it
says running Xcode build.

83
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:59.860
So actually the flutter
SDK is talking to Xcode,

84
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.581
the native iOS IDE to
compile the application.

85
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:10.402
And now I have on my iPhone,
the same counter application is working,

86
00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:14.163
and it looks like any
other app in the system.

87
00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:17.302
Yeah, it doesn't contain an icon and
that sort of things, but

88
00:06:17.302 --> 00:06:21.522
yeah, it's a default template, it's
actually an app installed on my simulator.

89
00:06:21.522 --> 00:06:26.079
And if I have my own iPhone
connector in this computer,

90
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.450
I might be able to get this
app directly in my iPhone.

91
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.530
There are a couple of steps to be done,
that we can see later.

92
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.655
But you can actually run this
on your own iPhone or iPad.

93
00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:39.650
What about Android?

94
00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:44.511
I can change here, again at the bottom,

95
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:49.026
remember I'm using the bottom
selector where it says iPhone 13.

96
00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:52.488
I can click there and
select one of the pixels that I have here,

97
00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:57.017
you probably have only one because the
first time you installed Android Studio,

98
00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:58.826
it includes only one emulator.

99
00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:02.841
So I will select that one,
now it's open, the emulator.

100
00:07:05.406 --> 00:07:09.191
And now if I just stop
the previous execution,

101
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:14.821
that's the iOS execution and
run it again, it will open in Android,

102
00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:18.820
it will compile an Android application,
okay.

103
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.434
It says running Gradle task, Gradle
is a tool coming with Android Studio.

104
00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:27.791
It will compile an Android application and
install that in the emulator.

105
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:32.063
The first time it takes time,
and as I mentioned before,

106
00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:36.251
it might take half an hour if
you have a slow connection.

107
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:41.263
So, it's something that happened with
me because I already have the data.

108
00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:45.633
And now I have the same
app running on Android,

109
00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:49.789
it looks like any other Android app, okay?

110
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.930
And it's even installed, okay?

111
00:07:52.930 --> 00:08:00.144
It's that one, it doesn't contain an icon,
okay, but it's actually a real app.

112
00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:06.726
If I connect through USB, my Android
device, and I'm going to do that later,

113
00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:12.434
you will be able to install and
see your app on your own phone as well.

114
00:08:12.434 --> 00:08:16.996
So you can see it's the same app,
it looks exactly the same on iOS,

115
00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.110
on Android, and in Chrome, I said website.
