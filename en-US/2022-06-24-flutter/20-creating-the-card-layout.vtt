1
00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:07.247
I'm going to wrap now my whole
column in another widget call card.

2
00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:12.227
But when you look here, there is no wrap
with card, but there is one that says,

3
00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:13.898
Wrap with widget....

4
00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:16.939
That's the one I'm going to use, and
I'm going to write card manually.

5
00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:23.945
Okay, so a card, if I save, it just
a container that by default has no UI,

6
00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:29.151
but I can change some properties,
such as elevation.

7
00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:32.092
And I can say elevation: 7, for example.

8
00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:33.263
What's an elevation server?

9
00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:36.234
Well, let me see if you can see that here.

10
00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:43.027
There is a little,
Some kind of shadow there,

11
00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:47.330
okay, that is actually defining this.

12
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.254
And of course,
I can change the background color.

13
00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:51.699
How can I change the background color?

14
00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.577
Well, the card has a color property.

15
00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:57.673
So we actually you can see here.

16
00:00:57.673 --> 00:01:02.352
So for example, I can take for
the colors, I can take any color,

17
00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:04.185
any swatch, any shade.

18
00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:10.656
I'm not saying this is going to look fine,
but I can do something like this.

19
00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:12.997
Maybe the card need some padding, right,

20
00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:15.935
because I want the card to
separate from the borders.

21
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:23.187
So then I click over the card,
click here, Wrap with Padding &gt; Save.

22
00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:24.858
And now, it's looking like this.

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.844
What if you say, hey, but
it's taking the whole height.

24
00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:35.755
What if I want it to be like
a little piece of information there?

25
00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:39.621
Well, I can take the card and
use another container.

26
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:41.711
So you can see everything
is a widget here.

27
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:45.169
Do you remember I mentioned
that this can get really messy?

28
00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:49.697
This is pretty common in Flutter,
widget with, widget with, widget with,

29
00:01:49.697 --> 00:01:51.941
widget with, widget with, widget.

30
00:01:51.941 --> 00:02:00.411
So there is another widget
that has the name SizedBox.

31
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.207
SizedBox can have a fixed height.

32
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.990
I don't know, 200 or maybe 150.

33
00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:12.421
You play with this until you're happy.

34
00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:16.975
Okay, make sense?

35
00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:18.978
So how do you debug this?

36
00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:22.908
Because I mean, maybe you're thinking,
hey, but this is a web.

37
00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:28.516
This is the web, so I can just right
click and inspect like on my website.

38
00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:32.271
Actually, not really.

39
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:39.306
By default, the renderer, that is, the
engine that is actually rendering this,

40
00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:43.535
it's based on a 2D canvas drawing,
not an HTML.

41
00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:46.027
So this is not actually a div.

42
00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:49.096
So here I have web components,

43
00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:53.941
but I can see the whole thing,
but nothing else.

44
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:59.906
So I don't have HTML elements to debug,
okay?

45
00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:04.864
But something that I can do, fortunately
is there is an inspector from Flutter.

46
00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.913
So, from Flutter is exactly that icon,
that one, Okay?

47
00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:20.616
That is also available in the View &gt;
Command Palette if you search devtools,

48
00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:21.855
Open DevTools.

49
00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:25.839
So the DevTools will let you
open different inspectors,

50
00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.162
the widget inspector,
CPU inspector, network inspector.

51
00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:33.042
And also,
you can use this in a web browser.

52
00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:36.284
So you can open a web browser
version of the inspector or

53
00:03:36.284 --> 00:03:41.219
you can open thee inspector here directly
in Visual Studio Code or Android Studio,

54
00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.419
if you're picking Android Studio.

55
00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.374
So, here you have,
is difficult to use this with a really

56
00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:52.309
big font size, but
you have the widget tree.

57
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:56.655
You can click on each element
in the widget tree and

58
00:03:56.655 --> 00:04:03.294
see information about the current width,
height, and size of the widget.

59
00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:08.725
So if you wanna debug your widget,
this is how you're going to do that.

60
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.684
&gt;&gt; Can you do changes the other way,
just to play with it?

61
00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:11.659
You probably can, right?

62
00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.640
&gt;&gt; What do you mean the other way?

63
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.287
&gt;&gt; I mean, just from the
&gt;&gt; IPhone to change properties here?

64
00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:19.668
&gt;&gt; If you can just
&gt;&gt; It's not like the browser toolkit,

65
00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:20.233
okay?

66
00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:23.590
So there are some things that you can
change, for example, on containers.

67
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.238
Let me see where I have a column here.

68
00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:30.086
So on the column, you can change, for
example, this, we can play with this

69
00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.476
until, well, it's not going to
make a difference at this point.

70
00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:37.457
So there are some things that you can
change, my UI is not so complex yet

71
00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:40.711
to actually see some changes,
but not a lot of property.

72
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:44.423
So, if I change the width,
it's not working.

73
00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:48.203
It's mostly for the bargain, okay, for

74
00:04:48.203 --> 00:04:52.532
making a small adjustments,
and that's all.

75
00:04:52.532 --> 00:04:58.366
Well, to finish this widget,
I'm going to add another container.

76
00:04:58.366 --> 00:05:03.992
I can actually add it anywhere,
it can be my card or it can be my column.

77
00:05:03.992 --> 00:05:05.622
That is cool.

78
00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:08.742
Let's use BoxDeecoration.

79
00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:12.119
Box decoration, now, I'm getting an error.

80
00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.100
Let's see why.

81
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.460
BoxDeecoration, Well,

82
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.104
let's use the BoxDeecoration,
let me go back a little bit.

83
00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:24.243
Command C.

84
00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:27.544
Let's apply the BoxDeecoration
to a container first.

85
00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:28.947
So do I have a container?

86
00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:29.678
No, what's a container?

87
00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:31.054
Like a div.

88
00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:34.107
So what I want this to
use a background image.

89
00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:37.654
So remember that I do have a background
image here, background.png.

90
00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:43.314
I wanna use that image as a background
of my card, that's the idea.

91
00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:47.581
So for that,
I need a container that is like a div.

92
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:51.349
So I cannot apply the background
image to any element.

93
00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.159
So I need a container where?

94
00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.617
You pick where actually.

95
00:05:54.617 --> 00:06:01.482
It can be here, Wrap with a Container,
and the container has a decoration.

96
00:06:03.557 --> 00:06:09.467
And the decoration is another object
called DecoratedBox, another widget.

97
00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:12.882
Fact, it's BoxDeecoration.

98
00:06:12.882 --> 00:06:15.772
And BoxDeecoration accepts many things,
such as an image.

99
00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:17.384
It also accepts shapes.

100
00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:19.490
You can apply rounded corners.

101
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.393
So there are many box-based things.

102
00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:27.545
And we know how to render an image,
we did that before.

103
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:31.993
We can do Image.asset and
the name of the image.

104
00:06:31.993 --> 00:06:34.023
Or also, there is another widget.

105
00:06:34.023 --> 00:06:36.502
No, it's the same, it's called AssetImage.

106
00:06:36.502 --> 00:06:39.610
There is an image only for
asset, if like the same, okay?

107
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.509
So there are so many widget.

108
00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.480
In fact,
they're more than 400 widgets in Flutter.

109
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.392
Okay, so
you will never remember all of them.

110
00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:56.092
So AssetImage and the name of the image,
that is images/background.png, okay?

111
00:06:56.092 --> 00:06:59.408
Trailing coma if you
wanna get to a new line.

112
00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:04.283
And let's see, it's asking me for
some const here.

113
00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:05.772
We can add that later.

114
00:07:05.772 --> 00:07:07.191
Trailing comma here as well.

115
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.770
So we can arrange this a little bit.

116
00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:21.322
DecorationImage, Think I'm
missing here one,

117
00:07:23.174 --> 00:07:27.663
Element, the image needs
a DecorationImage.

118
00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:31.666
And the DecorationImage
finally needs the image.

119
00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:33.453
So that's what I'm missing.

120
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.944
So now I will do this again.

121
00:07:35.944 --> 00:07:38.155
So you get the final idea.

122
00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:43.009
And now,
it's complaining because of const.

123
00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:46.220
By the way, when there are a couple
of const, you can just say,

124
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.442
I want to draw all the const to the file,
all the missing const.

125
00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:53.375
Okay, remember that const is
not actually mandatory, okay?

126
00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:57.623
So we are seeing the image,
it doesn't look great yet, okay?

127
00:07:57.623 --> 00:07:59.489
It is like, so what do we have?

128
00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:01.001
We have the container,

129
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:06.303
the container has a decoration with the
DecorationImage that has an image inside.

130
00:08:06.303 --> 00:08:11.621
And the container also has a child
that goes on top of the decoration.

131
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:12.690
Okay, makes sense?

132
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.891
But this is still weird.

133
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:18.471
We just need to change the property.

134
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:26.219
Think on where it's on
the DecorationImage that is actually,

135
00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:31.932
let me see why it's not giving me image,
fit.

136
00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:35.483
Its BoxFit.cover.

137
00:08:38.557 --> 00:08:41.925
And finally, we have something like that.

138
00:08:41.925 --> 00:08:44.200
So I'm changing a lot of properties here.

139
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.399
What do I need to do here now?

140
00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.170
Why is it complaining?

141
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.630
Const modifiers.

142
00:08:52.203 --> 00:08:57.833
So at this point,
probably it gets really messy.

143
00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:00.542
So, there is a moment when
you're doing Flutter,

144
00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:02.881
where you feel like you're death, right?

145
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.430
Everything is an error, and
then a comma will make a magic trick.

146
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.832
Of course, that happens everywhere,
but with this syntax,

147
00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:11.090
it's actually pretty common.
