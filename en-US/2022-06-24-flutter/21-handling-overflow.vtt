00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.390
So now, it's time to clear
the design a little bit.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.980
For example, maybe I don't think I like
that shade version of the amber color.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.575
We can try different ones like ad.

4
00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.015
Also you have a little preview
here of the color, and

5
00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.078
you see that within the source code, okay?

6
00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:21.668
So we have a shade 50 for example,
that may look a little better there.

7
00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:27.680
Also, maybe, what if I want
a background color over the text?

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.755
I want the text to have a background
color, a different background color.

9
00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:37.460
So you can have some kind with some
padding or something like that.

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.814
So you need to play with everything.

11
00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:44.626
So everything here is just taking
the text applying the padding,

12
00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:46.383
applying a container.

13
00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:50.830
For example the container,
I can take the text.

14
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.761
The text that is rendering
the description, and the title both,

15
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:56.770
and I can apply to it a container.

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.665
So, rap with container.

17
00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:06.943
Container has a color purple that defines
background color for that container.

18
00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:10.352
And I can use any color here for example,

19
00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:14.468
the same amber shade 50
from material design.

20
00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:17.778
So, if you pay attention there,

21
00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:22.870
we do have that background
color over the text now.

22
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.690
And, if you want padding, well,

23
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.788
the padding I should apply
another padding here.

24
00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:35.093
Should apply the padding to the container,
or to the text.

25
00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:39.055
What do you feel?
If I want more space with that

26
00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:41.533
background color.

27
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:48.877
So, it will get different results if we
apply the padding to the container or

28
00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:53.950
to the text, that is the container child.

29
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.919
So if I apply the padding to the text,
more padding,

30
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:02.535
I can say instead of 816,
you will see what happens here.

31
00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:09.080
So applying the padding before or after
in the tree, will make things different.

32
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.210
And I can use eight here.

33
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.200
And then I can do the same or
something similar to the other text.

34
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.224
And if the same maybe later homework,
you can make a widget that can

35
00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:24.623
be known as text with padding and
color, whatever you wanna call that.

36
00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:26.834
And then you reuse that widget twice.

37
00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:30.193
Remember, we are going to
create reusable widgets.

38
00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:34.278
So every time you find that you're
doing the same thing more than one,

39
00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:37.201
maybe it's a time for
creating a widget for that.

40
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:42.530
So, this text, I'm going to add
a container so I can set its color.

41
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.450
I will take the same color as before.

42
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.240
The color of amber shade 50,
remember it's one of the material colors.

43
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.790
And, we also need to
add a padding of eight.

44
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.430
So, to the text, look at these.

45
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.860
Sometimes, the little help disappears
from the ID, and be sure to go.

46
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.734
It's common.

47
00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:09.563
When they disappear, you can actually
get the same menu if you right click,

48
00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:11.083
and you go to refactor.

49
00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:14.100
So right click refactor,
you get the same menu.

50
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.850
And after a while it reappears again,
anyway.

51
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.780
So I'm going to add padding.

52
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.146
So now, it gets better.

53
00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:26.971
And my yo first page,
that is the one that I have here,

54
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:29.880
what if I wanna add more offers?

55
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.388
I want two offers.

56
00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:35.803
I need always a container,
a layout container.

57
00:03:35.803 --> 00:03:39.205
If you want two elements,
so if I want two offers,

58
00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:41.640
I need to wrap these in a container.

59
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.610
Which container should I use this for
horizontal scrolling, let's say column.

60
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.132
So, I will take the offer,
now my little light bulb is back,

61
00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.230
I will wrap this in a column.

62
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.066
But sometimes it doesn't appear, so you
actually need to sometimes click again, or

63
00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:01.300
click outside.

64
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.320
If not, you can always rub with
whichever and do it manually.

65
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.599
So, rub would column.

66
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.930
So now I have one offer.

67
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.685
Now it's complaining because it says hey,
what you can do for

68
00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:18.262
the cost, if you can put the cost to
the whole array instead of adding cost

69
00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:23.770
declarations on each item, and
you can just copy this couple of times.

70
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.554
So we have a couple of offers.

71
00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:30.330
If I save this,
now we see these on the screen.

72
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.740
But, the look at the bottom.

73
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.310
It's overflow.

74
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.640
And by default, we don't have a scroll.

75
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.395
So, flutter by default will
not give you a scroll, and

76
00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:48.198
it will give you those warnings saying
that you're getting out of the screen,

77
00:04:48.198 --> 00:04:50.776
the content is getting out of the screen.

78
00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:52.160
How to solve the problem?

79
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.320
We don't have a scroll view,
something like that.

80
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.182
We can add a modifier to the column,
or we can use a list view.

81
00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:02.637
A list view is like
a column with a scroll.

82
00:05:02.637 --> 00:05:04.296
So, [LAUGH] It was simple, right?

83
00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:07.313
Instead of column, we use this view.

84
00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:13.245
And now we have a nice section for
our offers section.
