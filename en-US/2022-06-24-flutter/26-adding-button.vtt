1
00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.843
The other thing that I
need here is a padding.

2
00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.532
So I will like to see
a padding at the right,

3
00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:11.231
I want to position in here that says, Add.

4
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:16.246
If I can add that product into my order,
that's kind of the goal.

5
00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:19.223
How can I add the button there?

6
00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:20.880
What do you think, sir?

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.410
&gt;&gt; Row.

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.390
&gt;&gt; A row, where?

9
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.920
Where should I add a row here?

10
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.082
So let me add the const
that are complaining here,

11
00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.803
either row because now I need row, where?

12
00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:32.940
It's kind of where should I add a row?

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.328
So actually, what I need is, I need the
image, and after the image, I need a row.

14
00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:41.777
So I can add a row manually
with some children.

15
00:00:41.777 --> 00:00:46.928
Okay, and
the children's are these two paddings.

16
00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:49.826
First, but if I do this,
this is what's gonna happen.

17
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.566
Now, they are in a row and
I don't want that.

18
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.288
&gt;&gt; Another column.

19
00:00:57.288 --> 00:01:01.699
&gt;&gt; Another column, make sense?

20
00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.406
So I need, first, a column.

21
00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:09.326
Makes sense?

22
00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:12.565
Then we need a row, but
then within that row,

23
00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:17.439
we need another column for the title and
price and then the padding.

24
00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.749
We have a question on the chat, yeah.

25
00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:22.236
&gt;&gt; Why wouldn't you wrap
the elements in a single padding?

26
00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:26.202
&gt;&gt; In a single padding?

27
00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:29.018
Padding, padding, I understand.

28
00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:31.873
Padding accepts child not children.

29
00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:38.310
So if you wanna do that, it's fine,
but you need another container, okay?

30
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.639
So a padding, you cannot apply
a padding to two elements.

31
00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.159
So a padding is to one element.

32
00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.616
So if you have a padding and you have two,

33
00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:52.478
you need another container in the middle,
like another row, another column.

34
00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:55.545
But it's possible here, I have a row, so

35
00:01:55.545 --> 00:02:00.551
now I could remove these paddings and
get the padding out to the row.

36
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:05.862
It's not going to be the same because you
won't be having padding between the text.

37
00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:09.824
But you layout your design by
having in mind that some widgets,

38
00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:14.932
they have child as a property and some
widget, they have children as a property.

39
00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:19.720
So, and you cannot change that, is not
your decision, is the wish of decision.

40
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.508
The padding widget
accepts only one element,

41
00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:27.988
you will apply the padding
to one element only, okay?

42
00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:31.768
So we were adding, we set a new column.

43
00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:34.807
So I'm going to wrap this into a column.

44
00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:41.336
I'm going to add the second padding
as a sibling of the first one.

45
00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:42.243
So we are back here.

46
00:02:42.243 --> 00:02:45.093
Yeah, we need to solve
some problems there.

47
00:02:45.093 --> 00:02:47.526
You can see it's getting
messy pretty quickly.

48
00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:51.648
In just five minutes,
I have, I don't know,

49
00:02:51.648 --> 00:02:55.262
probably six, seven nested elements.

50
00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:57.804
This is pretty common in Flutter.

51
00:02:57.804 --> 00:03:00.341
And also, I need in the row.

52
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.922
Fortunately, we have these
hints to know where we are.

53
00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:07.825
So probably here,
I need to add a botton, okay?

54
00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:11.834
Unfortunately, we don't have a button,
say, we don't have buttons.

55
00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:14.261
Actually, there are many buttons.

56
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:19.266
And they use button as a suffix,
so they don't call button,

57
00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:24.874
we have a TextButton,
we have an ElevatedButton, an IconButton.

58
00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:27.133
ElevatedButton looks like a button.

59
00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.370
And the TextButton is just like a link.

60
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.689
Also, we have a LinkButton
as well available.

61
00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.751
But let's say an ElevatedButton
will probably make the trick,

62
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.874
It has an onPressed property and
child, child is for

63
00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:44.419
the contents of the button box.

64
00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.854
And what do I want?

65
00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:50.798
Sure, can I add a text here,
like a string, saying Add?

66
00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:51.891
Not gonna work.

67
00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:58.620
Every time you see child, the type
expected is a widget, not a string.

68
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.370
So I need to actually create a widget,
for example,

69
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.416
a text widget that will have
the text inside, Trailing comma.

70
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:09.269
And what about onPressed?

71
00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.031
What do you think this
is in terms of type?

72
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:14.397
What should the type of
onPressed should be?

73
00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:15.801
A function.

74
00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:18.633
So how to create a function here.

75
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:24.357
Parentheses, code or
parentheses, an arrow function.

76
00:04:24.357 --> 00:04:27.250
Arrow function only for one expression.

77
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.762
Okay, Text(Add) is complaining
because it's constant.

78
00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:32.940
Okay, so let's see.

79
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.136
Look at the color of the button.

80
00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:41.991
By default, It's using the color of
the swatch that I define the theme.

81
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:46.742
I can change that if I want to,
but if you're okay, it's fine.

82
00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:48.133
So what?

83
00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.873
We have some layout issues to solve here.

84
00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.685
So first, the price for

85
00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:59.176
some reason is centered with the title,
why?

86
00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:03.053
So let me show you something,
what if I wanna add another product here?

87
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:06.494
So I wanna see two
products at the same time,

88
00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:09.288
what do I need to do in the menu page?

89
00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:13.467
&gt;&gt; The widget, I mean,
let's make column, I guess.

90
00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:15.869
&gt;&gt; A column, there is no other way.

91
00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:20.656
So I need to create a container, so if
you want to, one after the other, column.

92
00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:23.243
So I need to wrap this into column.

93
00:05:23.243 --> 00:05:28.001
And now, I can add another product
with another, let's say q.

94
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.264
Let's make it q.

95
00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:33.311
I'm going to create another one,

96
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:38.153
another Dummy Product,
this is a much larger, okay?

97
00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:41.601
Well, I am not seeing it, but
we know that instead of a column,

98
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:42.848
we can use a ListView.

99
00:05:42.848 --> 00:05:45.506
So we have it curl.

100
00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:51.907
So what I wanna show you is this,
they are not even uniform.

101
00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:53.204
So what's going on here?

102
00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:57.407
By default, the children of rows and

103
00:05:57.407 --> 00:06:01.338
columns, they have their width,

104
00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:07.181
their size little flexible
based on the contents.

105
00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:08.807
And I'm not sure I like that, right?

106
00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:10.706
It's kind of weird.

107
00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:14.342
So something that we can do, okay, so
there are many things that you can do.

108
00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:18.022
Okay, there are many ways to
solve this layout issues.

109
00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:23.423
So now, we need to go back to the problem
item and see what else we can play with.

110
00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:26.541
We can play with alignments of things.

111
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:30.783
For example, in this case,
we have this column,

112
00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:34.226
is the one that has the name of the price.

113
00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:39.131
So, we can solve the center problem, okay?

114
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:44.722
Though we wanna move the price there by
changing the property of this column.

115
00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:48.364
Is it gonna be main axis
&gt;&gt; Cross.

116
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.754
&gt;&gt; Or cross axis?

117
00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:52.428
&gt;&gt; Cross.
&gt;&gt; Cross.

118
00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:56.509
Let's say CrossAxisAlignment.start.

119
00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.418
Save, yeah, that'll work.

120
00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:04.308
Now, I need to work with
the row because I wanna change

121
00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:08.668
how the elements in the row are aligned,
okay?

122
00:07:08.668 --> 00:07:11.758
Should I use cross or main?

123
00:07:11.758 --> 00:07:16.100
I wanna see if I can
move this button there.

124
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.568
That's a goal, main, mainAxisAlignment.

125
00:07:21.568 --> 00:07:25.150
So we are going to take elements
from mainAxisAlignment.

126
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:33.088
There is one that says
a space between the children.

127
00:07:33.088 --> 00:07:37.478
So it will actually put a space
between the children and

128
00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:40.064
push the children to the edges.

129
00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:43.558
Make sense?

130
00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:44.983
That looks good.

131
00:07:44.983 --> 00:07:47.605
Yeah, maybe we need some
padding on the button.

132
00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:48.838
Can we do that?

133
00:07:48.838 --> 00:07:50.120
We know how to do that, right?

134
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.145
So we click on the ElevatedButton.

135
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:56.039
Let's say some right padding only.

136
00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.883
So how can I only right padding?

137
00:07:59.883 --> 00:08:03.500
As far as I wrap these in a padding, but

138
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.598
then I don't want to apply to all,
only to the right.

139
00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:15.907
Of course, I'm doing this with,

140
00:08:15.907 --> 00:08:21.172
let's say nice speed,
even if I'm explaining this.

141
00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:25.667
When you're doing this for the first time,
your speed will not be this one, right?

142
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:29.439
But you get used to that,
to know where to add the elements,

143
00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.992
where to change the cross,
blah, blah, blah, okay?

144
00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.169
Makes sense?

145
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.854
&gt;&gt; The row and
the main axis still throws me off.

146
00:08:37.854 --> 00:08:43.089
&gt;&gt; So the row, it's actually put
the elements in the row horizontally.

147
00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:49.207
So the mainAxisAlignment defines the
alignments of the elements horizontally.

148
00:08:49.207 --> 00:08:51.357
So you can say, I want them center,

149
00:08:51.357 --> 00:08:54.532
I want them here at the start,
I want them at the end.

150
00:08:54.532 --> 00:08:58.972
Or there are other options,
thare are space between, space around.

151
00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:02.330
I mean, this is actually
pretty similar to Flexbox.

152
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.744
In fact, it's based on Flexbox.

153
00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:09.408
So if you are a web designer, and
you have been using Flexbox and

154
00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:14.429
CSS, you will be at home here this
with the names and how that works.

155
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.506
So, you can play with that.

156
00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:20.822
For example, instead of a space between,
we can create a space around.

157
00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:22.135
And in this case,

158
00:09:22.135 --> 00:09:27.314
it's adding a space in the middle of
the two elements and also around.

159
00:09:27.314 --> 00:09:32.523
So we have a space,
maybe doesn't look so bad, but anyway,

160
00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:38.058
we have a space between elements and
also around the row, okay?

161
00:09:38.058 --> 00:09:40.885
Then you have a space evenly.

162
00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:46.256
This is exactly the same as space
no matter how big the elements are.

163
00:09:46.256 --> 00:09:52.855
I think for this case, space between
is the one, I don't want spaces around.

164
00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:59.174
For that, I use paddings, okay,
to define the spaces around.

165
00:09:59.174 --> 00:09:59.922
Does it make sense?

166
00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:09.052
Yep, So
then what you do with the Add button?

167
00:10:09.052 --> 00:10:10.499
I have a button, okay?

168
00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:14.438
And the button has an onPressed,
I need to do something.

169
00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:19.145
Well, again, I don't know, I don't have
the data yet, I don't have the repository.

170
00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:21.232
But I'm a widget.

171
00:10:21.232 --> 00:10:26.656
I'm a product item,
my responsibility is to render a product.

172
00:10:26.656 --> 00:10:31.872
Actually, I don't think I know what to do.

173
00:10:31.872 --> 00:10:37.591
So most of the time, in this case,
what I want is to move these events up.

174
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:43.013
So whoever is calling me, hey,
the user has clicked add here.

175
00:10:43.013 --> 00:10:44.803
It's your problem now.

176
00:10:44.803 --> 00:10:48.199
How to move an event up.

177
00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:52.838
We create a property of type function.

178
00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:55.689
So I can call this onAdd.

179
00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.550
So it's like a callback JavaScript.

180
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.264
So I'm going to also receive
this in the constructor.

181
00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:05.487
It's another property.

182
00:11:05.487 --> 00:11:09.605
This onAdd, like so.

183
00:11:09.605 --> 00:11:13.933
And then the only thing that I'm
doing here is just calling onAdd.

184
00:11:13.933 --> 00:11:16.800
And I can pass maybe the product,
that's an argument.

185
00:11:19.042 --> 00:11:24.776
Again, I'm responsible for the little
widgets, I don't know what to do.

186
00:11:24.776 --> 00:11:27.626
I don't know where the data is located,
I don't care.

187
00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:29.013
I shouldn't care.

188
00:11:29.013 --> 00:11:35.329
And then I'm just moving,
lifting the value up.

189
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:39.709
So now I'm getting errors at the top

190
00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:44.095
because I need to implement onAdd.

191
00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:47.111
Make sense?
For now, I can just put empty go,

192
00:11:47.111 --> 00:11:50.743
we will probably solve
this pretty quickly.

193
00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:55.059
So we've been playing a little
bit with cross alignments,

194
00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:58.785
with layout, so
we haven't seen anything so new.

195
00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:05.598
Modelland plane or fighting with
alignments, paddings, and all that stuff.

196
00:12:05.598 --> 00:12:07.103
By the way, do we have margin?

197
00:12:07.103 --> 00:12:11.669
No, a margin is a padding that
you apply outside of the content,

198
00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:15.740
outside of the background color or
something like that.

199
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.783
If you have a container with a background
color, you can apply padding outside

200
00:12:19.783 --> 00:12:22.371
the container and
padding inside the container.

201
00:12:22.371 --> 00:12:25.576
The padding inside the container
is the CSS padding, and

202
00:12:25.576 --> 00:12:28.593
the padding outside
the container is the CSS margin.

203
00:12:30.902 --> 00:12:33.169
Makes sense?

204
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.417
I mean, Kibera, you don't do this,
but I wanna show you that you can.

205
00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:41.810
You can apply padding to the padding,
it doesn't make sense, okay, I know.

206
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.235
But in fact,
it's not even appearing in the list, but

207
00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:45.781
they can actually do it manually.

208
00:12:45.781 --> 00:12:50.041
I can apply padding to the padding, of
course, they're gonna say, hey, come on,

209
00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:52.321
you can just use one and
increase the number.

210
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:53.215
But it's a widget.

211
00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:58.148
So actually, you can have a widget with
a widget with a widget with a widget

212
00:12:58.148 --> 00:13:00.228
with a widget without issues.

213
00:13:00.228 --> 00:13:05.427
This is actually using high performance
structures, so your objects,

214
00:13:05.427 --> 00:13:10.552
so it's not going to be a high performance
problem to create a large tree
