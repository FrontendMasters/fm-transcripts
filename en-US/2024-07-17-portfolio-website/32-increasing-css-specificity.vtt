1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.960
So here, it doesn't quite work.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.140
So what we've actually got going
on is a little bit of a conflict.

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.766
Again, once we start
putting things together,

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.520
we come into conflicts with our styles and
their specificity.

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.271
So what's happening here is that earlier
in our styles up towards the top here,

6
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:24.774
we have a class plus an HTML element,
a project figure.

7
00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.644
And we said display block.

8
00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:29.986
Later in the document,
we have a class by itself,

9
00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.914
but we have no HTML element with it.

10
00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:35.774
So our grid styling is not being applied.

11
00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:39.514
It's actually being overridden by
what comes earlier in the document.

12
00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:42.637
We need to increase our specificity
in order to make this work.

13
00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:46.290
So I am going to add
figure in front of this.

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.990
Now it has equal specificity.

15
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.680
We have a class and an HTML element.

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.560
Earlier in the document,
we had the same, so

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.300
the one that wins comes
later in the document.

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.532
If you're wondering about how we knew all
of these rules, the intermediate HTML and

19
00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:02.691
CSS course here will go through
all of the specificity stuff and

20
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:05.682
explain all of the rules and
how they work.

21
00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:10.438
So if we save that and
go back into Firefox here and

22
00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.570
refresh, now I have my image and

23
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.031
figure caption over here on
the left side of the screen.

24
00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:24.291
Together, now we need to
tell them where to go.

25
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.114
So let's get that done.

26
00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:34.059
So .figure-portfolio.

27
00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:40.381
Img margin-top 0,

28
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:45.604
grid-column 2/3,

29
00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:50.830
and grid-row 1/2.

30
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.313
And then after that, so we're telling the
image where to go, go over to the right.

31
00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:58.536
So on the second column in the first row.

32
00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:04.754
And then for figure-portfolio figcaption,

33
00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:11.617
We have a grid-column of 1/2 and

34
00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:15.571
a grid-row of 1/2.

35
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:20.811
So in other words, figure caption,
we want you to go in the first column,

36
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:25.385
same row, and the image we're
putting on the right, same row.

37
00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:29.114
Okay, and when we refresh our webpage,

38
00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.197
Now we have our image on the right and

39
00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:38.162
we have our track list here on the left,
whew.

40
00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:41.967
Questions so far?

41
00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:42.563
Okay, so

42
00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:47.824
the last thing we need to address here
on the screen is our jagged background.

43
00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:52.549
So the jagged background we have right
now actually has built into it some black

44
00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.364
background to work great on the home page.

45
00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:58.181
But what we want now is this
jagged background to have some

46
00:02:58.181 --> 00:02:59.744
transparency to it.

47
00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:03.694
And so
I played around with this by quite a bit.

48
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:08.569
And what I found was I needed to rewrite
a little bit of code in order to make this

49
00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.994
work in terms of HTML.

50
00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:15.148
Normally, this jagged background
would go on the footer.

51
00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:20.439
But because the footer already has
the background fit of cover set to it so

52
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:26.009
that this image changes, we can start
to see more of that image as we resize.

53
00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.146
If we put the jagged image on the footer
as well, that image also resizes, and

54
00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:37.129
we wind up with half of the image is white
and half of the image has stars on it.

55
00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.760
It's really weird looking.

56
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.422
So we have to keep this jagged
background in its own special little

57
00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:46.193
div in order to make this work.

58
00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:50.993
So we're going to change the HTML
in just the footer for this page.

59
00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:56.532
And so here we are in the footer.

60
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.443
And this is the container, and so forth.

61
00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:03.212
I don't know why that's red.

62
00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:12.345
No idea, okay, so after the footer here,

63
00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:19.473
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add
a div with a class of bottom-trim.

64
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:24.792
It's just a little div that's
just here all by itself.

65
00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:29.282
That's all the HTML we need,
just a div with the class of bottom-trim.

66
00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:32.633
And I've put this in just
before the container so

67
00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:36.241
that my div will stretch all
the way across the page.

68
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:40.442
So we have this now separate div called
bottom-trim that's going to sit as wide

69
00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:43.199
as the footer itself,
not as wide as the container,

70
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.745
and that is where we're gonna
place this background image.

71
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:51.054
So let's go to our stylesheet, and

72
00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:56.080
we are going to go into our footer styles,

73
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.816
which we have to find.

74
00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:04.587
Projects, contact, and our footer styles.

75
00:05:04.587 --> 00:05:11.898
And what I'm going to do is add to
this a class called bottom-trim.

76
00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:21.104
And here, I'll put in my background image,

77
00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:25.829
which will be url ../img.

78
00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:31.691
And I have a slightly different image
here for this one, fem-featured,

79
00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:38.213
-bottom.png.

80
00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.550
Background-repeat.

81
00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.329
Repeat-x.

82
00:05:50.845 --> 00:05:55.874
Background-position: top

83
00:05:55.874 --> 00:06:01.588
center, and height: 16px.

84
00:06:01.588 --> 00:06:06.729
Now, 99% of the time, you should
never use height in your designs.

85
00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.608
But in this particular instance, we have
a div that has no content inside of it.

86
00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:12.800
The only way in order for

87
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.768
this image to show is if we give it
a little bit of height artificially.

88
00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:18.447
And why 16 pixels?

89
00:06:18.447 --> 00:06:20.865
That happens to be
the size of the graphic.

90
00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:24.365
So we're making the div as tall
as the graphic, make sense?

91
00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:25.854
That's why we're doing that.

92
00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:31.775
Okay, and then padding-bottom: 4rem.

93
00:06:34.075 --> 00:06:39.009
And now when I save this and
I go back to my webpage,

94
00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:47.334
We will see here this wild and
crazy dashed thing going on here.

95
00:06:47.334 --> 00:06:49.494
What happened here, okay?

96
00:06:49.494 --> 00:06:54.294
Well, what happened here is my footer
itself has a big padding on it.

97
00:06:55.604 --> 00:07:00.597
So that padding is pushing this
jagged design away from the edges

98
00:07:00.597 --> 00:07:02.436
of the screen here.

99
00:07:02.436 --> 00:07:08.195
So what I'm going to need to do is add
a couple of extra styles for that.

100
00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:16.236
And I'm going to say .project + footer.

101
00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:21.034
So in other words, any footer that
its immediate sibling comes right

102
00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:25.995
before it has a class of project,
which would be our featured section,

103
00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:28.328
that also has a class of project.

104
00:07:28.328 --> 00:07:33.689
padding-top: 0.

105
00:07:36.244 --> 00:07:41.697
Okay, so if we change that and
refresh the page,

106
00:07:41.697 --> 00:07:46.031
now we have our jagged images here.

107
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:49.311
We need to remove the one
that was here before.

108
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:55.796
And I think that that one is,
where is that image located?

109
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.114
And that one is on our
section-featured project.

110
00:08:03.114 --> 00:08:05.988
So what we're going to do is,

111
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:12.419
Here in our HTML,

112
00:08:15.355 --> 00:08:18.587
Back up here, we have our class
of section-featured project.

113
00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:23.377
What I'm going to do in my CSS, so we have
this class here called section-featured.

114
00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:25.808
I'm gonna copy it.

115
00:08:25.808 --> 00:08:27.715
I'm gonna paste it.

116
00:08:31.874 --> 00:08:33.387
And I'm gonna make a change.

117
00:08:35.387 --> 00:08:38.296
Instead of calling it section-featured,
I'm gonna call it project.

118
00:08:40.156 --> 00:08:44.090
Because it's later in the document,
it will override what comes before, and

119
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.356
I'm gonna set this up to not
have this background image.

120
00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:50.682
So it's going to have just
a single background image.

121
00:08:54.428 --> 00:08:59.104
Okay, and when I save that,
and now go back to my webpage.

122
00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:03.771
There it is without that background image.

123
00:09:05.285 --> 00:09:06.477
How cool is that?
