WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.890
Obviously, we still have
a navigation bar here.

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.827
That's bad.

3
00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:07.414
We want the navigation bar to show
when we click the hamburger button.

4
00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:11.446
So we're going to need to
get rid of this navigation.

5
00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:16.320
And the way that we do that, super fun.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.268
We're gonna say our nav is going
to wind up with some funky

7
00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:23.649
kinds of dimensions to it.

8
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:28.562
So position of fixed.

9
00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:32.662
So when it's fixed on the screen,
it pulls it out of the normal flow and

10
00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:34.760
it fixes it to the top of the window.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.715
If we actually had room to scroll here,

12
00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:40.408
that nav bar would stay in place while
we scrolled up and down the web page.

13
00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:43.081
You've seen webpages do that before.

14
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:46.191
So that's what the fixed does.

15
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.666
Then we're gonna tell it where to go.

16
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:53.426
Top is 0, in other words,
go all the way to the top,

17
00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:58.530
right, 200%,
that's gonna shove it off screen.

18
00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:05.191
Makes sense, 200% is somewhere
way off there in the distance

19
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:10.206
out of the browser window, so
that's what right: 200% does.

20
00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:14.630
The width, we want to be100 vw,

21
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.880
anybody know what a vw is?

22
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.276
It is not a Volkswagen.

23
00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:20.898
&gt;&gt; View width.

24
00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:23.429
&gt;&gt; Viewport width, right?

25
00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.497
Viewport width, so,
100 viewport widths would be what?

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.264
As wide as the window, okay?

27
00:01:34.264 --> 00:01:36.869
As wide as the window, awesome.

28
00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.249
And the height will be 100 vh.

29
00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.544
Guess what vh stands for?

30
00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:45.923
&gt;&gt; I think viewport height.

31
00:01:45.923 --> 00:01:47.156
&gt;&gt; Viewport height.

32
00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:50.448
So it's gonna stretch
the whole way down the screen.

33
00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:53.748
So when we see it, these are all
the things that we're going to see.

34
00:01:55.598 --> 00:02:00.649
The background is fff.

35
00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.360
We're gonna put some padding
on the top of about 20%.

36
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.999
And then we're gonna add this transition.

37
00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.551
Boy, we got a lot of stuff
going on in here, right?

38
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:17.983
0 seconds,
0.5 seconds opacity 0.5 seconds.

39
00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:19.867
And I'm just gonna leave
that line right now.

40
00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:22.317
I will explain that to you momentarily.

41
00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:27.163
But the transition is the way that we're
gonna make a little animation happen so

42
00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:30.868
that when we click the hamburger button,
the menu flies in.

43
00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:33.328
That's the magic that's happening there,
and

44
00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:36.331
I'll explain that line to you
in more detail momentarily.

45
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:40.739
So now we're gonna say

46
00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.380
button:focus + nav,

47
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.885
button:focus-within + nav.

48
00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.838
Okay, so
that's a really funky looking selector.

49
00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:02.786
So remember anything that's
separated by commas,

50
00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:05.204
those are two separate selectors, okay?

51
00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:08.368
What is focus and what is focus within?

52
00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:10.753
Does anybody know what focus and
focus within are?

53
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.965
&gt;&gt; Maybe it automatically selects it for
you.

54
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it has to do with that.

55
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.833
So if I'm looking at my webpage here,
let me go up to the top here.

56
00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:29.546
And I start hitting my
tab key on the computer.

57
00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:34.933
Do you see how the little green box there
is sorta jumping around a little bit and

58
00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:38.043
it's showing me what's clickable, okay?

59
00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:42.701
That is focus, the focus is what
is responsible for those lines.

60
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:47.829
And of course, focus within is what's
inside of that particular item in focus.

61
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.474
Yeah, all right.

62
00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:58.509
So when we have the plus sign here,
we're talking about siblings.

63
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:02.909
And what we have here is we have
a button followed by a navigation,

64
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.870
okay, button, followed by a navigation.

65
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.922
So that is the pattern that
we're looking for here.

66
00:04:08.922 --> 00:04:13.446
So when a button in focus is
followed by navigation or, oops,

67
00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:18.231
within, a button with a focus
within is followed by navigation,

68
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:22.845
we are going to do these things,
this is gonna make disappear.

69
00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:26.346
So right will become 0, it was 200%.

70
00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:27.582
It's gonna become 0.

71
00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:30.496
So it's gonna come on to the screen.

72
00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:36.463
We're gonna change its opacity to 1,
that will make it so you can see it.

73
00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:40.824
And transition: right 0s,

74
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.672
opacity 0.5 seconds.

75
00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:54.235
So let me just click this and
you can kinda see what's going on now.

76
00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:58.326
Look at that, okay?

77
00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:00.242
So what's happening here?

78
00:05:00.242 --> 00:05:04.647
When we click the button now,
our menu is flying in,

79
00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:09.152
it's white, it's fully opaque so
we can see it, and

80
00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:14.483
it's coming in from the right side and
it's coming into view.

81
00:05:14.483 --> 00:05:15.612
Does that make sense?

82
00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:19.039
That's kinda what that code
that we just wrote said.

83
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.176
The only thing you see on
here is the Resume button.

84
00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:23.143
Why is that?

85
00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:24.241
&gt;&gt; The text is white.

86
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.284
&gt;&gt; White text on a white background,
exactly.

87
00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:29.074
I don't know if I can select that or not.

88
00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.658
Let me try again.

89
00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:32.580
There it is.

90
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.516
So you see it's there, okay?

91
00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:40.059
But it's white text on a white background,
and currently it's horizontal on the page.

92
00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:47.152
Okay, plus we have no x, so
we have some other things we need to add.

93
00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:52.905
All right, so
let's make that navigation bar then,

94
00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:55.409
right now is horizontal on the page.

95
00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.016
Let's make it go vertical and

96
00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:03.499
let's give it some color, I think.

97
00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:08.583
So now have you well,
we're gonna say display: block.

98
00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:13.952
We're gonna say text-align:

99
00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:19.521
center; position: relative;

100
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:28.480
top: -50vh; transition: top 0.5 seconds.

101
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.409
So all of that is for our navigation bar,
for all of those links inside of our

102
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.357
navigation bar, we are going to have
that do a separate little animation.

103
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:40.182
So just to demonstrate that for you.

104
00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:48.461
When I'm on our final site here and
I click my hamburger button,

105
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:53.988
see that the white flies in and
then see that the menu flies in as well?

106
00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:59.213
Cool, that's what we're coding right now,
Okay.

107
00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:12.958
And then we have to do
a little bit more here,

108
00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.418
button:focus + nav ul.

109
00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:19.218
This again has to do with the animation.

110
00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:29.298
Then + nav ul, top: 0.

111
00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:35.034
So this is bringing it in from
completely hidden away at -50vh.

112
00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:40.928
So off the page, this is bringing it in so
that we can see it, okay?

113
00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:47.704
So in theory, we can see it,
although I can't see it right now.

114
00:07:47.704 --> 00:07:50.427
Let's have faith that
it will come into view.

115
00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:52.663
&gt;&gt; Maybe you want to focus-within again.

116
00:07:52.663 --> 00:07:53.806
&gt;&gt; I forgot that, yeah.

117
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:58.427
Thank you, focus-within, there we go.

118
00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:00.333
It's there.

119
00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:03.699
One button, it looks like one button,
but it's there.

120
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:05.298
There we go, okay.

121
00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:11.826
So now we just need to style it so
we can see it.

122
00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:17.600
All right, so to get that done,
we're gonna say nav a: any-link.

123
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.849
any-link means any kinda
links that are there,

124
00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:24.026
whether they have been visited or
not visited.

125
00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:25.678
We wanna style those.

126
00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:32.408
So we're going to say display: block,
and padding: 1.5 rems,

127
00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:38.686
to give them the little space,
and color: var(--green).

128
00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:50.577
And to keep the space even
between navigation items, for

129
00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:54.237
the button itself, nav,
this is the .button,

130
00:08:54.237 --> 00:08:59.164
in other words, the resume button,
margin-top: 1.5 rem.

131
00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:07.581
So now when we click that, hey, look, we
can finally see at least the links, yeah.

132
00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:08.492
We're getting there.

133
00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:12.654
Okay.

134
00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.742
Now we're gonna add a close icon.

135
00:09:18.742 --> 00:09:23.715
So to add the close icon,
we're gonna say nav ul::after, and

136
00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:28.520
we're gonna use that same content
trick with like a Unicode.

137
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:36.651
So content would be " \2716".

138
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:41.226
You guys Google for
like /2716 and whatever, CSS or

139
00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:47.146
something like that, you'll find
these charts of Unicode characters.

140
00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:50.457
And you will find things
like hamburger buttons and

141
00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:53.077
you'll find axes and all the rest of it.

142
00:09:53.077 --> 00:09:59.215
What's nice about using these here
in the context of CSS in the realm,

143
00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:05.579
before and after, is that these come
in right straight off of your font.

144
00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:08.862
We don't have to load up a separate SVG,

145
00:10:08.862 --> 00:10:13.603
which can be a lot to try to
include your SVGs inside of CSS.

146
00:10:13.603 --> 00:10:17.285
So this is a little bit
simpler way of doing it.

147
00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:20.216
We'll make it var(--green).

148
00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:28.848
We'll make it display: block;

149
00:10:28.848 --> 00:10:32.781
position: absolute.

150
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:35.030
So this is how we're gonna
position this in space.

151
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.160
By absolute positioning,
we can set it exactly in

152
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.047
the upper right-hand
corner where we want it,

153
00:10:45.047 --> 00:10:50.070
and top: 0.125rem; right: 0.5rem.

154
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.776
That will dictate exactly where
that x is going to appear.

155
00:10:53.776 --> 00:10:55.590
We'll make it big.

156
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:03.251
font-size: 3rems; line-height: 1.

157
00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:10.349
So there it is, there's our x.

158
00:11:10.349 --> 00:11:14.036
Before we had the x, you can
actually click anywhere in here, so

159
00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:18.156
if I I click over in a white area or
something, that will close the page.

160
00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:22.895
But by putting in this x here, so
it looks like there's something to click,

161
00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:27.560
that gives people a little bit of extra
security that there is a way that I can

162
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.765
close this thing.

163
00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:33.022
They don't feel completely lost, okay?

164
00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:34.909
Yeah, and
I skipped the part about the SVGs.

165
00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:35.999
That's why they're still white.

166
00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:38.173
So let's get that in place.

167
00:11:38.173 --> 00:11:44.502
nav a svg{ } The fill color
will be var(--green),

168
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:53.682
And nav a:hover,

169
00:11:53.682 --> 00:11:59.320
nav a svg:hover{ color:

170
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.736
var(--tan)}.

171
00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:07.088
So if this is just a regular old link,
it's gonna be tan.

172
00:12:07.088 --> 00:12:12.274
And if it is an SVG,
it will have a fill of tan.

173
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:26.111
Whew, okay, There we go.

174
00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:36.709
Okay, so
our button still has a few issues here.

175
00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:39.385
We can fix that, okay.

176
00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:44.099
So we're gonna go here to nav.button.

177
00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:46.486
Scroll up just a little
bit from where you were.

178
00:12:46.486 --> 00:12:51.443
We're gonna go to nav.button,
and we're going to say

179
00:12:51.443 --> 00:12:56.295
that this is going to be
display: inline-block, and

180
00:12:56.295 --> 00:13:01.157
we're gonna say the color
will be var(--black).

181
00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:05.801
The last thing we have to figure out
here is why the button is going all

182
00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:08.012
the way across the screen here.

183
00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:12.162
It looks like it was working
when we roll our mouse over it,

184
00:13:12.162 --> 00:13:15.818
you see that it is tan and
we can see the word resume.

185
00:13:15.818 --> 00:13:18.497
When the button is here by itself,
it's green.

186
00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:22.383
The words are also green, that is why it
looks like it's an unlabeled button and

187
00:13:22.383 --> 00:13:24.829
it's stretching all the way
across the windows.

188
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:29.897
So it's behaving more like a block button
than it is a regular button that would be

189
00:13:29.897 --> 00:13:35.128
inline block or inline like we had it set
up before, and the issue is actually here.

190
00:13:35.128 --> 00:13:39.246
So when we go to nav a:any-link,

191
00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:43.937
guess what, our button is any-link.

192
00:13:43.937 --> 00:13:47.319
Yeah, it is coded just like link.

193
00:13:47.319 --> 00:13:49.820
So it's doing exactly what
we told it to do, and

194
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.701
I really hate it when that happens.

195
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:53.744
So it is displaying as a block,

196
00:13:53.744 --> 00:13:57.292
there it is stretching all
the way across the screen.

197
00:13:57.292 --> 00:14:02.798
It is got some padding on it, one and
a half rems, and the text color is green.

198
00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:03.482
There it is.

199
00:14:03.482 --> 00:14:06.430
It's exactly doing exactly
what I told it to do.

200
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.472
So in order to make this,
what I really wanna say is, for

201
00:14:10.472 --> 00:14:14.951
any link in the navigation,
except for the button, do this.

202
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:20.297
And there actually is a way to write that,
and the way it looks is this.

203
00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:25.257
nav a: any-link:not(.button).

204
00:14:25.257 --> 00:14:27.733
That one is a mouthful, okay?

205
00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:30.582
For those of you who
are a little bit more advanced,

206
00:14:30.582 --> 00:14:33.175
this is a really cool way
of dealing with this.

207
00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:36.576
So for any link that's there in
the navigation that does not

208
00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:39.168
have a class of button,
apply these styles.

209
00:14:39.168 --> 00:14:42.741
But if it does have a class of button,
do not apply these styles.

210
00:14:42.741 --> 00:14:46.524
And when you open up the window,
sure enough,

211
00:14:46.524 --> 00:14:50.120
the button did not have
that style applied.

212
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.904
Okay, how are people
feeling at this point?

213
00:14:53.904 --> 00:14:56.024
That was a huge mouthful.

214
00:14:56.024 --> 00:15:00.889
It's really oriented towards some of
you that have more experience working

215
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:05.081
with HTML and CSS, trying to put
in a hamburger button like this.

216
00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:10.018
If we had taken some other approaches, we
could have worked with a hamburger button

217
00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:14.619
in JavaScript that would introduce
a whole nother can of worms, so to speak.

218
00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:18.164
But to get it to work in CSS,
this is one way of doing it.

219
00:15:18.164 --> 00:15:23.323
If you are a more junior developer and you
found that this was kinda confusing and

220
00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.796
a lot, believe me, I feel your pain.

221
00:15:25.796 --> 00:15:30.414
[LAUGH] It's an awful lot to digest for
this hamburger button.

222
00:15:30.414 --> 00:15:35.087
So what you may wanna do is just do
the two parts that were relatively

223
00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:37.257
straightforward, which is,

224
00:15:37.257 --> 00:15:42.355
design your navigation bar like this
to go all the way across the screen.

225
00:15:42.355 --> 00:15:44.986
That was relatively straightforward and

226
00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.819
should be straightforward enough
to deal with, and then for

227
00:15:48.819 --> 00:15:53.117
smaller screens, maybe you just go
like this, and we call it good.

228
00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:57.846
And when the screens get even smaller,
maybe you would want to do something like

229
00:15:57.846 --> 00:16:02.433
make your name smaller, maybe make two
rows of buttons for the navigation and

230
00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:04.496
make them horizontal on the page.

231
00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.062
That would be another way to go.

232
00:16:06.062 --> 00:16:10.129
So there's a lot of ways that you can make
this easier if putting in the hamburger

233
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:13.423
button felt like a really big left and
a little bit too much to do.

234
00:16:13.423 --> 00:16:16.089
Make sense?

235
00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:18.400
So it's kinda like gym class, right?

236
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.649
We have the easy ones for
people who are brand new to this and

237
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:28.655
then we have the more difficult things for
people who've been around for a while.

238
00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:32.988
Any questions on this so far, yes.

239
00:16:32.988 --> 00:16:39.995
&gt;&gt; So regarding the last two
lines there starting at 236,

240
00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:46.009
it looks like both media
lines are going to apply.

241
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:48.406
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Right, because both things are true.

242
00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:49.263
&gt;&gt; Correct.

243
00:16:49.263 --> 00:16:54.121
&gt;&gt; Okay, are you able to use max and
minimum width to kind of say,

244
00:16:54.121 --> 00:16:58.616
okay, only do something if
it's between this and this?

245
00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:00.765
&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.

246
00:17:00.765 --> 00:17:06.439
So if you if you wanted to have a range,
you could say something like min-width,

247
00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:09.956
I don't know, width,
if you can spell it width.

248
00:17:09.956 --> 00:17:16.026
Let's say 500px, and max-width of 830.

249
00:17:16.026 --> 00:17:20.249
So that would give you a very narrow
range if that's what you wanted to do.

250
00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:23.360
That is a possibility with a media query.

251
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.421
Generally speaking, the way we look
at these in web development right

252
00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:33.159
now is all these styles that are here
are outside the media query.

253
00:17:33.159 --> 00:17:35.077
So they apply by default.

254
00:17:35.077 --> 00:17:37.757
So all those styles apply by default.

255
00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:42.668
Then we say, if it's no more than 830px,

256
00:17:42.668 --> 00:17:45.526
then these styles apply.

257
00:17:45.526 --> 00:17:49.807
And if it's no more than 640px,
these styles apply.

258
00:17:49.807 --> 00:17:56.122
But remember that things
are overridden along the way.

259
00:17:56.122 --> 00:17:58.677
So even though here, whatever,

260
00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:03.432
we've said that links are green and
the background is white.

261
00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:09.304
We overrode those as we go
further up here in our CSS.
