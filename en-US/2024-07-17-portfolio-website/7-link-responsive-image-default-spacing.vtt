WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.488
For the last part of this, there's some
other base changes that we need to make to

2
00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:08.646
our document now that we've got our
colors set up, we got our fonts set up,

3
00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:10.233
we got our font sizes set up.

4
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.428
The last few things that we
wanna change here are things

5
00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:16.484
like what is our link colors and
our link states, and

6
00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:20.042
we have some other issues that
are going on down here as well.

7
00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:26.430
If you notice, our image is kinda big,
[LAUGH] maybe a little bit too big.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.168
We also have it not quite on
the edge of the webpage here.

9
00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.820
So there's some other little
tweaks that we need to make now.

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.699
And so let me just walk you through those.

11
00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.796
These are other various base
changes to our website.

12
00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:45.617
And so what I'm going to do is I am
going to set up styling for our links.

13
00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:50.557
So if we take a look at the HTML for
our links, it looks like this,

14
00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:52.583
it's the ahref, right?

15
00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:57.428
So what would be my CSS selector
to change the look of the links

16
00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:01.709
on my website just as I'm
looking at them right here?

17
00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:03.329
What would be my selector?

18
00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:07.550
&gt;&gt; The a tag.

19
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.786
&gt;&gt; The a, right?

20
00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:12.419
Just regular old a, okay?

21
00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:18.278
Cuz that's what I want, there's a right
there in my HTML, here's a in my CSS.

22
00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:24.986
And I'm going to set this
to be color: var(--green).

23
00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:32.569
Once we do that, then my link
changes colors, and isn't this nice?

24
00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.816
We don't have to type in the same
hex codes over and over again,

25
00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:37.236
we already set them all up.

26
00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:39.641
And we can remember green,
but we can't remember,

27
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.385
I don't even remember what
the hex code was for that green.

28
00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:46.019
So this is a much better
way of doing things, right?

29
00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:49.918
Okay, now the other thing we might wanna
do is, when we roll our mouse over this

30
00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:52.472
link, maybe we want some
kind of change to happen.

31
00:01:52.472 --> 00:01:55.331
Maybe we want the underline to go away.

32
00:01:55.331 --> 00:02:00.618
So what would be my selector in that
case for when I hover over my link?

33
00:02:00.618 --> 00:02:01.952
What would that look like?

34
00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:05.632
&gt;&gt; a:hover.

35
00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:12.409
&gt;&gt; a:hover, yay, a:hover,
that would be it.

36
00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:19.812
And then we could say
text-decoration: none, okay?

37
00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:26.453
Wow, look at that, it works, okay?

38
00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:27.831
So a and a:hover,

39
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:33.358
those are great things to set up here
in your base styling for your document.

40
00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:35.564
Let's deal with this image here.

41
00:02:35.564 --> 00:02:41.165
Now, by default, images, of course, as you
know, have sizes associated with them.

42
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:43.788
You download them off your camera,
they're gigantic.

43
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:47.188
Maybe you've run them through
Photoshop and they are smaller, but

44
00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:49.464
they have some kind of
inherent size to them.

45
00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:54.432
If that size happens to be bigger than the
web browser window, you wind up with side

46
00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:58.623
scrolling, rarely something that
you actually wanna have happen.

47
00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:03.722
So one of the things that the styles that
you should probably add to every style

48
00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:09.223
sheet that you ever write is just to take
all of your image elements, which are img.

49
00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:14.967
Of course, that is right here
in your HTML, img, src, yeah?

50
00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:22.010
And we're going to say
the image max-width is 100%.

51
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.277
So don't go any wider than 100% of what?

52
00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:31.625
And that's something you should always
ask when you're dealing with percents,

53
00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.875
100% of what?

54
00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:36.185
In this case, it is the container.

55
00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:37.607
What is a container?

56
00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:40.619
A container in this case
is the image's parent,

57
00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.563
which would in this case
be the figure element.

58
00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:46.172
How wide is the figure element?

59
00:03:46.172 --> 00:03:50.492
It is that wide, [LAUGH] okay?

60
00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:53.197
We can't see the figure right now,
but we can see the image.

61
00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:56.402
That's how wide the figure
is at this moment in time.

62
00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.126
Makes sense?

63
00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.457
Everybody okay so far?

64
00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:05.342
All right, now, this figure,
I can already hear your graphic designer

65
00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:10.247
friends complaining because we have
all this nice alignment over here.

66
00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:15.164
All the Ts are lined up the paragraph, the
list is indented the way it should be, and

67
00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:18.127
then we have this image
that's way too indented.

68
00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:21.107
You wouldn't necessarily know
where this is coming from,

69
00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:24.571
but web browsers tend to put a little
bit of space around that figure.

70
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.291
It could be margin, it could be padding,
we don't always know which one, so

71
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.558
we're gonna zero out both of those.

72
00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:33.236
So I'm gonna say figure,

73
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.479
padding: 0, margin: 0.

74
00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.123
And that will stretch your
image across the screen and

75
00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:48.187
now it's nicely in line with everything
else that's there on the screen as well.

76
00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:53.424
&gt;&gt; Someone asking if they get lost or
wanna reset to the current codepen or

77
00:04:53.424 --> 00:04:56.549
whatever, is there a good way to do that?

78
00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.373
&gt;&gt; Yes, so
if anywhere you get lost along the way,

79
00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:02.699
I showed you the beginning
codepen here on the website.

80
00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.315
If you scroll all the way down to the
bottom, there is an ending codepen down

81
00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:11.215
here as well, and you can take
a look at the ending code, okay?

82
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:18.169
All right, so the very last
thing that I wanna do is this,

83
00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.272
how many people are wondering
why there is a little space.

84
00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:26.790
Do you see this little space here between
our box and our Ts and our image,

85
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.768
this tiny,
little space over here on the left?

86
00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:34.086
And you see there's actually a tiny little
space over here on the right as well,

87
00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:35.903
anybody wondering what that is?

88
00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:40.017
&gt;&gt; Yes, now that you mentioned it.

89
00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:42.772
&gt;&gt; EJ says, where is that coming from?

90
00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:44.057
An excellent question.

91
00:05:44.057 --> 00:05:48.273
Well, this happens to be coming
from the body element itself.

92
00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:51.858
The body element has either margin or
padding on it as well,

93
00:05:51.858 --> 00:05:56.806
which is often nice to keep the text from
running into the edges of the web browser,

94
00:05:56.806 --> 00:06:00.127
until your background is
some color other than white.

95
00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:03.414
And then you wind up with this weird
white border around everything.

96
00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:05.057
So to fix this problem,

97
00:06:05.057 --> 00:06:09.422
what we're going to do is we
are going to go to our body element.

98
00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:13.551
So mine is around line 20,
where I declared my font family, and

99
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:18.450
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to add some additional styles to this.

100
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.580
Notably, margin is 0, padding is 0, and

101
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.172
that should push you all the way
to the edges of the webpage.

102
00:06:28.172 --> 00:06:31.628
We'll add that space in later as part
of our design, but for right now,

103
00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:33.368
we're gonna take out the default.

104
00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:34.456
Yes, Mark.

105
00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:42.526
&gt;&gt; Would it be a bad idea to reset
everything with the star attribute?

106
00:06:42.526 --> 00:06:49.280
&gt;&gt; Yes, all right, so
the question is, could I do this?

107
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.594
If I start at the top of the document and
I say star, and

108
00:06:54.594 --> 00:07:00.988
I say padding: 0, margin: 0, and
I could go on and on and on.

109
00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:03.421
Let's just remove all of this stuff.

110
00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:08.356
So what this particular selector does,
the star by itself, guess what?

111
00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:09.890
Select everything in the document.

112
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.927
So we'll select all of the things, and

113
00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:14.778
let's get rid of all of
the browser default settings.

114
00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:17.930
In this case, I'm saying,
take out all the margin and padding for

115
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.128
everything on the page.

116
00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:21.421
But guess what that happens then?

117
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:25.748
We actually kinda like the padding and
margin that were there for our text.

118
00:07:25.748 --> 00:07:28.130
That was kinda nice to have.

119
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.831
Now my list doesn't look
like a list at all, okay?

120
00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:34.954
So now we actually have to go back and
recode what padding and

121
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.461
margin we actually do want.

122
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:40.709
So this is an approach that some people
take, is to turn everything off and

123
00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:43.052
then they recode back in what they want.

124
00:07:43.052 --> 00:07:47.950
I tend to just turn off what I don't want,
where I don't want it, and

125
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.103
leave the rest of it alone and
let the browser do its magic.

126
00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:57.063
So either way will work,
I think my way has less work behind it.

127
00:07:57.063 --> 00:07:59.319
Let me go back to my body style here,

128
00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:03.178
and I'm just gonna add a couple
of more things that are here.

129
00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:11.903
We could say our font-size
is the var(--base-size).

130
00:08:11.903 --> 00:08:16.081
We set this up already for our headings,
but let's also set this up for our body,

131
00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:19.965
so all of the elements on our webpage
will have our default size by default.

132
00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:24.943
You won't actually see much of a change,
because it was already said to be one rem.

133
00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:30.001
But as you know now, it will help it scale
if we ever do change those values for

134
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:34.128
the base size or for our scale,
so we need to put that in place.

135
00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:41.158
And I also like to set
a line height of 1.5,

136
00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:45.972
no units on this, why is that?

137
00:08:45.972 --> 00:08:52.065
Why isn't it 1.5 rem, why isn't it 1.5%,
why isn't it 1.5 anything?

138
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:55.463
Why is it just 1.5, anyone have an idea?

139
00:08:55.463 --> 00:08:57.331
&gt;&gt; It's scalar.

140
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:05.357
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is a ratio, so it's the 1.5
times the size of the font, okay?

141
00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:09.566
So when you put no units on it, then
math is done, and as you can see here,

142
00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:14.131
that will give our headings the
appropriate spacing, scales really nicely.

143
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:18.648
And it'll do the same for of paragraphs
and all the rest of that kinda thing.

144
00:09:18.648 --> 00:09:20.916
&gt;&gt; Are you able to use
percentages if you want?

145
00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:22.871
Like, can you say 120%?

146
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:28.672
&gt;&gt; Sure, we could say something like that,
I'm not sure what it'll do, okay.

147
00:09:28.672 --> 00:09:31.358
Well, so here's the problem with that.

148
00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:36.719
Even though it's a percent, you can
think of that as an absolute value.

149
00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:41.450
So it's 120% regardless of the size of
the font, so when your font is big like

150
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.642
this for the heading 1, it looks
like it has very, very little space.

151
00:09:45.642 --> 00:09:48.707
Whereas for
the heading 6 where the font is small,

152
00:09:48.707 --> 00:09:51.856
it looks like we have a huge
amount of space, right?

153
00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:56.746
But by using 1.5 with no units,
then it's proportional.
