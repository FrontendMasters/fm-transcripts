00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.187
All right, so now I've got all
of these heading sizes set up,

2
00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:05.720
what do I need to do now?

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.700
I need to apply it to the webpage right.

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.486
Okay, so
I'm gonna give you two minutes, and

5
00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:18.300
I want you to write the font sizes for
these headings.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.302
You've seen this enough now, you should
be able to take patterns that you've seen

7
00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:25.846
before with some of our other variables,
and write out some font sizes for

8
00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:27.920
our headings, so go ahead and do that now.

9
00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.478
What you should have now in your CSS
is you should have all of our headings.

10
00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:39.730
Remember these are the HTML
element heading tags so,

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.830
we don't need a dot in front of them,
we use dots for classes.

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.180
This is our HTML elements, H1,
2, 3, 4, et cetera, et cetera.

13
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.762
And then we're going to use the font size
property to set up with the variable name,

14
00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:58.290
okay, so we have our heading 1,
2, 3, 4, 5.

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.860
Now, that seems like a lot of work,
we could have just typed in numbers for

16
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.321
these font sizes.

17
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.293
So let me show you where
the power is with this approach,

18
00:01:08.293 --> 00:01:12.855
if we go back on up here to the top
where we have our base font size,

19
00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:16.426
if instead of 1 rem,
we set it to say 1.3 rems.

20
00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:22.327
Look at how all of our fonts scale all
together with one tiny little change,

21
00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:22.895
okay.

22
00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:27.008
So if our boss comes back to you and
says, nice website Jen,

23
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:31.855
but I can't read it,
you need to make the fonts bigger.

24
00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:36.368
Then you go, okay, well it's gonna take me
all day, you make the little change and

25
00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:39.608
then you can go run off to
the beach in the afternoon, okay.

26
00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:45.830
The other approach here, of course is,
you can change your scale,

27
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.298
right, so that the difference
in sizes between these headings.

28
00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:54.594
So right now,
our scale is 1.2 and little bit,

29
00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:58.828
pretty close in size,
what if we made it 1.4?

30
00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:04.612
Okay, so 1.4 is gonna make these radically
different insights, makes sense?

31
00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:08.456
And this is of course,
completely subjective and

32
00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:13.581
up to your designer as to what is
the relationship between the sizes

33
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:18.603
of these headings for
the kind of design that you're using.

34
00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:22.581
Generally speaking, I find that
1.2 is one that people use a lot,

35
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:27.522
1.25 is another one, that gives you a
little bit of extra spacing between those,

36
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.496
but not a radical amount
of spacing between those.

37
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:32.416
Make sense?

38
00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:39.353
All right, so a lot of typing,
worth the work, all right.
