WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.136
Now that we have all of our markup done,
we marked up our links,

2
00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:07.636
we marked up the actual
semantics behind everything and

3
00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:12.500
we've dropped in our SVGs,
it looks terrible that's great.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.818
That is the very first
step to all of this,

5
00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:18.170
now we can add more CSS in
order to make this pretty.

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.147
Now as I mentioned to you before,

7
00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:24.667
this is eventually going to appear on
top of the common image and obviously,

8
00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:28.485
you see everything is white up
here on the top and so forth.

9
00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:29.535
That's great,

10
00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:34.375
I don't have that common image
available to me here in the navigation.

11
00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.562
So what I'm going to do here instead,
just for

12
00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:42.794
the purposes of the work here that we're
doing, I'm going to put in another

13
00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:48.119
body style right here inside of my navs so
I remember to delete it later.

14
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.420
And I'm just gonna say
background-color of black,

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.689
which we'll get rid of most things
that we were just looking at here.

16
00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:02.265
We can also get rid of those borders, I
think we're pretty much done with those so

17
00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:06.691
we can get rid of the borders on the nav,
on the h1, and on the header.

18
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.438
You can either delete those or
you can comment them out and

19
00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:15.855
then with that in place, now we can start
to add some additional styles here.

20
00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:22.027
So for my header h1, we,
You probably don't want this so big.

21
00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:28.517
So I'm gonna say my font-size
is gonna be an h3 font-size.

22
00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:33.422
And we can just use the variable
that we already have been using from

23
00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:36.317
our previous variable stacks there.

24
00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:39.563
So our font-size is the variable of h3,

25
00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:44.849
then we're gonna say our font
weight is 300 and our margin is 0,

26
00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.869
which we actually we put
in down here at the bottom.

27
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:57.660
I'll just combine those here,
we can get rid of this other style.

28
00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:06.624
Okay, so for the svgs,
we can say header svg and

29
00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:14.296
we can say a width of something
like 30 pixels is probably good and

30
00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:23.097
then svgs don't have a coloured to them
the way that text works on the web.

31
00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:28.281
So properties like color or background
color don't necessarily work with SVGs,

32
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.697
what we use instead with them is fill.

33
00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:38.807
But we can still use our
variables from earlier, so white.

34
00:02:38.807 --> 00:02:42.922
Ha, here they are,
they do, in fact, exist.

35
00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:49.695
Meteor kind of looks like
an avocado [LAUGH] Once you see it,

36
00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:52.512
you can't unseen it.

37
00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:54.496
So these buttons and the SVGs are now,

38
00:02:54.496 --> 00:02:58.154
well, like I said the reason we didn't
spend a whole lot of time on that

39
00:02:58.154 --> 00:03:01.998
is because we knew that we were gonna
make other changes and as you can see,

40
00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:05.554
sure enough things are not
lining up as we expected.

41
00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:10.200
So we can make some changes
to that as well and

42
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.600
the way I'm going to do that is.

43
00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:23.604
I'm going to say nav.button And

44
00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:27.975
here I'm gonna change the padding on my
button it looks a little bit off here by

45
00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:32.616
putting nav in front of my button I'm now
overriding the styles that I have earlier

46
00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:35.755
in my document under just
the plain button class.

47
00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:40.578
So now that the specifically the button

48
00:03:40.578 --> 00:03:46.719
navigation we're gonna
change It's padding and

49
00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.689
it's gonna be four numbers 0.6 rem,

50
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.530
0.4 rem, 0.4 rem, 0.4 rem.

51
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.347
So now comes the big question with this,
right?

52
00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.317
What do those four numbers stand for?

53
00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:03.097
Does anybody know?

54
00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:05.287
&gt;&gt; Right and bottom.

55
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.522
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly,

56
00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:10.997
there are some combination of
those particular dimensions.

57
00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:14.993
So it is top, right,

58
00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:20.216
bottom, left, okay?

59
00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:26.466
And exactly, those of you who think
visually will say, clockwise, right?

60
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:31.813
From top, right, bottom, left,

61
00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:36.996
from 12 to 9, right,
going around the clock.

62
00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:42.061
Those of you who are not visible people

63
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:47.438
like me We say TR, BL [LAUGH], remember,

64
00:04:47.438 --> 00:04:52.023
and stay out of trouble, okay?

65
00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:56.903
Top right, bottom left either way,
that will help you remember what those

66
00:04:56.903 --> 00:05:02.091
four numbers are and believe me after 20
years of coding CSS, every time I have

67
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:07.347
to write out top right, bottom left,
I'm going TR, BL in my head, okay?

68
00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:10.277
That is how I keep it straight.

69
00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:13.480
So either one of those mnemonics will
help you remember what those four numbers

70
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.997
are and what they are representing.

71
00:05:17.277 --> 00:05:21.867
And then the last thing here that we
need to include In this, of course,

72
00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:28.781
is that our variable,
Our button is actually already black,

73
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:33.633
I think somewhere along the way it
turns white, so let's add this.

74
00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:37.643
Even though the text inside of it is
already black, let's just add this anyway.

75
00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:42.100
We want the text inside of it to be black.

76
00:05:45.026 --> 00:05:48.967
Let's add a hover state for

77
00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:53.421
these svgs and for doing that,

78
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:59.769
we're going to say header, a hover, svg.

79
00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:04.532
So in other words,
when we hover over the link,

80
00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:11.941
the svg color is going to change and
that's going to be a fill of our green.

81
00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:16.265
So when we roll our mouse over these,
they will turn green on hover and

82
00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:21.190
eventually we're going to change these
links as well to be white obviously our

83
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.924
links are the wrong color.

84
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:30.050
So let's go back down to our nav a here
and we're gonna set our color to var white

85
00:06:33.618 --> 00:06:38.899
There we go, so there's our white
links there my name is still not quite

86
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:44.107
what we want here and so we'll need
to add some styles for that as well.

87
00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:50.493
So this will be header h1 a and

88
00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:56.086
the color will be white, var white

89
00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:05.964
And our text decoration none

90
00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:14.651
How's that?

91
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:17.915
All right, so
we have one final addition to make to

92
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:22.837
our desktop version of this navbar and
I have added it here to my header svg.

93
00:07:22.837 --> 00:07:26.850
You'll see that I added
a margin top of -0.1 rem, and

94
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.695
that pulls those icons up
just enough that they're now

95
00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:35.567
in line with the resume button,
looks just a little bit better.

96
00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:38.323
Remember margins can have
a negative value to them and

97
00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:41.498
which in case moves them
in the opposite direction.

98
00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:44.782
So margin top would normally
push things down on the page and

99
00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:46.758
negative margin will pull them up.

100
00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:50.508
You cannot have negative padding,
you only have negative margins, okay.

101
00:07:52.178 --> 00:07:53.508
Something to remember there.

102
00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:59.922
Okay, so we are actually done with this
CodePen, feel free to close it and

103
00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:09.540
the next one we wanna move on to, If you
go back into your website for the course,

104
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:14.948
we are going to scroll down to where
it says tablet and mobile navigation.

105
00:08:14.948 --> 00:08:20.673
And so we are going to click on
beginning CodePen to start with that.

106
00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:27.681
And one of the things that you'll notice
as you are working through this particular

107
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.756
navbar obviously it looks
great when the screen is big.

108
00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:36.181
That's exactly what we were looking for
a name on one side, all the navigation

109
00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:41.274
on the other as I start to squash this up
well at some point they wrap on top of

110
00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:46.558
each other, that's just normal flexbox
behavior that we were out of room.

111
00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:50.058
So these are going to stack
that's the wrap part of row wrap.

112
00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:51.972
Remember we put that in earlier, but

113
00:08:51.972 --> 00:08:55.926
that's pretty much where these are gonna
stay as the screen gets smaller and

114
00:08:55.926 --> 00:09:00.664
smaller and smaller, kind of sub optimal
at those smaller screen resolutions.

115
00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:06.184
So the shorthand we usually use to talk
about this is called tablet and mobile.

116
00:09:06.184 --> 00:09:10.991
And I like using those words just because
it gives you a visual of a device that

117
00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:15.644
we might be talking about that would
use these types of dimensions.

118
00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:19.915
But the truth of the matter is we're just
talking about big screens, medium screens,

119
00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:21.009
and small screens.

120
00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:24.619
So, you'll hear other people talk
about screen sizing in that way.

121
00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:30.169
What is the right dimensions for
those screens, it depends.

122
00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.169
Have you seen how many devices
are out there these days?

123
00:09:33.169 --> 00:09:35.989
And every single one of them has
different dimensions for everything.

124
00:09:35.989 --> 00:09:40.263
So, what I would recommend that you
do is figure out at what dimension,

125
00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:42.314
things look good.

126
00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:48.709
One of the helpful features the CodePen
has, if you haven't noticed it already,

127
00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:54.548
look down at the very bottom of the screen
on the divider between the code and

128
00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:58.644
the display while I move
the divider back and forth.

129
00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:03.387
Do you see the Sort of white pill that
comes up down there and that is a rolling

130
00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:08.927
number and it will tell you exactly how
wide the screen is at various dimensions.

131
00:10:08.927 --> 00:10:14.202
That is a super handy way, I know that
I can get this close and at 770 pixels

132
00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:20.249
around there, that's where it's going
to wrap onto another line, okay?

133
00:10:20.249 --> 00:10:23.617
And maybe I don't want it to go all
the way this close before it wraps onto

134
00:10:23.617 --> 00:10:24.649
another line.

135
00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:27.892
Maybe I want a little bit of
space before it wraps, so

136
00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:31.890
CodePen can help you determine
exactly where those points are.
