1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.000
I think so
far this has been pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.830
We have figures, we have images,
we have figure captions.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.200
We've added styling to all of this.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.199
Now comes the moment when we need
to put the figure caption on top of

5
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.445
the figure, okay?

6
00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:16.540
So, so far everything should
be pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.650
Now we're gonna put the figure
caption on top of the figure.

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.415
Anybody have any ideas about the approach
that we could take to make this happen?

9
00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:28.278
&gt;&gt; Changing like the Z index.

10
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.522
&gt;&gt; So Z index would be associated
with the position property, right?

11
00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.535
So we could do absolute positioning and

12
00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.652
absolutely position our figure
caption on top of our image.

13
00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:39.172
That's definitely one way to do it.

14
00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:43.629
The other way that we can do it
is we can do it with CSS Grid,

15
00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.007
who knew that you could do this with grid.

16
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:47.616
It's one of my favorite
tricks in the world.

17
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:49.733
I love it overlapping grid cells.

18
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.793
So we're gonna do this with grid.

19
00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:56.133
So to our figure style that we
have started up here at the,

20
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.303
do we have to figure style?

21
00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:00.825
We don't have a figure style,
we'll invent a figure style.

22
00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:05.885
I usually like to put that first.

23
00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:10.319
I'm going to say display grid.

24
00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.823
So that's gonna make each figure
displaying in the style of grid.

25
00:01:15.823 --> 00:01:21.357
And then I'm going to tell
it grid-template-rows,

26
00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:25.097
I'm gonna have 1fr 100 pixels.

27
00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:26.061
Okay, so what does that mean?

28
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:33.485
We're gonna work with the figure
as a display of grid,

29
00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:38.701
just like you have seen before
with parents and children.

30
00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:45.847
We have in our HTML,

31
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:53.186
We have a figure here and
each figure has two children.

32
00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:58.610
In this case, one child is
the link that the images inside

33
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.939
of that link and
one child is the figure caption, okay?

34
00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.256
By declaring the style
of grid on the figure,

35
00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:11.535
we now have our image and
our figure caption as children and

36
00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:17.369
then we can manipulate those in space
to make these overlap each other.

37
00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:23.423
And the way that we'll do that,
Is with these two rows.

38
00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:29.813
And we have a row of, quote, 1fr,
and a row of, quote, a 100 pixels.

39
00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:33.664
100 pixels, that's pretty straightforward,
you know what that is.

40
00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:35.243
What is 1fr?

41
00:02:35.243 --> 00:02:36.113
What is that mean?

42
00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:38.125
Is it French?

43
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:41.266
It is not French.

44
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.566
It is fractions.

45
00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:44.766
Okay, one fraction.

46
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:49.207
So one of the cool things we can do in
grid is it will automatically do math

47
00:02:49.207 --> 00:02:49.730
for us.

48
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.187
The fr is a unit that can
only be used inside of grid,

49
00:02:52.187 --> 00:02:54.936
wouldn't it be great if we
could use it elsewhere?

50
00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:57.486
But unfortunately, it's a unique to grid.

51
00:02:57.486 --> 00:03:01.503
So I'm saying basically here,
we're gonna have 100 pixels for

52
00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:06.435
the second child, which will be the figure
caption, and everything else will be,

53
00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:10.255
quote, one fraction,
It's sort of just the remaining space.

54
00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:11.367
So that's what that means.

55
00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:17.847
And then we can specify exactly
where we want things to go.

56
00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:23.437
So, figure A, which is our child here

57
00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:29.901
in our HTML here on line
seven that figure A,

58
00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:37.091
we can say we want it
to go to grid-row: 1/3.

59
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:45.031
And grid-column: 1/2 and
I'm going to tell you what that means.

60
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:51.531
So if you imagine your figure where
it consists of two rows, right?

61
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:56.616
And if we start at the very
top of our figure here,

62
00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:59.273
this is line number one, okay?

63
00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:04.366
This is line number two between
our image and the figure caption,

64
00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:10.967
and this is line number three down here
at the bottom after our figure caption.

65
00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:15.662
So when I say grid-row: 1/3,
I'm saying to the image,

66
00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.534
I want you to take up all of the rows.

67
00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:21.854
I want you to take up the first row and
the second row.

68
00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:24.928
And I want you to be in the column of 1,
2.

69
00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:26.694
So column of 1 to 2.

70
00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:29.074
There's only one column in
this particular figure.

71
00:04:29.074 --> 00:04:30.744
Makes sense?

72
00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:35.641
Okay, nothing has changed because grid
very helpfully made another row for

73
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.154
our figure caption.

74
00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:41.512
It's actually made of third row,
even though we didn't ask for it.

75
00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:47.227
And then what we can do is say,
in our figure caption,

76
00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:51.678
we're going to say grid-row: 2/3.

77
00:04:51.678 --> 00:04:58.443
In other words,
take up just that second row,

78
00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:02.783
and grid-column: 1/2.

79
00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:08.269
And that we'll put our figure
caption right on top of our image.

80
00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:09.449
Makes sense?

81
00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.831
At this point,
we now have our figures in place and

82
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:14.509
we have our figure
captions overlapping them.

83
00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.489
Obviously, we have some over overlap here
between the image and the next figure.

84
00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:23.496
But we're going to address that
here momentarily when we lay

85
00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:28.598
these out in our desktop grid,
where we have all of the figures

86
00:05:28.598 --> 00:05:34.979
next to each other in the layout
that looks like, Like this.

87
00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.304
Where we have the big picture
over on the left side and

88
00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:42.177
then we have the two other
pictures over here on the right.

89
00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:43.344
Makes sense?

90
00:05:43.344 --> 00:05:46.835
Okay, so let's just continue
on writing our code here.

91
00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:58.356
And what I'm going to do now is for
these first three figures, and

92
00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:04.610
I'm just going to fold them up so
that the code's a little easier to read.

93
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.740
For these first three figures, I'm going
to lay them out with grid as well.

94
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.340
And so what I'm going to do is,
at the very top here,

95
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.990
I'm gonna add a div with a class of top

96
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.350
grid because this is the top grid.

97
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.786
[LAUGH] And a /div underneath, okay?

98
00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:37.265
And with that div around
the whole thing in place,

99
00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:43.636
then we could add our top
grid styling here, .topgrid.

100
00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.951
We're going to also display as grid.

101
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:54.905
And we're going to have
grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr.

102
00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:59.970
So in other words, make one column
twice as wide as the other okay,

103
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.494
and there they are trying to cram into
all the space there, you see that?

104
00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:07.462
It's because we had
written half of our code.

105
00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:12.492
I'm gonna give this a gap of 2rem.

106
00:07:15.452 --> 00:07:18.352
So that'll give us a little
bit of space in between, okay?

107
00:07:18.352 --> 00:07:26.080
So you see that, and then the very first
one here, this coffee cup image here.

108
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.096
I need this to stretch down over two rows,
and

109
00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:36.020
then have these two, the bootcamp and
the advanced CSS layouts.

110
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.194
I need this displaying over
here on the right hand side.

111
00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:43.851
So to set that up, we can say,

112
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:50.157
For the top grid, for the figure,

113
00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:55.480
that's the first one or the first child,

114
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.802
grid-row: span 2.

115
00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:04.419
In other words,
span yourself over two columns.

116
00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:05.166
There they are.

117
00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:14.489
Okay.
Nice?

118
00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:19.625
All right, so it looks like our
h3s are probably a little bit big.

119
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.955
So let's reduce that size as well.

120
00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:27.825
So I'm going to say for my topgrid h3,

121
00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:33.582
let's turn off the margin
on the bottom to 0,

122
00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:38.895
and make our font size, var, how about h5

123
00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:43.926
because it's just a little bit too big.

124
00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:47.603
Now, wow, look at that.

125
00:08:47.603 --> 00:08:51.123
You have cool overlapping
captions with your figures.

126
00:08:51.123 --> 00:08:52.280
How awesome is that?
