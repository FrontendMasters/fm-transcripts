00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.550
The next thing we need to do is get
our page ready for tablet and for

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.430
mobile dimensions, because,
as you know, this site looks absolutely

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.140
fantastic when we're looking at
it at large dimensions here.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.750
Hey, totally awesome.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.734
But as we make this smaller, our pictures
get smaller, things get smushed together,

6
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.687
and it's just not nearly
as pretty as it used to be.

7
00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:28.284
So we need to modify our display
with some media queries.

8
00:00:28.284 --> 00:00:31.444
So let's go ahead and add those now.

9
00:00:31.444 --> 00:00:35.120
And you can continue to
follow along with me,

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.543
working with the same CodePen
that you have been working on.

11
00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:45.312
Or if you take a look inside
of the website for the class,

12
00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.963
you can find a second CodePen.

13
00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:54.918
Beginning CodePen here for your tablet and
mobile layouts here and an ending

14
00:00:54.918 --> 00:01:00.352
CodePen for that if you've managed it,
if you've gotten lost along the way.

15
00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:05.137
Okay, so what we're going to do now
is we're gonna need to put in some

16
00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:10.439
more media queries that are going
to make these items start to Stack.

17
00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.216
So what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to

18
00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:20.260
add an apt media query
inside of my we're just

19
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.466
continuing on to add to
the layer of projects.

20
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.712
And for my media query,
I'm going to say max-width,

21
00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:38.492
992 pixels, which was determined by,
as you know,

22
00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:43.119
just scrubbing back and
forth here and saying, well,

23
00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.161
where does it stop looking quite so
good and picking a spot?

24
00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:54.248
So I happened to pick 992 pixels,
because that's what worked for me.

25
00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:59.044
And so as you and right now,
I'm looking at it around 936,

26
00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:01.442
so you see that my words here for

27
00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:07.393
advanced CSS layouts have started
to sort of scroll off the picture.

28
00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.172
It's just not looking as
good as it did before.

29
00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:12.493
So this is how I chose this.

30
00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:17.373
And so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to top grid, okay?

31
00:02:17.373 --> 00:02:20.529
Which remember top grid we
had worked with before, and

32
00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.953
we had told it to make us two columns.

33
00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:26.413
One is two fractions wide,
and one is one fraction wide.

34
00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:31.853
Well, what I'm gonna do with top grid now
is I'm just going to say display block.

35
00:02:33.063 --> 00:02:34.993
In other words,
I don't want any grid at all,

36
00:02:34.993 --> 00:02:37.133
just stack everybody on top of each other.

37
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.653
There they are, make sense?

38
00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:44.136
Does it like the easiest
solution that's here at all?

39
00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:45.826
But when you do this of course,

40
00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:48.976
there is no space in between
these particular items.

41
00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:52.336
So you are also going to
need to add some space.

42
00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:57.616
So for top grid figure, so
at the bottom of each of these figures,

43
00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:02.956
we can say margin hyphen bottom,
maybe something like 4rem.

44
00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.360
You could go with 2rem,
too, that would be fine.

45
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.874
But for whatever reason,
I thought 4rem was a nice number, okay?

46
00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:14.421
So pretty simple there they are all
stacked on top of each other,

47
00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:15.416
how cool is that?

48
00:03:16.606 --> 00:03:19.036
All right, nice and straightforward.

49
00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:23.340
Now, the bottom grid is going
to be interesting [LAUGH].

50
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.500
So, what we have here with
the bottom grid, remember,

51
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.899
on the desktop layout to the desktop
layout, while the desktop layout,

52
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:37.965
we just have our five icons all
next to each other straightforward.

53
00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:42.149
But when we get to our tablet layout,
our designer friend said,

54
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.123
hey, why don't you do this?

55
00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:48.531
[LAUGH] To what you said, cool.

56
00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:52.848
[LAUGH] Okay, well, here's the thing.

57
00:03:52.848 --> 00:03:55.978
With grid, this is not gonna be possible.

58
00:03:55.978 --> 00:04:00.289
Can anybody guess why with a name like
grid, why this might not be possible,

59
00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.356
&gt;&gt; Because the second row is overlapping?

60
00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:12.872
&gt;&gt; Correct, cuz everything
shifted over in the middle here.

61
00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:16.012
If it's a grid, it's a grid.

62
00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:19.152
They should be on top of each other,
right, and all lined up.

63
00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:24.827
But this is the middle of these images is
lined up with the gap on the top row here,

64
00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:25.814
okay?

65
00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:31.674
The only way to achieve a layout
like this is with Flexbox, okay?

66
00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:33.624
Flexbox can do this, grid cannot.

67
00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:39.593
So that is what we're going to
do here is change bottom grid to

68
00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.938
display is Flexbox instead.

69
00:04:43.078 --> 00:04:45.906
So we'll say bottom grid,

70
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:52.573
Display flex, which is how, fortunately,

71
00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:57.748
the markup is exactly the same
with parents and children.

72
00:04:57.748 --> 00:05:02.664
We just now need to change this
to display as Flexibox and

73
00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:07.099
flex-flow row wrap, And

74
00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.331
it would take a quick peek
at how this is going here.

75
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:16.045
Not very well so far, okay?

76
00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:21.780
Then we're going to say
justify-content center,

77
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.603
and we're gonna say align content center,

78
00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:30.004
and we're gonna give it a gap.

79
00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:36.245
And we're gonna give our gap two numbers,
6rem and 2rem.

80
00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:40.017
6rem will be in the row in between.

81
00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:43.978
So we'll have a bigger gap in between
the row of three and the row of two.

82
00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:48.088
And the 2rem will be the gap
in between each of the images.

83
00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:50.893
Now, if you take a look at this,
it's still gonna look kind of awful,

84
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:52.408
at least they're centered.

85
00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:54.853
But it's really not very pretty yet, okay?

86
00:05:54.853 --> 00:06:00.262
And the reason why is, we have told
Flexbox to put these all together.

87
00:06:00.262 --> 00:06:03.738
But we haven't told the Flexbox
how wide to make these.

88
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:07.958
Remember, we talked about the difference
between width and flex-basis.

89
00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:13.574
So what I need to do now
is tell bottom grid,

90
00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:24.007
And we can just say the children
of bottom grid, all of them.

91
00:06:24.007 --> 00:06:28.320
We want them to have a flex-basis of 30%.

92
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.956
So 30%, obviously,
like times three, is 90%.

93
00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:37.070
So that gives us a little bit of free
space that will help, set up our gap,

94
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.637
right?

95
00:06:40.177 --> 00:06:43.136
So there we go, boom,
it just magically appears.

96
00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:47.467
As soon as you set up that
flex-basis to be 30%,

97
00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:52.932
they just appear in the right
configuration, how cool is that?

98
00:06:54.922 --> 00:06:59.461
Okay, so then, the one thing that's
missing now is if you notice that bootcamp

99
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:04.761
icon there, It's a little bit shorter
than the other icons that are around it.

100
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:05.679
And remember,

101
00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:10.541
we applied a little formula to get all
of our images to be the same size.

102
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:13.831
And then applied to our top grid, but
it's not applying to our bottom grid.

103
00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:16.141
So let's apply that to our bottom grid.

104
00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:21.333
So we're gonna say bottom grid, IMG.

105
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:28.001
And we're going to do this again,
object-fit,

106
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:33.557
cover, width, 100%, and height,

107
00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:38.779
100%, Okay,

108
00:07:40.518 --> 00:07:45.347
And then, they'll all be nice and
pretty in the same kind of dimensions,

109
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.107
Isn't that amazing, So

110
00:07:55.107 --> 00:08:01.541
it's gonna go from that perfect, lovely,
five-across, all same-size image.

111
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:08.126
And then, it's gonna go to the three and
the two and it looks good, okay?

112
00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:12.385
Questions on that so
far, I'm sorry, so if I-

113
00:08:12.385 --> 00:08:14.464
&gt;&gt; We have three and two, right?

114
00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:15.259
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

115
00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:19.182
&gt;&gt; Keep moving smaller you have two and
three.

116
00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:24.316
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, because I set
my flex-basis to 30% here, so

117
00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:30.241
the size of each of these children
is now 30%, you won't actually,

118
00:08:30.241 --> 00:08:36.480
I mean, at some point, they do,
in fact, wrap out like this, okay?

119
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.570
Which is also,
still looks very attractive.

120
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.033
And as we get smaller,
eventually [LAUGH], but

121
00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:51.031
they're 30% still, and
that's why they're so tiny here.

122
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.619
So, we're now definitely beyond the point
where we need to make some modifications

123
00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:55.797
with another media query.

124
00:08:55.797 --> 00:08:59.205
Make sense, yeah, okay.

125
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:04.514
And so my next media query is at 667

126
00:09:04.514 --> 00:09:09.138
pixels, and 667 pixels is,

127
00:09:09.138 --> 00:09:14.007
667, right around in here.

128
00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:17.369
So it actually is going
to go to this 2 across,

129
00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:22.288
2 rows of 2 plus the 1,
before we go to our final media query.

130
00:09:22.288 --> 00:09:26.143
I'm actually fine with that, as I said,
I think it still looks fine, and

131
00:09:26.143 --> 00:09:29.298
that's ultimately what
we are concerned about.

132
00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:34.658
If that bothers you, you could make this
go stack on top of each other sooner.

133
00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:36.158
So it's a design decision.

134
00:09:39.318 --> 00:09:45.876
All right, so with our media queries here,
we have our first media query.

135
00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:50.483
We're gonna add another
media query @media, and

136
00:09:50.483 --> 00:09:54.348
this will be max-width, 667 pixels,

137
00:09:56.972 --> 00:10:02.810
So here, sorry, bottom grid

138
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.719
will have a gap of 2rem.

139
00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.126
So that's the first thing
that we need to do.

140
00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:15.909
Make sure that our gap
is got kinda big there.

141
00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:19.724
Remember, we had, I think it was
like a 6rem gap in the row, and

142
00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:22.424
they were kinda spread
out all over the page.

143
00:10:22.424 --> 00:10:26.681
Now, I'm setting the gap to
an even 2rem for all of those.

144
00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:31.911
And then for bottom grid a,
in other words, the links,

145
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:36.263
right now those are set to 30% each, okay?

146
00:10:36.263 --> 00:10:38.841
Which is why they're still
in this configuration.

147
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:42.971
I'm now gonna set my flex-basis to 80%.

148
00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:48.222
So in other words, make take over
most of that particular area and

149
00:10:48.222 --> 00:10:52.142
fill it with the picture,
so there it is, okay?

150
00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:58.508
And obviously, as we make it smaller,
it continues to look better.

151
00:10:58.508 --> 00:11:04.689
Now, let's take a look
at the top grid here,

152
00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:18.732
Let's see, yeah,
because I did the top grid on tablet, but

153
00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:21.484
I did not do the top grid on mobile.

154
00:11:21.484 --> 00:11:26.266
So a few modifications, so
we wanna make on the top grid on mobile.

155
00:11:26.266 --> 00:11:32.696
And so what we're going to do is,
4 667 pixels here.

156
00:11:35.716 --> 00:11:42.425
For top grid figure,
let's put a margin-bottom of 2rem, okay?

157
00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:51.406
So in other words, we're just continuing
to tighten a little bit of space here.

158
00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:54.239
It was larger,
I think it was 4rem at tablet, so

159
00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:59.146
we're just tightening this up a little bit
here and particularly to match the images

160
00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:04.797
that are going to come after,
The other thing is projects

161
00:12:04.797 --> 00:12:09.919
that I am proud of gets a little bit big
at this particular screen dimension.

162
00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:16.551
So I am going to add to
this a section-projects h2,

163
00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:21.376
and I'm gonna change my font-size to

164
00:12:21.376 --> 00:12:26.374
var h5, And

165
00:12:26.374 --> 00:12:31.899
these figure captions, once again, the CSS
projects text and advanced CSS layouts,

166
00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:36.610
these titles, get a little bit big,
so we may wanna reduce those as well.

167
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:43.436
Figcaption h3, font-size,

168
00:12:43.436 --> 00:12:47.235
var base-size.

169
00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:55.891
So let's make them a little bit smaller,
And so that's great.

170
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:01.747
That looks much better now, when we get
down to these mobile dimensions, okay,

171
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.564
So really, when you, as you're working
on tablets and you're working on mobile,

172
00:13:09.564 --> 00:13:13.693
it's really just taking a look at these
pages and looking at them by eye.

173
00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:18.411
Part of the reason that I love working in
CodePen here for this is that I can scrub

174
00:13:18.411 --> 00:13:23.273
this back and forth and know exactly where
in terms of the width of the screen that I

175
00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:27.731
look at got it and I go, that just
doesn't really look good anymore.

176
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:32.141
What is that particular width of
the viewport at that point in time?

177
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:36.219
So that's a very convenient way to
work on these particular issues and

178
00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:39.771
then decide where you want
to put your media queries.

179
00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:42.693
One of the things that happens
with a lot of the frameworks is

180
00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:45.040
that those media queries may be preset for
you.

181
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.590
And so you don't have this luxury of
customizing all these particular areas

182
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.800
without writing additional custom code
to go with that particular framework.

183
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.618
So here we are able to customize this and
make it absolutely perfect for

184
00:13:56.618 --> 00:14:01.149
this particular design rather than just
sort of a cookie-cutter solution that may

185
00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.624
or may not work with
this particular design,
