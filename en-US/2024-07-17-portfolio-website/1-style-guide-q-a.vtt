1
00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:05.388
So let us get started then
with building our website.

2
00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:09.926
And so just briefly here, if you click on
here in the chapter listing from the home

3
00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.128
page, if you click on prerequisites,

4
00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:15.286
this is going to talk a little
bit about the technology.

5
00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.847
I've talked to you about
most of this before.

6
00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:22.320
I've given you some points about how you
might customize this website for yourself.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.541
Again, sort of the baseline knowledge that
I expect you to have coming into this

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:30.325
course is what you would get out of
the front-end master's boot camp.

9
00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:35.119
And that was something that I recorded
with Brian Holt several years ago now,

10
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:39.398
but what you would have learned
there is still absolutely relevant,

11
00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:41.978
especially in the HTML and CSS space, and

12
00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:45.914
that would give you a baseline of HTML and
CSS coming into this.

13
00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:49.431
In terms of technology,
we're gonna be working in, as I mentioned,

14
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:51.350
VS Code, which is a free code editor.

15
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.584
We can talk about that in a little while,
if you wanna use something else, yeah,

16
00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:58.963
that's totally fine as well and
we're gonna be using CodePen.

17
00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:03.312
The way we start building websites
these days is we start with a so

18
00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:04.769
called style guide.

19
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.909
These style guides may be super
complicated if you are building a really

20
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.462
big meaty website for a major corporation,

21
00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:14.440
in our case this is going
to be rather lightweight.

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.792
We wanna set up some basic
styling that's in place.

23
00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:22.502
We're going to set up things
like colors and fonts and

24
00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:27.209
font sizes and maybe some base
styling on some of our HTML elements.

25
00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.306
So that is where we're going to start,

26
00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:32.044
you will find here a link
to the beginning CodePen.

27
00:01:32.044 --> 00:01:38.760
If you click on that, this will
open the CodePen in another window.

28
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.503
Hopefully you have a CodePen account,
if not,

29
00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:44.187
you may wanna take a moment to sign up for
this.

30
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:47.873
What you can do down here at
the very bottom of the page,

31
00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:53.245
there is a button down here in the very,
very lower right corner that says fork,

32
00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:57.999
and that you can then fork this
particular code pen into your account.

33
00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:00.639
That makes your very own copy of it so

34
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.426
that you can make changes
to this particular page.

35
00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:08.087
As you see here across the top,
we have HTML, CSS, and

36
00:02:08.087 --> 00:02:11.762
JavaScript that you can write
here inside of CodePen.

37
00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:14.374
This is not my preferred arrangement for
CodePen.

38
00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:18.173
I generally like to put the code
on the left side of the page.

39
00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:21.768
And if you're like me,
you can change this layout as well.

40
00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.309
You gonna go to the thing
up here in the upper right,

41
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:25.914
it looks kind of like a cupcake.

42
00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:32.016
It says change view, where I'm going
to click on the left side here.

43
00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:36.511
So the cupcake flipped over on its side
and I just find this easier to look at,

44
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.208
I can see my webpage better.

45
00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:43.175
And the other nice part is that I can
grab my bar here in the middle and

46
00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:45.852
make my screen larger and smaller.

47
00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:49.479
As we get into the responsive side
of things, that'll be important.

48
00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:54.530
&gt;&gt; When should I use raw CSS and when
should I reach for a framework or library?

49
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.589
&gt;&gt; When should you use raw CSS?

50
00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:01.153
For every single website you build.

51
00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:02.680
Anybody else want more opinions?

52
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.050
[LAUGH] I am not a fan of Tailwind,
I am really not a fan of Bootstrap.

53
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.059
Particularly, I'm not a fan of Tailwind.

54
00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:15.301
I think Tailwind gets rid of the most
important parts of CSS notably

55
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:19.998
the cascading inheritance, which you
can take massive advantage of when

56
00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:23.808
the building websites and
Tailwind gets rid of all of that.

57
00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:28.508
So to me Tailwind is like me coding
with one hand tied behind my back.

58
00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.564
So I don't recommend any of
those particular frameworks.

59
00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:35.250
Back in the day I used to
do more with Bootstrap.

60
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.282
Bootstrap was helpful back before
we had two great tools for layout.

61
00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:44.117
Now we have Flexbox and grid and you
can join me in my course on Flexbox and

62
00:03:44.117 --> 00:03:46.869
grid right here at front-end masters.

63
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.011
Once you understand how Flexbox and
grid work, you don't need

64
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.635
any of these CSS frameworks in order
to write those particular layouts.

65
00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:57.992
So that is my opinion on
that particular item.

66
00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:01.353
&gt;&gt; And I'll just add to it, I'm not
refuting anything what you're saying.

67
00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:04.203
I'm just saying in a professional context,

68
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:09.007
your team might choose to use Tailwind,
they might choose to use whatever.

69
00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:13.296
And having that foundational
knowledge is going to help you,

70
00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:17.751
no matter what tool or framework,
even if you do find yourself in

71
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:22.783
a bootstrap situation cuz there's
plenty of websites built with that,

72
00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:27.256
or whatever, Tailwind or whatever,
the framework of the day.

73
00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:31.380
So yeah,
having a foundation is the key to being

74
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.445
successful in any type of
situation you're thrown into.

75
00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:38.550
&gt;&gt; And that is absolutely true.

76
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.508
What Mark is saying is that the key
here being the framework of the day.

77
00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:46.987
So I know a lot of you wind
up learning some framework.

78
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:50.676
Well, my framework would have been
macromedia dream weever three when I

79
00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:51.408
started out.

80
00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:53.552
Guess how much good that's doing me today.

81
00:04:53.552 --> 00:04:55.928
Zero, and you know what?

82
00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.311
Tailwind may seem like it's inevitable and
it'll be here forever, but

83
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:01.206
I promise you what's gonna die one day.

84
00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:03.210
And when it does,
what are you going to do?

85
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.069
If you know the fundamentals, always, if
you know the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and

86
00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.532
JavaScript, you can learn any
framework that comes along.

87
00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:16.271
So that is why we are here today and
learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

88
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:22.154
&gt;&gt; If one were to build a website entirely
on their own, what would be the advantages

89
00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:26.923
of having a style guide even when
you are solo or with a small team.

90
00:05:26.923 --> 00:05:31.897
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so one of the nice things about
starting with a style guide is that this

91
00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:37.046
is going to give you kind of your baseline
settings for the rest of the website.

92
00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:40.452
So again, because we've set
up here's our base colors,

93
00:05:40.452 --> 00:05:43.243
our base spots are base styles for
the website.

94
00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:48.521
We wind up doing a ton less work later
because we're gonna leverage inheritance

95
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:53.500
and the cascade here in CSS from our
base into later portions of our design.

96
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.000
We don't have to keep writing
the same code over and over again.

97
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.384
That is why we start off with a base,

98
00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:03.369
even if you're building a website
using Only HTML and CSS.

99
00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:08.456
It's still extremely helpful to
have those base settings in place.

100
00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:13.455
&gt;&gt; Do you recommend using VS code or
an editor on your local machine, or

101
00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:18.558
are we gonna focus on CodePen
throughout the entire day or should we?

102
00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:21.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, the methodology that I'm

103
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.567
going to use here is I think better for
beginning students.

104
00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:31.442
If you are really into code you already
have like all of the command line things

105
00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:34.217
all set up and
all the GitHub things set up and

106
00:06:34.217 --> 00:06:38.494
all the rest of the tools that you
people use for building websites,

107
00:06:38.494 --> 00:06:43.396
you absolutely can start and use all of
those with VS code, no problem at all.

108
00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:46.161
But if you are starting
as a beginning beginner,

109
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.871
if you don't have a whole lot of
experience in working with code,

110
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.580
I find that code pen is such a great
tool for starting out because we

111
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.508
can write our code, see the effect
on the webpage immediately here.

112
00:06:57.508 --> 00:07:01.561
And what you'll see us do over the course
of today, is that we're gonna take our

113
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:05.376
design, we're gonna break each one of
those sections into an independent

114
00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:09.515
problem here in CodePen and solve for
each one of those sections independently.

115
00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:11.849
So we'll wind up with
a whole bunch of CodePens.

116
00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.678
Then in chapter six,
we'll take each of those sections and

117
00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:19.134
we'll combine them in VS
code into a single webpage.

118
00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:23.853
So, the idea here is to demonstrate
how you can take what seems to be

119
00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:29.270
a mind-blowingly huge problem,
how the heck am I gonna code this webpage?

120
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.164
How you can break it down into very small
pieces, how you can solve for each of

121
00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:38.774
those small pieces, then reassemble
those into a full webpage later.

122
00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:42.347
And that is the the pedagogy
behind what I'm doing today.
