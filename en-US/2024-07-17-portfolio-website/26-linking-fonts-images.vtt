WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.297
I am going to go back to
my web browser here, and

2
00:00:03.297 --> 00:00:09.232
I've actually kept my Google Fonts open
the entire time here, you might not have.

3
00:00:09.232 --> 00:00:13.026
So we need to make sure
that you have your families

4
00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:16.093
selected here inside of Google Fonts.

5
00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:22.145
So go to fonts.google.com,
we wanna make sure that we have so

6
00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:27.179
selected Fera Mano,
Josefin Sans and Lato, okay?

7
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.378
Chances are when you open up
fonts.google.com, this is all still there.

8
00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:33.966
Is that true, people in the classroom?

9
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.220
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.844
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're
going to go to get embed code, and right

11
00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:46.664
here where it says, embed the code in the
head of your HTML, all of that right here.

12
00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:53.210
We're gonna copy that code and we're gonna
put that exactly in the head of our HTML.

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.051
So you can put this,
I like to put my style sheet last, so

14
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:03.098
I'm gonna put this after
the title before my style sheet,

15
00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:05.984
I'm just gonna paste that on in.

16
00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:09.891
So yours should look
something like this now.

17
00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:19.644
&gt;&gt; It didn't remember my fonts,
are they listed on this

18
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:24.505
chapter 6 page or
should I go to the previous chapter?

19
00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.431
&gt;&gt; If you take a look,
I think it's chapter 1,

20
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.984
it'll tell you exactly
the fonts that you need, yep?

21
00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:32.839
Okay, great.

22
00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:37.441
So now we have our HTML document,
it is currently talking to,

23
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.981
in theory,
talking to Google to get the fonts,

24
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:46.309
it's talking to our stylesheet,
let's think about our images next.

25
00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:51.637
So, if you open up each of these
sections here on the web page,

26
00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:57.688
you will find somewhere, let me find
a section that has an image in it.

27
00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.702
To go all the way to the container,
the section featured area here,

28
00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:11.839
and you will see that all of the images
currently go, .2codepen, make sense?

29
00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:17.090
Because we copied this out of CodePen, so
it's doing exactly what it was told to do.

30
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.315
What we need to do is we need to swap this
from CodePen to the images that are right

31
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:25.303
there on your hard drive, which you
should have downloaded from GitHub.

32
00:02:25.303 --> 00:02:27.826
So the easiest way to do this is,

33
00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:32.409
we're just gonna highlight
what we've got here, okay?

34
00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:39.145
So I'm gonna highlight
assets.codepen.io/that number, okay?

35
00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:42.117
And then I'm going to go to Find and
Replace,

36
00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:46.041
which I think is under Selection,
it's under Selection.

37
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:51.442
It's under Edit, and
I'm going to choose Replace.

38
00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:57.053
So what I'm going to do instead
of having assets.codepen.io/

39
00:02:57.053 --> 00:03:01.443
that number,
I'm going to replace that with img.

40
00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:07.402
So that img should fit right in there
with a slash, and then my image name.

41
00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:08.837
Make sense?

42
00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:14.083
Okay, always good to do one first and
make sure it works the way you expect,

43
00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:19.605
[LAUGH] before you swap them all and
then find out you broke everything, right?

44
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:23.624
So try one, make sure it worked

45
00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:28.448
okay, Let's see.

46
00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:36.914
So we replace one, make sure it works
okay, and then if that is true and

47
00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:40.153
it's working okay,
then you can replace them all.

48
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.161
All right, and
there's quite a few of them in here.

49
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.510
Once you're done with
that here in your HTML,

50
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.197
you're also gonna wanna do that same
search inside of your stylesheet.

51
00:03:55.197 --> 00:04:00.627
So, save your HTML,
we're gonna switch over to the stylesheet.

52
00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:04.756
Remember, your style sheet has
got lots of images in it also, so

53
00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:08.892
we can do this exact same search
here inside of your stylesheet.

54
00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:11.853
I am going to do that search for

55
00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:17.663
assets.codepen.io/ the number,
and we'll find it.

56
00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:20.454
We'll swap it and make sure it works.

57
00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:25.047
But remember, this time,

58
00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:30.439
what we have happening here is,

59
00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.445
actually, can I undo?

60
00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:35.494
I can undo.

61
00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:40.516
What we have actually happening this time,
if I swap in img,

62
00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:44.163
is that the right path
here to these images?

63
00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:49.407
If I said url is img/fem-comment.jpeg,

64
00:04:49.407 --> 00:04:52.248
is that the right path?

65
00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:53.913
Why not?

66
00:04:53.913 --> 00:04:58.998
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Well,

67
00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:02.443
actually, the code is correct,
this is a URL,

68
00:05:02.443 --> 00:05:07.883
this the way you write it inside of CSS,
but the path is incorrect, right?

69
00:05:07.883 --> 00:05:14.487
Because I'm currently in my stylesheet
here, and I need to get to my images here.

70
00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:18.519
This path is gonna tell me to
look inside of my CSS, yeah,

71
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.545
cuz I'm currently in my style sheethere,

72
00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:26.939
I need to look inside of my stylesheet
folder for another folder called img.

73
00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.992
And I don't have one of those.

74
00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:31.178
So how do I fix this problem?

75
00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:35.317
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Dot, dot, slash.

76
00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:39.944
I'm gonna put a dot, dot, slash in front
of it, and by the way, VS Code rewards

77
00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:44.871
that by telling you, yeah, I kinda know
now where you're talking about, okay?

78
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:45.783
So the Find and

79
00:05:45.783 --> 00:05:50.738
Replace here is gonna have to be dot dot
slash when you get to your stylesheet.

80
00:05:50.738 --> 00:05:58.087
Now we can swap these And
make the changes here to your stylesheet.

81
00:05:58.087 --> 00:06:03.869
Hopefully that is all in place.

82
00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:05.109
Phew!

83
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.456
So now we have an HTML file,
that HTML file links to our Google Fonts,

84
00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:16.136
that HTML file links to our custom
stylesheet, that HTML file was looking for

85
00:06:16.136 --> 00:06:20.759
images that are on the hard drive that's
in front of us, not off at CodePen.

86
00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.707
And our stylesheet is also looking for
images that are on our hard drive,

87
00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:26.076
not in front of CodePen.

88
00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:31.297
Phew, so that is how you move all of those
sections that you developed in CodePen,

89
00:06:31.297 --> 00:06:34.096
add a CodePen, and
put them into VS Code, so

90
00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:37.288
that you can continue to
do further development.
