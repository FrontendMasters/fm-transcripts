00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.482
Top grid is now done for our desktop
layout, we're gonna need to go back and

2
00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:09.412
revisit this top grid for
mobile and tablet layouts.

3
00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:14.022
But before we do that,
let's focus on the bottom grid, okay?

4
00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.880
So that means we're gonna
go back to our HTML and

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.231
we have a whole bunch of
these items here underneath.

6
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:28.021
So we have, once again, a course link,
a course image, and a course title.

7
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.388
That's all.

8
00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:34.396
And what we're going to do here is
I'm gonna set up the first one for

9
00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:37.715
you, and
then you can set up the other ones.

10
00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:42.066
So we are going to have, of course,

11
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:48.604
an image source would be
this particular image here.

12
00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:56.023
In this case, it's a webP image, okay?

13
00:00:56.023 --> 00:01:01.333
And the Alt text for
that is going to be the name of that

14
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:06.306
particular icon,
in this case, CSS Projects.

15
00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.991
And then around this,
we are going to put in a link.

16
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:17.703
So this is a href = '

17
00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:27.471
Target = _blank.

18
00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:34.929
And then we can end with a /a, okay

19
00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:42.532
So you should see, down here on
the bottom, you should see an image.

20
00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:46.665
And they may be kind of big,
don't worry about it,

21
00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:50.331
we'll fix that particular problem, okay?

22
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.485
So in other words,
we just have clickable images here,

23
00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:57.713
we have alt text that's available for
screen readers, and that's pretty

24
00:01:57.713 --> 00:02:01.760
much all that we need down here for
these five images down at the bottom.

25
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.948
Okay, markup all the rest of them, once
again, I recommend just copy paste, and

26
00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:08.207
then substitute in the appropriate links.

27
00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:30.035
All right, so
hopefully you did okay with that,

28
00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:33.376
you should now have a series
of images there on the screen.

29
00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:37.591
You'll see that they start
with some kind of link.

30
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.415
Hopefully they open in a separate window.

31
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:45.139
And then you'll have your image that's
there with the alt text that was given to

32
00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.704
you for each one of those.

33
00:02:46.704 --> 00:02:50.710
So you've got five of these images,
and if you scroll down the page,

34
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.935
there they all are in all their glory.

35
00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:55.181
They're kind of big, but that's cool.

36
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:56.012
That's fine.

37
00:02:56.012 --> 00:02:59.747
All right, everybody got that okay?

38
00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:04.166
All right, now all we need to do is
make them stretch across the bottom of

39
00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:06.976
the three images that we
have here at the top.

40
00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:12.249
And so to do that, once again,
we need to manage our HTM.

41
00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:18.417
So we know that we have here in our HTML,
we have our div with a class of top grid,

42
00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:23.938
right, that was our parent, and
the figures here were our children.

43
00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:28.101
You declare grid on the parent,
in this case a top grid, and

44
00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:31.868
the figures then line up
exactly as you wish in space.

45
00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:36.303
We're going to do exactly the same thing
here with our series of linked images.

46
00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:43.326
So we are going to add to this
a div with a class of, guess what?

47
00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:48.583
Bottom grid,
because I'm super creative that way.

48
00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:51.983
And if you scroll all the way
down to the bottom here,

49
00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:55.087
we are going to add another
/div at the bottom.

50
00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:59.355
So now we have a nice grouping here for

51
00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:03.082
our five linked images, okay?

52
00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:05.779
So that's the change you
need to make to your HTML.

53
00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:12.325
Then when we take a look at our CSS,
still inside of our project's layer,

54
00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:17.517
we're going to add our next
style which is .bottomgrid.

55
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:25.183
And this is where we say display grid,
and what we wanna do

56
00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:31.343
is we basically wanna put all five
of those images next to each other.

57
00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:37.533
That is a series of five columns, they
are probably all exactly the same width.

58
00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:43.795
So we can write that as grid template
columns, and there's a shorthand,

59
00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:48.240
I mean, you can write, 1fr,1fr,1fr,1fr,

60
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.908
if you wanna write that,
you totally can, and it'll work great.

61
00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:56.116
In fact, there they are.

62
00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.739
How awesome is that?

63
00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:02.190
But there is also
a shorthand you can use for

64
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.403
this, which is repeat: (5), ifr.

65
00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:09.767
In other words, give me five 1fr's.

66
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.959
It does exactly the same thing, okay?

67
00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:13.062
And there they are.

68
00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:17.518
Let's give them a little
bit of space in between.

69
00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:22.124
How about a gap of 2rem.

70
00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:23.702
There we go.

71
00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:26.012
So pretty?

72
00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:30.566
And 2rem because we used 2rem up here on
the top as the gaps in between our grid

73
00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:32.262
elements up here on the top.

74
00:05:32.262 --> 00:05:36.685
And then the last thing I
wanna do is actually give this

75
00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:41.794
a little bit of margin of 2rem0,
so that will give us a little

76
00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:46.342
bit of a gap in between our top grid and
our bottom grid.

77
00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:50.198
Pretty, and now it all looks
like one great big huge piece,

78
00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:55.155
and it really isn't, it's two completely
separate pieces here in space.
