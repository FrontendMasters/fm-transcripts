1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.054
Well, congratulations,

2
00:00:02.054 --> 00:00:07.869
you have all survived to have now coded
every single section of this website.

3
00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:13.441
It's all been coded, and we are ready
now to start moving things into VS code.

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:18.099
The last step here for putting
together this homepage is to actually

5
00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.600
assemble the homepage from
the Component CodePens that we have.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.425
So the first thing that I need
to ask everybody here to do,

7
00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.871
is to open up VS Code.

8
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:31.751
If you want to open up your copy of VS
Code, you should see something like this.

9
00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:34.970
It looks absolutely like nothing at all.

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.549
This is just plain old VS Code.

11
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:42.208
What I'm going to do to get started here,
I'm just gonna work on my desktop.

12
00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:51.428
And here on my desktop,
I am going to make a new folder.

13
00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:54.029
However you go about making a new folder,

14
00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:57.075
make a new folder right
here on your desktop, and

15
00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:02.051
I am going to call this portfolio, that is
going to be the name of the folder where

16
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:06.842
I'm going to keep all of my files
associated with this particular website.

17
00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:11.313
Inside of portfolio,
I am going to make more folders.

18
00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:14.977
I'm gonna make one folder called img.

19
00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:17.530
That is where my images are going to go.

20
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.478
And I'm going to make another folder here.

21
00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:22.456
This is going to It's gonna be called CSS.

22
00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:25.291
Guess what goes in there?

23
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:31.143
Okay, that's where our style
sheets are gonna go, all right?

24
00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:34.877
And then what I can do is, in VS Code,

25
00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:40.424
I can just drag my portfolio
folder right into VS Code.

26
00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:43.214
And it should set itself up so

27
00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:49.043
that you can see the folders
over here on the left hand side.

28
00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:51.880
Now we're gonna do a whole
lot of copying and pasting.

29
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.285
First thing we're gonna do is download
some images in a starting HTML file from

30
00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:56.828
GitHub.

31
00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:01.181
You can get there from the course
website if you go to the GitHub icon

32
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:04.857
up here in the upper right-hand corner and
click on it.

33
00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.671
This is going to put you into GitHub.

34
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:09.565
And what you'll see here is chapter six.

35
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.965
This is the thing that we're going
to need to download to our computer.

36
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:17.005
If you're a GitHub person and
you're familiar with how GitHub works,

37
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.705
do your GitHub magic, however it
is that you wind up doing that and

38
00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:23.017
download these files to your computer.

39
00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.165
If you are not a GitHub person,

40
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:30.547
what I would recommend that you do is
here in this green button that says code.

41
00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:33.150
There is an option to download a zip file.

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.117
That's what we're gonna do here.

43
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.193
And it's gonna ask me
where to download it.

44
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.335
I'm going to put it on my desktop.

45
00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:47.656
Okay.

46
00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:52.318
And then I'm going to go to my desktop,
and

47
00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:59.062
inside of my portfolio folder,
I'm gonna unzip my zip here.

48
00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:06.002
I'm gonna grab my images out
of this folder, all of them.

49
00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:13.528
And I'm going to drag them into
my portfolio images folder.

50
00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:15.926
[SOUND] Okay.

51
00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:19.683
I'm also gonna grab the project,
start.HTML, and

52
00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:24.620
I'm gonna drag and drop that into
my portfolio folder as well, okay.

53
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.729
And again, if you know, if you're a GitHub
person and you know how to do this,

54
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:28.686
you just do your thing.

55
00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:32.691
The end result should be that
you have a folder called CSS,

56
00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:37.840
a folder called Images that has all of
the images in it that you downloaded,

57
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.864
and a file called Project Start.HTML, and

58
00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:44.975
all of those should be inside
of a folder called Portfolio.

59
00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.429
Everybody okay so far?

60
00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.764
Fantastic.

61
00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:53.951
Okay.

62
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.674
Great.

63
00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:03.136
So now that we have those folders and
the images that are downloaded and

64
00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:06.072
we're set up and ready to go with that.

65
00:04:06.072 --> 00:04:10.291
What we're going to do is go
from our most recent CodePen.

66
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:17.206
We'll copy the CSS from that and
paste it into a new style dot CSS folder.

67
00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:20.821
And so
the most recent CodePen was Chapter five,

68
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:26.392
which we just went through, putting
together the featured project here.

69
00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:31.082
This contains all of the CSS that
we've written in the course to this

70
00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:32.160
point in time.

71
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.660
If you just copy this CSS here,
I'm just gonna highlight,

72
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.785
I'm gonna copy, and then in VS Code Inside

73
00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:50.859
of my CSS folder I'm gonna start a new
file, I'm gonna call this style.css,

74
00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:57.413
and then I'm just gonna paste in all
of that CSS from code tab and save it.

75
00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:02.206
Then what we're gonna need to do is,
you're gonna need to go through your other

76
00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:06.154
various CodePens here, and
I've given you the links for these.

77
00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:08.200
And we are going to copy and

78
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.971
paste the HTML from each one of these
CodePens into our index.html file.

79
00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:19.105
So, here inside of your VS Code folder,
let's make a new file.

80
00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:25.597
We're gonna call this It's index.html,
okay?

81
00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:31.932
So there that is, and then what I'd like
for you to do, as soon as you've saved it,

82
00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:36.730
very important that you save it first and
call it index.html,

83
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.620
what we're gonna do is we're
gonna type an exclamation point,

84
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.083
just like that, and
then hit the tab key on your computer.

85
00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:47.261
And if you do that,

86
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:51.558
you will wind up with the sort of
basic framework of an HTML document.

87
00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:53.359
We'll have the head and
we'll have the body.

88
00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.438
Did it work?

89
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:54.979
&gt;&gt; What was it?

90
00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.547
Exclamation point then what?

91
00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:59.651
&gt;&gt; Exclamation point and tab.

92
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.838
Worked.

93
00:06:00.838 --> 00:06:03.647
Okay, great, perfect.

94
00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:07.980
Okay, so this is what we need
in order to get started.

95
00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:15.351
So now what we're going to do, is,
we're gonna go in each of these CodePens

96
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:19.469
in order, and I'm gonna do this
first one for you, and then we'll,

97
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.831
you can do the rest of these on your own.

98
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.184
We're going to start
with header slash nav.

99
00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:31.195
So I'm going to open up this CodePen,
and I am going to copy header,

100
00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:36.573
and then I'm going to go to my VS code,
and I'm going to paste

101
00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:41.847
that here inside of the body,
once again inside of VS Code,

102
00:06:41.847 --> 00:06:47.352
just like CodePen,
it has those little collapsible arrows.

103
00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:49.937
So if you're feeling a little overwhelmed

104
00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:52.736
looking at all the code
we've written today,

105
00:06:52.736 --> 00:06:57.645
that is where you can just collapse these
and make it a little less overwhelming.

106
00:06:57.645 --> 00:07:01.168
Then we're gonna go to intro

107
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.722
We're going to select all.

108
00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:10.339
So Cmd or Ctrl+A, Cmd or

109
00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:14.828
Ctrl+C, and go into VS Code.

110
00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:18.488
And paste.

111
00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.138
So that's our intro.

112
00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:27.843
And we're gonna do the same
again with featured.

113
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.084
Everybody getting the idea here,
just copy and paste.

114
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.420
&gt;&gt; So everything is gonna go into index.

115
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.715
&gt;&gt; Everything is gonna
go into index.html and

116
00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:46.139
we're just listing them
one after the other.

117
00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.165
In between the body and
the slash body, but

118
00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:52.370
this header here, that was our navigation.

119
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.636
This is our intro and then now I'm
going to paste in my featured.

120
00:07:57.636 --> 00:08:01.819
So we're just gonna continue to paste
these one right after the other like this.

121
00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:11.427
So your code should look kinda like mine,
I've collapsed everything,

122
00:08:11.427 --> 00:08:13.624
so you just see the sections
of the webpage.

123
00:08:13.624 --> 00:08:16.794
So, you should have the head
of the document here,

124
00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:18.951
it's kinda hidden at the moment.

125
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:22.769
Then inside of the body element,
you should have your header.

126
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.731
You should have your section
with a class of intro.

127
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:30.807
You should have your section with a class
of Section featured, section with a class

128
00:08:30.807 --> 00:08:35.823
of Section projects, section with a class
of Section contact, and your footer.

129
00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:37.939
Make sense?

130
00:08:37.939 --> 00:08:43.953
Okay, now, so we have an HTML page.

131
00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:45.892
We have a stylesheet.

132
00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:50.769
We've got a ton of images and none of
them are talking to each other, right?

133
00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:55.902
Okay, so one of the things we need to do
is we need to link up our stylesheet,

134
00:08:55.902 --> 00:09:00.311
and we also need to make sure
we've linked up our fonts, right?

135
00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:03.475
So let's link up our stylesheet,

136
00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:08.941
right after the title here,
we can put in link href equals.

137
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:13.035
We're gonna go into our CSS folder and
find style.CSS.

138
00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:18.841
So this will be CSS slash style.CSS

139
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.911
rel equals Style sheet.

140
00:09:26.617 --> 00:09:31.395
That's how you make a link
to your local style sheet,

141
00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:37.247
we can change the title of this
document to Jen Kramer Portfolio.

142
00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:45.841
Frontend masters or whatever you
wanna put inside of your title.

143
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:47.605
This is gonna be your homepage.

144
00:09:50.998 --> 00:09:53.067
Everybody okay so far?

145
00:09:53.067 --> 00:09:53.979
Okay.

146
00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:56.248
Now we need to get our fonts.

147
00:09:56.248 --> 00:09:58.145
And, yes.

148
00:09:58.145 --> 00:10:03.246
&gt;&gt; When do we know if we
need to reset that CSS.

149
00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:06.956
&gt;&gt; Well at this point we have worked
through all of the styling of

150
00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:11.631
our documents so we do not need a reset
CSS file for this particular project.
