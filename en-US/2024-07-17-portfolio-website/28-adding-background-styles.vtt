WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.984
So the very last step here for
this web page is we need

2
00:00:05.984 --> 00:00:11.340
to make our very cool
jagged looking edges here.

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.160
So we have this awesome effect here
with these jagged edges, right?

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.955
Which is part of the sizzle
of this particular design.

5
00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:23.969
We've got some up on the top and we've
got some down here on the bottom, and

6
00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:28.455
they look absolutely amazing and and
everybody wants to know how to do that.

7
00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.951
Well, we wait until the very end to
do it because we're going to do this

8
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.316
with background images and

9
00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:37.495
we need to make sure everything is lining
up here within the webpage itself.

10
00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:41.878
So, here is the way we are going
to go through that process.

11
00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:47.678
So it is possible to have more than one
background image on the same element.

12
00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:50.908
This was my learning experience
when putting this course together.

13
00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:53.918
I did not know that you could have
two background images together on

14
00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:55.458
the same element.

15
00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:59.478
But it is in fact possible, and
it's gonna make this whole thing work.

16
00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:04.503
So what I have created for
you is the little bit of that background

17
00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:09.808
image that's going to give you
alternating little bits of white and

18
00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:15.778
little bits of transparency to let
the other section shine through.

19
00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:18.283
And we need now to assemble this so

20
00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:22.499
that we have two background
images on the same section.

21
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.934
So, I'm going to start
here in your featured

22
00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:31.147
section with the section featured style.

23
00:01:31.147 --> 00:01:34.868
So for
me it's around line 373 in your CSS.

24
00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:37.607
Hopefully for you, it's kind of similar.

25
00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:40.757
So the way we're going to
set this up is as follows.

26
00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:43.157
We have a background image here.

27
00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:46.695
Right now,
this is called fem-feature-bkgd.png.

28
00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:50.898
This is that white background with
the gray stripes in it, okay?

29
00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:52.407
So that's the first thing.

30
00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:54.427
We definitely need to keep that.

31
00:01:54.427 --> 00:02:01.098
What we're going to do is add to this,

32
00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:05.266
url and we're gonna say

33
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:13.197
../img/fem-feature-bottom.png.

34
00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:17.949
And then a comma, and
then the other image that was here,

35
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.846
url ../img/fem-feature-bkgd.png.

36
00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:24.796
So in other words,
we have two of these together.

37
00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:28.936
Those quote marks are actually
kind of optional.

38
00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:30.786
We make them match, okay?

39
00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:34.787
So we've listed two
background images together in

40
00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.376
the same declaration separated by a comma.

41
00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:44.253
The order does matter because we want the
bigger image, the one with the stripes,

42
00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:49.620
we want that on the bottom, and we want
this particular image on top of that.

43
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.750
So we're gonna list it second.

44
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.961
Then of course, for
background repeat and position,

45
00:02:55.961 --> 00:03:00.600
we can put a comma and set up
the second set of parameters for that.

46
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:09.220
So in this case,
we're going to say repeat-x, repeat.

47
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.674
So for the first image it will
repeat only in the x direction

48
00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:15.282
which is what we want for
that jagged line but

49
00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:18.968
the other image will repeat in
both the x and the y directions.

50
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.718
For our background position,

51
00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:29.529
we're going to say bottom center,
center center.

52
00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:34.647
So, we want this skinny image we want down
at the bottom of the featured section,

53
00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:40.666
and we want it to be centered, whereas our
background image will be centered as well.

54
00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:45.118
And then of course,
we have our padding here.

55
00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:47.903
Okay, how are we doing so far?

56
00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:51.736
Okay, so
now let's take a look at our webpage.

57
00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:57.986
If we refresh, and
scroll on down to the bottom.

58
00:03:57.986 --> 00:03:59.702
Check it out.

59
00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:01.534
It totally worked.

60
00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:06.038
So the takeaway from this is that you can
have more than one background image on

61
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.387
the same class slash the same
container on your webpage.

62
00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:13.077
The ordering of those background
images definitely matters.

63
00:04:13.077 --> 00:04:16.200
You want the one that is going
to appear in the background,

64
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.318
that's the first one you want to list.

65
00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:22.477
And the one that's gonna appear on top of
it, that's the second one that you list.

66
00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:27.614
And then you can use your other
background properties to list, again,

67
00:04:27.614 --> 00:04:33.027
comma-separated values for
those particular images, okay?

68
00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:38.694
Okay, so the next one we're going to
do is add this to the intro style.

69
00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:43.884
So we're going to go
back into layer intro,

70
00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:51.336
and we are going to add this at
the intro image up here on the top.

71
00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:58.143
And the first thing I'm going to do is
change my padding just a little bit here,

72
00:04:58.143 --> 00:05:02.074
I'm going to say 4rem 0 10 rem 0, okay?

73
00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:03.082
So in other words,

74
00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:06.868
give me a little bit of extra room down
on the bottom of that intro image.

75
00:05:09.188 --> 00:05:12.224
I have two images, once again, so

76
00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:17.881
the comet image is going to actually
be listed second this time,

77
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:22.302
and the first image that
I'm going to list is url,

78
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.578
And this one will be

79
00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:40.147
../img/fem-featured-top.png.

80
00:05:43.157 --> 00:05:46.614
So that is that first image and

81
00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:52.296
then we'll have our second comet image,
okay.

82
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:56.261
Hit return on that.

83
00:05:59.086 --> 00:06:04.547
Then for the background repeats,
we want the first

84
00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:09.632
one to repeat in the x direction,
no-repeat.

85
00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:22.324
For background position, we want the first
one to be bottom center, and then 86% 10%.

86
00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:28.858
Okay.

87
00:06:28.858 --> 00:06:36.646
So on the intro, we have double
background images as well, okay?

88
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.712
And once you've done that,
we should be able to save.

89
00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:48.132
And then take a look at your
Frontend Masters page here.

90
00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:53.802
And when we refresh, you should have
your jagged image up there on the top.
