>> So congratulations, at this point in time, you now have two pages. You have a home page, you have an inside page, they're commendable across devices. And it is amazing looking portfolio with all kinds of different images, all kinds of different colors and it's ready for you. So what I hope you'll do with these particular layout is, I hope that you will think about what story you want to tell about your own career and your own portfolio.

Swap in some screenshots, swap in little bits of code. Swap in whatever makes sense to tell your story in the best way. You'll have a very cool looking portfolio, something a little bit different than everybody else has there. You can even swap in different images in the space images that I've used for images that are meaningful to you and for your life.

[00:00:50]
So congratulations on making your two page website with HTML and CSS. And I look forward to seeing you in another course here at Frontend Masters.
