1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.661
To make this work, I'll fold up
my base here, fold up my intro,

2
00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:06.490
fold up my contact.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.140
We're in the nav portion of the code here,
and

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.643
what we're going to do is add
some media queries to this.

5
00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:16.360
What do media queries do?

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.842
Anybody know what a media query is and
what it does?

7
00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:21.801
Well, what's a query?

8
00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.947
Query is a question, right?

9
00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:28.785
So we're questioning our media.

10
00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:35.102
[LAUGH] And the media in this particular
case is gonna be the width of the screen.

11
00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.513
So we're gonna ask a question,

12
00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:41.451
is the width of this screen
no more than some number?

13
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:46.409
And we determine that number by moving
the little bar around until we find some

14
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.134
number that works.

15
00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:55.784
In this case, I am going to say @media and
then I'm going to give it a test.

16
00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:59.676
So, hey,
this is a media query browser, and

17
00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:05.524
what I want you to find out is,
if we are at a max-width: 830px.

18
00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:10.930
And then we're gonna put
in some curly brackets and

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.201
our styles will go inside
of this as the media query.

20
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:18.828
Now let me just ask you,
if my screen is 750px wide,

21
00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:24.168
will these styles apply whatever
I put inside the media query?

22
00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:27.416
How many people say yes, absolutely,
those styles will apply.

23
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.823
If the width of my screen is 750px,
will the media query here with

24
00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:40.733
a max-width: 830px, any styles that
I put in there, will they apply?

25
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.352
Absolutely yes?

26
00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.428
Absolutely no?

27
00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:46.178
No idea?

28
00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:54.106
[LAUGH] Okay, the answer is yes,
styles in there will apply up until 830px.

29
00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:58.776
As the screen gets bigger than that,
these styles will no longer apply, okay?

30
00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:03.689
Now, you probably were used to working
in the opposite way with minimum width

31
00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.285
media queries, right?

32
00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:07.208
That is the other way that you can work,

33
00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:11.784
in which case, we're working from a mobile
device and making something bigger.

34
00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:15.784
In this case, we're making something
big and we're making it go smaller.

35
00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:19.121
In the case of working with
navigation in particular and

36
00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:23.807
in case of working with beginners, I find
that designing the desktop first and

37
00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:27.854
then making things smaller,
tends to work better mentally [LAUGH].

38
00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:30.692
We just follow it better for
whatever reason.

39
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:34.136
The code is actually easier to
write as well for navigation bars.

40
00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:35.886
So that's why I'm taking this approach.

41
00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:44.199
Okay, so first of all here, inside of our
media query with a max-width of 830px,

42
00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.742
we're gonna tell our header
to change its alignment.

43
00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:54.302
So right now,
our header is set to put a space between.

44
00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:57.639
So it's gonna say,
put the name over here on the left and

45
00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.919
put the nav bar over here on the right.

46
00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.529
I'm gonna change that to
justify-content: center.

47
00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.349
And nothing is gonna change on
my screen cuz I'm not at 830.

48
00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.849
So get it to 830, Let me see, am I there?

49
00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.226
I'm actually there right now,
it's not wrapping, when it does wrap,

50
00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:24.629
which is a little bit smaller,
it will in fact be centered on the screen.

51
00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.874
But patience,
we're gonna make it work just right now.

52
00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:37.698
So for my header h1,
what we're gonna do is we're going to say,

53
00:03:37.698 --> 00:03:44.376
let me give you all the properties and
then I'll explain them,

54
00:03:44.376 --> 00:03:50.298
flex-basis: 100%; text-align: center; and

55
00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:53.453
margin-bottom: 2rem;.

56
00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:58.406
Okay, so what just happened here?

57
00:03:58.406 --> 00:04:02.060
[LAUGH] So flex-basis: 100%,

58
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.749
you are familiar with the concept
of width, I know you are.

59
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:13.659
If I said the width was 100%, it would
be 100% of the containing element.

60
00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.493
Here we have a thing called flex-basis.

61
00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:18.988
When you work with flexbox,
there are no widths.

62
00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:23.582
And the reason why is, even if I
said the width was, let's say, 25%,

63
00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:26.117
25% is actually an absolute number.

64
00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:32.972
It would never be 24.9%, it'll never
be 25.1%, it will always be 25%.

65
00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:39.134
The flex in flexbox means that
25% is a kind of dimension.

66
00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:43.366
[LAUGH] Sometimes it might be 25%,
sometimes it might be more than that,

67
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.525
sometimes it might be less than that.

68
00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:48.230
That is the flex in flexbox.

69
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.190
And the way we make that magic happen
is through the flex-basis property.

70
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.826
So here, because we're working with
flexbox, I've set this to 100%.

71
00:04:56.826 --> 00:05:01.724
And what that means is that that box that
has the name in it is going to take up

72
00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:04.357
a 100% of the screen width there.

73
00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:05.197
See that?

74
00:05:05.197 --> 00:05:08.537
So it's up there on the top and
it's taking up a 100%.

75
00:05:08.537 --> 00:05:14.704
And if I put a border on it, because
some of you look puzzled, 2px solid red,

76
00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:20.863
You can see, there it is, taking up
the full width of everything, yeah?

77
00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:25.431
Okay, because it's taking up
the full width of everything,

78
00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:27.073
what happens to the navbar?

79
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:34.237
The navbar doesn't have room, so it wraps
onto the next line automatically for you.

80
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.625
Make sense?

81
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:42.875
Awesome, so that's all we have to do.

82
00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.967
Now this is working for smaller screens,

83
00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:47.549
probably somewhere around
the tablet dimension.

84
00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:52.321
Very, very cool, any questions?

85
00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:59.395
So we've gone from throwing our logo
on the left and our navbar on the right

86
00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:04.429
to making them stack on top of
each other and look pretty, okay?

87
00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:08.109
And that works really well
until we get smaller, right?

88
00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:12.116
Now we start to approach
phone screen dimensions and

89
00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:14.583
you could live with that maybe.

90
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:17.454
But you're probably thinking it
should be a hamburger button, right,

91
00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:20.102
that's the button with
the three stripes on it.

92
00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:22.392
So now comes this part.

93
00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:24.954
And this is probably
a little bit more difficult,

94
00:06:24.954 --> 00:06:28.272
probably one of the more
difficult things that we do today.

95
00:06:28.272 --> 00:06:32.035
But I will talk you through all
of this code, and remember,

96
00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:37.320
there is an end-state to this code pen so
you can see the hamburger button working.

97
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.783
Okay, so what we're gonna
do with a hamburger button?

98
00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:46.691
The first thing we need to do is,
make a change to our code in the HTML.

99
00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:50.718
So right now we have an h1, we have a nav.

100
00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:55.021
We're going to add this item right here,
which I currently have commented out.

101
00:06:55.021 --> 00:07:00.491
So we're going to add this button here,
okay?

102
00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:06.365
And you'll notice that this is a button
with a type of button, [LAUGH] which seems

103
00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:11.741
rather repetitive, but this just means
that this is an actual functioning button.

104
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:14.661
Tabindex ="-1" has to do with usability,

105
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:17.807
it will be skipped over
under most circumstances.

106
00:07:17.807 --> 00:07:20.796
And guess what hidden does?

107
00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:24.306
It's hidden [LAUGH].

108
00:07:24.306 --> 00:07:26.069
Okay, awesome.

109
00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.269
So we're gonna add this.

110
00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.709
This will ultimately become,
basically, our hamburger button.

111
00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.329
Now we can set all of this up and
style it once we have that in place.

112
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.180
So this is where you need to watch
your little curly brackets here, okay?

113
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.795
We wanna still be within the layer of nav,

114
00:07:47.795 --> 00:07:51.680
but we want to be not inside
our last media query.

115
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.052
So you may wanna fold up your media query
here and we're going to add @media,

116
00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:04.195
And this is gonna be a max-width: 640px.

117
00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:07.685
Why?
Because when I tested it,

118
00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:09.695
that seemed to be a good dimension.

119
00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:13.995
All right, so
I have my screen in about 525px right now.

120
00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:18.099
So these styles would be applying.

121
00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:23.263
All right so header,
we're gonna go back to aligning

122
00:08:23.263 --> 00:08:27.985
these as justify-content: space-between.

123
00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:32.602
And the reason why is, ultimately, when
this becomes a hamburger button, we wanna

124
00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:37.217
have the name on the left and we wanna
have the hamburger button on the right.

125
00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.387
So space-between is a good
way to set that up.

126
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:45.959
I need to turn off the,
my h1 right now is taking up 100%

127
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.560
of that space,
I need to turn that off, so header h1

128
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:58.013
That is going to go to flex-basis: auto;

129
00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:06.140
And we'll just see that as going over to
the left hand side right now, the navbar

130
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.735
is not able to wrap up next to it, but
if we had it programmed as such, it could.

131
00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:17.240
Okay, then header button.

132
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.975
This is now, perhaps,
one of the confusing moments.

133
00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:25.638
This is the HTML button as
opposed to our class of button.

134
00:09:25.638 --> 00:09:29.519
We had a class of button on a link
because that button, button,

135
00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:32.265
when we clicked on it, we went somewhere.

136
00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:36.310
That is the definition of a link,
when you click on it, you go somewhere.

137
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.375
HTML buttons, not the class,
but the HTML button,

138
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:43.398
lots of different things can happen
when you click those buttons.

139
00:09:43.398 --> 00:09:45.355
Often, they're triggered by JavaScript.

140
00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:48.123
In this particular case,
we're gonna trigger it by CSS, but

141
00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:49.518
it's not taking us anywhere.

142
00:09:49.518 --> 00:09:52.608
In this case, it's gonna show
us our navigation, ultimately.

143
00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:58.372
So notice that there's no period
in front of that header button.

144
00:09:58.372 --> 00:10:04.933
Display: block; font-size:

145
00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:10.791
3rem; line-height; 1;

146
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:18.054
border: 0; background-color:

147
00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:21.803
transparent; and

148
00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:28.370
the color: var(--white).

149
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.379
And if you see it at all, I think it sort
of flashed around a little bit there,

150
00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:38.343
it kind of looked like a dash for a while
and kind of a fat dash and a skinny dash.

151
00:10:38.343 --> 00:10:40.483
And now it's completely disappeared.

152
00:10:40.483 --> 00:10:45.173
If that happened, that's awesome, that's
exactly what we're looking for, okay?

153
00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:50.503
So this is a bunch of styling that
we just need to add here in place.

154
00:10:52.873 --> 00:10:57.213
We can also add a hover state to this,

155
00:10:57.213 --> 00:11:03.668
header button: hover; color: var(--green).

156
00:11:06.802 --> 00:11:12.254
And then comes the magic part,
which is header button,

157
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:16.314
two colons, not one, two colons after.

158
00:11:17.984 --> 00:11:19.834
And so this is a pseudo element.

159
00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:23.535
So we're saying, after the button,
we are going to put in this.

160
00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:28.935
And it's gonna look really weird,

161
00:11:28.935 --> 00:11:33.438
content: "\2630".

162
00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:37.905
And I think it's unicode code or
something similar, but

163
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:43.782
it's one of those kind of encoding
things that gives us the three stripes.

164
00:11:43.782 --> 00:11:49.681
So now it shows up, Okay?

165
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:52.631
So all of this is needed so
that when we roll over the button,

166
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:55.706
we have a white button,
when we roll over it, it turns green.

167
00:11:55.706 --> 00:11:57.840
All of that stuff is needed for that.

168
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.164
And we want it big so
that's where our font-size of 3rem is and

169
00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:03.247
we want it with minimal line-height.
