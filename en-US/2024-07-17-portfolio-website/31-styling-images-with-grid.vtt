00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.379
For this figure that comes right after
this YouTube video I'm going to give it

2
00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:12.673
a class and the class is going to be,
Featured-screenshots.

3
00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:21.602
Okay, and so that's gonna to give me
a class that I can use to style this

4
00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.061
figure in a little bit more detail.

5
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:28.433
Here in my css, we can say

6
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:38.019
figure.featured-screenshots, display:
grid,

7
00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:46.145
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr,

8
00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:51.564
grid-template-rows: auto

9
00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:55.541
uto and a gap of 2rem.

10
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:59.741
So that should set us up with three
screenshots equally by each other and

11
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:00.814
in two rows.

12
00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:04.116
That should give us
the images in the top row and

13
00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:07.934
then the figure caption
coming after that in theory.

14
00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:10.794
Let's check in on how that's doing.

15
00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:18.794
All right, so if we take a look at our
webpage so far, we refresh the page.

16
00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:23.439
What you're gonna see is we
have a bunch of images that

17
00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.649
are all stacked on top of each other.

18
00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.833
And we have some captions that are in
the wrong places and so forth.

19
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:33.393
So here is how we're going
to have to fix this.

20
00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:38.366
What's going on is that if we scroll down
into the project section of the webpage,

21
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:43.050
which comes after the featured section,
we have here figure display grid and

22
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.966
we have figure image and
we have figure a and all the rest of this.

23
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:50.527
This is overriding the styles that
we have earlier in our document.

24
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:55.233
So what I'm going to need to do is I'm
gonna need to move the styles that I just

25
00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:56.126
put in place.

26
00:01:56.126 --> 00:02:02.668
And those styles are .project figure,
.project figcaption and

27
00:02:02.668 --> 00:02:08.872
figure.featured-screenshots, all
four of those.

28
00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:13.686
I'm going to remove from the featured
section of the webpage here,

29
00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:15.672
the featured layer.

30
00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:18.052
I'm going to go down to projects.

31
00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:23.985
I'm gonna scroll past all of the figure
and figure capture styling there and

32
00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:30.518
come on down here to the bottom where I
will paste in my additional styles here.

33
00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:35.334
So now I have .project figure as
display block .figure caption, and

34
00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:38.988
the figure featured
screenshots are all here.

35
00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:42.064
When I save this and
now go back to my webpage.

36
00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:45.644
Okay, so
now we have our videos looking good.

37
00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:46.974
We have all of the images.

38
00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:49.064
They're all stacked on top
of each other right here.

39
00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:52.233
Don't panic about that,
we're gonna fix that in a moment, but

40
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.004
the other images are looking okay.

41
00:02:56.624 --> 00:02:57.512
All right, so

42
00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:02.555
we only see one image here because we
have conflicting style that's happening.

43
00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:09.501
And our conflicting style is happening for
section featured image.

44
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.689
So if I find my section
featured image style.

45
00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:20.948
So here in section featured image,
I've actually told all of the images to

46
00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:26.373
display in the same place, which is
in the first row in the first column.

47
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.443
And so those images are doing
exactly what I told them to do.

48
00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:33.973
They are all displaying in the first
row in the first column on the webpage.

49
00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:40.126
So we need to override them here
inside of our later style so

50
00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:45.298
that they don't do that
later in our document.

51
00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:52.928
So I'm gonna scroll down to my
figure.featured-screenshots image.

52
00:03:52.928 --> 00:03:55.497
I'm gonna add the style here.

53
00:03:55.497 --> 00:03:59.692
So section-featured

54
00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:05.876
.featured-screenshots img.

55
00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:08.331
So we'll make a more powerful selector and

56
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:12.072
put it later in the document
to override what came before.

57
00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:18.532
We'll say grid-column: revert,
grid-row: revert.

58
00:04:18.532 --> 00:04:21.848
In other words, forget what you
know about those images and

59
00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:23.951
where they are being located.

60
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.321
Get rid of them.

61
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.231
That's what the revert
keyword happens to mean.

62
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:33.969
So if we save that and we go back into
our Firefox here and hit refresh,

63
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.771
now our images are all displayed,
all one right next to each other.

64
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:41.189
Yay, that is what we're looking for.

65
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.486
Our caption is still bunched
up here over on the side.

66
00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:48.826
So let us get that working as well.

67
00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:56.353
And that is going to be right
after .section-featured

68
00:04:56.353 --> 00:04:59.287
.featured-screenshots image.

69
00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:05.099
We'll say .featured-screenshots
figcaption,

70
00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.455
and we'll say our grid column is 1/4

71
00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:14.606
because we want that
figure caption to stretch

72
00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:19.715
all the way across through three columns.

73
00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:22.035
Not be limited to just the first column.

74
00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:26.562
So we're gonna put that in and

75
00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:31.105
grid-row: 2/3, okay?

76
00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:32.555
Take a look at the web page again.

77
00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:35.365
There it is.

78
00:05:35.365 --> 00:05:40.418
So now our figured caption stretches
across the bottom of those three images.

79
00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:43.666
Now what I'd like to do is I'd like
to make these into two columns,

80
00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:46.787
because again, this is too long
of a line for easy reading.

81
00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:50.993
Wouldn't it be nice if we actually
had two columns of text and

82
00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:54.087
we can do that with the columns property.

83
00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:54.757
It's kinda cool.

84
00:05:54.757 --> 00:05:57.217
You might not have heard
of this one before.

85
00:05:57.217 --> 00:06:03.640
So if we say our
.featured-screenshots figcaption p.

86
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.874
Paragraph inside of the figure caption
that's inside of our featured screenshots.

87
00:06:07.874 --> 00:06:11.266
We'll say columns: 2.

88
00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:15.522
So what this does is it takes a look at
the lines of text, divides it in two and

89
00:06:15.522 --> 00:06:19.586
puts it into two separate columns,
which is really great.

90
00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:22.816
And while we're here,
let's put in a little extra margin.

91
00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:28.456
So margin-bottom: 5rem to give us
a little bit of breathing room.

92
00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:31.237
And when we take a look
at our webpage again,

93
00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.846
now we have two lovely columns of text.

94
00:06:33.846 --> 00:06:35.266
It's a little bit easier to read.

95
00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:37.546
And this is done with newspaper style.

96
00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:42.192
So we are actually in the middle of
a sentence here, styling buttons,

97
00:06:42.192 --> 00:06:46.304
audio players, hamburger menus and
lists back up to the top.

98
00:06:46.304 --> 00:06:51.314
More like reading a newspaper
here with the columns property.

99
00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:56.119
Okay, this next image it
should be stretching across

100
00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.550
the screen with some space around it.

101
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.475
So it's kind of pretty well
doing that right now, but

102
00:07:03.475 --> 00:07:07.585
it needs a little bit more
space down here on the bottom.

103
00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:09.563
So let's take a look at that.

104
00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:21.808
In my html, How did I do that,

105
00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:29.374
cool It is both annoying and
very cool at the same time.

106
00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:32.982
Okay, so here in my html image for
the diamond grid,

107
00:07:32.982 --> 00:07:37.704
we have a class of feature image
that's associated with it.

108
00:07:37.704 --> 00:07:40.333
So we can use that for styling.

109
00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:46.669
I'm going to add to this for
our .featured-image and

110
00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.800
I am going to say display: block and

111
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.356
I'm gonna give it a margin of 5rem 0.

112
00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:57.748
So that will give us a little bit
of breathing room for that image.

113
00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:07.596
Okay, remember that margins in
a vertical direction collapse, so

114
00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:11.795
we have some of that collapse
that is happening here.

115
00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:16.119
And then now for this last image
down here, this is a figure again.

116
00:08:16.119 --> 00:08:20.023
And I wanna set it up such that
the image is on the right and

117
00:08:20.023 --> 00:08:23.103
the figure caption is on the left.

118
00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.573
So let's set that up as well.

119
00:08:27.713 --> 00:08:32.073
Here in my html,
I am going to go to my last figure here.

120
00:08:32.073 --> 00:08:32.961
This is the one.

121
00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:42.987
And what I'm going to do
is give this a class.

122
00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:51.060
Class = "figure-portfolio".

123
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.168
Okay, and then I can write a style for
this one too.

124
00:09:00.761 --> 00:09:03.002
,figure-portfolio.

125
00:09:06.426 --> 00:09:11.292
We'll say padding: 5rem 0.

126
00:09:11.292 --> 00:09:14.096
We'll say display: grid.

127
00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:20.546
We'll say grid-template-columns
will be 1fr 1fr.

128
00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:23.335
So we'll have to equal columns.

129
00:09:23.335 --> 00:09:28.411
Grid-template-rows will be auto,

130
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:32.858
make however many rows you need.

131
00:09:32.858 --> 00:09:39.087
We'll tell the items to
align-items in the center.

132
00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:43.274
So this will put the text aligning in the
middle of the image instead of at the top

133
00:09:43.274 --> 00:09:46.397
of the image,
which is where it would go by default.

134
00:09:46.397 --> 00:09:53.477
So align images puts it in the center and
then a gap of 2rem.

135
00:09:53.477 --> 00:09:59.529
Okay, and if we take a look at that inside
of our browser window, .project figure.

136
00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:04.981
.figure-portfolio is being
overwritten by my .project

137
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:10.002
figure that comes earlier
in the set of styles, okay.
