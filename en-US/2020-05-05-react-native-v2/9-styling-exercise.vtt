00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.982
Now you've had an introduction into
how styling works in React Native.

2
00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:08.390
And it's time to start learning by doing.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.159
Using all the information that you've
got from the previous chapter,

4
00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.572
here's a styling exercise.

5
00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:19.417
I've created some colorful boxes.

6
00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:24.035
We've got a cyan, a blue, magenta, and
an orange box, with some white text.

7
00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:26.503
And here are the colors that I used.

8
00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:29.264
And using all the information
you had from a previous chapter,

9
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.420
try to replicate this UI.
