00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.960
Now that you know everything about the
flat list, lets put this into practice.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.960
This colors you might
have already recognized,

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.289
are from the solarized color scheme
which is one of my favorites.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.000
And the color palettes actually consists
of 16 colors, not just four and

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.660
here's all of them.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.460
I would like you to modify your
code to use a flat list to display

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.887
all these colors.

8
00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:32.540
Here's a screenshot of what I
would expect you to look on.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.519
And for extra credits, you could also
try figuring out how to display the text

10
00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.134
in dark for the lighter palette colors.
