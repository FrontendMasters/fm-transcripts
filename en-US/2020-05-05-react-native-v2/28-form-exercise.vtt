00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.500
Last exercise and this is definitely
going to be the trickiest one.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.370
If you're going to take some time and
have a go at it yourself,

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.960
don't be alarmed if it
takes you an hour or

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.310
longer because this is meant to be
quite a, there's a lot going on there.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.000
So here's a little recording of what
the end product would look like.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.950
We've got an add color scheme button
which is similar to what we already have.

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.460
And then this launches a Moodle.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
And in the Moodle we have an input
where you can name your color palettes.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
And then we have a list of loads and
loads of colors.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.720
And you can toggle these on.

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.742
And finally, we submit the color and
it gets added at the top of our list.

12
00:00:48.692 --> 00:00:51.796
So I've added some requirements here, so

13
00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:55.720
you can basically work
on these one by one.

14
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.220
Firstly, pressing on add color
scheme opens the Moodle,

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.620
we've pretty much done that already so
you get that one for free.

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640
Secondly, the user can enter the name for
the color scheme.

17
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.060
Here you can add name.

18
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.010
Thirdly, the user can toggle the buttons
to select colors to add the theme.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.840
Now, ideally, we'd show a little
preview for the colors but

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.840
I didn't want to go too crazy cause
there was a lot going on already, and

21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.720
you can have a go at it on your own.

22
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.460
So each color just has a toggle
button on the right and

23
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.550
you can toggle that on and off.

24
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.820
If the user has to submit without
entering a name for the color,

25
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910
they will get an error message.

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.280
So this is not actually
demonstrated in the GIF.

27
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.500
But if the, if I was to press Submit,
without actually adding the name,

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.600
it would give me an alert,
saying, please add a name.

29
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.000
If the user hits Submit without
entering the correct number of colors,

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.067
which is three, I do get an error message.

31
00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:57.666
Should there is a check before you submit
that if the user has selected two or

32
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.171
fewer colors,
it will say please select at least three.

33
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.988
And finally, if the user has
entered the name correctly, and

34
00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:11.173
have chosen at least three colors,
the Moodle will close and

35
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:14.000
a new color scheme will be
added at the top of the list.

36
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.020
There's basically the requirements.

37
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.970
I've added some hints here,
if you're gonna have a go at this,

38
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.920
don't use all colors all at once.

39
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.813
I've added, so
basically these are all the web colors.

40
00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.667
So you can start with just a couple and

41
00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:34.535
I just to figure out how
the toggle button works and

42
00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:40.221
just getting that working, and
then adding more once the basic is done.

43
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.460
For these bits, the submit warnings,

44
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.790
you can use the native alert Moodle,
which is here.

45
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.870
You just call alert dot alert.

46
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.520
With this you don't even need
to add all these arguments.

47
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.990
And this will tell the user that,
something's wrong.

48
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.968
This is the like cheapest
way to do little alerts.

49
00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:05.917
And finally, navigation,
navigate works just

50
00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:10.680
like navigation go back if the page
you target is already on the stack.

51
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.390
So if I'm here inside the Moodle,
and then,

52
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.830
if I do navigation go back,
would go back to the home.

53
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.990
But similarly, if I did navigation,
Navigate Home,

54
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.360
it would do exactly the same thing.

55
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.560
And this is handy because you can pass in

56
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.860
arguments into navigate whereas you
can't pass in arguments into go back.
