WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.190
All right, so now that we've
learned a little bit about forms,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.200
let's do a little segue and
talk about modals.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.743
So this is an example of
what we want to get to.

4
00:00:11.743 --> 00:00:17.080
Basically what I want us to do is have
a add a color screen button, which will

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.694
open a modal and the modal will have a
form where you can enter the color screen.

6
00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:26.520
Press Submit and it will add the color
screen at the top of this list.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.150
That's basically the end goal,
that will be the last exercise.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.492
But in order to get to that, we actually
need to do the modal thing first and

9
00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:40.128
I've added this as a separate section,
because adding a modal requires

10
00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:44.699
editing of route navigation, so
there's a little bit going on there.

11
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:54.800
Now, let's look at this little tree
view that I next one react navigation.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.310
So this is basically
what we want to get to.

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.030
But currently, we have these three,
we have the main stack and

14
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.980
then we have which we just
called stack at the moment.

15
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.840
And this has two screens, it has the home
screen and the excess detail screen.

16
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.850
Now what we want to do,

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.140
is actually we have the RootStack and
we have home and detail screen.

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.937
What we're going to do is we want
the RootStack to have to like sub stack we

19
00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.860
want to have a main stack and
a modal screen.

20
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.322
So you can think of these as how
the screens are presented to use,

21
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.040
it's kinda like a tree-ish view.

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.280
So in order to have a modal, we need
to actually modify our stack layout.

23
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.630
So we could have, add these MainStack and
the ModalScreen in between.

24
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.870
So you can reference these
react navigation docs for

25
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.940
how to do it, because we're basically
following exactly what's here.

26
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.124
Right, so to get started,
let's rename our stack to RootStack.

27
00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:06.646
So let's go to App.js, close on
where the things are going on here.

28
00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.388
So let's rename this to RootStack, and

29
00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:17.430
then rename it to RootStack here, as well.

30
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.410
And save make sure nothing's broken.

31
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
All right, now what are we doing now?

32
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.505
All right, so
next we're adding a MainStack.

33
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.570
So I think I forgot to add this line,
but underneath here, we have another one

34
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.795
called MainStack and
we create another StackNavigator.

35
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.401
So now to reference we're creating
this one and this one and

36
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.665
notice that we're creating the ones that
have kinda two prongs going out to them.

37
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:56.807
Now we're going to create
a MainStack screen.

38
00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:05.890
Just gonna copy this code here.

39
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.390
Right, so this is the screen.

40
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.560
Notice that this is in a navigator the
same way this was already in a navigator

41
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.610
and I've pretty much just
copied what was already here.

42
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.070
So I've copied the content of what we
currently had our entire stack and

43
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.014
copied it into our main stack.

44
00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:37.565
Next we want to update our app component
to use a RootStack and a MainStack.

45
00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:45.210
So I'm gonna copy this here.

46
00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:52.494
[SOUND] Alright, so

47
00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:58.124
have a MainStack here.

48
00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:00.485
And this is where we can also add a modal.

49
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.285
Yeah, we need so
one thing to note is that,

50
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:09.826
we need to have headers shown
false here for example.

51
00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:14.785
Because if we didn't, we would get
two headers, because we're going

52
00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:19.400
to add a modal here and
we want the modal to have its own header.

53
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.220
Whereas because this RootStack has its
own StackNavigator, it gets a header.

54
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.540
So, that's something to be worried
of when you are listing this things.

55
00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:33.490
All right, and now we should add a modal.

56
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.174
Let's create a new file called

57
00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:43.547
ColorPaletteModal and

58
00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:49.673
add it to our screens directory.

59
00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.741
Well, I'm gonna type this in cuz I have so
far.

60
00:04:55.741 --> 00:05:01.779
Let's do hello world,
import React from 'react'.

61
00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:07.797
If you type this enough,
you could do it in your sleep Input {View,

62
00:05:07.797 --> 00:05:10.869
Text} from "react-native".

63
00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:19.229
And we do const ColorPaletteModal.

64
00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:26.756
And return a.

65
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.283
View.

66
00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:32.463
With some text.

67
00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:43.612
And finally we export it.

68
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.567
Notice that the cool thing is that this
component, even though it's a modal,

69
00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:55.160
it looks the same as all other components.

70
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.500
We don't need to add any special
configuration which is quite nice.

71
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.790
But that is also why is quite handy to
separate your components and screens.

72
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.755
Just so you know that's like you yourself
will know that the screens will have

73
00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:09.686
the navigation props,
whereas the components won't.

74
00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:19.757
Now finally, the thing what
we wanna do is we want to add

75
00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:24.940
the new pallet modal into our
App.js into the RootStack.

76
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.620
So let's go to App.js and let's import it.

77
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.237
So import,

78
00:06:32.237 --> 00:06:40.358
ColorPalettesModal from screens.

79
00:06:46.048 --> 00:06:48.366
And we want to add a screen for

80
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:52.430
ColorPaletteModal next
have the RootStack one.

81
00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.241
The main one, so I'm basically I'm just

82
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:06.300
gonna copy this code ColorPaletteModal.

83
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.770
We do want the header and
this should be colorPaletteModal.

84
00:07:15.355 --> 00:07:18.139
Did I wrong, okay, screens not screen.

85
00:07:24.274 --> 00:07:25.732
Palette.

86
00:07:25.732 --> 00:07:31.191
[LAUGH]
Okay,

87
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:35.080
typo, I turned intelligence
often now I'm regretting it.

88
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:42.864
Cool, so now it's all wired up and
all we need to do is start interacting.

89
00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:51.747
All right, so in order to do this, we need
to just add a little button somewhere, so

90
00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:54.750
we could press it and launch the modal.

91
00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:00.180
So let's go into our home,
which is in here.

92
00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:07.867
And let's add a ListHeaderComponent.

93
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:17.473
And in this ListHeaderComponent,
let's do a TouchableOpacity.

94
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:25.549
And let's do a Text inside, Launch Modal,

95
00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:30.176
it's an import, TouchableOpacity.

96
00:08:37.415 --> 00:08:38.482
And text.

97
00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:47.100
Cool, so now we've got a little button and
we need to do it onPress.

98
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.433
So in order to launch the modal.

99
00:08:52.877 --> 00:08:56.080
We can just use the navigation prop again,
which is kinda neat.

100
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:05.284
So we do navigation.navigate and.

101
00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:16.944
There you go, so the cool thing about it,

102
00:09:16.944 --> 00:09:22.393
is that the way we navigate is
actually the same between modals and

103
00:09:22.393 --> 00:09:25.680
just going into different screens.

104
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.084
So all the difficult thing about
how to launch it was in the App.js.

105
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.210
So to recap, so
this is now our root component.

106
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.640
We have a RootStack that has two screens.

107
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.960
One of the screens is our MainStack.

108
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.730
And to the screen is our Modal.

109
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.579
And a MainStack we have our home and
our ColorPalettes.

110
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.100
Now, the good thing about it is that,
now that you have this set of ones,

111
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.770
if you need to add any subsequent
modals you can just add them here.

112
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.570
You don't need to do this dance again.

113
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.120
So, the question was how to properly
handle the exhauster dependency warning.

114
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.085
From use effect, and
that is because if you

115
00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:13.820
have the hooks es lint rules turned on,
and you go,

116
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.776
and you think it's going to be here so
yeah, so here,

117
00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:23.654
if you have hooks exhorted
dependencies turned on.

118
00:10:23.654 --> 00:10:30.145
Then anything you use inside here, it will
tell you that you have to add it in here.

119
00:10:30.145 --> 00:10:34.376
We're not sure how to go around it other
than ignoring it, I personally don't

120
00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:38.111
have the hooks, these also dependencies
turned on for this reason.

121
00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:42.571
Because I feel like they
are quite flawed and as in,

122
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:46.009
they don't account for all use cases.

123
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:48.562
I had a particular thing
where I was building a chart,

124
00:10:48.562 --> 00:10:52.840
that was actually on the web, we're
building a chart, a quite complex charts.

125
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.430
And we turned on
the exhausted like adding,

126
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.240
we added all the hooks ESlint rules.

127
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.000
And they also fixed adding all
the parameters into useEffect.

128
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.153
I'd actually broke our application and so

129
00:11:08.153 --> 00:11:15.434
it's kind of like you have to either
be mindful and disable them yourself.

130
00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:22.938
Yeah, basically,
you have to be mindful and

131
00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:27.479
not to use the ESlint rule or

132
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:32.424
just disable them as needed.

133
00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:33.870
&gt;&gt; I had a question about that.

134
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.221
Looking at the navigation tree, trying
to figure out why did why did we set

135
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:47.767
up a tree of NavigationStacks
versus just keeping it flat?

136
00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:53.908
Would you be able to accomplish
the same thing within a single stack.

137
00:11:53.908 --> 00:11:57.587
&gt;&gt; Well let's see what happens.

138
00:11:57.587 --> 00:12:01.036
So if I put this

139
00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:10.244
ColorPaletteModal in here instead.

140
00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:18.430
Yeah, so it launches, but
it launches as a page, not a modal.

141
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:24.980
So the reason that we added it is because
we want the bottom up modal experience.

142
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.830
And if I added it here,
then it's just another screen.

143
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.950
The only way we can
distinguish between a modal and

144
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:37.530
a screen is notice that here we're doing
mode= 'modal', which is that anything

145
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:42.417
that we add will be added from the bottom
up, which makes the modals work.
