00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.568
Cool, right, let's look at
the navigation exercise solutions.

2
00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:05.910
I've broken these two
parts into four sections.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.740
So first of all, what we want to
do is we want to move the colors

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.360
from the color palette to home and
then pass it and

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.050
the palette name to the color
palette components.

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.006
Right, so let's take these colors and
move them to home.

7
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.212
And now, I'm actually gonna
rename this to solarized.

8
00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:40.408
Yeah.

9
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.150
And I'm going to just create
a second argument here.

10
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.800
So these are the props
I want to pass through.

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.192
And let's do paletteName; 'Solarized.

12
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:07.957
And colors, Solarized.

13
00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:10.942
Cool, and now we go into the palette and

14
00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:15.572
we're going to use the parameters
that are being passed in.

15
00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:18.752
So these were in route, I think.

16
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:24.969
And let's do colors, will be route,

17
00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.729
actually, let's destructure them.

18
00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.348
Colors and paletteName.

19
00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:45.061
And passing colors here and
the palette name in here.

20
00:01:46.448 --> 00:01:47.720
Route.params.

21
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.320
Yeah, so this is a route.params,
not just route.

22
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.010
Yeah, so this is what now working.

23
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.413
Now we can,

24
00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:02.720
In our color palettes we can get rid of
our colors cuz we don't use them anymore.

25
00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:07.371
Cool.

26
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:14.546
[INAUDIBLE]
Yeah,

27
00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:19.677
and yeah, if you haven't done it yet,
I've added the, made the background color

28
00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:24.540
white cuz I prefer, I think white looks
better, crisper with all the colors.

29
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.364
Right, part two, make sure the page title
will be the name of the color palette

30
00:02:31.364 --> 00:02:33.313
instead of the name of the page.

31
00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:40.550
So this is actually done in the Home.js.

32
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.670
And we can pass,
not Home.js, sorry App.js.

33
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.430
This is actually done in the App.js and

34
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.405
we can pass a another parameter
called options, which,

35
00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:55.100
where we can use to route and make
the pallet's name the title of the page.

36
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.830
I'm just gonna copy this, codes, and

37
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.440
I'm gonna add it as another argument here,
Into our color palette.

38
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.030
You see it's called updated, so

39
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.940
we actually get a color
name here which looks good.
