00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.020
All right.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.340
So let's do the Expo one first.

3
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.790
So I'm going to show how to add
navigation to both of them.

4
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.700
But Expo will be quite simple,
it'll be quite straightforward.

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.450
For pure React Native,
there'll be more extra steps as always.

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.660
So let's do Expo.

7
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.264
Let's open your terminal in
your project directory and

8
00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:24.359
you can use npm install or
yarn install, and

9
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.574
you'll want to install react
navigation dash native.

10
00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:43.340
And then the next thing you
wanna do is you wanna install.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.780
So this installs all
the native dependencies.

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.980
Here's an example of where Expo
has done some work for you.

13
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.750
So we use Expo install rather than NPM
install, and these are all the packages

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.090
that basically are necessary in
order to make navigation work.

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.214
So let's just copy this whole thing and
run it.

16
00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:07.703
And the last thing you want to do,

17
00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:12.450
I've actually been using my React Native
app rather than, okay, I'll just do this.

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.730
Your input to navigation container.

19
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.920
And you go to your App.js,
and you add the import here.

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.661
And then you just take the navigation
container and wrap your whole app in it.

21
00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:30.175
Cool.

22
00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:35.130
Yeah, so that's that's pretty much it.

23
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.360
The reason this doesn't work for

24
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.420
me is because I use the native
application for my example.

25
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.050
But if you refresh your app and
it still works,

26
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.840
that basically means that
you've installed it correctly.
