00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.490
So for the pure React Native,
adding navigation, there's more to do.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.971
So first thing you wanna do is you
want to install the dependencies.

3
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:13.743
Notice that we install all
the dependencies with NPM,

4
00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:17.455
which is why we have
to do this extra work.

5
00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:22.128
So let's get all these dependencies.

6
00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.340
And now, we have to do two sets of work
because we're building for two platforms.

7
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.730
Or if you're just doing this
workshop with one platform,

8
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.820
you can just follow these ones'
instructions, but I'm going to do both.

9
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.090
And so the first thing you wanna do
is install the native dependencies.

10
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.880
And we've already installed
CocoaPods earlier because we needed

11
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.790
to actually initialize the project.

12
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.380
So I'm going to move this documentation.

13
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.252
But basically what we wanna do is we
wanna go into the iOS directory, and

14
00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:03.516
now you run pod install.

15
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:10.922
So actually I'll show you, if we look
at what's in your iOS directory here,

16
00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:14.120
we have two files,
we have a Podfile and a lock file.

17
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.720
So this actually, it's kind of similar
to a package JSON and a Yarn lock or

18
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.750
an NPM lock, and they work the same way.

19
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.420
So this is just a record of what
version of what libraries are used.

20
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.530
And before React Native 60 you would
have had to manually add some lines

21
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.220
into your Podfile, add pods here into your
Podfile in order for them to be installed.

22
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.465
But from React Native 60,
we have what's called auto linking.

23
00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:46.020
Which means that they go through your Node
modules and see if there are any native

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.180
dependencies that need added,
and just do it automatically.

25
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.640
So all we need to do
is to run pod install.

26
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.072
And you can see it's
installed these libraries.

27
00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.730
Cool, now we go back.

28
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.840
And because we've done a native change,
we've added something natively,

29
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.050
just rerunning our JavaScript
bundle isn't going to be enough.

30
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.565
We'll have to actually do react-native

31
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:13.956
run-ios to rebuild the native bundle.

32
00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:15.850
So this might take a little while.

33
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.940
Meanwhile, I'm going to just run
through the Android instructions.

34
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.390
So for Android, their dependencies are
managed kind of magically using Gradle.

35
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.130
Gradle isn't a package manager
it's kind of like a build tool.

36
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.965
But when you run React Native on Android,
then Gradle goes down those

37
00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:38.400
other dependencies, does the magic,
so there's no manual install step.

38
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.660
But we do need to add
these two lines to add

39
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.920
some compatibility libraries
to our new React Navigation.

40
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.674
So with this we would go to
android/app/build.gradle.

41
00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:55.356
Which is here, so Android,

42
00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:58.880
app build.gradle.

43
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.800
And then we look at dependencies, we add
these slides underneath the dependencies.

44
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.570
So let's have a look.

45
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.738
This is basically
the configuration file for Gradle.

46
00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:12.740
Dependencies, okay, here they are.

47
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.151
So we got my dependencies here.

48
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:20.863
So I'm just gonna add them underneath,
cool.

49
00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:31.483
Okay, and now, same applies for Android
because we've added some native modules.

50
00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:39.994
In order for the application to pick up
the native stuff, we need to rebuild it.

51
00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:44.520
While this is building,
let's do the actual import thing.

52
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.040
So this is exactly the same
as it was on export.

53
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.505
The only difference is we have to
import the gesture handler on our own.

54
00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:59.620
So we go to app.js, we go to the top of
the file, this is before the React import.

55
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.936
And we add react-native-gesture-handler.

56
00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:05.472
And then the rest is the same,
we import navigation container,

57
00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:07.248
from React Native navigation.

58
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:11.541
And then we wrap our
entire application in it.

59
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:18.883
So now that I save it, Yeah,

60
00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:23.610
this is what I mean, so my debugger
doesn't show up as a reason anymore.

61
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.933
So I'll that if I actually quit
my emulator, then restart it,

62
00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.577
it usually plays nice.

63
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.597
Okay, so Android works,
just a moment for iOS.

64
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:50.547
React Navigation actually just
released version 5 three weeks ago,

65
00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:54.234
where they changed how you do
navigation quite significantly, but

66
00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:56.630
it's a lot better than what it was.

67
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.797
It's much more like React and
easier to figure out, so

68
00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:03.798
it's a good time to start learning it.
