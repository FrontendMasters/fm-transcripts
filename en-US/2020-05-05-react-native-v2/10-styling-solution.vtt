WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.850
So we had a couple of questions
come out about fonts.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.222
So on the web, you could just set
one font for the whole application.

3
00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:12.775
And the question was, whether you
could do the same on React Native.

4
00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:16.945
Unfortunately you can't, because we use
inline styles we have to explicitly

5
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:20.625
set the font for every single element.

6
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.615
On big applications, there's a couple of
ways that you can share styles either you

7
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:30.320
will have a global shared style sheets
that you can import styles from,

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.040
to your individual components.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.000
Or you can just have a text components
that you reuse in every single place.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
So usually there's, you figure out
a one place to set the front but

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.330
then that thing is used
in multiple components.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.954
Right let's look at the solution for
this styling exercise.

13
00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:52.488
All right, so first thing we have,
we have some text here some boxes

14
00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:55.765
are different color so
I'm gonna edit the text.

15
00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:04.408
I'm making a conscious
effort not to type a u.

16
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.950
And you notice that the text
is quite a bit bolder here.

17
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.166
So we're going to add a text style.

18
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:22.677
And that's to font,
the default font size is 16, I think.

19
00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:27.611
So let's do 18.

20
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:32.305
[SOUND]

21
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.823
Cool and because I got rid of styles for

22
00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:54.652
the view, add text is touching

23
00:01:54.652 --> 00:01:59.666
that end of the screen again, so

24
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:05.082
I'm gonna just add some padding.

25
00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:19.454
Let's do paddingHorizontal 10.

26
00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:24.007
Sounds good.

27
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.728
And here I'm gonna add some
padding to the top as well,

28
00:02:26.728 --> 00:02:28.750
cuz this isn't at the top of the screen.

29
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.600
Let's do paddingTop, let's do 40.

30
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.590
Cool, all right, now let's do some boxes.

31
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.320
Now because this is just an area that
you wanna style, the best thing to use,

32
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.930
the only thing to use really is a view.

33
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.530
So I'm gonna just add a view here and I'm
gonna and I'm gonna add some text inside.

34
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.103
I'm just gonna copy the first one.

35
00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:05.104
Cool, now I'm gonna add a style,

36
00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:08.616
I'm gonna add cyanBox.

37
00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:17.729
That's the backgroundColor.

38
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.332
Just copy this hex code

39
00:03:29.562 --> 00:03:32.726
All right and
I definitely need some padding.

40
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:38.170
Ten, let's go with ten for padding.

41
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.380
And, right.

42
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.070
Okay, so the color for
the text here was white and bold.

43
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.791
So let's match that.

44
00:03:53.172 --> 00:04:00.880
Oops, let's do box text.

45
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:10.954
Color white.

46
00:04:13.902 --> 00:04:17.864
And fontWeight, bold.

47
00:04:20.498 --> 00:04:26.070
All right, so what else, okay, so
you notice that the text here is centered.

48
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.910
Remember the way we center
things is using flex.

49
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.260
And we need to add in
order to center this,

50
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.530
we need to add style to its container.

51
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.691
So we need to go to cyanBox and

52
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:41.835
tell the box that we wanted content
inside it to be always centered.

53
00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:49.190
So for this we do,

54
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.906
justifyContent, center and

55
00:04:56.906 --> 00:05:00.620
alignItems.

56
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.940
Cool, it sent it, that's looking good.

57
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.350
And finally, let's do this text,
the header text.

58
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.226
This should have some spacing below,
so let's just add this.

59
00:05:17.914 --> 00:05:21.338
So now we have our cyan box.

60
00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:25.640
All pretty looking like the designs and
we'd like to add another one.

61
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.588
So to do that, I'm just gonna
copy the code for the cyanBox so

62
00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:34.660
the box and text and
I'm gonna add it under here.

63
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.135
And I'm gonna name this,
a blueBox and updates.

64
00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:42.251
So blue.

65
00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:51.467
Cool.

66
00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:55.664
And I need to add the styles.

67
00:05:55.664 --> 00:06:05.664
[SOUND]

68
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:14.400
Okay, so now we've got two boxes, but
notice that they're touching each other.

69
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.810
Whereas on the designs they don't.

70
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.788
So I'm just gonna add some
bottom margin as well.

71
00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:29.710
All right, well,
this is looking pretty good.

72
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.530
But one thing you might have noticed then,
as we added the second box,

73
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.580
we pretty much copied all the styles,
apart from the background color.

74
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.610
So we want to use the array method
of passing in two styles, so

75
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.250
we could pass the color and
the box style separately.

76
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.871
So I'm gonna create
a new style called box.

77
00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:53.956
And then I'm going to copy
all the styles from here,

78
00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.960
apart from the color into the box.

79
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.222
And then these,
I'm just going to convert to the colors.

80
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:10.793
And then for both of these box views,

81
00:07:10.793 --> 00:07:16.740
I'm going to convert this into
an array and have two elements.

82
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.353
I'm gonna have the box and then the cyan.

83
00:07:24.962 --> 00:07:26.043
Same here.

84
00:07:26.043 --> 00:07:33.135
Gonna have the box and
the color, wrong color.

85
00:07:36.097 --> 00:07:41.892
Cool and now we can just add the two
remaining colors the same way.

86
00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:50.733
So we got magenta

87
00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:54.993
and orange.

88
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:18.095
Add the orange.

89
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:34.263
I do have to add an extra one.

90
00:08:41.183 --> 00:08:46.810
[SOUND] Nice and now this

91
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.554
match the design.

92
00:08:51.554 --> 00:08:54.456
And I've also been running my
Android emulator in the background.

93
00:08:57.551 --> 00:08:59.993
Cool and it's working on Android as well.

94
00:08:59.993 --> 00:09:04.460
And one thing to notice that colors look
a little bit different between Android

95
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.340
and iOS.

96
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.160
And sometimes that's just how it is.

97
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.300
There's nothing to do about it.

98
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.510
We're literally using the same hex codes.

99
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.050
So that's something to be wary of.

100
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.680
I've had to change color values just for

101
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.820
Android just to make sure that it looks
good especially greens for some reason.

102
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.010
So it's something to be wary of.

103
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.760
Right let's look at the solution.

104
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.980
Make sure I've covered everything.

105
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.680
If for some reason you fall behind,
I know I typed quite quickly so

106
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.610
if you fall behind.

107
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.900
If you fell behind, or

108
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.570
you're a little bit confused,
feel free to click on these links.

109
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.633
And this should have all the depth
of what we just added as well.

110
00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:49.139
I guess you add a paying top,
horizontal and the heading and

111
00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:54.810
the boxes and combining styles,
cool that works.
