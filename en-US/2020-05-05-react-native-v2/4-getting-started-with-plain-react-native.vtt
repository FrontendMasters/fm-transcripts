1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.352
Before we carry on and actually start
writing code, what I'm going to do is

2
00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.603
I'm going to show you what it takes to
get to the same point or without Expo.

3
00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:12.685
One thing to note if you're using Expo and
you're using the Expo app, is that you

4
00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.950
have to make sure you're on the same Wi Fi
network as your computer because basically

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.237
the JavaScript bundle that's being built,
is being sent to your phone using Wi Fi.

6
00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.645
And if you're not on the same network,
you can't do that.

7
00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:29.091
If you're already familiar
with mobile development, or

8
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:33.956
if you just really don't wanna use Expo,
you may want to use the React Native CLI.

9
00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:38.661
This requires for you to install Android
Studio or Xcode depending on whether you

10
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.340
want to build the Android or iOS or
both In order to get started.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.630
If you already have these installed, it
should be up and running within minutes.

12
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.036
But if not, it can take a couple of
hours to install and configure them,

13
00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:52.734
especially Xcode is huge.

14
00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.001
Again, if you're on Windows or Linux, you
won't be able to build on the iOS device,

15
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.550
Xcode only exists for the Mac.

16
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.620
But you can still follow this along and
build the Android app.

17
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.260
Now the best thing to do is
basically follow my favorite thing,

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.530
which is the React Native CLI Quickstart
guide on the React Native Website.

19
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.180
Here you can choose your
development operating system, and

20
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.470
the target operating system, and pretty
much just follow what they're doing.

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.741
And three, I'm going to do Mac and IOS.

22
00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:28.740
So I already have Xcode installed.

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.390
And if you don't, you might have
to install it from the App Store,

24
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.228
on your on your computer.

25
00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:41.820
Get the things you want to make sure we
have installed on Node, and Watchman.

26
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.887
Node is the JavaScript runtime,
and Watchman is basically

27
00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:53.228
a tool that allows us to hot
update with React Native And

28
00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:57.561
again, if you've already
installed Node on your system,

29
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:00.344
make sure you have Node 8.3 in URL.

30
00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:03.030
And if you don't have it,
you can install it from the Node website.

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.890
Okay, there you go,
there's a link to Xcode to us,

32
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.850
if you don't already have Xcode, you'll
have to install it from the Mac App Store.

33
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.130
So I already have this installed.

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.140
So I don't need to do that.

35
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.430
And this will also install
the iOS Simulators.

36
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.670
And all the necessary tools to build
iOS app, this is why it's so huge,

37
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.390
it does everything.

38
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.528
We'll have to install CocoaPods as well,

39
00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:31.610
CocoaPods is basically the iOS,
Package management system.

40
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.990
So you can think of it as npm for
native iOS, it's a little bit different.

41
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.968
But if it helps,
that's basically what it does All right,

42
00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:44.975
so if you have installed Xcode,
Node, CocoaPods,

43
00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:48.539
now you should be ready to do this,
all right.

44
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:53.994
So, I think I'm gonna go back here, and

45
00:02:53.994 --> 00:02:58.780
I'm gonna initialize my
React Native awesome project.

46
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.281
I'm going to be using mpx for this,

47
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:07.782
if you've never used that before it's
actually a utility tool that's built into

48
00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:12.978
npm that allows you to run CLI commands
without installing things globally.

49
00:03:12.978 --> 00:03:15.068
So you remember we
installed Expo globally,

50
00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:17.824
whereas in the React Native
docs they recommend using mpx.

51
00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:22.917
So who am I to argue?

52
00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:26.383
You notice that this takes quite a long
time because, there's a lot to do.

53
00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:44.229
Okay.

54
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.562
So this actually, I didn't know
that I was very brave yesterday and

55
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:51.907
I upgraded my operating system,
which it looks like

56
00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:56.560
it's uninstalled CocoaPods which so
I didn't know that this did that.

57
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.020
But apparently it actually tells me
that it will install CocoaPods for

58
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.980
me, which I'm going to do.

59
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.604
That was good to know.

60
00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:16.650
My pods installation failed,
I'm gonna try installing them using this.

61
00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:31.336
&gt;&gt; Do you write exactly
the same experience?

62
00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:37.089
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm gonna have to
report it to the React Native folks.

63
00:04:41.702 --> 00:04:43.307
Yeah, we've done it.

64
00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:44.713
So happy.

65
00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:46.956
Right, okay.

66
00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:48.118
So now,

67
00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:01.860
Right, so in order to run
like a React Native project,

68
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.090
you actually have to do two things.

69
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.700
So, the first you have
to start the packager.

70
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.380
And secondly,
you have to build the actual native app.

71
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.710
So if you do the command
to build the native app,

72
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.900
it does start the packager for
you automatically.

73
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.400
But I like to do this

74
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.288
explicitly because I would like to
know what the packager is up to.

75
00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:27.920
So, I'm gonna do yarn start or
npm run start if you're using npm.

76
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.530
So this is just starting a packager.

77
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.442
And then in a different tab,
I'm gonna go to the same directory,

78
00:05:36.442 --> 00:05:41.184
and then I'm gonna do npx
react-native run-ios.

79
00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:47.622
So, this will build, install, and

80
00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:53.290
launch the application on
your default iOS Simulator.

81
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.250
And on the first time you do it,

82
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.750
it will take a little while, because it's
building all the binaries from scratch.

83
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.479
But the subsequent times,

84
00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.001
if you haven't edited any of the native
code it's quite a lot quicker.

85
00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:19.571
Have this experience illustrates we're
experts so much easier to get stuff.

86
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:27.542
Yeah, okay.

87
00:06:30.135 --> 00:06:31.656
Cool, awesome.

88
00:06:31.656 --> 00:06:35.225
Well, that was a chore and a half.

89
00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:40.230
Yes, so this is the Hello World
template for React Native.

90
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.800
Using the React Native CLI, you notice
that there's a lot more going on.

91
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.590
And I've had people who are just new to
React Native kind of go, well, there's so

92
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.750
much going on I have no
idea where to start.

93
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.640
But don't worry, we're gonna basically
delete everything and start from scratch.

94
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.860
So we have the same experience
regardless of your platform.

95
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.480
So this is running on iOS,

96
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.600
and I'm also gonna show you how
to get this running on Android.

97
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.240
So if you are an Android user,

98
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.380
you've had to install Android Studio,
which I already have installed.

99
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.290
So I'm gonna just stop that,
hopefully didn't disappear

100
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.380
after my reckless upgrading
of operating system.

101
00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:28.802
And we don't need to use Android Studio
to actually launch a project, but we will

102
00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:34.615
need to launch the Android Virtual Device,
before running the start Android command.

103
00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:37.565
So if you're on the latest
version of Android Studio,

104
00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:40.615
I remember I was on 3.2 and
I didn't have this option.

105
00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:45.165
But basically, if you launch it and you go
under Configure, you can open AVD manager,

106
00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.695
AVD stands for Android Virtual Device.

107
00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:50.665
And here you can create
your virtual devices.

108
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:53.157
So if you don't already have one,
you can basically go here,

109
00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:55.885
click on Virtual Device,
you can choose the device,

110
00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:58.450
you can choose which
version of Android it runs.

111
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.890
And you'll basically download all
the binaries and created for you.

112
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.280
This will also take other, well,
thankfully, here's one I made earlier.

113
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.691
And I'm just gonna
double-click to launch it.

114
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:15.307
There is a command, If you know the device
name, there is a command that you can run

115
00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:18.760
to just launch the emulator
from your terminal.

116
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.800
But for the first time, it's just easy
to do it through the user interface.

117
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.340
And once this is launched,
you can actually go ahead and

118
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.290
just close Android Studio stuff
cuz this is pretty standalone.

119
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.718
Now, once this is open,
I basically run mpx

120
00:08:34.718 --> 00:08:41.420
react-native run-android,

121
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:47.580
and then this will pick up this virtual
device and then install the app on it.

122
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.710
If you want to run this on your
phone instead, all you need to do is

123
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.350
take your phone and plug it into
your laptop, and close the emulator.

124
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.430
And then the AVD manager should
just pick up your phone.

125
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.410
If it doesn't,
there are some deep debugging tips here,

126
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.330
I think, yeah,
you have to enable USB debugging.

127
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.740
So I don't have an Android
device with me at the moment.

128
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.540
But basically you go on to version number
you tap on it's like seven times, and

129
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.930
that will enable developer tools, and
then you can enable the USB debugging and

130
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.510
then you can install it on your phone.

131
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.693
So it's a hassle.

132
00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:25.800
I always use virtual devices if I'm
developing just client projects.

133
00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:30.200
Cool,there it is, awesome.

134
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.630
Right, so now we have the both
the same exact application actually,

135
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.550
running on both iOS and
Android which is pretty cool.

136
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.460
Now, let's have a look at the folder
structure of a pure React Native project.

137
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.990
So this is the one that we just created,
and launched on the virtual devices.

138
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.680
And you can see that there's
already a whole lot more going on.

139
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.950
Now, the bits that are the most important
here is you notice that there's an Android

140
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.300
directory and an iOS directory.

141
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.200
And these directories basically
hold their native code.

142
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.620
So if you go in here, you'll have the app
delegate, there's a header file, and

143
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.464
there's the actual content file and
this is Objective-C.

144
00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:16.584
And then the same Find List so
there's an Android equivalent to this.

145
00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:17.888
So we're in here.

146
00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:20.410
Leave the Java naming convention,
but very good.

147
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.235
This is the entry for the app.

148
00:10:22.235 --> 00:10:24.993
Now most of the time,
you won't need to look at these.

149
00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:30.550
But it's a good thing to know that
this is where the native code lives.

150
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.657
We'll still have module for
default or their dependencies, and

151
00:10:33.657 --> 00:10:36.255
another thing to note is that
the react native template

152
00:10:36.255 --> 00:10:40.360
actually comes with flow pre-installed,
they're still in the flow train.

153
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.829
So you'll have a buckleconfig and
a flowconfig,

154
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:46.257
we're not gonna be using flow for
this, so feel free to ignore them.

155
00:10:48.602 --> 00:10:52.524
Finally, we also have prettierr and
we have some babel and

156
00:10:52.524 --> 00:10:56.670
package.json, but
notice that we also have an Index.js.

157
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.890
So for Expo, Expo actually handles this
mounting your application on its own,

158
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.180
whereas with pure React Native,
it's kind of done explicitly.

159
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.720
But we still have an App.js,
which is where all our app code lives.

160
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.776
So this is the file that
you'll be working on.
