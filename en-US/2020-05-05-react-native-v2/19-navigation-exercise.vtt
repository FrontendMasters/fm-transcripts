00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.640
As you can see, so
currently we have a hard coded value and

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.950
a hard coded color palette.

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.000
We would like these to be dynamic.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.510
So what we wanna do is we want
to pass the palette name and

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.930
the colors down to
the color palette screen so

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.040
it could be extended to render
any color palettes we want.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.550
And you can do this as a second
argument in the navigate prop.

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.280
So the first argument is always the name
of the screen you will navigate to,

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.040
and the second argument is optional.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.750
But it can be properties that you want to
be passed into the color palette screen.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.710
For screens that you've navigated to,

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.225
you get a special route
param added automatically.

13
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:50.882
So this is out of the same
way as the navigation param.

14
00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:55.971
And these parameters will become
available from route.params.paletteName.

15
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:58.500
So for example here,
if you do route.params.paletteName,

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.510
you will get Solarized.

17
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.307
So for this exercise,
there's four parts to this.

18
00:01:04.307 --> 00:01:08.595
Firstly, update the app so that the colors
and the name are being passed into

19
00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:11.946
the color palette dynamically,
which makes it reusable.

20
00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:18.430
And I've also linked to the right
place in the documentation.

21
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.371
The second part is making sure that the
page title will be the name of the color

22
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:24.478
palette instead of the name of the page.

23
00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:28.480
So that's what we just discussed as well.

24
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.965
Then we want to add two
more color schemes.

25
00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.450
We added the colors for these,

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.230
now we wanna have rainbow color scheme and
the Frontier Masters color scheme.

27
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.180
And finally, this is kind of a stretch
goal, but we'd like to update

28
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.420
the homepage so that it displays the first
five colors of the color scheme.

29
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.940
Kind of like in a little rose,
you get a little preview.

30
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.474
So here's one I built earlier for
me to reference.
