1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.830
So now we are gonna need to render
lots and lots and lots of colors.

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.161
So let's just go ahead and
copy the giant colors array.

3
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:13.761
And add it here.

4
00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:20.212
And because there's lots and lots of lots
of things, we're going to use a FlatList.

5
00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:31.433
Let's go underneath Palette name and
do FlatList.

6
00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:37.823
So here our data is the COLORS.

7
00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:43.165
keyExtractor will be

8
00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:50.588
item =&gt; item.colorName.

9
00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:04.965
Then renderItem, going to get the item
which is the individual color.

10
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:10.775
And now we can pretty much just copy this,

11
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:18.723
the switch code that we made earlier,
And put it in here.

12
00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:25.744
So here the color name will
now be item.colorName,

13
00:01:30.738 --> 00:01:35.870
And for the styles,
do I have to change anything?

14
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.498
Cool, now we've got
an array of all the colors.

15
00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:43.558
So next what we want to do,
we can actually remove

16
00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:48.421
some of this padding now,
some of this margin now, okay.

17
00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:55.364
So the next thing you wanna do is,
obviously,

18
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.072
these are all turned on by default.

19
00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:01.480
We want some way to actually track
what's turned on and what's off.

20
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.280
So in order to do this, let's create
a new state variable to hold this, so

21
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.010
let's create one for selected colors only.

22
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.628
So let's do SelectedColors and

23
00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:25.040
setSelectedColors, useState and
let's start with an empty array.

24
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.746
Now, we want this selectedColors
array basically to contain,

25
00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:35.790
they each contain one of these.

26
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.101
So here, where we decide
where something is selected.

27
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:46.226
So this value is either true or false
based on whether it's selected or not.

28
00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:50.678
So all we can do is we can do if

29
00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:55.330
selectedColors.find, so

30
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.323
this is color, which is individual item.

31
00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:09.894
So color.colorName is
the same as this item,

32
00:03:13.848 --> 00:03:16.776
colorName, and it's true.

33
00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:23.047
And basically, what we want here is we
want to force this into being a Boolean,

34
00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:27.740
and a handy way to do that is
a double exclamation mark.

35
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.010
So a single exclamation mark would make
this the opposite of what it was before.

36
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.290
So if it was true, it would be false.

37
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.480
If it was an object, it would be false.

38
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.850
And then a double one will just
basically converted into a Boolean and

39
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.760
then convert it back.

40
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.066
So you make it truthy.

41
00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:48.694
Cool, so
now all of these are not selected,

42
00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:53.075
which is correct,
cuz we don't have any items in our array.

43
00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:56.110
And last thing we need to wire
up is this onValue change.

44
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.560
So let's create another callback.

45
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.416
Let's call it handleValueChange,

46
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.650
And here, we get two things.

47
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.577
So we get the value, so whether
the user turned this thing on or off.

48
00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:28.321
So value and also we get the whole color.

49
00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:42.739
Nice, so here basically

50
00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:46.890
if value is true.

51
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.863
So this means that the user
has toggled the button on,

52
00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:52.983
we want to add the color into
our selected colors array.

53
00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:57.561
So let's do setSelectedColors.

54
00:05:00.172 --> 00:05:02.880
And we do care what the current ones are.

55
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.008
So we do colors.

56
00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:13.120
And we return all the colors,
but with the current one added.

57
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.526
And in this case,
we don't really, do we care?

58
00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:21.185
I guess I'm adding it to
the end of the color list,

59
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.900
I guess it doesn't matter too much.

60
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.000
And then otherwise,

61
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.840
if the value is false, we know that
the user has toggled it to be off.

62
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.750
And in this case, we are going to
remove it from our current color array.

63
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.031
So we do setSelectedColors,

64
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:47.916
And then we're just going to filter
the color that they deselected out.

65
00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:09.830
Actually, I can't call this color.

66
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.833
I've gotta call it selectedColor.

67
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.674
And I'm going to do
selectedColor.colorName.

68
00:06:26.674 --> 00:06:32.700
All right, so
here it basically does colors.filter.

69
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.628
And this filters out everything where
the colorName is the selectedColorName.

70
00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:42.950
In theory, well, okay, so the reason
it doesn't work is we aren't actually

71
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.590
calling this function, so
we need to add it to onValueChange.

72
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.838
So onValueChange will return selected,
so this is the Boolean.

73
00:06:52.838 --> 00:06:57.549
And in this case, we do actually want to
call this explicitly cuz we wanna pass

74
00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:58.496
in two things.

75
00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:04.580
You wanna pass in selected, And also
the color that we're currently working on.

76
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.543
So this two arguments.

77
00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:15.300
There you go so, I think

78
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.980
this might have to be a converse.

79
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.480
Okay, yeah, so I had a small
mistake here when I did a filter,

80
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.280
I filtered everything
out rather than this.

81
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.220
So if you followed along,
make sure this is a negation.

82
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.860
And now I can select all of these.

83
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.507
Now, if you remember,
we had another alert that we had to do.

84
00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:45.214
We had to check that there are at
least three selected colors,

85
00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.520
so let's add another if else here.

86
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:57.870
else if, let's do selectedlColors.length,

87
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:03.575
let's say, is less than 3.

88
00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:12.165
Then we do an alert saying,

89
00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:18.904
Please add at least 3 colors.

90
00:08:25.015 --> 00:08:29.001
So if I do have the name, I press net.

91
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:31.311
Why does this still work?

92
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:32.618
&gt;&gt; I think it's misspelled.

93
00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:34.759
&gt;&gt; Thank you, misspelled length.

94
00:08:37.654 --> 00:08:43.213
All right, so add a name and
add no colors.

95
00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:45.955
Okay, so
it's saying please add at least three.

96
00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:50.493
Doesn't work with two, but if I add three-
&gt;&gt; You need selected

97
00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:53.521
colors in your array at the bottom.

98
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:55.710
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, I do, thank you.

99
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:01.965
This is because our handle submit
hook is now being re-rendered.

100
00:09:04.205 --> 00:09:06.416
I told you this happens to
me all the time [LAUGH].

101
00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:14.536
All right, let's actually add
some interesting colors here.

102
00:09:18.352 --> 00:09:21.690
Why did these not show up?

103
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.413
I know why, because I've hard coded
this colors array to be empty.

104
00:09:25.413 --> 00:09:30.859
So let's do selectedColors here.

105
00:09:30.859 --> 00:09:33.671
And I'm just gonna refresh.

106
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.489
Yay, it works!

107
00:09:43.489 --> 00:09:44.448
That's pretty cool.

108
00:09:44.448 --> 00:09:49.037
And so there's loads and loads of
things where you can enhance this.

109
00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:58.260
You could make the Submit button nicer,
you could add little color previews, yes?

110
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.441
&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say that's what I did.

111
00:10:00.441 --> 00:10:02.666
I had a blue square of color
next to the drawing, so.

112
00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:04.341
&gt;&gt; Nice.
&gt;&gt; None of them actually are.

113
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:08.314
&gt;&gt; Yep, perfect, yeah, so there's loads
of little things that you can do.

114
00:10:08.314 --> 00:10:13.306
You can enhance the net hook request,
they actually do a post.

115
00:10:13.306 --> 00:10:15.818
If you wanted to,
you could add the bottom navigation.

116
00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:18.665
The API actually has
a search functionality.

117
00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:22.569
So if you search by ID, you can
also preview a particular color, so

118
00:10:22.569 --> 00:10:25.670
there's loads of things if
you want to tinker a bit.

119
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.180
Sorry, you had a question?

120
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.000
&gt;&gt; You mentioned in the beginning that
React Native has flex out of the box.

121
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.520
Does it also support grids?

122
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.180
&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so.

123
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.440
I think it's flex only, yep.

124
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.220
&gt;&gt; So you cannot even wire that up?

125
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.550
&gt;&gt; I don't think so, sorry, yes?

126
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.557
&gt;&gt; What's the benefit of using use
callback as opposed to just writing

127
00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:54.293
another anonymous function?

128
00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:00.265
&gt;&gt; You could write an anonymous function.

129
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:06.203
Yeah, especially so if you have,
if you had a use callback and

130
00:11:06.203 --> 00:11:10.347
you put it outside of here,
that will be completely fine to do.

131
00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:15.294
You just have to make sure to pass in
all the arguments into the function.

132
00:11:15.294 --> 00:11:17.318
So you can do either.

133
00:11:17.318 --> 00:11:22.454
I'm pretty sure I could just,
yeah, so I could move this

134
00:11:22.454 --> 00:11:27.605
handleSubmit, for example,
outside of the function.

135
00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:32.290
But then every time I call it, I would
have to pass in the selected colors.

136
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.780
And I would have to pass in
the currently selected name as well.

137
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.494
So you could do it, but

138
00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:38.449
you need to make sure you pass
in all the different arguments,

139
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:39.434
cuz it will be a pure function.
