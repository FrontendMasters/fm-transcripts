00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.302
Now that you're experts in hooks and
network requests,

2
00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:06.470
let's do the network requests exercise.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.180
So I've got a host of versions
of these color palettes,

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.730
which are available on this URL.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.360
And it basically just gives you
a JSON array that's structured like

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.382
our current array is.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.780
And I would like you to convert
our current application

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.540
to fetch these color palettes from the
API, rather than having them hard-coded.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.000
And you should be using all of the three
hooks we've just talked about.
