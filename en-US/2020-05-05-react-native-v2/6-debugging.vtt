00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.062
As developers,
we do a lot of debugging, a lot.

2
00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:06.490
I feel like most of my work is debugging.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.893
And it's pretty important to know what
tools there are available for this.

4
00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:18.445
The main thing is basically being
able to launch the Debug menu.

5
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.327
Now if you're on a device,
what you do is while the app is open,

6
00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:26.891
you shake the device like this and
then you'll see a Debug menu like this.

7
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:31.151
It feels very silly if you have
a room full of expert developers, and

8
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.435
everyone's like.

9
00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:35.806
[LAUGH] But yeah,
that's literally how you do it.

10
00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:40.867
If you're on an Android emulator,
you use Cmd + M on a Mac,

11
00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:44.630
or Ctrl + M if you're on Windows and
Linux.

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.227
And then on an IOS simulator,
you use Cmd + D.

13
00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:54.984
So if I do Cmd + D, I get the Debug menu.

14
00:00:54.984 --> 00:01:02.076
And then same for Android,
if I do Cmd + M, I get the Debug menu.

15
00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:07.846
One thing to note is if you're swapping
between them, Cmd + M in IOS is minify.

16
00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:10.947
So if I do Cmd + M here, bye!

17
00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.629
It's very annoying.

18
00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:17.182
Cool, so let's look at
the options that we get here.

19
00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:18.668
The main option is reload.

20
00:01:18.668 --> 00:01:22.314
Now, the newest React Native has
hot reloading on by default.

21
00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:26.118
So if you added something, it will
automatically get transferred in your app,

22
00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:26.927
which is great.

23
00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:30.436
But sometimes you might have
to turn hot reloading off or

24
00:01:30.436 --> 00:01:32.460
you have to explicitly reload.

25
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.556
So reloading is the main thing
that you probably use this for and

26
00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:40.818
what this does is that it will
redownload the JavaScript bundle.

27
00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:44.792
And because reloading is
such a frequent thing to do,

28
00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.364
you can also use Cmd + R to do this.

29
00:01:47.364 --> 00:01:52.265
It doesn't work on Android as it does.

30
00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:55.682
Now the other thing that you
can do is you can debug.

31
00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.648
So I'm gonna move this to the other
screen so you can see it better.

32
00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:06.505
If I press on Debug, it will open a React
Native debugger, which is basically this.

33
00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:07.599
You'll see it's on local host 8081.

34
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.764
It says debugger UI.

35
00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:14.661
And now what you do is you open
the inspector as you would on a web page,

36
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:17.519
and then you have a console here.

37
00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.428
So anything you actually add to it, if
you use console log to log something out,

38
00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:24.126
it actually appears here.

39
00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:31.761
Yeah, let's try this.

40
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.564
So in your app,
don't worry about what it returns,

41
00:02:36.564 --> 00:02:40.604
whether you're using React Native or not,

42
00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:45.970
just go just above where the return is and
do a console log.

43
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.200
Cool, so now notice that this
appeared in our console.

44
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.282
And if I refresh.

45
00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.730
I have so many versions of these open,
they're getting a bit confused.

46
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.629
Okay, there it is.

47
00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.049
And one thing that's interesting to try
out, that if you use a different console

48
00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.277
properties like warn or error,
they actually display in different things.

49
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.207
So try using console warn instead and

50
00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:22.320
you'll notice that this comes
up as little yellow box warning.

51
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.040
And if you use console.error,
you get this full screen error.

52
00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:36.052
So one thing to note that when you're
first starting up with React Native,

53
00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:40.532
if you this black screen with the red top,
it looks really terrifying but

54
00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.890
actually it's just a console error.

55
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.599
It usually means that
something's going wrong,

56
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.236
but it's not the end of the world.

57
00:03:56.638 --> 00:04:00.803
And finally, let's have a look at
the other options that we have here.

58
00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.563
So I'm gonna stop debugging, so

59
00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:08.402
the other thing we can do is
you can choose Show Inspector.

60
00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:11.726
Now I don't use this very often
because I haven't found it very handy

61
00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:15.463
on mobile screens, but basically it
works the same as inspection on the web.

62
00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:22.690
So you can click on things and
you can see some positioning information.

63
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.917
You can turn it off by doing Cmd + D,
and hide inspector.

64
00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:30.104
And the other thing that you
might wanna do is you might wanna

65
00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:31.792
disable fast refresh.

66
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:36.183
So this refreshes as you type which
might feel quite jarring to some people.

67
00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:41.933
So you can always disable or
enable it as necessary.

68
00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:46.844
Your options are quite advanced, but feel
free to check them out on your spare time.

69
00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:50.620
The ones that I use most often
are basically reload and debugger.
