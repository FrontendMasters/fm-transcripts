00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.747
Now if you've been eyeing of
the React Native space already,

2
00:00:03.747 --> 00:00:05.696
you've probably heard of Expo.

3
00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:09.745
And if you haven't, Expo is
essentially a suite of tools built for

4
00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:11.273
an around React Native.

5
00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:16.155
And it's designed to basically make
your building up experience as easy

6
00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.122
as possible.

7
00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:19.303
So it's all focused on
developer experience.

8
00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:22.220
There are a separate company and
they're not affiliated with Facebook.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.163
Now, some people have really
strong opinions about whether or

10
00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:29.932
not to use Expo or
just use plain React Native.

11
00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:34.449
So if you're one of those people,
just feel free to skip the section and

12
00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.802
just carry on with your preference.

13
00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:41.142
This is an introductory workshop and
can be followed with Expo and without.

14
00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:46.968
However, if you have strong opinions,
if you don't have any strong opinions,

15
00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:50.236
and you need some help
deciding just read on.

16
00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:54.296
If you're new to mobile development and
basically just wanna have a taste of

17
00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:58.801
React Native and just play around with
things a little bit I would 100% recommend

18
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.799
you go with Expo just because
it's easier to get going.

19
00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.219
There's a lot less up run configuration
work and you just get to writing code much

20
00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.736
quicker, you should also definitely go
with Expo if you're on Windows or Linux.

21
00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:16.704
But you want to use your physical
iPhone to run the app on.

22
00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:20.419
Because you can't build an iPhone app on
Windows and Linux you need a Mac for that.

23
00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:26.259
The main reason I'm recommending Expo for
an introductory workshop,

24
00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.538
is because it may take quite
a bit of time to set up your

25
00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:35.433
development environment for
the first time without Expo.

26
00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:38.069
From my experience,
how long it could could take?

27
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.543
It depends on your environment and whether
you want to use your physical device,

28
00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:46.856
or if you want to use an emulator,
or simulator.

29
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:51.331
The Expo on a physical device is
the quickest possible way to get going.

30
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:54.972
If you already have a Node installed,
for example,

31
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:59.871
you pretty much get going a couple
of minutes for both Android and iOS.

32
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:05.107
If you want to use a iOS simulator or an
Android emulator, you'll have to install

33
00:02:05.107 --> 00:02:10.354
Xcode or Android Studio which can take
quite a bit of time, hence the added time.

34
00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:15.614
And if you want to do playing
React Native on a physical device,

35
00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:20.676
or an simulator, or an emulator,
there's a little bit more

36
00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:25.661
extra time to get everything
to play nice in your computer.

37
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:29.989
And on Windows or Linux,
it generally can take a little bit longer.

38
00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.444
And you can't build any iOS applications
because you need a Mac device for that.

39
00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:40.931
This is why most React Native
developers actually end up on a Mac,

40
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:45.174
because you can build an Android
app on a Mac and an iOS app, but

41
00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:48.125
you can't do the same on any other device.

42
00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:55.899
Now Expo has some restrictions and
the main restriction is basically that,

43
00:02:55.899 --> 00:03:00.473
if you need to add any native code, so
what we discussed earlier about if you

44
00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:04.850
find any things that you wanna do
that React Native doesn't let you do.

45
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.407
Or that are not built into Expo,

46
00:03:07.407 --> 00:03:12.163
you won't be able to do it without,
what we call ejecting.

47
00:03:12.163 --> 00:03:15.137
And this basically means converting
your Expo application into

48
00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:16.910
a Vanilla React Native application.

49
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.792
So that's the only time
where it's becomes tricky.

50
00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:25.437
So in my experience
working with React Native,

51
00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:30.538
all production apps that are built
have been either ejected if they

52
00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:35.291
started with Expo or
just started with playing React Native.

53
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:41.590
And this is mostly the clients,
what the clients wanted, or just.

54
00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:47.829
What we've had to do due to
the features that we had to add.

55
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.469
I always use Expo for
in-person workshops though,

56
00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:54.729
because otherwise we'd all spend two hours
getting set up and that's not very fun.
