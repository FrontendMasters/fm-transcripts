00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.090
Hello, welcome to this
course on React Native.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.860
Yeah, first off, I'm really excited for

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.960
you because I really enjoyed
learning about React Native.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.110
I've been using a smartphone for
years as have you probably.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.722
And, yeah,
I've always wondered how it works and

6
00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.167
how all these little
elements get put together.

7
00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:24.873
And it's kind of fun to figure it all out,
so lucky you.

8
00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:26.818
And the objective of the course,

9
00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.945
my main goal is basically to
give you the knowledge and

10
00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:34.830
the tools necessary to just start
building your React Native applications.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.962
So in this course,
we're going to be googling things.

12
00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.280
We're going to be looking
at documentation.

13
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.260
We're gonna be debugging and

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.350
making mistakes because I'm going to
be typing out all the solutions live.

15
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.160
So I will definitely make mistakes.

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.330
So basically, I will be giving you this
course the way I would build software.

17
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.713
So you can just take this knowledge and

18
00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.922
just start applying it
to your day-to-day life.

19
00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.694
And I've got a little course
guide here and firstly,

20
00:01:02.694 --> 00:01:04.840
all these course notes are hosted.

21
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.930
So if you haven't already,
you can go to my GitHub pages,

22
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.780
it's called React Native v2, and then
you can follow alone in your own time.

23
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.840
It'll actually go handy in this work cuz
there's a bunch of code example that you

24
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.040
might want to copy instead
of writing from the slides.

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.940
I've got a little legend here,

26
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.460
so some of the chapters are marked
with this lovely note emoji.

27
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.910
So this means that they are exercises,
they're broken parts into two sections.

28
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.550
There's a exercise and
then followed is like

29
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.210
a little chapter with a eyes emoji, which
will be the solution to the exercise.

30
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.214
How you approach these is completely
up to you, if you're the kind

31
00:01:44.214 --> 00:01:48.612
of person that learns best by doing,
I would recommend spending 10, 15 minutes,

32
00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:52.072
just having a go at the exercise,
and then looking at the solution.

33
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.414
I also make note of
the little link emojis, so

34
00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:03.700
these are links to the solution
of the preceding exercise.

35
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.009
If I go to my GitHub,
Actually share this through here.

36
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:18.170
So these are links to these divs, so these
are all the codes that we're going to do.

37
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.750
So each link will link to something like
this where you can see what we've just

38
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.673
added as a div.

39
00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:28.282
So use this to check your work, or
if you get lost, you can also check this.

40
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:33.983
And finally, you can use Expo for
this course or

41
00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:38.800
you can use Vanilla React Native,
so it's completely up to you.

42
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.940
There are only, I think three parts
where the instructions differ, and

43
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.520
in these sections, the chapters
are prefixed with either Expo or RN.

44
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.744
So just choose the ones that apply to you,
I will be covering this.

45
00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:57.326
All right, so About You, the intended
audience of this course are basically

46
00:02:57.326 --> 00:03:01.950
people who are familiar with JavaScript,
but new to React Native.

47
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.050
If you already know React,
that's actually perfect because

48
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.070
a lot of React is immediately
transferable to React Native.

49
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.120
And in this course, if you're new to
React Native, don't worry about it.

50
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.336
I will be explaining all the React
concepts from the ground up as well.

51
00:03:17.742 --> 00:03:22.478
But the focus of this course is basically
how React Native differs from React on

52
00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:23.120
the web.

53
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.150
So I'll be focusing on things
that you might not have thought

54
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.200
could work like that in Native platforms,
and yeah, just things that are different.

55
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.450
I'll be using a MacBook Pro and an iPhone
simulator and an Android emulator, and

56
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.490
also some things from my phone as well.

57
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.080
You don't need to match my setup exactly,
but at a minimum,

58
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.810
you should have a Mac Windows or Linux
machine or phone or an emulator installed.

59
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.620
So my name is Kadi, I'm a senior software
engineer currently working at Formidable

60
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.720
and I build things in JavaScript.

61
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.249
At the moment, I mostly build things
in JavaScript in React Native, but

62
00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.085
I've also done React and plain JavaScript.

63
00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:06.376
I actually started up,

64
00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:11.000
I started out programming at the
university where I studied Mathematics.

65
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.772
And then I joined a company where I
thought I was going to write algorithms in

66
00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:19.966
mathematics, and ended up writing
web applications in .NETs.

67
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:26.927
And after that, I segued into JavaScript
and then to React and React Native.

68
00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:32.450
If you wanna follow me on social media,
got some links to my Twitter and GitHub.

69
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.785
So this is what the course will look like,
got a section introduction,

70
00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:41.495
got setup, then we'll go into looking
at basic components in React Native.

71
00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:44.170
And then we've got a meaty part
which is all around navigation.

72
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.307
And then we're going to look at hooks and
network requests, and finally forms.

73
00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:55.622
I've added some sections on extra credit
as well, I'm not expecting to actually be

74
00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:59.230
able to follow these on today, but
you can read these on your own time.
