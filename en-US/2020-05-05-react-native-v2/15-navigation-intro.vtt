00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.952
So in our app, the next thing we'd really
want to do is add navigation to our app.

2
00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:06.221
And what we would like is,

3
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:09.523
we'd like to have multiple color
palettes that we can choose from.

4
00:00:09.523 --> 00:00:13.063
And we would like when you press on the
color palette, we would like to open a new

5
00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:15.871
screen where we can display
the details of the color palette.

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.892
That's basically what we want to get to.

7
00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:23.693
So in order to do that, we need to
add navigation into our application.

8
00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:27.946
You might be surprised to learn that
React Native actually has no navigation

9
00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:28.551
built in.

10
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:32.797
You get nothing from default,
you have to use a library.

11
00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:37.137
And this is actually because Facebook
themselves have their own really

12
00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.176
customized navigation
solutions that's highly

13
00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:42.864
coupled to how their application is built.

14
00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:46.369
So this is why they didn't
include it in React Native.

15
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.428
There are two main
libraries to choose from,

16
00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:53.869
they're called React Navigation and
React Native Navigation.

17
00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.848
In terms of functionality,
they're built by different people.

18
00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.614
But in terms of functionality,
they're pretty similar,

19
00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:00.952
they both do the same thing.

20
00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:02.990
I have used both of them.

21
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.758
The API on how we use them
is quite a bit different.

22
00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:10.938
React Native Navigation
used to be more performant,

23
00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.613
cuz it was hooking into the actual,
real native navigation,

24
00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:18.590
whereas React Navigation was more
JavaScript magic over the top.

25
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.461
Whereas recently,
in the last two releases, I think,

26
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:23.060
they are fully native as well.

27
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.078
So there's no performance
benefits between them.

28
00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:29.436
For this workshop, we're going to
be using React Navigation, and

29
00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:32.580
that is because this is
what's built into Expo.

30
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.118
Now this is where whether using Expo or
not kind of comes in.

31
00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:41.728
So if you're using Expo, and you don't
want to go out of your Expo safe space,

32
00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:46.745
you'll have to use React Navigation
because React Native Navigation

33
00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:50.930
has native dependencies that
you can't have by default.

34
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.718
So if you're using Expo and
you want to do React Native Navigation,

35
00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:56.584
you'll have to eject from Expo.

36
00:01:56.584 --> 00:02:01.266
And there's a chapter later on
that you can read more about it.
