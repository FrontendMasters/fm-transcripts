1
00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:02.320
All right,
now let's move on to part three.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.060
And let's add the two new color schemes.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.890
Now, I like to create a constant for
the color palettes.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.670
So we have each palette its own
item in this color palettes array.

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:24.526
So I'm just gonna copy this
over into our home component.

6
00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:31.120
And I'm going to copy the two
new colors over as well.

7
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.470
So they were in here.

8
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.963
Open up here.

9
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.789
Cool, so the RAINBOW and
the FRONTEND_MASTERS.

10
00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:00.011
All right, and now because we
are rendering a list of array,

11
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:03.990
I know that there's only three items
currently but it's going to be more.

12
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.324
And we're going to go ahead and
use a flat list.

13
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.363
So we'll import flat list.

14
00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:18.390
And let's put it.

15
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.130
Kinda nice to be here.

16
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.459
So let's do a flat list.

17
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:28.570
The data is going to be
the array of color palettes.

18
00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:38.390
The key extractor.

19
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:47.550
The item and I choose to use
the paletteName cuz this is unique for us.

20
00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:56.888
And finally for the render item,

21
00:01:56.888 --> 00:02:03.261
we'll just render the name
of the color palettes.

22
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.730
I'm going to copy the whole
touchable opacity that we had below.

23
00:02:18.164 --> 00:02:19.133
And now currently,

24
00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:23.030
they all say Solarized because I
haven't used the properties from item.

25
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.608
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
replace them.

26
00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:29.613
So and because paleteName and
colors are the same as these

27
00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:35.045
attributes on the object,
I can just pass in the entire item.

28
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:48.840
Cool.

29
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.667
So now, if we press on the separate ones,

30
00:02:55.053 --> 00:02:57.710
We get the separate color patch,
which is pretty cool.

31
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.600
And now for the last part,
we just like to update this ListView so

32
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.400
it displays a preview of all the colors
that we'll have in the palette.

33
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.680
Now, to do that, I think I just
like to create a new component

34
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.990
rather than doing everything
in the home component.

35
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.162
So let's just go ahead and do that.

36
00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:20.000
Let's go into our components directory.

37
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.554
What do I call it?

38
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.306
Let's call it palette preview.

39
00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:28.096
So let's create a new component in
components and call it palette preview.

40
00:03:34.698 --> 00:03:37.308
Now, in palette preview, as I always do,

41
00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:41.420
just create a Hello World
thing to display something.

42
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.700
So import React.

43
00:03:47.063 --> 00:03:50.701
And we import a view and a text.

44
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.068
And we create a constant
component called palette preview.

45
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.087
And we have it return a view and
some text.

46
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.988
And finally we export
it as a default export.

47
00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:34.560
Now, the first thing we should do is just
make the PalettePreview return what we

48
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.655
currently are returning.

49
00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:41.485
So currently we are returning
a TouchableOpacity with some text.

50
00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:43.435
So let's actually just go ahead and

51
00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:49.430
copy all of this that we had in
the render item in the Home.js.

52
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.020
And let's just copy it
to the PalettePreview.

53
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.160
Now, this has two dynamic
things that we're doing.

54
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.980
One is we display the palette name and
the actual color.

55
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.180
And the other thing is we
have an unpressed action.

56
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.220
So, what we'll like to do is
pass these in using props.

57
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.648
So let's add,
actually let's do this from Home.

58
00:05:11.648 --> 00:05:12.379
This might be easier.

59
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.943
So in home, import palette preview.

60
00:05:15.943 --> 00:05:19.484
So let's do imports
Palette previewed from,

61
00:05:19.484 --> 00:05:24.765
notice that the home directory is
if it's inside screens like it is.

62
00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:28.165
Now you have to go one directory
up to go to components.

63
00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:43.580
And so instead of the touchable opacity,
let's return this.

64
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.470
And as for props, what we want to do
is we want to pass in this navigation.

65
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.040
We'd like the navigation
prop isn't by default

66
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.780
available from pilot preview because
it's just a standalone component.

67
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.570
So we don't want the pilot preview itself
to do the navigation at this point because

68
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.090
there's no point so we're just going
to create an unpress this navigation.

69
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.743
So let's do unpress.

70
00:06:11.923 --> 00:06:14.232
It usually I do handle press, I think.

71
00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:19.580
And it's a function.

72
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.300
I did navigation like it did here.

73
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.212
And then the other thing we want
to pass in is the actual item.

74
00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:35.357
So let's just call it palette.

75
00:06:38.443 --> 00:06:42.240
So this will pass the whole item
including your item name and the colors.

76
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.363
Now we can get rid of
this TouchableOpacity.

77
00:06:48.094 --> 00:06:51.442
And this is complaining because we
don't have TouchableOpacity here

78
00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:52.640
in the PalettePreview.

79
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.425
So I'm going to import this.

80
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:05.190
And, right, so now we've parsed into
props called handle press and pallet.

81
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.922
Let's use them, so let's do handlePress.

82
00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:23.251
I'm gonna call this ColorPalette,
And ColorPalette.

83
00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:32.691
Then we can replace this with handlePress.

84
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.478
And finally.

85
00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:44.750
PalleteName you can get from
colorPalette paletteName.

86
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.050
Okay, so it's complaining
because I hadn't filled this.

87
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.740
I turned autosave off and
I've always have autosave on and so

88
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.220
it was complaining because
I hadn't saved home.

89
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.220
Cool.
So, now our render item has been updated

90
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.730
to use palette preview instead of passing
in two props one is handle press and

91
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.390
one is the actual color palette.

92
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.700
And then in the PalettePreview component.

93
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.880
We use these two props to,
we call handle press when the user presses

94
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.795
on the touchable opacity, and we display
the palette name dynamically in the text.

95
00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:19.423
So let's check that this still works.

96
00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:30.571
Nice and [INAUDIBLE] basically,

97
00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:34.800
we would like to add some style to that.

98
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.990
So like the headings here
are significantly bolder and

99
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.070
there's some padding.

100
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.903
So let's make these buttons
a little bit easier to press.

101
00:08:44.563 --> 00:08:48.193
If you remember to add styles,
we import style sheets.

102
00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:55.563
Let me create a constant for styles,

103
00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:59.080
the Stylesheet.create.

104
00:09:02.527 --> 00:09:05.039
All right, let's first add a.

105
00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:10.393
Let's add a text.

106
00:09:15.261 --> 00:09:20.656
Let's do font weight, bold,

107
00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:26.473
and let's do a font size of 18.

108
00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:36.152
And let's pass this in here.

109
00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:39.905
It's done.

110
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.170
Nice so this works but it's not quite
the same because we have padding here.

111
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.470
We don't have padding here.

112
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.835
So we should probably add padding to the
thing that contains our palette previews.

113
00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:55.330
So let's go home.

114
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.150
And let's add a stylesheet here as well.

115
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.711
So I'm going to remove these cuz they're
not used and import style sheet.

116
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:12.231
And create a style sheet
at the bottom of the file.

117
00:10:21.213 --> 00:10:26.913
I'm gonna call this list and
I'm just gonna

118
00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:31.853
give it padding, good padding 10.

119
00:10:38.845 --> 00:10:42.767
Right there, and the other thing
you might want to do is again,

120
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:46.911
the background for this is quite dark,
so if you don't like that,

121
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:49.655
I usually make the background color white.

122
00:10:56.435 --> 00:10:57.128
Nice.

123
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.930
Right, let's get those
little palettePreview boxes.

124
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.220
Now, because we're rendering multiple
things, we can use FlatList again.

125
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.780
Generally here you could get
away with just using a mouth,

126
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.320
because you know you're
rendering five things.

127
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.442
But generally it's good to just get
out of the habit of using a map and

128
00:11:19.442 --> 00:11:21.772
react native and just use a FlatList.

129
00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:27.910
So I'm going to add this
FlatList just under here.

130
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.920
All right, so what is our data for
the flattest going to be?

131
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.720
Well, we're going to take the colors from
the color palette, we want the first five.

132
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.889
So we're going to do color palette.

133
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.220
Slice, not splice, and

134
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:54.210
the first argument is where you'll want
to start the sub array, which is from 0,

135
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.776
and then the second one is
how many items you want.

136
00:11:57.776 --> 00:11:58.548
So line 5.

137
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.251
And next step we'll have the keyExtractor.

138
00:12:09.192 --> 00:12:10.990
Pass a new item.

139
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.950
And here we're gonna have
the actual colorPalette, so

140
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.540
we'll use the Color Palette, so
we actually have the colors.

141
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.115
So we'll use the color name.

142
00:12:24.115 --> 00:12:29.820
Okay, so that's all right, this is
colorPalette.colors.slice, there we go.

143
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.070
Yeah, so we'll have the actual color.

144
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.922
So we'll use the color name as the key.

145
00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:39.680
Nice.

146
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.200
And then finally in the render item,

147
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:47.093
let's just render out the name of
the color first and then go from that.

148
00:13:05.815 --> 00:13:09.980
Cool.

149
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.919
All right, so here, we are not going to
keep it like this but for now in the right

150
00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:17.340
item I am just taking the item and
then I am rendering the color name.

151
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.832
So I can see that this is working.

152
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:28.133
Now in order to make this, one thing
you'll notice that obviously here,

153
00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:31.760
we have colors displayed horizontally.

154
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.510
But here we have the vertically.

155
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:40.465
So thinking we used to horizontal, true.

156
00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:43.425
Yeah.
So, there's two ways to do it.

157
00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:44.995
You can do it with flex.

158
00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:50.045
I think in the example I've actually,
done it with using flex direction row,

159
00:13:50.045 --> 00:13:53.000
but you can,
because it's just a flat list.

160
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.297
You can actually just
use horizontal true and

161
00:13:55.297 --> 00:13:57.540
it automatically displays horizontally.

162
00:14:02.872 --> 00:14:03.372
Cool.

163
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.320
All right, next up,
we want to actually create the box.

164
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.278
So, in order to do this I'm going to,
instead of a rendering a text I'm going to

165
00:14:13.278 --> 00:14:19.497
render a view, And
I'm going to give it a style.

166
00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:26.785
Now, I already know that I'm going to
have two styles, one being dynamic and

167
00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:27.960
one not being dynamic.

168
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.450
So I'm going to start off with an array.

169
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.860
And then the first I want to use is
the background color for the box.

170
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.970
So let's do backgroundColor.

171
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:46.129
And the background color
will be item.hexCode.

172
00:14:50.453 --> 00:14:51.541
Go to import the view.

173
00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:57.404
Nice, and

174
00:14:57.404 --> 00:15:01.970
currently nothing appears because our
view doesn't have any height or width.

175
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.770
So let's add some styles to
give it a height and a width.

176
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:12.031
So let's do box,
let's do height 30 and width 30.

177
00:15:12.031 --> 00:15:18.570
And let's add these here.

178
00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.360
Cool this is showing up.

179
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.860
She's very nice, but
they're all squished together.

180
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.982
So I'm just gonna add
some margin on the right.

181
00:15:40.032 --> 00:15:44.514
I'm also going to add

182
00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:49.500
some of the top, yeah.

183
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.630
I'm going to add some like
spacing between these as well.

184
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:59.684
So let's add a little
bit between the text and

185
00:15:59.684 --> 00:16:02.482
the colors with margin.

186
00:16:07.022 --> 00:16:08.675
Cool, and it split out.

187
00:16:08.675 --> 00:16:09.741
And then.

188
00:16:12.914 --> 00:16:17.790
Finally we want to add some
margin between these two as well.

189
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:23.554
So let's just,
add some on the flat list itself,

190
00:16:23.554 --> 00:16:27.534
just do a style, styles.list and

191
00:16:27.534 --> 00:16:33.711
then create a style on list and
let's do marginBottom

192
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:38.560
maybe 20 Yeah, that looks good.

193
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.470
All right, so one thing you might have
noticed is that one of the front end

194
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.730
masters colors unfortunately white.

195
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.550
Which is the same color as our
background so it doesn't show up.

196
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.420
So what we'd like to kinda
do now is we would like to,

197
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.730
like create maybe a shadow or
something in order for this to show up.

198
00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.020
And thankfully, you can do that.

199
00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:03.120
Just here, so

200
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.240
there's fortunately you have to add
all the shadow properties separately.

201
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.622
So I'm just going to copy, copy these.

202
00:17:12.926 --> 00:17:15.980
So we just want to add these to the box.

203
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.591
I can see this adds a bit of color, which
is a bit of shadow, which is kind of nice.

204
00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:27.110
&gt;&gt; Do you know elevation in there?

205
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

206
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.410
So yeah, one step ahead of me.

207
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:36.700
So I was going to show so,
this does things on iOS,

208
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.410
but actually does nothing on Android.

209
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.230
So because Android doesn't as all
material design and in material design,

210
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.680
you don't have shadows.

211
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.504
But on Android, you can use
elevation instead, so if you do,

212
00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:55.920
elevation two and save,
then this actually show up.

213
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.092
It's a little bit hard to see on my
screen, maybe I can do elevation 10.

214
00:18:00.092 --> 00:18:03.316
It will show up here you can kind of
see a little shadow going on here.

215
00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:11.675
So I actually I think the reason that
this isn't looking the same as it did for

216
00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:16.855
me on my image is because in my image
I actually completely forgot that

217
00:18:16.855 --> 00:18:21.595
you could make the flex this horizontal
and I just use the flexDirection.

218
00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:26.845
So I think if I instead
get rid of horizontal and

219
00:18:26.845 --> 00:18:32.340
do flexDirection Row.

220
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.800
Actually all the shadows show up because
then we have all the spacing between them.

221
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.416
You can make this work in both ways.

222
00:18:45.761 --> 00:18:48.988
Yeah, so here, probably don't want 10.

223
00:19:02.051 --> 00:19:07.451
And you might want to actually go and take
this, all this shadowColor that we did,

224
00:19:07.451 --> 00:19:12.299
and also copy it to the color box that we
used in here to make sure that if we go

225
00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.847
to the Frontend Masters here
this white will show up.

226
00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:24.390
So let's go to color box and
go to the actual box styles.

227
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.160
And then just paste the same colors in.

228
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.729
And now you can see that the white
is kind of highlighted and

229
00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:30.419
it shows up very nicely on the screen.
