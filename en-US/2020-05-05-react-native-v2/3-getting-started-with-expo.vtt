00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.220
So, some of you have already set
up your Expo environment and

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.098
if you have that's great.

3
00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:08.922
But I'm just gonna run this
through from scratch, so

4
00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:11.130
we can do it together if you haven't yet.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.940
Cool, so find a good place.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.513
Yeah, so first thing, basically,

7
00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:23.640
I always refer to the React Native docs or
Expo docs.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.760
Like these React Native docs
particularly are the bread and butter.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.560
I use them all the time.

10
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.070
And the best guides in my
opinion are these Quickstarts?

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.086
So I always use these because they update
these whenever they release new versions.

12
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.080
Cool, so
basically what we are doing is this.

13
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.430
So we'll need a computer,
a smartphone and node.

14
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.743
If you already have node installed,
that's great.

15
00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:52.610
If you don't, you'll have to install it.

16
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.160
You can check if you already have node
installed by typing node that actually

17
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.320
into your terminal.

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.080
If it returns the node version number,
you're golden.

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.970
If not, you might have to go and
install it.

20
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.400
And if you need to install node,
you just go send node website and

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.220
download this here.

22
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.350
I always go for the LTS version,
LTS stands for long term support.

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.320
So generally the even numbers were
node our long term supports and

24
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.290
the odd ones are not.

25
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.166
Cool, alright, so next thing we
do is we install the expo-cli and

26
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.880
we install this globally so we could have

27
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.816
the expo-cli command available for
us everywhere.

28
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.835
Depending on your internet
connection this might take sometime.

29
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.157
Cool, we're done, right.

30
00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:47.200
And now we're just gonna
initialize our project.

31
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.026
So let's do expo init and
then your project name, so

32
00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:56.315
I'm gonna name mine, AwesomeProjectExpo.

33
00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:02.787
Right and you'll get some options here.

34
00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:08.644
And you can have a TypeScript, if you're
TypeScript fan, you can have TypeScript

35
00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:14.330
already added and you can also have
react navigation or the pre configured.

36
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.080
We're going to address react
navigation ourselves later.

37
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.830
So we're just gonna go with
the most blank template.

38
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.790
So now, you can use yarn.

39
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.770
If you have yarn installed or just, I

40
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.330
think it's actually npm run start,
I'm gonna have to fix my documentation.

41
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.580
Cool so this opens to the package m,
now we're halfway there.

42
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.660
So now what you do,
is you're going to be using your phone.

43
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.830
You can take your phone, fact, I'm gonna
mirror mine so you can see what I'm up to.

44
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.380
So I'm gonna go to the App Store,
and if your App Store.

45
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.559
If you're on Google, go on Google Play and
then just search for Expo.

46
00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:04.900
And we'll have an application that looks
like this, it's called the Expo Client.

47
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.440
And install it if you're done
already otherwise you can open it.

48
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.340
You might have to log in as well.

49
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.040
Cool, so now we have this installed and
now notice that this

50
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.050
debug screen that Expo launched for
us has this handy QR code.

51
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.776
So what we do now is,
if you're on an Android phone,

52
00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:29.032
there will be a button on your
screen that says scan QR code.

53
00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:33.380
But if you're on an iOS phone, like me,
What you do is you open the camera app.

54
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.865
And it will give you a little push like
push notification that tells you to open

55
00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:39.785
the app in Expo.

56
00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.835
Now you can see in the bottom it
says building JavaScript bundle,

57
00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:43.950
this is actually here.

58
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.019
This is what it's doing, cool and that's
basically our hello world application,

59
00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.050
lets have a look at the folders
structure that is created

60
00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:04.290
So this is all this creative
which is actually not a lot.

61
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.090
If you're already
familiar with JavaScript,

62
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.920
you definitely know node modules.

63
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.959
So node modules is basically where all
the many modules that have installed for

64
00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.909
Expo and for React Native,
then we have this assets directory.

65
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.760
So notice this was the screen that we
had earlier while Expo was building.

66
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.720
And this is basically where you
can add all the assets that

67
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.559
you want to include the applications,
any images, any funds, any icons.

68
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.890
And then these two are just expo specific,

69
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.110
little folders that you can
pretty much just ignore for now.

70
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.920
Then we have some babel and
app configs, which we can also ignore.

71
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.706
The main thing, the only thing that
we really care about here is this,

72
00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:52.631
which is our App.js, which is where
we'll start writing all our code.
