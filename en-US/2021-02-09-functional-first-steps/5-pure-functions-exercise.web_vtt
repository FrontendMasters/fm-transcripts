00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.223
Now that we talked a bunch
about what is a pure function,

2
00:00:03.223 --> 00:00:04.612
what is not a pure function.

3
00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:06.349
We're gonna put this into practice.

4
00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:10.420
So, we're going to look at some code and
we're going to assess which functions

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.180
are pure and which ones are not,
and think about why.

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.718
So, in the next notebook
in this collection,

7
00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:24.510
which we can access right here,
pure functions exercise.

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.070
You have your first observable notebook
that I'm gonna encourage you to play with.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.549
So this is an exercise where you
get to look at some code and

10
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.850
then decide for each one,
whether it's pure or not pure.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.927
And when you think you're
set on the answer,

12
00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:48.794
you can click the reveal answer button.

13
00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:53.550
And you will find out, and there's
also a little bit of an explanation.

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.770
So you can think about why.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.800
And make sure that that matches up
with your understanding of why each

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.265
function is pure or not.

17
00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:07.320
And you will see those answers show
up as soon as you hit those buttons.

18
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.119
And also this code, what we're
looking at here, this is live code.

19
00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.630
So you can edit it if you want to.

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.359
But in this case, just to make sure we're
all on the same page about which functions

21
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.280
we're talking about, and how they behave.

22
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.864
We are probably not gonna want
to edit any of this code.

23
00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:25.658
Just because,

24
00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:29.753
right now, we're just gonna make sure
check our understanding of purity, and

25
00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:33.990
make sure that we're all on the same page
about what's pure and what's not pure.

26
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.860
So you can go to this exercise,
pure functions.

27
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.876
And again, if you'd like to make
a copy of any of the notebooks that

28
00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:49.531
we look at today, you can go to this
three dots menu and hit the fork button.

29
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:51.739
And you may need to sign up for
an observable account.

30
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.811
Again, it's free,
uses existing logins that you have.

31
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:59.140
But then you will have one in your
own account that you can mess with

32
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.404
however you want.

33
00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:03.726
But you don't need to do that for
this case, you don't need to sign up for

34
00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:04.284
anything.

35
00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:08.870
You can just hit those buttons and see
the updates happen live in your browser.
