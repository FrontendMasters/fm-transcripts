[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:42.235
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
I've been working as a developer for

3
00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:47.140
the past eight years and
it's a job that I find really rewarding.

4
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.530
Cuz I feel like I get to go to work and
solve problems.

5
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.670
And I find it really fun and
so I'm hoping to share this,

6
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.400
some of the skill set with you.

7
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.290
We're kind of scratching the surface, but
it's going to be enough for you guys to

8
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.280
kind of get a grasp of everything and
know enough to know how to find more

9
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.930
information and how to learn some of these
things in a more in depth kind of way.

10
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.830
So the first thing that we're
gonna talk about is our tool set.

11
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.053
And it's really, really important and why?

12
00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:20.160
It's because the tools of our
trade are designed to help us.

13
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.820
To help us solve problems,
to help us do things faster, and

14
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.360
you need a good text editor and
a way to debug HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

15
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.940
And there are lots of browsers
out there but Chrome is kind of,

16
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.970
it's the one that's really
geared towards developers.

17
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.580
It's much easier to find your way around.

18
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.210
The developer tools are built-in,
unlike some of the other browsers.

19
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.440
And the text editor we'll be
using today is Sublime Text.

20
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.720
But you can use any editor of your choice.

21
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.310
So the reason we use a text
editor that's specific for

22
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.440
code is because we have
syntax highlighting for

23
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.150
all the different programming
languages that we use, HTML, CSS.

24
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.660
So, in this example,

25
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.460
the brackets are highlighted in
a different color, and the string,

26
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.610
which is the thing between those quotes,
is a different color as well.

27
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.850
And that's a visual indicator
that things are correct.

28
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.930
And so your brackets have to match up.

29
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.650
And so if they're colored, it's much
easier to see if you've missed something.

30
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.070
Same with your parenthesis.

31
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.860
So Sublime text has a great feature.

32
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.400
Where your parenthesis, when they match up
they will be highlighted, so if you type

33
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.470
parenthesis into Sublime text, it will put
underscores underneath the matching pairs.

34
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.890
So in the example above we have an extra
parenthasy with no match and so when

35
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.290
we type it and put our cursor on it, we'll
see that no other parenthesis highlighted.

36
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.810
It also has a great tool
called replace all, so for

37
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.430
example if you wanna change
a string in a whole block of text,

38
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.290
you can go to edit and replace type
in your new thing, hit replace all,

39
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.420
and it'll find all of the instances and
swap them out for you.

40
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.231
So, we're gonna use Chrome
to debug our web pages, and

41
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.970
if you guys could visit google.com and

42
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.199
right click anywhere that's not an image,
and click on View Page Source.

43
00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:50.977
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
when you guys do that,

44
00:03:50.977 --> 00:03:52.700
you're gonna get something like this.

45
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.720
And it's like whoa,
what is all this stuff?

46
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.730
There's a bunch of numbers,
not a ton of words.

47
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.230
It's not really clear at all.

48
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.130
So a better way of debugging a page.

49
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.728
And you guys cant try this
out by right clicking on

50
00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:14.001
the Google image and
going to inspect element

51
00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:21.580
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,

52
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.726
that's much better.

53
00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:29.820
So by doing this, you're scrolling right
into the source of the code that does

54
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.870
the specific thing and so
here you can see it's an image tag which

55
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.240
we'll talk about later but there's also
a link to the image that's being used and

56
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.430
if we hover over that link,
we'll see the Google logo.

57
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.840
So a great thing about Chrome is
that you can actually go ahead and

58
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.520
update the values.

59
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.480
So, if you have this up here,
you'll see that there's a height tag.

60
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.630
You can double click on it and
update the value.

61
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.540
So you can enter new value,
press Enter and you'll see your changes.

62
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.150
So one thing to note about this is
these changes are only on your computer

63
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.215
if you refresh the page you'll lose them.

64
00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:23.301
So.

65
00:05:26.623 --> 00:05:31.510
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's try and
change the Google logo.

66
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.571
So we're going to navigate to google.com,

67
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:40.020
we're going to right-click and
inspect the google image element.

68
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.089
And then we're gonna set the width to 700,
and the height to 30.

69
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.210
So I'll go ahead and
do that with you guys.

70
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.813
&gt;&gt; Student: You just have

71
00:05:51.813 --> 00:05:56.000
to go back.

72
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.205
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Back.
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah [INAUDIBLE].

73
00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:01.009
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Is that fine?

74
00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:01.967
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

75
00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:05.113
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
so we got google.com,

76
00:06:05.113 --> 00:06:10.140
we're going to right click,
inspect element.

77
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.440
It'll pop up this console here and

78
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.090
let me make this text size bigger so
that you can see it.

79
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.710
So we're going to double
click in the height.

80
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.209
Change that value to 30.

81
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.459
And double click in the width and
set that value to 700 and press Enter.

82
00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:33.054
And you guys should see
something like this.

83
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.700
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Is everyone see that?

84
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.715
Does anyone need help?

85
00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:40.860
&gt;&gt; Student: [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay.

86
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.752
Great

87
00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:56.930
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
so that was our result.

88
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.440
The other great thing about Chrome is it
has something called a Javascript Console

89
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.820
which we'll be using
a lot later in the class.

90
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.123
And to do that, you go to View,
Developer, and Javascript Consoles.

91
00:07:13.292 --> 00:07:15.615
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,
can everyone open that up?

92
00:07:24.272 --> 00:07:28.685
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So it's View,
Developer, and JavaScript Console.

93
00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:33.830
For the purpose of this class,
it would be nice to

94
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.500
open that up in a brand new tab so that if
there's anything going on with the webpage

95
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.070
that you have this consult open on,
it's not interfering with your work.

96
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.367
For example, like Google here so

97
00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:53.869
this is totally fine we
can just go in here and

98
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:57.897
press Enter a few times to clear it out.

99
00:07:57.897 --> 00:08:02.943
&gt;&gt; Student: [INAUDIBLE] On the top left.

100
00:08:02.943 --> 00:08:04.646
No top left yeah there we go.

101
00:08:04.646 --> 00:08:05.660
That was-
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: This?

102
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.477
There we go.

103
00:08:07.477 --> 00:08:10.840
Yup, you can hit this right
here to clear out your console.

104
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.770
So we're going to type something
out here and see our result.

105
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:21.410
So let's type console.log,

106
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:27.500
and in the process, this developer
console should be giving you hints.

107
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.621
So as you type you'll
see things that match.

108
00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:34.411
And then we're gonna put a quote and

109
00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:38.882
Hello World match that quote and
match that parenthesy.

110
00:08:43.882 --> 00:08:46.428
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Once you have that and
you hit Enter,

111
00:08:46.428 --> 00:08:51.205
if you scroll up you'll see that
Hello World was printed right here.

112
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:10.420
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So the other thing
that we'll be using the console for

113
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.230
a lot is if you have an error
in your Javascript files.

114
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.680
You'll see an indicator here
in the developer toolbar.

115
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.800
It'll show a big red X.

116
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.700
And the number of errors that you have.
