2
00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're just
gonna go over a handful.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.270
There's a ton of CSS properties.

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.242
Ton, ton, ton, ton.

5
00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.584
And there's good resources on it.

6
00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.369
We talked a little bit about the MDN.

7
00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.829
MDN's great for CSS.

8
00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.073
Again, stands for
the Mozilla Developer Network.

9
00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:24.612
It's like the bible of
front-end web development.

10
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:29.815
If it says it in the MDN, it's truth.

11
00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.453
CodePen, the creator has
another site called CSS Tricks.

12
00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:38.318
He has a glossary of CSS, super useful.

13
00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:40.440
The MDN gets really technical sometimes.

14
00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:45.150
And CSS Tricks is really good at
putting it like, in layman's terms and

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.650
giving examples, and stuff like that.

16
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.260
So, for CSS, I highly recommend Chris
Coyer's website, which is CSS Tricks.

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.530
Okay, so, let's talk about some
ways just to modify text, right?

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.730
And there's umpteen billion.

19
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.170
This is just some of the highlights.

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.500
Color, think you can kind
of figure that one out.

21
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.220
It modifies the text color.

22
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.850
Font weight.

23
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.380
So, you can say normal, and
that'll be like just normal text.

24
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.370
If you say bold,
then it'll bold your text for you, right?

25
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.460
So, that's kind of what font weight does.

26
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.162
You can also give it numbers.

27
00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:25.166
Again, something you'll discover is
there's many ways to do this and

28
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:29.118
just kinda pick your favorite,
whatever makes the most sense to you.

29
00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:35.108
So font-weight,
if you say 900 I think, that's bold.

30
00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:38.880
Whereas if you give 100,
it's really thin text.

31
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.980
But not every font has it.

32
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.450
Anyway, we're not talking
about fonts right now.

33
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.970
Anyway, but that's what font weight is,
I'll just stick to normal and

34
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.925
bold, that's what I do.

35
00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:53.375
Font-style, you can have normal or italic,
if you wanna make your text italicized.

36
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:58.540
Text-align, so we talked about like
divs being like containers, right?

37
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.740
If you wanted to bump up against the left
side versus bump up versus the right side

38
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.350
or you want it to center.

39
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.625
That's what text-align is.

40
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.627
Text-indent, so
if you have a paragraph but

41
00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:13.078
you don't want to move all the text over,
you just wanna move the first line over,

42
00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:16.510
kind a like paragraphs
having indentations.

43
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.310
That's what text-indent does.

44
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.430
And you just gives us like I want
you to indent like 20 pixels.

45
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.010
So it'll just indent that
first line like 20 pixels.

46
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.976
And then font-size.

47
00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:31.145
Again, this is just like,
I want really small text so

48
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:34.400
I say be nine pixels tall, right?

49
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.693
Or I want you to be really huge,
so be 40 pixels.

50
00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:47.544
And we're gonna go over
units of measurements

51
00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:54.453
here in just a sec so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like right now,

52
00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:55.600
I feel like I do that a lot.

53
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.540
Measurements, so, CSS has a whole bunch of
different measurements for legacy reasons.

54
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.570
And you look,
you'll see that legacy reasons,

55
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.850
reason very often,
like the reason why JavaScript has so

56
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.910
many weird things about it
is that they're trying to be

57
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.390
compatible with code all the way back
from the 90s which is just a huge pain.

58
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.379
But then CSS has kind of the same issue,
right?

59
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.579
So, there are pixels, points, ems, exs,
rems, inches, millimeters, centimeters and

60
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.460
I don't think I'm even covering them all.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just a total mess, right?

61
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.320
Totally different ways of measuring
things, so for font size, I can say it's

62
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.180
ten pixels tall or I can say it's two
ems or I can say it's three exs or

63
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.310
I can say it's four rems or
three inches or two millimeters.

64
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.830
All of those are valid and they will work.

65
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.100
Which one do you use then
is the correct question,

66
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.580
and the answer is there are a few.

67
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.510
So for example, don't use points,
don't use inches,

68
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.400
don't use millimeters,
don't use centimeters.

69
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.150
Those are all like super old,
no one uses them.

70
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.510
They were more for
print anyway as opposed to the web,

71
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.120
because CSS has also been used for

72
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.670
print stuff like setting up magazines and
newspapers and stuff like that.

73
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.770
So and as far as like,
you can use pixels, you can use ems,

74
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.710
and rem is kind of new, but
also kind of useful as well.

75
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.710
And they have different usefulnesses.

76
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.219
So pixels is kind of the defacto
standard for most things.

77
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.850
It's not actually a real pixel, just so

78
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.820
you know, it's just an arbitrary unit
that they've just called a pixel.

79
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.640
Which is good because a pixel on
an iPhone is very, very small, right?

80
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.260
So if you said it was ten pixels on an
iPhone, it would be like this big, right?

81
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.160
Whereas if you were on a big desktop,
or even worse, like an old CRT monitor,

82
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.390
it would be like this big.

83
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.160
Not really but it'd be much larger.

84
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.826
So it's kind of up to each
individual manufacturer to make

85
00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:14.744
sure that a pixel looks
good on their own screen.

86
00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:19.185
That being said,
text can't be much smaller than nine,

87
00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:22.793
eight, nine,
probably seven the smallest or

88
00:05:22.793 --> 00:05:27.617
it's not readable after that point,
so just kinda as an FYI.

89
00:05:27.617 --> 00:05:29.650
Ems are relative.

90
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.920
Won't talk too much about it but
what it is, is you have a font, right, and

91
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.270
every font is different.

92
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.810
And is the size of one.

93
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.629
The letter m, right,
a lowercase m, how wide it is.

94
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.891
So it's a relative measurement of unit.

95
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:52.742
So let's say you have an image and
then when make the text different sizes,

96
00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:55.899
you want the image image
to resize with the text so

97
00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:00.533
it's always the same relative height or
width or something like that.

98
00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:01.989
You would use an right,

99
00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:05.409
because an is always relative to
the font size of wherever it is.

100
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.860
And ex, just so you know,

101
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.170
is the height of a lowercase x,
whereas like an is the width.

102
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.010
Ex is not super well-supported so
just stick to for the most part.

103
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.600
Rem is a root.

104
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.986
So can kind of be convoluted
a little bit because if like you

105
00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:27.996
have like a body that's like three ems and

106
00:06:27.996 --> 00:06:32.912
then you have like a paragraph
inside the body that's like two ems.

107
00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:37.017
It has this kind of elastic
width that kind of happens,

108
00:06:37.017 --> 00:06:41.942
right, because it's relative
to something that's relative.

109
00:06:41.942 --> 00:06:42.878
Does that kinda make sense?

110
00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:44.262
If it doesn't, it's totally cool.

111
00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:48.119
But just so you know,
if you nest measurements,

112
00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.376
they get kind of out of whack.

113
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.234
And that's what rem is.

114
00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:52.615
It's root ems.

115
00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:56.694
So it's like, when the page loads,
how big was right?

116
00:06:56.694 --> 00:06:58.370
And then base everything off of that.

117
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.740
So it's,
you kind of lose that elastic effect.

118
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.398
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Is that for

119
00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:07.687
kind of responsive type designs?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so responsive design

120
00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:13.639
is like when you're trying to make
things work on desktop, tablet, mobile.

121
00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:20.161
Yeah, so it's for that, and
ems are very useful in trying to do that.

122
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:26.025
And the measurement of good question,

123
00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:30.900
yeah?
&gt;&gt; Student 2: So if we want our CSS to be

124
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.730
responsive, we need to use
a certain one of those or

125
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.240
what?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not necessarily.

126
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.860
Again, kind of a little bit
beyond the scope of this class.

127
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.606
But it'll be a combination.

128
00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:47.714
Just certain things make sense
in certain measurements, right?

129
00:07:47.714 --> 00:07:51.905
Very rarely are you gonna do widths and
ems,

130
00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:59.276
widths are nearly always going to be
pixels, but text sizes are often in ems.

131
00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:01.841
So, they're different tools for
different jobs and

132
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:06.544
it's kind of hard to blanket them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'd

133
00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:09.157
say when in doubt use pixels.

134
00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:15.468
That's a pretty good rule of thumb.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Default to pixels and

135
00:08:15.468 --> 00:08:20.544
then if you know better like,
I'm doing font sizes,

136
00:08:20.544 --> 00:08:24.769
I should probably use ems,
then you use that.

137
00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:31.041
Okay, yeah, so pixels, while not
necessarily uniform across browsers,

138
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.765
it will be uniform across your page,
right?

139
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.502
So you're not gonna have one pixel
that's wider then the other if you're in

140
00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:38.180
Chrome, right?

141
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.250
But Chrome might be a little
bit different then Firefox.

142
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.560
And in particular,
phones are gonna be different than normal

143
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.967
browsers.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Ems,

144
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:53.568
it's how wide the literal lowercase
m is in the current font,

145
00:08:53.568 --> 00:08:57.030
and it's good for
sizes that scale with font.
