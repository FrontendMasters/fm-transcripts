[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna get into
something a little complicated right now.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.140
It's called the box model.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.780
That's kind of like how CSS is based on.

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.680
It's like boxes that kind
of flow next to each other.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.350
Also called like document flow or
something like that.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.170
So there are a lot of CSS properties
that specifically affect boxes.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.504
The most obvious of that is going
to be width and height, right.

9
00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:35.031
So if I tell something
you're only 300 pixels wide,

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.591
it's gonna make itself 300 pixels.

11
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.857
And if I have text in there, the text
is going to flow inside of it, right,

12
00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:44.181
it's gonna flow to that constraint,
like you're text is not gonna try and

13
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:46.873
extend outside of it,
it's gonna stay within its parent's

14
00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:50.958
constraints.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's kinda weird to

15
00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.310
explain, but I think it kinda makes
sense once you start actually doing it.

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.170
So border's one of those, you're telling
it to put a border please around my box.

17
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.802
So all those are valid borders,
one pixel solid black,

18
00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:07.158
three pixels dashed gray,
five pixels dotted, and

19
00:01:07.158 --> 00:01:10.106
then like a hex number, right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the border go on

20
00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:11.290
the outside of the box?

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.590
Or does it flow into the box?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

22
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260
that's a really interesting question.

23
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.080
Let me see if my next slide is that.

24
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.860
Yeah, we'll talk about
that in just one second.

25
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620
That hex right there's purple,
in case you're wondering.

26
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.680
Background color, you're saying,

27
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.090
I have this box, I want the inside of
my box to be this particular color.

28
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.160
Background image.

29
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.370
So say, I like to make
an annoying tiled background or

30
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.620
something like that, then you can
use background image for that.

31
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.010
So, let's talk about widths, heights,
borders everything like that.

32
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.390
It's complicated right, so
just so you know, if this doesn't

33
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.940
initially make sense work on it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Will border box be

34
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.190
covered?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll mention it right now.

35
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.880
Yeah we'll talk a little bit about it.

36
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.250
Sure.

37
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.750
Let's talk.

38
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.670
So this is the box model.

39
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.290
So first thing you have is height and
width in the interior there, right?

40
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.420
Don't worry about background color.

41
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.510
The background color will just only
cover what's inside of there, right?

42
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.040
So height and width.

43
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.900
That's just saying, here's my container
and it is like this big, right?

44
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.380
Then outside of your width and height,

45
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.160
and right now we're talking about
content box versus border box, so

46
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.100
I'll address border box in just a second.

47
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.860
But if you don't tell CSS to do anything
differently it assumes what you want is

48
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.389
content box, which is this model that
I'm showing you right here, okay.

49
00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.560
So, you have height and width and
then on top of the height and width,

50
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.240
so say I have 100 pixels and
100 pixels and that's my square, right.

51
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.132
Then I say I have ten more pixels of
padding on every side, it will go outside

52
00:03:10.132 --> 00:03:15.723
of that and it'll be, you have your 100
and now you have 120 by 120, right,

53
00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:20.510
cuz you have ten pixels on either side
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

54
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.000
that's the padding, that padding
is what's immediately around it.

55
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.080
And then outside of your padding
is where your border goes, okay.

56
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.530
So say like I have like border
three pixel solid black, okay.

57
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.123
So then I have like a border left,
a border top, a border right and

58
00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:36.452
a border bottom of three pixels.

59
00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:41.772
So now I have 126 by 126 pixels right.

60
00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:46.950
If it seems weird it is, okay?

61
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.970
And then outside of the border
then you can tell like

62
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.160
I want you to be this far away
from anything else right.

63
00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.470
So, I want you to be ten pixels away
from like my nearest container.

64
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.540
So you say I want 10 pixels on every side.

65
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.751
So then it pushes all the content
away from a ten pixels on any side.

66
00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:09.940
That kind of make sense?

67
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.630
Okay.

68
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.020
The model that I just described to
you is known as content box and

69
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.210
it's a huge pain in the ass,
giant pain in the ass.

70
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.930
Recently they came up with something
called border box that makes a little bit

71
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.970
more sense.

72
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.380
And the biggest difference is,
if I say my content is

73
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.560
a 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall,
that includes both border and padding.

74
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.810
So using this,
in fact I'll go to my mouse.

75
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.800
So using this particular,
if we say make this border box,

76
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.690
width is now up here and
height is now down here and it includes.

77
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.382
So if I say,
I have a 100 pixels by a 100 pixels,

78
00:05:01.382 --> 00:05:06.800
and I have ten pixels of padding,
the ten pixels in padding go inside of it.

79
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.860
And now actually your content only
has 80 pixels to fit in, right?

80
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.420
As opposed to going on the outside.

81
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.960
And you have a 100 pixels
to fit your content in, but

82
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.400
your box is actually 120 pixels wide.

83
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.350
Why is this easier?

84
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.690
Because if you're trying to do relative
widths, because you can do like,

85
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.110
I want you to take up 80% of your width.

86
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.130
Having the padding outside
of that 80% made it just

87
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.420
a giant pain in the ass right.

88
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.816
You had to like, if I wanted to make my,
like I had two containers one was 80% and

89
00:05:39.816 --> 00:05:45.312
one was 20%, I had to account for
padding and border on top of that.

90
00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:51.153
So, I had to be 78.3% wide
plus my padding, right.

91
00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:54.030
It just made it like
the math just horrendous.

92
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.770
So, you can say things like I want you
to measure in terms of border box.

93
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.270
And then you just say 80%,
20% it just fits.

94
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.670
That's the big difference.

95
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.640
It's extremely useful.

96
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.200
I recommend just putting
everything in a border box.

97
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.990
Particularly, if you wanna do responsive.

98
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.550
This bit is huge if you are trying to do

99
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.461
responsive web design.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think you mentioned

100
00:06:15.461 --> 00:06:16.990
document flow earlier.

101
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.060
Can you just explain that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

102
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.978
We're gonna talk about
that when we go to flows.

103
00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:21.644
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

104
00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:22.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so it's coming up

105
00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:29.330
super soon.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool any questions about

106
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.504
border box, content box,
widths, heights, borders?

107
00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:38.764
This is kinda like,
it's like clear as mud, probably, right.

108
00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.704
It's kind of convoluted to
speak on a theoretical level.

109
00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:45.610
It kind of just makes sense
as you keep going with it.

110
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.290
And if you mix up padding and
margin, don't worry.

111
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.260
Everyone does.

112
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.143
It's cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

113
00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:58.040
further questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I have a question about

114
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.720
bordering.

115
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.520
So when you put the CSS
probably in values,

116
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.620
does it matter the order
that you place them?

117
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.690
Say, you put background on top or,

118
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.250
and while you keep on adding it,
it gets pushed down to the bottom.

119
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.360
Is there a specific order that you have to

120
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.510
maintain while?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No.

121
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The rendering doesn't make

122
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.759
a difference?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes no difference.

123
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.960
The only difference is I repeat the value,
right?

124
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.170
If I say padding ten pixels, and then I
say padding 30 pixels right after it.

125
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.684
The 30 pixel one will be honored
because it's the last one in there.

126
00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:36.672
Other than that, like, if I wanna have
like font color and font weight in there,

127
00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:39.970
it makes no difference if I put color
first or if I put color second.
