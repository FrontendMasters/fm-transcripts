[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:07.708
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Should you be able
to scroll down to see the rest or

3
00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:12.896
is it just like?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you did overflow:

4
00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:19.160
auto or scroll, like that really small.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.352
Let it scroll.
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Okay.

6
00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:24.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whatever you want.

7
00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.489
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I hate scrolling so

8
00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.082
I typically don't like to have scroll

9
00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:35.810
bars.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about this?

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.559
Did we for the most part get this?

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.440
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Female Student: I just got a question

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.260
about the form actually in the CSS file.

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.520
Somebody once told me
that there is a certain

14
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.930
way the attributes need to be listed in.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.167
the order of the HTML file?
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Yeah.

16
00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:58.455
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean so,

17
00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:02.186
the answer is technically no.

18
00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:05.782
Technically, the browser doesn't
care if you say color green, and

19
00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:07.270
then patting ten pixels, or

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.430
patting ten pixels and then color green.
&gt;&gt; Female Student: It has more to

21
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.097
do with somebody else reading the code.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

22
00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:17.236
that's just kind of a preference thing,
it's kind of a stylistic thing.

23
00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:21.290
If your team adheres to one or
you want to adhere to one,

24
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.410
then go right ahead.
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Okay.

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.280
I didn't know if there was a standard.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's not.

26
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.260
There's no standard to it.

27
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.380
I'm pretty lazy about it.

28
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.210
But I just wanna write my code as
fast as possible and be done with it.

29
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.420
I haven't found ordering them
a particular way has been helpful at all,

30
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.680
I find it took me more time
than it was saving me.

31
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.990
I guess,

32
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.460
it's kind of my limitless test as I might
saving more time than I'm spending, right?

33
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.330
So, if I could save me a ton of time down
the road, then I would be all over it.

34
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.598
But the fact that I'm spending
a ton of time right now for

35
00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:58.387
no savings later.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: The question

36
00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:00.908
I was checking,
how could use inline-block instead of

37
00:02:00.908 --> 00:02:04.200
float?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

38
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.120
we haven't really talked
about inline-block.

39
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.121
We've talked about this
block level elements and

40
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.986
we've talked about inline elements, right?

41
00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:15.490
We have not talked about inline-block.

42
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.900
We're going over there's many ways
to skin a cat kind of idea, right.

43
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.329
There's many ways to do this.

44
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.310
So, let's do it without floats.

45
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.270
So now, we have these around
the same different lines, right?

46
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.025
And now we can say, I hate that,
we're gonna say display

47
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:40.479
inline-block.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

48
00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.820
then you're gonna have to
save margin zero, I think.

49
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.080
Yeah, so I mean we're close, probably
if I said 24% it would do it correctly.

50
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.918
What inline-block is doing is it's gonna
treat it like an inline element, right?

51
00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:09.600
Like an image or a span or
something like that.

52
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.705
You're changing the way that
the CSS is going to treat it.

53
00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:17.443
Inline-block is kind of a hybrid between
block level elements, like divs, and

54
00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:19.196
inline elements like spans.

55
00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:22.903
And there's kind of this hybrid approach
called inline block that it's going to

56
00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:27.220
trigger like an inline, mean it's gonna
try and treat essentially like text.

57
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.200
But it's going to respect width and height
and padding and all that stuffs because

58
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.720
if you try to get like spans, like width
through height, it just ignores them.

59
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.458
Right?
It doesn't know what to do with them but

60
00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:43.010
inline-blocks, it will actually try and
respect your widths and heights.

61
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.180
And, I'm sure there is a way to get
rid of the spacing here between them,

62
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.710
I can't remember off the top of my head.

63
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.583
So, floating's easier I think,
personally, but it's kind of up to you,

64
00:03:55.583 --> 00:04:02.769
whatever you wanna do.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

65
00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.360
So, since we are on the subject,
display has a lot of uses,

66
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.280
you can say display none,
it's an easy way to hide stuff, right?

67
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.130
I just hid all the picture groups.

68
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.789
Let's get rid of this and
say go back to flow left.

69
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.450
Get rid of this.

70
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.460
Put that back in.

71
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.430
Okay.

72
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.900
So if I said,
I no longer want any images ever to show.

73
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.240
I'd say image display none.

74
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.960
Okay all images are now going to go away.

75
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.490
The browser treats them
as if there not there.

76
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.430
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Do they get sent

77
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.510
to the browser from the server, still?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Are you

78
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.020
talking about the images themselves?
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Yeah.

79
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It will not absolutely

80
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.990
overflow the images.

81
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.350
The browser is smart enough that
it has display none on them,

82
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.520
it will not actually load those images.

83
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.100
As soon as you actually make them visible,
then it'll actually go out,

84
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.102
fetch those images and bring them back.

85
00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.959
Yeah.
So they will exist in your HTML but

86
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.670
they will not affect document flow.

87
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.180
As you noticed, the text pushed up, right?

88
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.660
Let's say I wanted the text
actually stay where it was, right?

89
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.981
There's a property called visibility,
and you say hidden.

90
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:24.122
&gt;&gt; Female Student: [COUGH]

91
00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:25.515
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What that means is I want

92
00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:28.647
you to still exist,
I want you to still take up space,

93
00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:32.580
I just don't want you to
actually show anything.

94
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.010
Right?
In this case the image just appeared but

95
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.950
it is still actually
taking up that same space.

96
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.513
Kinda weird but occasionally it is useful,

97
00:05:40.513 --> 00:05:46.600
so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

98
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.580
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: What's the order that

99
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.500
the HTML and the CSS is loaded, because
isn't it walking the dog while it's

100
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.830
loading the CSS?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [COUGH] So

101
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.670
HTML is always loaded first, definitely.

102
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.990
Then your HTML, or
sorry your HTML is always loaded first,

103
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.080
then in your head element you
should have all of your CSS,

104
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.510
like we showed you that head block row,
that's where you stick your CSS.

105
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.750
And then that will actually be applied
right there so that you don't get that,

106
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.730
what's called flash fun style content.

107
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.400
Then after that, if you put your
JavaScript at the bottom of your body

108
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.250
tag like you should,
then the JavaScript is then executed.

109
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.130
But really the HTML is always loaded
first, like that's just a given.

110
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.880
Then after that,
it is up to you how everything is loaded.

111
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.640
You can put your CSS in different
places and have it load different ways.

112
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.326
Just best practices dictate
that you load it at the top.

113
00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:48.766
Does that answer your question?
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Yeah.

114
00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:52.462
Because it's parsing it while

115
00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:56.160
it's loading, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I really

116
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.590
don't remember to tell you exactly.

117
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.480
That seems to make sense to me, but

118
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.140
I'm not gonna say this
because I don't remember.

119
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.762
But that would be a great
thing to go read.

120
00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:12.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

121
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.730
So how did we do with the exercise?

122
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.610
Do okay?

123
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.010
Get it for the most part?

124
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.850
Seeing mostly head nods,
which makes me really happy.

125
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.380
I think this is one of the most
fun parts of web development,

126
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.610
is kind of molding the HTML to kind of
fit your vision of what it should be.

127
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.380
It's very for me, at least,

128
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.520
a pretty creative process.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: So,

129
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.970
a couple questions about
the choice of techniques.

130
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.230
Does it matter,

131
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.520
the width of the browser at all for either
of these two techniques that we used,

132
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.976
the boarder, or the float?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it certainly does.

133
00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:04.597
Imagine taking this page and putting it,
iPhone size would be like this size,

134
00:08:04.597 --> 00:08:08.270
right, which is just like
a terrible experience.

135
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.760
What you would want this to do,

136
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.850
and here we're getting back
to responsive web design.

137
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.430
Responsive design means
that between this width and

138
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.610
this width of the browser
display it like this.

139
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.460
And when you're on desktop do this.

140
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.530
When you're on essentially
a tablet size browser do this.

141
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.100
Or when you're on a mobile
size browser then do this.

142
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.300
I'll give you a really
basic example of that.

143
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.766
We did it on /marketplace/feed,

144
00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:44.996
there we go.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

145
00:08:44.996 --> 00:08:48.830
so, this is like a full
size browser width, right?

146
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.880
And then I'll use the,
let's put this on the side.

147
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.520
Okay?

148
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.380
So, full size desktop browser and
then once you start getting down to

149
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.750
tablet sizes then it reorganizes
itself and has three.

150
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.160
And then when you get down to
an iPhone size, he has one and

151
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.800
eventually two, right?

152
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.820
This is the idea of what we'd
call responsive web design.

153
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.749
It's different css rules that
apply to different sizes.

154
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.990
Now, the next question you
ask is how do you do that?

155
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.640
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Show us the code for

156
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.268
that.

157
00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:21.030
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean,

158
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.600
it's not actually too bad,
it's all in Sass though,

159
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.030
so a little bit different than
what we've been talking about.

160
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.460
But, they're called media queries, and
off the top of my head, because I always

161
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.990
write them in Sass, I don't actually
remember how to write them in Raw css but

162
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.120
you say between this width and
this width apply these rules, right?

163
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.860
These rules only have effect
between these widths.

164
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.410
These rules only have effect
between these widths, right?

165
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.420
And then once you get
outside those widths,

166
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.320
those rules no longer have effect.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: With the total frame?

167
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.887
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Of the browser, right?

168
00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:55.946
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: The view port?

169
00:09:55.946 --> 00:09:56.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The view port precisely.

170
00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.420
Yeah.

171
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.760
So that's kinda what we would.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I get away from it?

172
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.800
What the hell happened?

173
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.590
All right, I guess we went to a new,
there we go.

174
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.831
All right, so, this is again,

175
00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:17.063
what I would do in this is I would stack
it differently at different widths.

176
00:10:17.063 --> 00:10:21.000
You would have four on one line,
so they'd take up 25% on desktop.

177
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.770
Then on tablet,
you would have them take up 33%.

178
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.100
Then they would stack
three next to each other.

179
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.511
Then on mobile,
they'd stack up 50% right, and

180
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:36.326
have two of them on one line.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

181
00:10:36.326 --> 00:10:38.330
kind of a more of an advanced technique.

182
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.780
There's other cool Frontend Masters
courses on that kind of stuff so.

183
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.817
Definitely would recommend
checking those out.

184
00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:49.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

185
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.051
Other questions?
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Okay, so in HTML,

186
00:10:55.051 --> 00:11:01.269
going back to HTML,
you referenced the kitten photo.

187
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:05.966
When you need to reference something

188
00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:10.690
from your own file is it different?

189
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.368
What's the difference in
importing that into HTML?

190
00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:17.720
&gt;&gt; Female Student: So if I have an image.

191
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.780
This is my own picture, and I wanted
to import it into image source here,

192
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.840
how?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do

193
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.690
you reference it?
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Yeah.

194
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll go more into that

195
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.090
tomorrow when we're talking about node,

196
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.170
but the sum of the story is,
in fact, you have a whole slide.

197
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.290
I think Nina has a slide on relative and
absolute paths don't you?

198
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.680
Yeah, I'll let Nina explain it.

199
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.210
She's way smarter than me, so.
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Tomorrow,

200
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.480
okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

201
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.460
I think it's tomorrow.
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Okay.
