00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Exercise time.

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.480
Let's open, so go to CodePen.

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.970
So you can go to codepen.io/pen, it'll
take you straight to creating a new pen.

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.060
I'm pretty sure you can
go to codepen.io and

5
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.550
just like there's a new
button there as well.

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.520
Let's go back here and
let's get the requirements again.

7
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.230
So I want you on this new page.

8
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.360
So first of all, let's talk a little bit,
just specifically about CodePen.

9
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.580
You don't have to put
that HTML tag on CodePen.

10
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.730
CodePen actually automatically
does that for you.

11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.570
So if you wanna be lazy like I am,
you don't have to.

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.690
If you want to actually like be complete
and kinda get the full experience,

13
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.540
you're welcome to as well.

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.720
It won't hurt anything.

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.767
Anyway, so

16
00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:08.470
what I want you to do on this new page
is I want you to make a title, right?

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.070
If you remember the titles are like
the H1 through the H6, and the reason why

18
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.330
you would choose an H1 versus an H2 versus
an H3 is it just implies hierarchy, right?

19
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.270
So the H1 should be
the most important title.

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.432
Typically, you only have, there's kind
of different schools of thought on this,

21
00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:28.767
but you have one H1 on a page, right?

22
00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.530
Like, this is my blog.

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.753
Like my blog would be your H1 like blog,
like this is blog post number one,

24
00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:35.839
that'd be an H2.

25
00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:38.280
And blog post number three
would be an H2 as well, right?

26
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.610
And then you would have like
different headers inside your blogs.

27
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.310
The first part of my day, H3.

28
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
The second part of my day, H3, right?

29
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.060
It's hierarchy that you define yourself.

30
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.969
Whatever makes sense to you,
that's what you should do, okay?

31
00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.504
So in your new CodePen,
create a new page that has a title and

32
00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:06.099
then I want you to create an unordered
list of things that you look for in a car,

33
00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:12.400
and then I want you to create an ordered
list of your favorite cars, right?

34
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.210
And then after you've done that,
give each one of those a title.

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.260
It could be like my favorite cars and
things I look for in a car.

36
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.360
I'm doing half your work for you.

37
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.830
Just kidding.

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.613
Actually writing copy is
probably one of the hardest

39
00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:34.190
parts of my job because
I'm just really bad at it.

40
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.740
Okay, are those instructions
clear to everybody?

41
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Their asking more
to explain the heading tags.

42
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.590
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

43
00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:45.138
All right.

44
00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can click
these nice little arrow things.

45
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.750
You can collapse it.

46
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.020
Right now we're not
worrying about anything.

47
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.080
CSS and JavaScript,
we'll come back to that later.

48
00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So just to talk a little
bit about H1s right, like this is a title.

49
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.550
Page two, a smaller title.

50
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.635
Page three, yet

51
00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:23.730
smaller title.

52
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.979
Yet smalled like it's spelled.

53
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.260
Okay, so it implies hierarchy, right?

54
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.300
Like as we've seen with HTML,
it is very hierarchical based, right?

55
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.820
You'll find that a lot of this stuff
that I am teaching you like it

56
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.700
just teaches you kind of how to
define your own hierarchy, right?

57
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.690
Like there's no special rules of how you
can use H1s, like there's nothing that

58
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.730
says like you can't have an H2 on
a page if you don't have an H1, right?

59
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.240
Like this,
it's purely just what it means to you.

60
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.640
So for example, like we'll talk
about the project that I work on,

61
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.310
which is redditgifts, right?

62
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.365
An H1, there's only one H1 in a page, and

63
00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:16.588
it defines like this is what is
entire page is about, right?

64
00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.340
And then I'll have H2's,

65
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.980
like this is what this particular
section of this whole page means.

66
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.789
And then an H3 would be like what this
particular section inside this section of

67
00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.830
the whole page is.

68
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.090
But that is all defined by me,
right, what does an H1 mean to me?

69
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.870
So they're essentially giving you tools,
like different markers, right, for

70
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.030
your Tupperware, of how to define things.

71
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.540
So, in this particular case, like they
don't really have any meaning, right?

72
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.755
It's only meaning that you assign to it.

73
00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:53.293
Or you'll look at different websites and

74
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.271
they'll have like an H4 next to an H2,
right?

75
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.519
There's no meaning to it and

76
00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.040
in that's case it's not very
useful because it's just chaos.

77
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.150
Anyway, they're just titles and

78
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.680
then the number only has significance
as much as you assign to it.

79
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.960
And I guess the other difference is
that the browser has different default

80
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.340
stylings for it.

81
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.800
But very rarely will you just leave
it with the default stylings.

82
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.480
You'll change it to be whatever
you want it to look like.

83
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.100
Does that make more sense?

84
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.990
Hopefully, as we keep using them it
will make more and more sense to you.

85
00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.482
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

86
00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:44.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So how did we do?

87
00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:49.552
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: People still working.

88
00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:55.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks like I'll
give you a couple more minutes.

89
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.840
I'll give you like three more minutes,
is that good for people?

90
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.979
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I have a question.

91
00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.433
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: When we are creating

92
00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:07.963
the unordered and ordered list,

93
00:06:07.963 --> 00:06:13.017
it's in the body,
not the paragraph, right?

94
00:06:13.017 --> 00:06:14.262
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

95
00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.266
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yeah,
it's just kind of to,

96
00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:21.070
you don't actually have to put the body.

97
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.070
When you're making HTML documents,
you do have to have a body, but

98
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.943
Codepen actually wraps everything
in a body before you, right?

99
00:06:28.943 --> 00:06:31.180
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just to be nice to you.

100
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.771
So you are welcome to put it but

101
00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:40.666
you also don't have to
in this particular case.

102
00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:41.853
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [INAUDIBLE]
code would be [INAUDIBLE].

103
00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:44.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
let me throw those back up.

104
00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:01.467
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So do you div or

105
00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:05.190
basically wrap anything or everything in?

106
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.680
Can you explain the difference
between a div and span.

107
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

108
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.368
So something we have not addressed yet

109
00:07:12.368 --> 00:07:15.525
which is actually a really good
point to bring up is span.

110
00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:23.004
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Span and
div are similar because they are simply

111
00:07:23.004 --> 00:07:27.197
like generic containers for
something, right?

112
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.692
The difference is,

113
00:07:30.692 --> 00:07:34.229
is like a div is like a big container that
contains a lot of smaller containers,

114
00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.730
whereas span is just like its actually
like the smallest container, right?

115
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.505
So like you can have a paragraph and

116
00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:44.710
it can have a like couple spans that
will surround like a certain words.

117
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.930
So I will go over it after
we finish this example.

118
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.577
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe you're
covering it later but

119
00:08:01.577 --> 00:08:05.820
he's asking about black level as well,
do you want those explained?

120
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
we will definitely go over that as well.

121
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.830
We'll address that more in the CSS part,
which is a little bit later today.

122
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
