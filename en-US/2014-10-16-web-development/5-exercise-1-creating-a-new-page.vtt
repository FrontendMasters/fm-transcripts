00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Exercise time.

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.480
Let's open, so go to CodePen.

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.970
So you can go to codepen.io/pen, it'll
take you straight to creating a new pen.

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.060
I'm pretty sure you can
go to codepen.io and

5
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.550
just like there's a new
button there as well.

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.520
Let's go back here and
let's get the requirements again.

7
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.230
So I want you on this new page.

8
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.360
So first of all, let's talk a little bit,
just specifically about CodePen.

9
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.580
You don't have to put
that HTML tag on CodePen.

10
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.730
CodePen actually automatically
does that for you.

11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.570
So if you wanna be lazy like I am,
you don't have to.

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.690
If you want to actually like be complete
and kinda get the full experience,

13
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.540
you're welcome to as well.

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.720
It won't hurt anything.

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.767
Anyway, so

16
00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:08.470
what I want you to do on this new page
is I want you to make a title, right?

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.070
If you remember the titles are like
the H1 through the H6, and the reason why

18
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.330
you would choose an H1 versus an H2 versus
an H3 is it just implies hierarchy, right?

19
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.270
So the H1 should be
the most important title.

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.432
Typically, you only have, there's kind
of different schools of thought on this,

21
00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:28.767
but you have one H1 on a page, right?

22
00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.530
Like, this is my blog.

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.753
Like my blog would be your H1 like blog,
like this is blog post number one,

24
00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:35.839
that'd be an H2.

25
00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:38.280
And blog post number three
would be an H2 as well, right?

26
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.610
And then you would have like
different headers inside your blogs.

27
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.310
The first part of my day, H3.

28
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
The second part of my day, H3, right?

29
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.060
It's hierarchy that you define yourself.

30
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.969
Whatever makes sense to you,
that's what you should do, okay?

31
00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.504
So in your new CodePen,
create a new page that has a title and

32
00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:06.099
then I want you to create an unordered
list of things that you look for in a car,

33
00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:12.400
and then I want you to create an ordered
list of your favorite cars, right?

34
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.210
And then after you've done that,
give each one of those a title.

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.260
It could be like my favorite cars and
things I look for in a car.

36
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.360
I'm doing half your work for you.

37
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.830
Just kidding.

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.613
Actually writing copy is
probably one of the hardest

39
00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:34.190
parts of my job because
I'm just really bad at it.

40
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.740
Okay, are those instructions
clear to everybody?

41
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Their asking

42
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.340
more to explain the heading tags.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

43
00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:49.721
All right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

44
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:52.680
you can click these nice
little arrow things.

45
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.750
You can collapse it.

46
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.020
Right now we're not
worrying about anything.

47
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.140
CSS and JavaScript,

48
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.866
we'll come back to that later.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

49
00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:04.660
just to talk a little bit about H1s right,
like this is a title.

50
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.550
Page two, a smaller title.

51
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.635
Page three, yet

52
00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:23.730
smaller title.

53
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.979
Yet smalled like it's spelled.

54
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.260
Okay, so it implies hierarchy, right?

55
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.300
Like as we've seen with HTML,
it is very hierarchical based, right?

56
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.820
You'll find that a lot of this stuff
that I am teaching you like it

57
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.700
just teaches you kind of how to
define your own hierarchy, right?

58
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.690
Like there's no special rules of how you
can use H1s, like there's nothing that

59
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.730
says like you can't have an H2 on
a page if you don't have an H1, right?

60
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.240
Like this,
it's purely just what it means to you.

61
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.640
So for example, like we'll talk
about the project that I work on,

62
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.310
which is redditgifts, right?

63
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.365
An H1, there's only one H1 in a page, and

64
00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:16.588
it defines like this is what is
entire page is about, right?

65
00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.340
And then I'll have H2's,

66
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.980
like this is what this particular
section of this whole page means.

67
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.789
And then an H3 would be like what this
particular section inside this section of

68
00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.830
the whole page is.

69
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.090
But that is all defined by me,
right, what does an H1 mean to me?

70
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.870
So they're essentially giving you tools,
like different markers, right, for

71
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.030
your Tupperware, of how to define things.

72
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.540
So, in this particular case, like they
don't really have any meaning, right?

73
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.755
It's only meaning that you assign to it.

74
00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:53.293
Or you'll look at different websites and

75
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.271
they'll have like an H4 next to an H2,
right?

76
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.519
There's no meaning to it and

77
00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.040
in that's case it's not very
useful because it's just chaos.

78
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.150
Anyway, they're just titles and

79
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.680
then the number only has significance
as much as you assign to it.

80
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.960
And I guess the other difference is
that the browser has different default

81
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.340
stylings for it.

82
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.800
But very rarely will you just leave
it with the default stylings.

83
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.480
You'll change it to be whatever
you want it to look like.

84
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.100
Does that make more sense?

85
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.370
Hopefully, as we keep using
them it will make more and

86
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.482
more sense to you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

87
00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:44.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So how did we

88
00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:49.045
do?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: People still

89
00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:53.976
working.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks like I'll give you

90
00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:55.740
a couple more minutes.

91
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.390
I'll give you like three more minutes,
is that good for

92
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.318
people?
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I have

93
00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:02.290
a question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

94
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.433
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: When we are creating

95
00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:09.980
the unordered and
ordered list, it's in the body,

96
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.017
not the paragraph, right?

97
00:06:13.017 --> 00:06:18.079
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

98
00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:21.070
yeah, it's just kind of to,
you don't actually have to put the body.

99
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.070
When you're making HTML documents,
you do have to have a body, but

100
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.262
Codepen actually wraps
everything in a body before you,

101
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:29.309
right?
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay.

102
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:31.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just to be nice to you.

103
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.776
So you are welcome to put it but you also

104
00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:41.008
don't have to in this particular case.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [INAUDIBLE]

105
00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:42.313
code would be [INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

106
00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:44.080
let me throw those back up.

107
00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:01.467
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So do you div or

108
00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:05.190
basically wrap anything or everything in?

109
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.280
Can you explain the difference
between a div and

110
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.870
span.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

111
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.050
So something we have not addressed yet
which is actually a really good point to

112
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.721
bring up is span.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Span and

113
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:25.393
div are similar because they
are simply like generic containers for

114
00:07:25.393 --> 00:07:27.197
something, right?

115
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.692
The difference is,

116
00:07:30.692 --> 00:07:34.229
is like a div is like a big container that
contains a lot of smaller containers,

117
00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.730
whereas span is just like its actually
like the smallest container, right?

118
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.505
So like you can have a paragraph and

119
00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:44.710
it can have a like couple spans that
will surround like a certain words.

120
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.930
So I will go over it after
we finish this example.

121
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe you're covering it

122
00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:03.840
later but
he's asking about black level as well,

123
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.160
do you want those explained?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

124
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.970
we will definitely go over that as well.

125
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.270
We'll address that more in the CSS part,

126
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.020
which is a little bit later today.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
