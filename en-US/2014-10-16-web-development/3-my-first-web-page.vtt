[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.282
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so this is
called code pen, it's essentially like

3
00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:10.532
a little web app that you can kind
of write your own code in and

4
00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:13.790
it'll instantly execute it for
you, which is kind of fun.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.549
So this exactly what you were
seeing before on the slides.

6
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.550
So you can start like editing this and
the part on the right will reflect it.

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.720
So as you can see here, we have our html,

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.330
which is kind of like then entire html
document will be wrapped in the html,

9
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.970
that's just how you're letting the browser
know I'm giving you html please render it.

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.490
Something you'll find out as you get
more and more into programming is that

11
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.160
computers will always do exactly
what you tell them to do.

12
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.960
There's no inference,
there's no intelligence about this,

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.110
your computer is only as smart as you are,
and probably a little bit dumber.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.100
But I mean let's go ahead and add another
paragraph so you can put this p tag right

15
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.430
and say I love this so much.

16
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.390
And then you have to let
the browser know okay

17
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.600
I'm done telling you about this paragraph,
please stop displaying a paragraph.

18
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.444
And there you go.

19
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.977
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or
you can put like another tag in there,

20
00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:36.190
H1, and say, this is great.

21
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So does it matter that
this is your account on Codepen?

22
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.130
Are we changing it just on our browser?

23
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're changing
it just on your browser.

24
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So please feel free,

25
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.375
you can't overwrite me so.

26
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.285
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I did that on purpose.

27
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:52.708
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Brian,

28
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.017
can you bump the font?

29
00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:57.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

30
00:01:57.932 --> 00:01:59.194
Is that up good?

31
00:01:59.194 --> 00:02:00.605
Better?
Okay.

32
00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:06.870
Yeah, that brown's kind of hard to read,

33
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.730
I also don't know how to change it so
feel free to toy around with that.

34
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.487
We have lots of examples coming so

35
00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:18.769
there'll be plenty of opportunity
to mess around with this.

36
00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:23.203
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

37
00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:27.290
So you'll notice that there
is some style to this, right?

38
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.560
The browser knows if it's an H1,

39
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.700
make stuff really big, if it's a paragraph
then make sure stuff is spaced out, right?

40
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.510
Cuz if I just start typing in here,
which you can, but I try and

41
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.780
put spaces in here,
it's not gonna give them new lines.

42
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.570
That's because the browser
doesn't know what to do with it,

43
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.710
so it just kind of smashes it together.

44
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.740
It's like I don't know why
you're giving me lines, so

45
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.425
I'm assuming that you
don't want new lines.

46
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.411
[LAUGH] So
that's why you have to put in paragraphs,

47
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.571
paragraphs kind of separate stuff.

48
00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:05.933
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,
any questions on that?

49
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right.

50
00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:13.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: By the way
this is a really bad idea.

51
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.590
What I just did right there,
please do not do that.

52
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.090
Okay.
