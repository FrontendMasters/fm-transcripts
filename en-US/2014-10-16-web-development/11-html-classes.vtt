[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:04.444
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Classes.

3
00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:06.448
So, here is your marker right,

4
00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:11.460
now we're actually to give classes
which are essentially labels right.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.485
I'm gonna say like this
is a div right here and

6
00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:18.380
encompassing this amorphous entity to you.

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.930
And guess what?

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.750
It's a blog post.

9
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.630
And so you look at it and
say, this div is a blog post.

10
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.340
And now you know why that div exists.

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.790
So again, to someone that had never seen
that code before, they'd look at that and

12
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.120
say, why the hell did they put a div here,
right?

13
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.179
What is this?

14
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.210
And so that's what we're gonna use,
and they're called classes.

15
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.470
And to preempt the question that I
know is coming from the online people,

16
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.400
we're gonna talk about
IDs in just a little bit.

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.850
Right now we're gonna talk about classes.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.040
So here is a very small example.

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.520
We now have a div that's
surrounding two images but

20
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.200
we wouldn't even have to see the images to
know, this is a group of pictures, right?

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.080
So this is an attribute on
that div called a class and

22
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.566
that's just saying like you're taking
your marker to your Tupperware and

23
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.770
saying, this is I don't know
spaghetti from last night or

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.180
something like that,
that's what the class is for.

25
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.920
And then again you can address the classes
later using CSS, which is super useful.

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800
So, let's take a look at this example.

27
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.629
And I know you're all excited,
because you get to see more cat pictures.

28
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.427
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
so expand that out.

29
00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:46.227
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so.

30
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.897
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's what that class is
for right, so it's essentially just saying

31
00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:58.440
you don't even have to see what's
underneath here to know what's in it.

32
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.470
Does that kind of make sense?

33
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.600
Cool, I'm sure you're all really
happy you get to see more cute cats.

34
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.140
All right.

35
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I have a question.

36
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.609
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you go back, yeah,

37
00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.520
right there, okay.

38
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.145
So here, you have a div class,
you have your image but

39
00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:33.651
then your image has that forward
slash at the end of the image.

40
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:37.570
But then you have, well I guess you
have to close that, okay never mind.

41
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I got it sometimes
you just got to sound it out loud.

42
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.490
There's this concept in computing called,
what is it?

43
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.210
Rubberducking.

44
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.230
Yeah, so, and we actually did
this with one of my coworkers.

45
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.690
I really hope he's not watching,
[LAUGH] at one of my former jobs.

46
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.984
So he would always come over to my
desk and he'd just ask me like,

47
00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:04.330
hey man how do you do this?

48
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.870
And he'd just start
explaining to me his problem.

49
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.861
And like halfway through it
he'd solve it himself and

50
00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:09.960
just go back to his desk, right?

51
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.100
So rather than have him come over,
we bought him a rubber ducky.

52
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.810
And we put it on his desk and was like,
before you can ask anyone any questions,

53
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.870
you must explain your problems
to your rubber ducky.

54
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.950
And so I'd hear him mumbling over
the wall just saying okay rubber ducky,

55
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm doing this, and this is going on.

56
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.246
And he was like, I get it, and he was
just pounding on the keyboard, right?

57
00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:36.050
[LAUGH] So,
it's actually extremely useful, right?

58
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.420
Just enunciating your problems
will help you solve a lot of them.

59
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.060
So, I'm serious,
go buy yourself a rubber ducky.

60
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.990
I feel like I should get Amazon
affiliate fees for that.

61
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, now,
I do have another question.

62
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

63
00:03:58.191 --> 00:03:59.984
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You started with div class,
but

64
00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:02.250
you don't have to close it as div class?

65
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.931
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Correct.

66
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:04.729
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why?

67
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:09.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So your closing tags
will never have attributes right?

68
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.960
It's actually only-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

69
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

70
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because this
one knows that I mean if you

71
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.640
wanna talk about the way the browser looks
at it, it says I have now opened the divs.

72
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.570
So whatever happens after
this is inside this div and

73
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.540
it looks until it finds another closing
tag and it closes out all of that.

74
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

75
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
it doesn't have to match.

76
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Gotcha.

77
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, good question though.

78
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.090
Does that make sense to everyone else?

79
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.110
Yeah you don't need the attributes
as well on the closing tags,

80
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.210
closing tags will never be anything but
like slash, the name of the tag

81
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.872
close it that's it, great question.

82
00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:51.322
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] like.
If you are looking at a photo album, so

83
00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:54.420
you have your photo album open.

84
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.358
Now your photos are here.

85
00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:57.838
Then there's nothing.

86
00:04:57.838 --> 00:05:00.006
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, there you go.

87
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:01.418
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like that.

88
00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:03.778
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There you go,
I appreciate that.

89
00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:04.607
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

90
00:05:04.607 --> 00:05:05.107
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's
a good example though.
