00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.237
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We're going to
start talking about JavaScript, and

3
00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:10.258
this is purely an introduction
to programming,

4
00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:13.810
aimed towards people who
haven't really done it at all.

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.110
So how is JavaScript different from HTML?

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.470
Well, HTML is purely presentational,
there's nothing dynamic about it,

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.430
there's nothing that changes.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
We talked about client server,
server sends back HTML, there it is,

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.414
the browser displays it.

10
00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:36.703
Javascript is different,
Javascript is a programming language,

11
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.539
and what that means is it's
interpreted by your browser, so

12
00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.450
there are variables, and things change,
and there's a line of execution.

13
00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:50.280
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
what can we use JavaScript for?

14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.920
And there are a ton of
different applications.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160
It's been around for quite a long time.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
Fun fact, it was created in ten days.

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.480
Which is like that [NOISE] for
programming language.

18
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.950
So we can use JavaScript for anything
from creating something like a pop-up.

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.860
You ever got one of those
on an annoying website?

20
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.800
To something like
a full-fledged video game.

21
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.730
The basic composition of
JavaScript is a statement.

22
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.980
So each line in JavaScript is an
instruction and when the browser reads it,

23
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.610
it executes that line of code.

24
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
So for the duration of these slides,

25
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.540
I'll be showing code in this different
font and syntax highlighted, so

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.440
that will help you differentiate
between what's code and what isn't.

27
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.632
So,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: What's this weird

28
00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:49.680
semi-colon thing going on
at the end of a statement?

29
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.468
So if you think of a JavaScript
statement like a sentence,

30
00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:58.380
then the semi-colon is a period,
it means that this line is done.

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.460
And you'll be seeing a bunch of these.

32
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.970
The other thing that you'll
see in JavaScript is comments.

33
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.430
So one-line comments start with
two forward slashes at the end.

34
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.200
And comments are not code,
but can co-exist with code.

35
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.770
So they're not executed by the browser,
they are only read by humans,

36
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.620
so, only meant for yourself or
other people, so notes.

37
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.930
You can also do multi-line comments and
they are a forward slash and a star,

38
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.259
what you wanna write, then they are ended
with a star and another forward slash.

39
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.270
If you have syntax
highlighting in your editor,

40
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.340
you'll see that comments
are a different color.

41
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.860
So some rule of thumbs about comments,

42
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.220
don't try to overuse them in
code that you're sharing.

43
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.540
So, if you have a really complex piece
of code, feel free to comment it, but

44
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.393
don't just put comments in willy
nilly if other people are going to

45
00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:12.900
read it, cuz they should be able to
infer what's going on from your code.

46
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.480
If you do go back and update your code and
you have a bunch of comments, make sure

47
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.060
you update them so that if someone goes
out and reads your code, they're not

48
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.660
reading the comments and getting
the wrong picture of what's going on.

49
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.030
So, there are a few ways that we can
see results when we write JavaScript.

50
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.980
The first way is that super
annoying pop up, the second way

51
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.880
is we can output directly to
the html page, the third way

52
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.580
is that we can display it in that console
that we talked about in the beginning.
