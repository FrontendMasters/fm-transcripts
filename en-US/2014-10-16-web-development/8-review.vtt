00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:04.516
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's review.

3
00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:07.370
These are inline tags that go over text,
right?

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.040
So we have strong,
which usually means bold.

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.050
And you notice that I say
usually in all these?

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.080
You notice how I changed
the color of the text?

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.230
All of that is available to change.

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.630
So, what you need to ask yourself is,

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.120
the HTML makers could have made
this bold instead of strong, right?

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.960
But the issue here is,

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.130
what might be strong could be different
in different contexts, right?

12
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.300
Like, say, for example,
we're making a page and

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.449
we wanna really emphasize this
one particular word, right?

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.560
We would put strong around it, and

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.903
then say later that we wanted to make
instead of it being bold, we want it,

16
00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:55.520
it should be like bigger and green.

17
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.240
So if we had it say bold, we'd wanna
change it to be something else, but

18
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.800
the tag would say bold and so you'd have
this kind of like cognitive dissonance,

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.460
like this says it's bold but
I changed my mind about it and so

20
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.340
now I no longer want it to be bold but
the name of the tag is still bold.

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.470
So your tag is kind of lying to you.

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.150
Instead you can call it strong, and

23
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.230
in both cases the word is now strong,
like the bold is strong and

24
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.180
the large and green is strong, it just
gives you flexibility to change it later.

25
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.080
We kind of follow that.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.975
This is, again, going back to that
semantic HTML, as opposed to saying

27
00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:40.871
this is my green div, you should say
this is my navigation, because your

28
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:46.036
navigation is always going to be
navigation, it might not always be green.

29
00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:47.116
Does that kind of make sense?

30
00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:48.616
Go ahead.

31
00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:52.674
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]
conjunction with CSS also,

32
00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:56.827
if it's already bold we go in CSS and
we change it and

33
00:01:56.827 --> 00:02:00.360
make it all like pink, bold, like that.

34
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.977
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or can make it

35
00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:01.477
strong, but okay.

36
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah yeah,
that makes me happy that you get it.

37
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.500
So I don't feel like
a bumbling idiot up here.

38
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.050
Well I already kind of do, but it's cool.

39
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.220
I'll deal with my own
psychology on my own time.

40
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.370
Okay.

41
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.190
So &lt;strong&gt; it's for bold, emphasis
is like typically you use italics for

42
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.970
emphasis 95% of the time, but
maybe that 5% you want emphasis to have

43
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.070
more spaces between the letters, or
it's gray or something like that.

44
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.320
You're free to change it and
it's not lying to you, right?

45
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.920
Cuz if you said italics, and then you
changed it, it's no longer italics and

46
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.200
it's gray but it says it's italics,

47
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.286
you're just like well what
the hell is going on here, right?

48
00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:50.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then &lt;span&gt; is like divs for inlines.

49
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.249
It's used for something you wanna separate
from other things, and like I said,

50
00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.700
it becomes very useful with CSS.

51
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.234
Because just putting something in
a span will not do anything to it,

52
00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:03.454
it just has a span around it and the user
has no idea that there's a span around it.

53
00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.514
Make sense?

54
00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:08.634
Cool.

55
00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:17.294
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's just take and
look at another example of this.

56
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:25.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is what everyone
in the room is thinking right now.

57
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.100
So I have this paragraph.

58
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.550
It's like this class is awesome and
I love it.

59
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.670
So it's just wrapping individual
elements inside of there.

60
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.042
Just things that you
want to put emphasis on,

61
00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:47.490
like something you would do in Word and
you would just highlight and hit bold on.

62
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.620
That's essentially what this is doing.

63
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.730
Or you're just saying this text
is different from the other text.

64
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.580
It's special, this is my special text.

65
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.855
Questions about that?

66
00:03:59.855 --> 00:04:02.935
Cool.

67
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:08.070
Let's just close out stuff.

68
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.390
I'll leave that one open in case
I need to do some other stuff.
