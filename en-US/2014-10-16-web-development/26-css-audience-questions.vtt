[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:06.922
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like if I wanted to center
the boxes it's actually not too hard.

3
00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:16.610
I'm going to go back to styling in here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have margin on here.

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.580
So here I have a 10 pixel on the left and

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.890
on the right and
then 30 pixels on the left.

6
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.190
If I just change this to auto and
I change this to auto.

7
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.160
Now it's actually going
to center those right.

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.159
Auto is just saying that this
only works on left and right,

9
00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:37.970
it doesn't work on up and down.

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.552
Please center myself in
whatever my parent is right.

11
00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:51.941
So like if I have parent-div down here,

12
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:58.120
if I say width only be
like 40% of what you can

13
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.927
actually be.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

14
00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:14.188
let's just say like a border.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll

15
00:01:14.188 --> 00:01:19.360
say like blue or
something like that I guess.

16
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.420
Oops, I didn't want that.

17
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.800
Anyway that kind of makes the point.

18
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:32.441
[SOUND] So, you can see right here
the div only takes up 40% of it's width.

19
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:34.120
And these are all centered within that.

20
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.440
So, the marginato centers
it within it's parent.

21
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.610
Right, so these ones are all
being centered within the parent.

22
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.471
So, if i said here,

23
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.570
margin 0, and that would be pushed
to the left up here, right?

24
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.880
So these are all centered in here and
not necessarily centered on the page.

25
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.910
It's what you would expect but
it's kind of weird to verbalize it.

26
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.790
That makes sense?

27
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.973
Follow.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone commented

28
00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:02.538
that flexboxes were trying
to solve all these problems?

29
00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:04.485
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah so, flexbox,

30
00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:08.835
which we do use a little
bit on Reddit is trying

31
00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:13.543
to solve some of these
vertical centering woes.

32
00:02:13.543 --> 00:02:17.002
It's been a problem for 15 years, right.

33
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.385
And it just seems kind of silly that
we have the same problem that we had 15

34
00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:20.942
years ago.

35
00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:24.500
So there's a new model of
displaying called flexbox and

36
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.420
centering things in flexbox, vertically is
trivial, like, it's really, really easy.

37
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.490
You just have to say justify content,
middle, or center or something like that,

38
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.135
but that's for another day.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it box dash flex

39
00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:45.175
property?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't,

40
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:49.490
flexbox I don't work in enough to
actually remember all of the things but

41
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.560
you have to say like.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it part of CSS?

42
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's CSS 3.

43
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.280
Actually it's even beyond CSS 3,
it's like 3.1.

44
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.610
So you say display flex.

45
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.398
As you can see, it just totally fucked
up or messed up everything, sorry.

46
00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:10.281
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Flexbox-flex.

47
00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:10.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But they

48
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:15.588
haven't even agreed on like I
say the browser manufacturers

49
00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:20.542
have not even agreed about what
that property should be called.

50
00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:27.970
[COUGH] So it's hard to use right now.

51
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.609
But CSS tricks if you wanna look at it
has a really good to toil on how to use

52
00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.482
flexbox if that's something
you're interested in learning,

53
00:03:37.482 --> 00:03:39.294
I would highly recommend it.

54
00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:44.289
That's what I refer to every time I
need this, because there's 30 properties

55
00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:49.421
around it that are useful so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's difficult though,

56
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.893
I'll throw that caveat out, cuz you have
to worry about like flex direction and

57
00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:58.040
hustifying content versus justifying
items and stuff like that.

58
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.130
Other questions about
what's going on here?

59
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.730
Specificity make a little
bit of sense to you?

60
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.097
The more specific you are,

61
00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:13.387
the more it will be applied.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As a general rule,

62
00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.257
just something I'd throw out there,

63
00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:18.420
is don't necessarily rely on
order to solve your specificity.

64
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.210
You can have two of them
that refer to one class and

65
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.300
then you can just put the one
you want applied, below it.

66
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.210
It's kind of a poor practice because
if anyone reorganizes your CSS,

67
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.420
which is a kind of a common thing to do,
it could mess up what you were intending,

68
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.770
so I'll just say, play it safe,
use two classes instead.

69
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.390
Another thing that I catch
a lot of crap for this, so

70
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.558
this is a highly contested subject,
I never style on ID ever.

71
00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:53.659
Why?

72
00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.465
It's because if I need to

73
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:02.700
overwride something with an ID has,
it's really hard, right,

74
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.550
you can't, cuz you gonna only have
only one ID in an item right?

75
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.270
So you can't overwride
based on having two ID's.

76
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.210
So you either have to have an ID and
a class, which is really dumb, right?

77
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.120
Or you have to use important,
which you shouldn't use.

78
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.040
Whereas if it was just a class and
it had two classes, guess what you do?

79
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.030
You throw in another class.

80
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.400
You have three classes and
you're done with it.

81
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.631
It's requires very little rewrite
if you're doing everything based on

82
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:32.175
classes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The only time that I will

83
00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:35.470
style IDs, is if I can
guarantee this thing is unique.

84
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.860
I'm never going to want to
style this some other place, so

85
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.020
let's just throw an ID on it and
be done with it.

86
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.970
IDs are a specificity nightmare though.

87
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.850
That's why you stick to classes,
I don't ever style in tags, or

88
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.620
very rarely style in tags,
and I yeah, very rarely.

89
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.640
Like I'll style like links and
stuff like that,

90
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.590
but I'll very rarely style like divs or
something like that, never that.

91
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.640
Stick to classes.

92
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.280
You'll have a happy life
if you stick to classes.

93
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.450
Okay, other questions?

94
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.553
All right.

95
00:06:23.572 --> 00:06:24.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,

96
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.730
I believe we went over this, I think,

97
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.129
let me just make sure.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We

98
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.912
did.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One just came in kinda

99
00:06:33.912 --> 00:06:37.158
talking about SaaS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Versus class and

100
00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:43.706
stuff like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

101
00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:46.870
spreading CSS is a bit of a pain.

102
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.970
It's kind of archaic.

103
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.080
There's no idea of nesting in CSS.

104
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.540
Say right here if I wanted
to do blog-post but

105
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.870
I wanted to style all the h1's
just inside the blog-post.

106
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.420
You would think this
would make sense right?

107
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.540
I could just nest the rule
inside of blog-post.

108
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.750
Right so I'd have blog-post and then
inside of blog-post, I'd have h1 right?

109
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.610
And I could say color red.

110
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.930
This doesn't work in CSS, CSS,
everything has to be flat.

111
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.110
If I wanted to do all the h1s
inside of the blog post,

112
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.629
I would have to do .blog-post

113
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:33.868
h1 color red, right.

114
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.333
So this idea of nesting doesn't exist.

115
00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.368
So some smart guys got really
sick of doing that and

116
00:07:41.368 --> 00:07:44.828
they wrote another language called SaaS,

117
00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:49.455
there's one called Stylus,
there's one called Less.

118
00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.706
Anyway, those are the three big ones,
SaaS being the biggest and then Less and

119
00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.439
Stylus fighting it out for second place.

120
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.170
They wrote this language that you write.

121
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.100
This kind of more concise CSS and
then you compile it.

122
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.960
So essentially you run it through another
program which then spits out normal CSS.

123
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.630
It's very useful, we use it in Reddit,
we use it in SaaS.

124
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.750
I would recommend as you're starting out,
just kind of wrapping your mind around

125
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.350
CSS, cuz SaaS and Less introduced some
really more advanced complex ideas.

126
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.680
So it's better just to start
out writing vanilla CSS and

127
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.080
then once you get sick of writing CSS,
then it's a good time to jump to SaaS cuz

128
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.916
then you're like, everything that I hate
about CSS has mostly been solved by this.

129
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.390
So but

130
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.200
anyway, there's a lot more than just like
nesting, but that's one of the things that

131
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.789
people really like is nesting.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Variables, right, you

132
00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:47.590
can have variables in your [INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

133
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.840
actually Firefox now allows
you to have CSS variables.

134
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.720
So that actually can work now in CSS,
which is pretty rad.

135
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.572
Because for example, say I had this color.

136
00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:06.671
I don't know say my favorite
one is fog dog, fog dog.

137
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.070
It's orange.

138
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:15.890
So this color right here,
say I was using it all over my CSS, right?

139
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.830
That was like my brand color and
I needed to use it everywhere.

140
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.840
It's really annoying to
have to repeat that and

141
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.820
then say that if my brand color changes.

142
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.210
I'm Airbnb and now I'm suddenly
red instead of blue right?

143
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.960
You would have to go back to literally
every place in your CSS and change it.

144
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.090
But if you use a variable right,

145
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.410
you change it one place and ta-da it's
changed everywhere, which is kind of nice.

146
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.759
So, that's why variables are useful,
they are in SaaS,

147
00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:44.065
and they just came out in modern browsers,

148
00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:47.802
which means we can use them in five
years when everyone's caught up.
