[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:05.580
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's talk about Git.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.410
I'm sure all of you guys
have learned about GitHub.

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.160
So Git and
GitHub are actually two different things.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.071
Git's a tool, and
GitHub is it's a platform

6
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:25.249
where they kind of use
that tool in a social way.

7
00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:32.097
So they host lots of code from lots of
different people and it's mostly open and

8
00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:38.650
everyone can go ahead and check it out and
have a copy of that code.

9
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.140
So the advantage of using Git,
is Git is a version control system.

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.170
So you can save snapshots of your files
as they were in different stages.

11
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.240
And if something is going wrong and
you need to go back, you

12
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.780
can kind of rewind and see what that file
look like at a certain point and time.

13
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.290
So mostly use for code but version control
is also great for even a text project.

14
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.500
If you write a paragraph and you put
it in your version control system and

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.250
you deleted it and two days later, you're
like, I wonder what that paragraph said.

16
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.920
It actually had a really good idea in it.

17
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.270
I want it back.

18
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.930
You can cruise back through history and
take a look at that snapshot.

19
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.380
So Git works perfectly fine
on your local machine.

20
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.930
But it's nice having a remote server
that you can sink up your changes with.

21
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.140
So, if anything happens to your machine,
your changes are still there.

22
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.380
GitHub is a remote server.

23
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.828
So, you guys all have GitHub accounts,
we're going to go ahead and fork

24
00:01:53.828 --> 00:02:03.200
our first project.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

25
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.470
I made a test account that
I can use with you guys.

26
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.630
So I'm gonna sign in.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'll

27
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.916
give you guys a few minutes to
sign in to your GitHub accounts.

28
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:27.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is anybody not in GitHub?

29
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.394
Anybody need more time or

30
00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:35.041
should we keep going?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Keep going.

31
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.657
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [CROSSTALK] All right

32
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:43.533
so Brian has this project that
we're all gonna make a copy of,

33
00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:49.421
make some changes to and
then push them back up to his project.

34
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:57.551
So go to github.com/btholt.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

35
00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:03.001
look at Brian's repositories.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

36
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:10.953
click on this one pull requests.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

37
00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:16.111
we're going to go ahead and
fork this project and what fork means

38
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:22.240
is take a snapshot of everything that
Brian did, copy it over to my machine.

39
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.900
I can make changes.

40
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.690
I can use my version control.

41
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.790
And it doesn't really
matter what Brian is doing.

42
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.660
But the really powerful feature, forking,

43
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.590
is Brian's working on his project and
I'm working on my project.

44
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.400
Maybe Brian decides that what
I'm doing is really cool and

45
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.360
he wants to include what I've
been doing into his repository.

46
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.630
So he can go ahead and take my fork and
copy it over to his code.

47
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.748
And so now, we have fort, so we're in the
prongs, we're doing separate things but

48
00:03:55.748 --> 00:04:00.736
then we join back together.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So let's go ahead and

49
00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:08.662
click this fork.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

50
00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:11.310
this is going to forward
you to a different URL.

51
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.193
So now instead of being
on github.com/btholt,

52
00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:22.610
I'm now on github.com/nina-test.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

53
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.960
this is my own project.

54
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.600
So now take this https clone URL
that's right here and copy it.

55
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:39.900
You can do that using this button.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We're

56
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.492
going to go to our terminal, and

57
00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:48.814
go to any directory where
you'll be able to find

58
00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:53.783
your files again on.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

59
00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:59.401
on Mac you can do the cd ~/Desktop.

60
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:00.390
That will take you to your Desktop.

61
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.670
For the Windows users,

62
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.410
you guys will wanna be using that
git bash application for this part.

63
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.260
So we're gonna take that
URL that we copied.

64
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.820
And type in get and
clone and then paste it in.

65
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.159
What this is gonna do is pull
down that code from that server,

66
00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.506
make a new directory for us locally and
copy everything that's in

67
00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:32.429
there.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Does

68
00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:34.520
everyone have this step complete?

69
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.150
You guys all have your forks checked out?

70
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.206
Okay so now we can go into this directory.

71
00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:55.301
It's called pull-requests-1.

72
00:05:55.301 --> 00:06:00.374
This is a pretty boring project,
there's really nothing in here,

73
00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:03.051
so I want you guys to do an exercise.

74
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:04.780
We're gonna liven it up a little bit.

75
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.295
So in this directory,
make a new file, call it your first

76
00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:16.490
name.txt and in that file put
a fun fact about yourself.

77
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.942
So I'll give you guys
a few minutes to do that.

78
00:06:21.942 --> 00:06:24.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What should we call it?

79
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.290
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Your first name.txt.

80
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Let's do first name and

81
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.710
then first letter of last name.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, yeah.

82
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We have 110 people.

83
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.160
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: All right.

84
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it's likely

85
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.196
first names will collide.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: All right let's do

86
00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:44.641
a first name and
a first last name letter.txt.

87
00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:49.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

88
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.845
How do you want them to create the files?

89
00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:57.033
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: You

90
00:06:57.033 --> 00:06:59.778
guys just need to make sure
this file is in this directory.

91
00:06:59.778 --> 00:07:05.757
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]

92
00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:07.453
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Did you fork

93
00:07:07.453 --> 00:07:13.758
the repository?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Not [INAUDIBLE]

94
00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:19.234
github.com/bholt.

95
00:07:19.234 --> 00:07:21.895
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: BT Holt.

96
00:07:21.895 --> 00:07:23.915
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: BT Holt?

97
00:07:23.915 --> 00:07:27.035
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: BT Holt.

98
00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:27.817
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

99
00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:31.157
That's nice, thank you.

100
00:07:31.157 --> 00:07:34.495
T.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I dropped one.

101
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.191
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That readme or

102
00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:38.695
are we supposed to make a new file?
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Make a new file.

103
00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:40.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Make a text file.

104
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.900
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah just a plain

105
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.460
old text file.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: From the command line?

106
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.770
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If you are on a Mac

107
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.440
and you wanna make a new file
from the command line or

108
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.100
on a Linux machine there's
a fun command called touch.

109
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:59.294
So you can say touch and a file name.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

110
00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:02.990
what that does is just
creates a totally empty file.

111
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.950
So if I do an ls now,
I'll see a ninaz.txt file

112
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.254
in here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If I'm here in Windows,

113
00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:15.845
just go, we're in the Desktop, right?

114
00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:19.833
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Folder on the desktop.

115
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay,

116
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.750
the folder on the desktop.

117
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.209
So then just drop a txt file.

118
00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:29.750
Open a Notepad.

119
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.985
Open Notepad or TextEdit.

120
00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:37.750
And the.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just git.

121
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.757
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: To guys that get this

122
00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:40.010
touch command working?

123
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.250
Yeah, okay.

124
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:50.071
I think on Mac you can just say open and
then it'll open up a text edit.
