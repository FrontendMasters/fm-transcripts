[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:06.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
open this CodePen using jQuery.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.480
We're gonna make it so when the button is
clicked, whatever text is in the input is

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.790
going to be set as the text on that p
on that paragraph that's on the page.

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.830
Again, do not modify the HTML.

6
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.460
You can only modify the JavaScript.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.010
And I'll give you this hint too.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.451
You're going to need text, val, and click.

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.787
Those are the three JavaScript functions
that you're going to be using.

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.609
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
let's just take a look at this.

11
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:51.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
we have our input right here.

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.550
I've given you a nice
little class to refer to.

13
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.861
I've given you a button here, and
then I've given you the user text,

14
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.938
which is what you're going to replace.

15
00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Are the instructions clear?

16
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.693
Are you understanding
what I want you to do?

17
00:01:14.693 --> 00:01:18.528
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

18
00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:19.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If this were number two.

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So essentially I'm gonna
type like right here in this thing

20
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510
right there in the top right.

21
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.330
I want to to view it so
that I can click it and

22
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.840
then where it says replace me to be
replaced by whatever text was in here.

23
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.338
That make sense?

24
00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:35.393
Cool.

25
00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:39.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What is the URL right
in front of the question mark?

26
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.260
Lv.

27
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: URL front
end of the question mark.

28
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.050
The editor's thing right here?

29
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.620
Is that what you're asking?

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just before the question
mark, what are those characters?

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.774
L?

32
00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:52.649
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's an L.

33
00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.430
lvwl.

34
00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:01.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,
let's come back here, this might be it.

35
00:02:01.864 --> 00:02:04.531
A bit bigger, clearer top one apps.

36
00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:16.617
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
my first recommendation for

37
00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:21.668
you is you need to set up
a click listener on that button.

38
00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:23.854
That would probably be the first
thing that I would do.

39
00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:34.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay so if you've got
a click listener set up probably my next

40
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:38.822
step would be to grab whatever
the val is out of the input.

41
00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:53.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you don't remember
how to do that the last CodePen

42
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.660
that we just did.

43
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.670
We did exactly that.
