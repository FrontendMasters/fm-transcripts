00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.061
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So class,
this is a blog post, right?

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.940
Everything inside of this div contains
a blog post or is a blog post, right?

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.310
So likewise here,
this is as well a blog post, right?

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.621
Because these are two tupperwares
that contain exactly the same thing,

6
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:27.150
they should have the same label.

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.070
Also, as a side note,
notice I'm using hyphens.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.090
That's just kind of like the way
that CSS is typically named.

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.630
You don't have to, underscores work,
you can do camel casing,

10
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.770
that all works and
there's nothing inherently wrong with it,

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.630
just the standard way of doing it,
the way the community has done it.

12
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.902
Is this way is separated by hyphens, and
you'll find that once we start talking

13
00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:02.776
about JavaScript, it's camel case, and
if you do Python, it's underscores, right?

14
00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:10.515
Every language has it's little
different semantic way of doing things.

15
00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.325
So what is this?

16
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:17.440
It's a title of some sort, right?

17
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.460
So, this could be a blog-title, right?

18
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.411
That'd make sense to call it that.

19
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:30.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

20
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.440
What's inside this div?

21
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.343
Like I feel like seriously like we're
sitting, like going through, okay,

22
00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:38.060
this has this, this has this, right?

23
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.530
I mean, it's essentially what
this process is right now.

24
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.880
This contains a bunch of paragraphs,
right?

25
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.640
This contains all of the blog posts,
right?

26
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.503
So, you can call this like Bbog-text,

27
00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:55.380
or blog-paragraphs, right?

28
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.430
Something to that effect.

29
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.640
We'll go with text, right, because this
contains all of the text in the blog post.

30
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.570
And then here, class = what,

31
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.640
this is a blog-paragraph or

32
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.120
if your lazy like me, you just know
that like this is a paragraph, right?

33
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.720
So that's what p stands for
so you can just say blog-p.

34
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.470
They have a good rule over at Google that

35
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.870
kind of adopted is that shorten things
as much as it make sense to you, right?

36
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.950
So, like in the example
that they give is like,

37
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.640
if it's called navigation,
if you call it nav, right?

38
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190
Everyone knows what nav means, but

39
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.290
if you call, if you're trying
to like label an author and

40
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.360
you see atr, that makes sense to you,
it's not gonna make sense to someone else.

41
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.150
So, stick with author.

42
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.981
Write out all of author.

43
00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:55.497
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I implore you to
shorten things as much as it makes

44
00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:56.470
sense to.

45
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.319
And I think in this sense
blog-p makes sense.

46
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.202
So, these are all the same so we are going
to give them all the same classes, okay?

47
00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:15.550
Now, the key here is that we're
going through the second post.

48
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.605
But we've already given these names out,
right,

49
00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:21.530
we should definitely not
re-invent the wheel.

50
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.830
So, this was a blog-title, right?

51
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.906
Because I believe that's what
we called it up here, right?

52
00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:44.127
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Blog-text
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Blog-p.

53
00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:55.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And blog-p,

54
00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:58.280
oops.

55
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.286
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Eduardo's asking, I thought
that a blog post can target the p

56
00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:09.440
tag using .blog-post, P,
why use classes on the paragraphs?

57
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.780
Isn't that using a lot of extra classes?

58
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.550
Bad design?

59
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

60
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.380
We're going to start talking about Brian's
opinion versus everyone else's opinion.

61
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.490
There's certain people that
would definitely say that.

62
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.500
There's a couple of good reasons
why I feel like it's a good

63
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.950
idea to give everything a class.

64
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.080
The first one being that, it's nice to
just give everything a label, right?

65
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.460
Just assume that everything you stick
in the fridge is gonna have a label.

66
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.079
Because when you pull it back out later,
you're gonna know instantly what it is.

67
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.830
The second part of that, and

68
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.640
let's just delve into the way
the browser works real quick.

69
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.680
When you're talking about CSS, I guess
we'll address more on that later, but

70
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.400
there's CSS performance implementations

71
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.220
that make it better to use
a class rather than to use an ID.

72
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.350
It's a minor consideration,

73
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.958
because the browser's CSS
engine is really, really fast.

74
00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:16.110
But it makes your CSS
faster to use classes.

75
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.330
But going back more towards
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like the semantic thing.

76
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.300
It's just easier to label everything.

77
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.480
It's more of ribose for sure right?

78
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.260
You have to type a lot more.

79
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.990
But in my opinion this
makes things easier.

80
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.010
Now, let's say, I have a blog post, right?

81
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.770
But now I have, let's say I put a
paragraph at the top, that's like a TLDR.

82
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.130
Do you know what that is?

83
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.050
Too Long, Didnt Read.

84
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.710
That's essentially,
like a little summary, right?

85
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.900
Say, I put a little summary
text at the top, right?

86
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.899
And I said, like up here,
like p.blog-summary.

87
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.050
Sorry.

88
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.770
There's a special trick that you can use.

89
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.996
I'm super lazy I don't like typing things
so you can hit p.blog-summary and hit tab,

90
00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.846
it'll I'll complete it for you.

91
00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:17.785
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway.

92
00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:20.445
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is that
just this good pen or?

93
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:24.075
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can get sublimed at
the same thing, but it's called EMMET,

94
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:25.544
you have to install it.

95
00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:31.215
Yeah, E-M-M-E-T, I can't live without it,
I use it every day.

96
00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:34.660
So, force of habit.

97
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.334
Okay so,
discussing what Eduardo I think asked,

98
00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:45.800
is that now I have two different
kinds of paragraphs in here, right?

99
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.080
This was when I added later.

100
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.233
If I styled everything based on
just paragraphs or just the p tag,

101
00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:55.702
Now this would receive the same style
which is not what I want, right?

102
00:06:55.702 --> 00:06:57.661
I want to have them different styles.

103
00:06:57.661 --> 00:07:00.870
So, now that I have different
classes on each one of them,

104
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.660
if I had another different
type of the same tag later?

105
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.930
I can style it differently.

106
00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:10.647
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If that doesn't make
complete sense to you right now,

107
00:07:10.647 --> 00:07:13.569
it will make sense later so, but
that kind of address is that?

108
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.485
And the other thing is you're
learning like Brian Holt

109
00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:25.600
flavoured CSS right now,
which I think I'm pretty good at.

110
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.730
Someone pays me to do it and
they've done it for a while.

111
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.660
So, it can't be that bad or maybe it can.

112
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.430
[LAUGH] Yeah?

113
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: My question is about
the new container tags in HTML5, so

114
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.101
at what point do you leverage
those in this approach?

115
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:47.680
Or do you, what's the trade off to
do it yourself versus use those?

116
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, that's a good question.

117
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.050
HTML5 has a bunch of like new
kind of like container tags,

118
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.710
and when I say container tags,
something like div.

119
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.850
One of them that we've already
talked about is article, right?.

120
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.670
These are actually kind of articles,
right, like blog posts or

121
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.000
like individual little articles.

122
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.530
It would be better to call
these articles for sure.

123
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.560
So, rather then call this like div,
call this article.

124
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.790
And again you have to change
this down here, right?

125
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.601
Because now your Tupperware just got
a little bit more specialized, right?

126
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.514
That you look at this, and he's like,

127
00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:31.250
this is like some sort of complete article
in here, that's why you would use it.

128
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.980
As far as, you notice, that it's still
rendering the exact same thing over there.

129
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.310
Nothing has changed over here.

130
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.330
It's just little cues for
yourself later to pick up later.

131
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.590
It's like, that's what this does.

132
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.038
It also has accessibility implications.

133
00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:48.920
So, like e-readers, right?

134
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.680
So, when someone that's blind
is using the internet, they have

135
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.120
things called e-readers that go through
and essentially read the internet to them.

136
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.750
And so these e-readers pick up
really well on these article queues.

137
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.700
It's like.

138
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.390
There's an article right here,
this is important.

139
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.243
Like this is what you,
this is kinda wanna read, right?

140
00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:09.922
Because the e-reader doesn't want it like,
here's the homepage, it doesn't want to go

141
00:09:09.922 --> 00:09:13.322
to like the navigation, so
it'll skip the nav part of this side but

142
00:09:13.322 --> 00:09:16.170
it'll go straight to
the articles which is awesome.

143
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.930
We wanna make the internet
accessible to everyone.

144
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.330
Great question, so article,
section is another one,

145
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.090
if you have different sections of
your website, it's a good one to use.

146
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.430
Nav is another one,
like where you have navigation.

147
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.464
Again, the e-readers will just
automatically just skip over nav,

148
00:09:33.464 --> 00:09:36.720
because who wants to know about your
navigation unless they wanna use it?

149
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:39.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Stuff like that.

150
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Are you still gonna use
classes within those new tags then?

151
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Definitely.

152
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:54.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just so that you can
point to those things uniquely at CSS.

153
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.093
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, precisely.

154
00:09:57.093 --> 00:10:01.390
And again, I have an article right
there that's called blog post.

155
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.980
But lets say, two years down the road,

156
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.900
I want a different type of article,
all right?

157
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.720
This is a guest article or
something like that.

158
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.440
They are now individually labeled.

159
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.170
I do not have to go back and
change things.

160
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.600
Like, that's, I hate going back and

161
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.350
changing code that didn't have to change,
right?

162
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.300
Like if I had just named
it better the first place,

163
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.300
I wouldn't have had to change it.

164
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.690
So, that I'm always guarding
about doing future work, right?

165
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.822
I'd rather do five minutes of work now
rather than two hours of work later.

166
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:35.061
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good questions.

167
00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:36.041
More questions?

168
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:39.881
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

169
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So was this painful?

170
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.130
Was this really shitty to do?

171
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.240
It should be, cuz I don't like it, but.

172
00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:53.585
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This become extremely
useful once we get in in the CSS because

173
00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:56.981
now this is all labeled up and
like all the Tupperware's labeled.

174
00:10:56.981 --> 00:11:01.331
We can just like now send CSS to go in,
change everything and

175
00:11:01.331 --> 00:11:03.160
it's really easy to do.

176
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:11.950
So again, spending a little bit of time
now will make things a lot easier later.

177
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.550
So we didnt do the IDs.

178
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.790
I mean what I would do here,
let's just go do it real quick.

179
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.410
So, first of all I'm just
gonna change this back to div.

180
00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:32.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something you
might notice I'm doing as well.

181
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.270
Is you can have multiple cursors
in code pen as well as in sublime.

182
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.260
Which is the thing that
we had you all install.

183
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.350
So, like i can select this and
I can select this and this and

184
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.310
I can change them all at once.

185
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.049
So, know this is thing, right.

186
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.023
I'm just doing that with Cmd-click in Mac,
I'm pretty sure it's like Ctrl-Click in

187
00:11:54.023 --> 00:11:57.021
Windows, maybe window button,
I don't remember.

188
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway, if that's
weirding you out, that's what I'm doing.

189
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.580
Okay, so
I said let's go get the blog post IDs.

190
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:14.595
So, let's just say,
this would be like blog-post-1.

191
00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:21.440
Id=blog-post-2, something like that.

192
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.900
Something that is,
you can guarantee to your future self,

193
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.080
there will never be another one
of these on the page, right.

194
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.420
So like if I said like Blog

195
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.190
post primary or something like that,
that's harder to say,

196
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.240
I can guarantee I'm never going to have
a primary blog post on the page again.

197
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.120
That's kinda the difference there.

198
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.320
If you say, there's only going to
be one first blog post, right?

199
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.810
So, that's a good one to use.

200
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.280
That make sense?

201
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.880
Again, I only put ID's when I
absolutely have to use them.

202
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.141
On the whole,
I try to just make everything a class.

203
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:05.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz IDs
are inherently not reusable, right?

204
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.173
Because they are unique you can never
use them again, classes are not and

205
00:13:11.173 --> 00:13:15.931
I'm always looking to like right one piece
of code and have to apply in many places.

206
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:22.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which again, once we
arrive to CSS we'll make more sense.
