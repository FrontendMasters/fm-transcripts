2
00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.859
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about
the great collapse for a second, h1s.

3
00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.850
Let's just say we do something dumb and
we float our h1s.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.170
Nope, that's actually gonna do okay.

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.228
And then, P,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: float: left.

6
00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:34.214
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Do I have an over?

7
00:00:34.214 --> 00:00:35.564
I have an overflow on this, that's why.

8
00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:43.553
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I have height, okay?

9
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm trying to get
something bad to happen in CSS and

10
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.928
then I have a height 0, padding bottom.

11
00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:04.781
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hm,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well I'll just talk

12
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:08.620
about it for a sec cuz I can't seem
to get it to do it real quick.

13
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.020
Anyway, so there's something that people
often refer to as the great collapse in

14
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.820
CSS, that when you start floating elements
inside of a parent div, the parent div,

15
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030
when you try and style it, collapses.

16
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.590
It'll have no height.

17
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.300
So if you have a nice background color,

18
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.760
or something like that,
it's not styling correctly.

19
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.450
This is called the great collapse because
you're putting floated elements inside of

20
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.240
an element that is itself,
trying to figure out how tall it is.

21
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.300
And so with floats inside of a parent div,
what you need to

22
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.470
do on the parent div is you need to give
it some sort of way to reset itself.

23
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.140
You'll see a lot of times
something called clearfix.

24
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.390
Or people will put overflow: hidden
in weird places in the code.

25
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.000
That's to get that parent
div to reacquire its height.

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.330
All it needs to do is just reset itself.

27
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.090
So if you notice that you're using floats
and your parent div is collapsing,

28
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.726
throw something on like,
if you put overflow: hidden,

29
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:14.180
it'll adjust itself or look up clearfix.

30
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.600
If you search for clear fix,
it'll be the first thing that'll come up.

31
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A couple questions here.

32
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.580
One, you're just kind of
questioning what no wrap is and

33
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.050
understanding white-space and
how that works.

34
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like the CSS properties?

35
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.950
Yeah so,

36
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.940
not CSS, but the browser does its
best to fit all of your text and

37
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.920
everything that it can on one line.

38
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.190
Sometimes you don't want it to wrap, so

39
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.620
you use something like white-space:
nowrap, I think is what it is, and

40
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.540
then even if you start going outside of
your div, it will not overflow your text.

41
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.766
In fact,
I think if we went back to this and

42
00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:09.562
I said like blog-post-p and
I said whitespace: nowrap.

43
00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:18.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I gotta remember.

44
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.984
It's not one of the most common ones.

45
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.929
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
notice now I have a super long page,

46
00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:29.250
because all the text
refused to wrap itself.

47
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.817
It's typically not a desirable thing,
right, but there are occasions like,

48
00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.789
you have a head or something and
it's wrapping itself in a weird way.

49
00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:42.623
So you can use whitespace: nowrap to
prevent this wrapping from happening.

50
00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:46.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then they wanna know about the clearfix.

51
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

52
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.009
I hadn't prepare a talk on it,
but let's clearfix.

53
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.020
This is the one that I typically use.

54
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.520
Nicholas Gallager, super smart guy.

55
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.328
So again, search for clearfix.

56
00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:06.141
And what he does is, all right,

57
00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:11.937
let's see if I,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

58
00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:16.870
again, you have a CSS reset,
this clearfix is just like a utility class

59
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.324
that you can just throw on
things to fix itself, so

60
00:04:20.324 --> 00:04:25.242
let's do,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just go

61
00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:26.401
to open a new CodePen.

62
00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:33.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: See if
I can get it to do it.

63
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.428
So I'm gonna have div class=parent and

64
00:04:40.428 --> 00:04:45.523
I'm gonna have .childx2,

65
00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:51.648
this is the emit stuff, maybe not.

66
00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:54.731
All right,
I guess it doesn't want to do emit for me.

67
00:04:54.731 --> 00:05:03.647
Child,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

68
00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:10.059
Div, div, div, okay?

69
00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.513
So we have a parent and two children.

70
00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.561
We're gonna have .child,

71
00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:21.025
float: left,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

72
00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:22.912
we're gonna have parent.

73
00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:27.487
Let's just collapse that one.

74
00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:30.036
background-color: red.

75
00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:41.535
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here we're gonna
have height: 20px, width: 20px.

76
00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:52.054
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
and let's just do this,

77
00:05:52.054 --> 00:05:58.342
background-color: green.

78
00:06:06.821 --> 00:06:07.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll have,

79
00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:18.287
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: padding: 30px, yeah,

80
00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:21.010
that will ruin it.

81
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.061
That will actually fix it.

82
00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:29.971
Okay, so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let me save this and

83
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:31.801
I'll put it in so people can see it.

84
00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:40.059
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just add new slide here.

85
00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:51.245
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
slide 71 will have that on there now.

86
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:55.704
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

87
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.487
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have these two things,

88
00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:04.112
I now no longer have a background of red,
right?

89
00:07:04.112 --> 00:07:06.512
Cuz you would suspect the parent
to have a background red.

90
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.632
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe before
you get into too much more,

91
00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:17.407
he just kinda wants to know
why do we need to clearfix l?

92
00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:20.234
What's the history on it?

93
00:07:20.234 --> 00:07:25.158
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So clearfix, I have
now demonstrated the effect that I'm

94
00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:29.680
trying to demonstrate,
is that you would expect this

95
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.590
parent to have a background
red between these two squares.

96
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.730
Let's just make these like 200,
so it's more, right?

97
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:45.515
You would expect this background right
here to be red, but because of the way

98
00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:50.480
floats work and parent divs heights
are determined, with floats, it doesn't

99
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.440
know what to do about the background and
so it just collapses everything.

100
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.563
So the parent,
if I put a border on the parents,

101
00:07:58.563 --> 00:08:06.130
it'll be a little line at the top,
border: 1px solid blue, right?

102
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.930
So, now notice we have this
blue line up here, right?

103
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.761
Totally weird because we would
expect it to just why don't

104
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.903
you just cover everything that's
the children cover, right?

105
00:08:16.903 --> 00:08:19.370
And it's the way
the floats are determined.

106
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.460
So there's a couple ways
to kind of fix this.

107
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.436
And the fastest way is you can
just say that on this parent is

108
00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:31.774
overflow: hidden, overflow: hidden.

109
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.510
Low and behold, it fixes itself and
now it has a background.

110
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.530
It's weird and it has to do with
the way that overflow's calculated.

111
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.010
I'm not even really sure like
the mechanics behind of why that works.

112
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.960
Just that it works.

113
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.850
[COUGH] So let's talk about clearfix.

114
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.200
That's a hack what I just showed you,
but if I throw on here clearfix.

115
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.280
So I just copied some CSS from
Nicolas Gallagher's website.

116
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.760
We're just gonna throw it on
here in the bottom, right there.

117
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.020
Don't worry about what it actually is.

118
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.130
I'm not sure why this works either.

119
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.210
But now if I throw this class on here,
cf, it also will fix it.

120
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.903
It's a little bit more clear what's
going on here, why that exists.

121
00:09:18.903 --> 00:09:20.440
You put overflow hidden on there,

122
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.469
people don't know that you're
trying to clear your flow, right?

123
00:09:23.469 --> 00:09:26.410
In this particular case,
you see cf on there.

124
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.680
It's like, okay.

125
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.630
He's doing a clearfix here.

126
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.170
He's trying to get this
float width stuff to work.

127
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.279
Does that make sense?

128
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.060
Cool.

129
00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:40.372
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's
gonna happen to you and

130
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.460
you're gonna be super
frustrated when it happens.

131
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.444
So just kinda refer back to this.
