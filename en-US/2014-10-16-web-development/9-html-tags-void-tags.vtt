2
00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:08.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Void tags or
self closing tags are essentially tags

3
00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.610
that do not need a closing tag.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.150
That's what void tags or
self closing tags mean.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.860
So if you notice for every div I have,

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.190
there's a closing div,
right, the slash div.

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.040
There are some elements that
doesn't really make sense on,

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.290
because they're kind of like,
they would never encompass something else.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.050
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Going back to the m and

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.940
strong tags, I was just wondering,

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.180
can you override that with CSS?

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Absolutely.

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.089
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Totally.

14
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.310
Cool.
So void tags.

15
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.430
You know when you're
filling out a form and

16
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.940
they have a little piece of something that
you can fill out, it says enter your name,

17
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.060
enter your last name, enter your address.

18
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.230
Those are input elements,

19
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.686
it's something that the user can
click on and then start typing into.

20
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.485
So you would never have
anything inside of an input and

21
00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.740
the fact of the matter is you can't
have anything inside those input.

22
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.391
You're not going to have
a paragraph inside of your input.

23
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:16.360
So instead of being contrived and
just doing input/input, they said let's

24
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.760
just save four keystrokes and we'll have
like a trailing slash at the end, right?

25
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.820
So that's what this trailing
slash right there means.

26
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.265
It means that this is a tag
that is self contained,

27
00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:36.710
that needs no closing tag,
it closes itself.

28
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.450
So, I think I have.

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.582
Get rid of that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have an example

30
00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:43.245
right here.

31
00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You'll find that we have
a lot of cat pictures in this workshop.

32
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.434
So if you like cats, get excited.

33
00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:06.170
[COUGH]
So,

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.760
here I have two different
self closing tags.

35
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.000
Apparently I put in attributes.

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.270
So ignore the image for right now, okay?

37
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.890
We're just gonna talk
about the input up here.

38
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.270
So the input is this thing right here,
right and

39
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.680
you can type things in it, okay.

40
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.378
Again, it doesn't make any sense to
put anything inside of there, right?

41
00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:37.350
You can't put a paragraph in here,

42
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.460
you can't put a div in here,
it's just a tag that exists by itself and

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.784
so what they have done is they have
just made this a self closing tag.

44
00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:50.840
Any more you actually don't
even have to put that slash,

45
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.430
this is actually valid as well and
it's just a tag that just never closes.

46
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.350
That's okay.

47
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.130
You'll see it quite often, you'll also
see this, both of them are valid.

48
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.610
I'd recommend at least until you
really understand about development,

49
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.270
just putting it there, it's really just
kind of an useful indicator to yourself.

50
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.500
This is what this is, right?

51
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.619
Okay, so down here, I have the IMG which
is an image tag as you might imagine,

52
00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:29.645
an image tag is just like it's a tag that
I'm gonna put a picture on the page,

53
00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:34.284
right and as you notice,
it is a self closing tag, right?

54
00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:39.000
You're not gonna put something inside
of the image or rather you can't.

55
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.710
You might want to, but you can't.

56
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.050
If you want to maybe at
the end of the class,

57
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.150
we'll show you how but it's not intuitive.

58
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.260
Okay, so that's what the image tag does.

59
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.781
Now in order for an image tag to work
you have to tell the browser this is

60
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.740
the picture I want you to use, right?

61
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.160
You can't just say please
give me a picture, right?

62
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.150
Asking the Internet for a picture
probably is not going to end well, so

63
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.390
you wanna define the picture yourself.

64
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.990
So that's what this SRC is, right?

65
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.079
It's just saying here's the picture
I want you to put here.

66
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.030
In this particular example,
I use this place kitten website where

67
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.010
you can just say like please
give me a 400 by 400 image.

68
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.960
400 is pixels, right it's 400 pixels.

69
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.040
So if I say 300,
I'll get a different picture.

70
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.007
You're so lucky, right?

71
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:37.150
You get to see cat pictures all day.

72
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.523
But what are you expecting form
someone from Reddit, right?

73
00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:42.484
It's just tons of cat pictures on Reddit.

74
00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:46.008
Okay, so
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's the place kitten

75
00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:49.235
part's not important,
they're just place holder pictures.

76
00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:54.366
So that's what this SRC is,
it's called an attribute.

77
00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.420
So sometimes
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Hey Brian,

78
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.190
you're asking what's the difference
between the bold tag and

79
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.860
the strong tag?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there is a bold tag.

80
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.750
It does exist, just don't use it.

81
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.860
It's old and I was describing the very
problem with the bold tag earlier,

82
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.280
that sometime later you're gonna want your
bold text to not be bold but be green

83
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.450
instead or just you're gonna wanna change
it to be something other than bold.

84
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.190
And in that particular case,

85
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.540
you now have a bold tag that
no longer makes things bold.

86
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.080
It just doesn't make any sense.

87
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.950
It's bad.
Don't use it.

88
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.904
Use the strong tag a bit.

89
00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:34.000
They do accomplish the same thing but

90
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.040
the strong one is going
to make more sense later.

91
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.130
All right, good question.

92
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.879
Thank you anonymous internet stranger
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

93
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.443
so.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Next question's

94
00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:51.630
about like XHTML versus HTML5?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in this class,

95
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.970
we're gonna be talking about HTML5.

96
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.730
So there are different revisions of HTML.

97
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.140
Any more, HTML5 is supported everywhere.

98
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.650
So just don't even worry about old stuff,
at least for this class.

99
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.220
You might go to a job and
you might work on like Windows XP and

100
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.680
have to use Internet Explorer 6, and then
you might have to care about like XHTML

101
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.050
and if that's the case,
I'm really really sorry.

102
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.240
[LAUGH]
But for the purpose of this class,

103
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.700
we'll be talking about HTML5 and practical
differences, they're 90% the same thing,

104
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.370
for the most part.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: And

105
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.460
then on that note on HTML 5,
they're talking about self closing tags,

106
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.930
is that considered bad practice in HTML 5?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The self-closing tags?

107
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.580
You mean having trailing slash versus
not having the trailing slash or

108
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.200
just having self-closing tags.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Yeah,

109
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.509
I believe so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

110
00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.380
well you have to have self-closing tags,
right?

111
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.450
You can't make an image any other way,
right?

112
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.450
If I did this
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is

113
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.660
not valid HTML like the closing IMG.

114
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.950
So either have to have this like
no closing tag or space like this.

115
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.527
Either one's fine.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That make sense?

116
00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:23.700
Yeah, it just doesn't exist like
it's wrong, so don't do it.

117
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.720
And it makes sense right?

118
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.130
You have an image and
just an image stands by itself,

119
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.300
it's it's own entity, it wouldn't enclose,
it's not a container.

120
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.120
It's just a thing that is, that is.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: So

121
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.340
some you have the closing complete tag,
some you have self closing tags only, and

122
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:47.600
some are void tags and self-closing?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Those

123
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.740
terms are interchangeable.

124
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.880
Self-closing and void tag,
it means exactly the same thing.

125
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.620
And some tags are self-closing,
others are not like for example,

126
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.850
you cannot have a self-closing div.

127
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.060
That's invalid as well.

128
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.680
A div must have an opening tag,
and it must have a closing tag.

129
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.400
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Like paragraph,

130
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.870
you can do both with paragraph.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, just have a like that?

131
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.790
Is that what you're saying?

132
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.600
That's not valid either,
it has to have that.

133
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.480
Now I say not valid.

134
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.010
Your browser is pretty smart and it can
kinda guess what you're trying to do, but

135
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.545
it's just like don't.

136
00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:30.298
[LAUGH] Right?

137
00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:33.057
You don't want your computer
guessing what you wanted,

138
00:08:33.057 --> 00:08:36.221
right cuz it's usually gonna get it wrong.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: I think the main

139
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:41.022
difference is a paragraph is gonna wrap
something, a div is gonna wrap something,

140
00:08:41.022 --> 00:08:45.687
each one's gonna wrap something, there's
content inside of those tags versus

141
00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:50.040
an image is an object, it's just.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's an entity that exists.

142
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.710
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Yeah, you're not

143
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.660
gonna wrap.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something in an image.

144
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.180
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: You're not gonna wrap

145
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.290
text in an image tag.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that kinda make sense?

146
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.010
I think it's just one of those
things with practice comes.

147
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.970
And another disclaimer that I'll throw out
here is I've learned a lot of things from

148
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.310
teaching my wife to code because she
yells at me when she doesn't like stuff.

149
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.930
You all are very nice that you
don't yell at me and throw things.

150
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.550
My wife is not quite that nice
when I'm teaching her things or

151
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.270
maybe I deserve it probably.

152
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.880
So it's not her problem, it's my problem.

153
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.810
I make my wife sound abusive, she's not.

154
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.698
So I love her.
Yes, so my wife wants to understand

155
00:09:34.698 --> 00:09:39.070
every little piece of something right now.

156
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.380
She's like well what is that
title doing right now, right?

157
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.830
Sometimes there's just things that it's
better to just ignore them right now and

158
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.170
try and come back and
understand them later.

159
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.070
Because like I said,

160
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.070
there's a very wide foundation you
need to get to understand HTML.

161
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.554
And so to try to understand every
micro piece of data right now,

162
00:09:58.554 --> 00:10:01.287
it's going to paralyse you, right?

163
00:10:01.287 --> 00:10:05.460
Because sometimes this has to be there but
it is not gonna make sense until you

164
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.730
understand this other piece, right,
very common thing in web development.

165
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.850
So ignorance is bliss sometimes,
I guess that's what I am trying to get at,

166
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.040
is learn to ignore something until
it's the right time to learn it.

167
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.663
Okay, so other questions before I
start talking about attributes?

168
00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:26.947
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: There's onw where I

169
00:10:26.947 --> 00:10:30.670
wonder why you are using the doc
types in here, in this HTML file,

170
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.730
is that just an example in CodePen?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, and like

171
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.090
it's just another one of those things,
I don't want to explain it right now and

172
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.360
I will explain them.
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Okay.

173
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a thing that's

174
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.780
called doc types that

175
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.450
kind of let the browser know what
type of HTML you're gonna give it.

176
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.330
That's the basic story.

177
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.760
I'm omitting it.

178
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.911
Don't omit it when you're doing it in
code, but it's okay to omit it when we're

179
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:57.964
talking about it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz right now,

180
00:10:57.964 --> 00:11:02.800
actually technically, everything's
all ready wrapped in HTML and body.

181
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.569
So you have to nest it in HTML
body which is not correct,

182
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:07.390
you can't have two body elements.

183
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.920
Anyway, okay so

184
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.140
SRC right here, okay?

185
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.490
An image needs to know where to go.

186
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.540
So sometimes these HTML, let's see if
I can even get it on the same page.

187
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.610
So notice like you have
line numbers right here.

188
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.050
So this SRC actually is on the same line,

189
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.690
it's just too long to
fit it on the same line.

190
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.945
Sometimes these HTML tags need
additional information that are kind of

191
00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:42.250
metadata about the tags, right?

192
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.265
We'll talk about classes and
IDs later, which are also attributes.

193
00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:50.223
For this particular case, you need
to tell it where the image is, and

194
00:11:50.223 --> 00:11:52.638
that's what this is
what this SRC thing is.

195
00:11:52.638 --> 00:11:56.290
And so notice,
it's enclosed within the tag.

196
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.417
So most of the time
we've just seen head and

197
00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:03.110
head is surrounded by
angle brackets right.

198
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.632
Here image is surrounding not only IMG but
and the first thing is always going to be

199
00:12:07.632 --> 00:12:12.020
what type of tag it is and then after
that the order isn't important, right?

200
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.850
[COUGH] So
the source tells it where the image is,

201
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.320
and then we close the tag afterwards.

202
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:26.460
That kind of make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

203
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.150
Well I think, again we'll repeat this
ad nauseum I use images all over this.

204
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.570
So you'll see attributes
a ton as we go forward.

205
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.630
But it's essentially like here's
more information about this

206
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.160
tag that you'll need.

207
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.570
That's kind of the point of an attribute.
