2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.109
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: First of all, this
box-sizing and border-box that we talked

3
00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.380
a little bit about before, but
this makes this so much easier, right?

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.870
Cuz the first thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna take these, actually,

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.790
I need this open, don't I?

6
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.948
Cuz I don't remember
what anything's called.

7
00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:21.610
So picture-group, right?

8
00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.665
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because
everything's in a picture-group.

9
00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.380
Yep, okay, so just make this a lot bigger.

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.830
Come on.

11
00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:53.145
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so .picture-group,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

12
00:00:53.145 --> 00:01:00.400
we're just gonna give them a width of 25%,
okay.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.280
Now they're all tightly
compacted together.

14
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.030
We're gonna say border 1 px solid black.

15
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.470
Okay, and how we're gonna float them left.

16
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.500
Okay, and
now everything is on the same line.

17
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.750
But It looks kinda dumb cuz they
all have these different heights.

18
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.380
So how you want to do
height is kinda up to you,

19
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460
you can just do something like 200
pixels or something like that.

20
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.010
That's kind of an easy way to do it.

21
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.030
Except that's not nearly high enough, so

22
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.730
let's try 400, 300, maybe like 330.

23
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.924
All right,

24
00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:54.960
good enough.

25
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.928
Let's give them a bit of padding,
a little bit more breathing room, so

26
00:01:57.928 --> 00:02:00.610
we're going to say padding five pixels or
something like that.

27
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.050
Something you're kinda gonna learn as you
go forward with this kind of stuff is that

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.070
you just kind of poke around, see what
works, poke around a little bit more,

29
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.470
see if it works better.

30
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.730
It's just kind of tooling with it, see if
it works, it's kinda the hacker attitude.

31
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.170
Okay, so
now everything's on the same line.

32
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.350
We wanted it to be centered, so
we're gonna say text-align center.

33
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.410
That's pretty much it, isn't it?

34
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.280
Yeah.

35
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.672
And then you can make it wider, and notice
it all, even when you get super small,

36
00:02:47.672 --> 00:02:51.386
which is bad but whatever,
you might want to say overflow hidden, so

37
00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:53.394
it doesn't flow into the other one.

38
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.150
But there you go.
