2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.700
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
I have my JavaScript here.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.840
I have three different kinds of
statements that will help put results and

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.650
they're all commented out.

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.490
So we can un-comment them one by one.

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.450
Let's see what happens.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.090
So when I run this code,
I get a super annoying dialog

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.070
box when I uncomment this out.

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.550
And if you don't want that dialog
box popping up every time you

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.340
can put that comment back in front of it.

11
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.613
This will write directly to the HTML page.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

12
00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:46.240
this will log to the console.

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.620
As you see though, nothing happened, and

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.810
that's because we don't
have our console open.

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.368
So if we go to view, Developer,
and the JavaScript console,

16
00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:03.698
we'll see our output right here.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Nina,

17
00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:08.611
Eduardo is wondering
your opinion about having

18
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:13.031
to deal with JavaScript being disabled and

19
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:19.940
developing a non-JavaScript version.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's always a risk.

20
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.382
But my thought on it is unless
you're writing code for

21
00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.490
corporate use,

22
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.686
in that case you know Java script is
going to be disabled ahead of time.

23
00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:38.710
If your code's just out there, it's like,
if a person chooses to have Java

24
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.090
script off that's their choice, there's
really not much you can do about it.

25
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.490
There are some mobile browsers that
might not be able to parse it and

26
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.508
if those are your users,
you should try to take care of them.

27
00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:57.528
&gt;&gt; Student 2: I'll say that at Reddit we

28
00:01:57.528 --> 00:02:03.930
do not have a non JavaScript
version of the site.

29
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.120
We assume that our users have JavaScript
because we've looked at our analytics and

30
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.890
much over 90% of them, in fact,
closer to 97% of our users

31
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.714
have JavaScript enabled.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If you don't,

32
00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:22.260
you might be using an ancient computer
that might not be able to parse the site

33
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.757
anyway, or you're doing as choice,
in which case...

34
00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:27.423
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Some of the browser

35
00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:32.008
manufacturers are even
talking about just removing

36
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.246
the ability to disable JavaScript.

37
00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:41.449
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

38
00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:45.000
does everyone see that
hello console down here?

39
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.140
Okay, for several of the future exercises
we're gonna be using this console to,

40
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.040
let's see,
