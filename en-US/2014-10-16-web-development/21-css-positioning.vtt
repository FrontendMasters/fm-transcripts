[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:07.236
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Talking about it,
are we gonna go in to positioning in CSS,

3
00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:09.579
learning the best practices for top left,

4
00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.425
bottom right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure, so something that's

5
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:18.288
kind of even beyond this box
model right here is that,

6
00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:22.395
you can actually use
this tag property called

7
00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:26.091
position to move stuff around, right?

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.169
So, let's say you have this box and

9
00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.371
you wanted to be just three
pixels to the left, right?

10
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.451
You can do position and
you can move it across.

11
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.250
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's show you

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.540
a couple things right now actually.

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.087
So let's go back to this Google
thing right here, right?

14
00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:48.707
So, I'm gonna just right click on here,
and I'm gonna say Inspect Element,

15
00:00:48.707 --> 00:00:54.293
just like what Nina was doing earlier.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll

16
00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:56.807
make this just a little bit smaller.

17
00:00:56.807 --> 00:01:03.374
No, that's right, we're okay right there?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

18
00:01:03.374 --> 00:01:08.330
so, you notice we've got this
thing over here that says Styles.

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.211
This is actually the CSS that's
being applied to that img, right?

20
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:16.695
These are the rules that we
were just barely writing and

21
00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.671
what is being applied to that.

22
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:23.769
So, up here we can start doing things

23
00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:28.390
like background-color: red.

24
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.432
Pretty cool, right?

25
00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.332
So, we can actually start
messing around with the CSS.

26
00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:34.278
And you can actually just say like,
I don't want this to have so

27
00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:34.953
much padding on top.

28
00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:38.260
So you can just like uncheck that and
it's no longer a padding on the top.

29
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.500
So, just what this question is asking,
there is another one called position.

30
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.570
And position, you can kind of tell,

31
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.260
this is how I want you to determine
where you are on the page, right?

32
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.280
So if I say position: absolute,
that sounds

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.800
like I'm going to tell you absolutely
on the page where I want you to be in.

34
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.091
So in this particular case,
I can say, top: 0 px.

35
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.573
So now it's on the very top of the page.

36
00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:12.571
And I can say, right: 0px, right?

37
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.704
And now it's absolutely,
if you look at this page now,

38
00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:18.381
absolute position at
the top right of the page.

39
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:25.540
Or I can say, a 100 pixels, now it's
a 100 pixels from the right of the page.

40
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.140
You can also go negative as well, right?

41
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.810
So if I say negative, so
it's going off the page, right?

42
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.660
So, there's several ways
you can do this as well.

43
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.270
Like there's position absolute which
just likes leave it there, right?

44
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.921
If I say, let's take this off so
it's right.

45
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:48.481
If I say fixed now, okay?

46
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:52.370
Now if I start scrolling, look,
it actually like stays in place.

47
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.901
It's fixed within your view port, right?

48
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.021
So you have to think of your page
in two different heights, right?

49
00:02:59.021 --> 00:03:03.141
There's actually the height of the entire
page, including what's not on the screen,

50
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.925
and there's also height in terms
of what is your view port,

51
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.296
what can you actually see.

52
00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:12.280
And so, position: fixed, is in terms
of your view port, position: absolute,

53
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.340
is in terms of the entire page altogether.

54
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.788
So even though whether your
position on the page is changing,

55
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:25.462
your position on
the viewport doesn't change,

56
00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:31.482
because your viewport is just your
viewport, it's always where it is, okay?

57
00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:36.306
Now there's position, sorry, relative,
we'll leave that at 10 pixels or

58
00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:37.101
something.

59
00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:40.301
Position: relative,

60
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.921
come on.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Relative.

61
00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:48.411
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

62
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:55.107
relative is kind of an interesting one
because what relative says is okay,

63
00:03:55.107 --> 00:04:01.168
go ahead and put yourself wherever
you were going to put yourself and

64
00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:04.381
then from there, go here, right?

65
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:08.301
So in this particular case,
I have position relative.

66
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:12.450
It puts itself like right here and
I say, from there, go 10 pixels down.

67
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.100
Or from there,
go a 100 pixels to the left.

68
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.510
Well, let's just leave this in terms of.

69
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.260
Okay, so
go to where you are supposed to be, so

70
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.820
in this particular case let's
just uncheck these, right?

71
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.471
So that's where it would be if
nothing was effecting it, right?

72
00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:34.693
Then from there,
I want you to go right, a 100 pixels.

73
00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:36.830
Does that kind of make sense?

74
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.330
Little bit?

75
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.550
So, I have now set all of this, right?

76
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.360
And, like you now know
how to reposition things.

77
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.870
People that are new to web development
want to abuse this, right?

78
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.031
They want to use position relative or
position whatever for everything.

79
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.244
That's not necessarily the best
way to do it because then you

80
00:05:01.244 --> 00:05:04.272
start kind of getting into
weird flows of your document.

81
00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:09.398
We're gonna to go over documents flow in
just a second, but [COUGH] suffice to

82
00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:15.320
say that it makes, putting elements
next to each other really difficult.

83
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.336
So, if you notice here,
the one that I checked off that Google

84
00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:25.373
already had on there was position top or
padding top, right?

85
00:05:25.373 --> 00:05:28.743
You wanna stick more to padding and
margins to get things together because

86
00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:32.511
then it makes things actually take up the
space that they're supposed to take up.

87
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:36.740
So in this particular case, we now
have this padding top on top of it and

88
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.911
now nothing can flow into
that padding top, right?

89
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.691
It's taking up that space so
nothing will flow into it.

90
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:46.127
And in your case,
it's totally seamless to you,

91
00:05:46.127 --> 00:05:48.451
you have no idea that that's padding,
right?

92
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:51.328
But if you loook at it filled with
background color on it then you

93
00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:52.591
can tell that it's there.

94
00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:57.472
But, you might ask,
I want it to have background color,

95
00:05:57.472 --> 00:06:02.671
just on the logo, but
I also want it to be down that 112px.

96
00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:06.898
So if you change that to margin, you'll
have the same position, but as you know,

97
00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:10.971
background color doesn't go out to
the margins, it just covers the padding.

98
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:14.880
So, yeah, that's how you do it.

99
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.000
That's why you would use margin.

100
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.625
Do we follow, does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: He had a kinda list of more

101
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:26.427
questions, but
I think you may have covered most of them.

102
00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:32.331
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I guess, so like when to use

103
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:36.869
floats versus position properties.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

104
00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:38.727
we're about to go into floats.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay.

105
00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:39.845
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's the next thing we're

106
00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:43.128
gonna talk about.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then, I guess, yeah, so,

107
00:06:43.128 --> 00:06:47.579
if you're gonna cover that,
might cover most of that and

108
00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:52.307
then just kind of a general
question on what CSS frameworks do

109
00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:53.810
you recommend?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's

110
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.660
an interesting question.

111
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.560
So, there's kind of this
concept of a CSS framework.

112
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.010
We haven't actually got into frameworks.

113
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.310
We're actually going to talk about
jQuery which is a JavaScript tool set.

114
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.720
The difference there is minor, so don't
worry about tool set versus framework.

115
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.690
Anyway, it's essentially code
that someone else has written,

116
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.960
that makes your job easier, right?

117
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.010
Don't reinvent the wheel,
someone's already invented it.

118
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.660
So, the one that's popular is Bootstrap.

119
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.150
We're not gonna talk too much about it.

120
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.420
But, let's get rid of this, right?

121
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.060
Some guys over at Twitter and
GitHub made a bunch of really useful CSS.

122
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.970
This looks really nice, right?

123
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.440
They just give you a bunch of styles and
says like here's a bunch of good ideas,

124
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.260
why don't you go ahead and stick to that.

125
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.306
It's great for
if you're just starting out,

126
00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:47.456
if you just wanna get a site
out really quickly and

127
00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:51.556
you don't wanna worry about the styles,
just throw some Bootstrap on it.

128
00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:55.220
And with Bootstrap,
all you have to do is you throw on,

129
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.545
I want this to look kinda,
I'll show you, right?

130
00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:06.967
Come on.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,

131
00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:12.647
blah, blah, blah, blah, I want like
buttons or something like that, all right?

132
00:08:12.647 --> 00:08:16.637
So like you think of a button, you think
of a normal really ugly gray button that

133
00:08:16.637 --> 00:08:18.520
your operating system has, right?

134
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.840
If you don't want it to look like that,

135
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.040
all you have to do is throw on button,
button default, and bam.

136
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.720
And it just looks like that.

137
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.402
You didn't have to write new CSS,

138
00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:29.901
someone wrote CSS that you
can just throw on there.

139
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.261
Or I want it to be a warning button,
right?

140
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:36.600
So you do button,
button warning, kablam, right?

141
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.410
Suddenly, you have a pretty button
that has a nice little hover state, so

142
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:48.670
if I hover over it,it gets darker,
if I press it, it looks different, right?

143
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.600
That's kind of the idea there.

144
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.450
So this is a CSS framework, it's called
Bootstrap, there's a couple of them,

145
00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.580
there's like Foundation and
Inuit, some other ones.

146
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.240
Which ones do I recommend?

147
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.965
I recommend none of them [LAUGH] if you're
actually going to be building a big

148
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:09.901
product that you want to
control how it looks.

149
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:13.287
If you're just building a proof of concept
that you wanna build on the weekend,

150
00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:16.081
you don't want to worry about how
it looks, Bootstrap is great.

151
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.950
It's the only one I really
had any experience with.

152
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.571
I know the guys that do it,
they do an awesome job.

153
00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:25.831
They're all designers, so
it all looks really nice.

154
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.773
So, yeah, Bootstrap if you
wanna try something like that,

155
00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:32.104
that's the one I would recommend.
