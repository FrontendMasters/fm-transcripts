00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.393
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
let's talk about NPM.

3
00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:10.414
NPM stands for node package manager.

4
00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:14.233
So remember when we used jQuery, we were
pulling in code that someone else wrote

5
00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.710
to make our life a little bit easier.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.490
Right, typically the way we do that we
have to go out to take first website

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.290
download their code, put it on our
server and server from a server,

8
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.562
we have to go to their server and
pull down their code from their server and

9
00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:33.895
put it on our webpage, and
that's all fine, it works.

10
00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:37.665
Node kinda took this a step further and
they introduced a package manager,

11
00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.265
I mean, they didn't introduce that, but

12
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:41.385
they're just leveraging that
which is already existent.

13
00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.775
And now if we want to go out and

14
00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:48.925
grab someone else's code, it's really
as easy as saying NPM install blah,

15
00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:54.180
and then all of a sudden this code is
now on your server and ready to be used.

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.130
Super cool, right?

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.470
It's just super convenient.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.410
And great news, if you got through that
last example, you already have it.

19
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.420
Because you have to have
NPM if you have node.

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.150
We're just going to give you
a really basic tutorial on, well,

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.540
just introductory to it.

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.380
So first of all to introduce why
we're gonna install nodemon.

23
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.750
Or nodemon I've heard it called
all sorts of weird stuff.

24
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.920
I'm gonna introduce to you
why this is useful first.

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.470
So my server is still
running right now and

26
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.430
I want to say like hello Minnesota
instead of hello world, right?

27
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.820
So I change this, I save it okay.

28
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.560
And come back to my app.

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280
And I'm gonna refresh it.

30
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.820
Notice it's actually still saying hello
world, even though I changed it and

31
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.820
I saved it.

32
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.880
And the reason being is like your
server actually has to restart itself.

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.070
Because your server has to reset
itself backup before it will actually

34
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.900
recognize those changes.

35
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.670
So, in order to stop the server, we're
gonna hit control and we're gonna hit C.

36
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.970
The letter C, right?

37
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.563
That should stop your server.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, that's just your

38
00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:11.964
keyboard sending to the server, please,
shut yourself down, I'm done with you.

39
00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:16.057
Now I'm going to run it again,
I'm going to say, node app.js.

40
00:02:16.057 --> 00:02:19.305
Okay and if I go back and refresh,
what do you imagine you're gonna see?

41
00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:21.355
Hello world, apparently.

42
00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:30.112
Am I changing the right one?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did

43
00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:33.637
you save it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Thought I saved it.

44
00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:43.721
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Has anyone else seen

45
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:48.343
Hello Minnesota?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is just pure bizarre.

46
00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:50.885
You know why, I'm changing the wrong one,

47
00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:56.336
that's why.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have two of them open.

48
00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:04.551
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which one am I changing,

49
00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.936
that is a good question.

50
00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:16.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, talks.

51
00:03:33.827 --> 00:03:41.689
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: App &gt; basic &gt; app.js.

52
00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.650
Okay, that's right.

53
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.080
And where am I?

54
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.468
I'm on desktop, okay, so,

55
00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:54.278
I was in the wrong one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

56
00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:56.606
and I'm going to say no, to app.js.

57
00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.923
That should now say Hello Minnesota.

58
00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:05.359
Ta-da.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,

59
00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.200
so that's super annoying, right?

60
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.610
To have to go Ctrl+C and
restart your server every single time.

61
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.870
Another little trick, if you notice, if
I hit up on my keyboard it's going to go

62
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.970
back to the last command
that was in there.

63
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.130
I've been doing that a bunch too.

64
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.060
Anyway, point in case, it's super
annoying to have to restart your server.

65
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.440
Every time I save a file,
I just want my server to restart, okay.

66
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.150
So I'm gonna say npm install -g,
which stands for

67
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.780
globally, and
I'll explain that in a sec, nodemon.

68
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.180
Go ahead and hit enter.

69
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.790
Mine's gonna error out
cuz I already have it.

70
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.820
Maybe not.

71
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.080
Maybe it's gonna update it
which is probably a good thing.

72
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.160
You can see just like npm vomit all over

73
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.680
your screen right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which is

74
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.530
what were you typing in?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I will type it here

75
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.350
again just a sec.

76
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.700
Is that working for most people?

77
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.542
Is anyone getting like permission denied?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Getting makedir errors,

78
00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:09.512
which just might be permissions.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, okay, so

79
00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:15.426
if you're getting that you're
gonna need to type sudo.

80
00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:16.879
And then you're gonna type npm.

81
00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.237
And everything that I say from
here on out you're gonna have

82
00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.076
to type sudo in front of.

83
00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:27.516
Okay, so you're gonna say sudo

84
00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:31.970
install -g nodemon like that.

85
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.168
It's gonna ask you for your password,
it's the same one that you log in with.

86
00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:48.225
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And is that working for

87
00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:48.744
you now?

88
00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:58.391
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

89
00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.014
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think so, it was quiet for

90
00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:01.855
awhile, thinking.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

91
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:07.114
we're probably sending out a lot of
requests all at once [INAUDIBLE]

92
00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.801
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]

93
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:14.580
her server error.

94
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:24.184
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

95
00:06:24.992 --> 00:06:27.082
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, for other people,

96
00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:28.511
is this working?

97
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:32.319
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact you don't have to

98
00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.646
actually put sudo in front,

99
00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:36.480
this is the only one that you'll
have to put sudo in front of.

100
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.540
Anyway, what sudo means, for
those who are not familiar with that, it

101
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.610
actually stands for switch user and
then do, don't actually worry about that,

102
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.340
but your computer has lots of guards
to make sure that other people

103
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.470
aren't doing weird things to your
computer like people aren't coming in and

104
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.700
stealing all your files and
changing all your files.

105
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.510
And so they have this idea of permissions
that certain users only have permissions

106
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.990
to do certain things.

107
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.970
Now as probably the sole proprietor
of your computer you have

108
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.840
most of those permissions.

109
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.740
But your computer really tries to guard
even you against against like blowing up

110
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.000
your computer.

111
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.730
It's like, and so they make you
put the suit on front of things

112
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.350
just like to make sure that you're
about to do something very powerful and

113
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.740
could control this screw yourself up.

114
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.211
You type sudo,
this is now on you and not on me.

115
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:32.038
Cuz Linux doesn't like to be blamed or
Unix for that matter, okay.

116
00:07:32.038 --> 00:07:36.956
Question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So after nevermind.

117
00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.370
We should get somebody at the bottom.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

118
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And then you.

119
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I think it's something

120
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.250
that looks like this with
like a little tree or

121
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.115
something like that at the bottom
then everything's A-OK.

122
00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:50.030
So now let's go ahead and test it out.

123
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.905
You should be able to type nodemon and

124
00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:57.189
type app.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it should give you some

125
00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:02.135
sort of output looking like that, okay?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now it should be

126
00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:04.615
able to come back and say Hello Utah.

127
00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:05.828
Okay, save that.

128
00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:12.821
Notice that it restarted due to changes,
starting node app.js.

129
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:13.707
You should be able to refresh.

130
00:08:13.707 --> 00:08:15.693
I didn't have to stop my server and
restart it,

131
00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:20.168
it just restarted itself.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty cool.

132
00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:23.027
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: What was that command again?

133
00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:26.339
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nodemon app.js,

134
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.300
this one?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

135
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.816
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let me see,

136
00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:30.591
let me clear it and

137
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:36.171
then I'll put it up there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is

138
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:40.033
that working for most people?

139
00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:41.080
All right, cool.

140
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.320
There's lots of utilities like that for
node.

141
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.490
That happens to be a super easy one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do

142
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.570
you think you might be able to
show the process on Windows?

143
00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:01.040
On the chatroom it's having problems.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I can give it a shot.

144
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.961
I don't actually even have node
installed on my windows box yet.

145
00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.571
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyone here running Windows

146
00:09:17.571 --> 00:09:19.506
and get it?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And got it?

147
00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:21.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, was it like the,

148
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.700
was the process much different?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: No.

149
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

150
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.260
it's just npm install-g,
and that worked, cool.

151
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.200
So really the steps that I just went
through should work for Windows.

152
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.729
But let's just node

153
00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:46.836
js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

154
00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.789
think this is actually a huge file.

155
00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.224
No, it's not too bad.

156
00:10:01.762 --> 00:10:03.821
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, well I'm,

157
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:07.043
I'll just explain it again.

158
00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:12.781
So I'm gonna say npm install, that's
assuming that you have node install right?

159
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:15.502
If you don't have node install
then this isn't going to work.

160
00:10:15.502 --> 00:10:20.119
-g nodemon and if you're on
Windows that should just work.

161
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:28.087
I don't think there's even the concept
of sudo on git bash so or on the cmd so.

162
00:10:28.087 --> 00:10:30.060
Just do that, it should run,
it should work.

163
