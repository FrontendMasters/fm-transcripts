[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just open
another CodePen right now.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.220
codepen.io, just kinda wing this.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.700
All right, so we're gonna have a div here.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.638
In case you're wondering,

6
00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:25.210
I do lotsof shortcuts cuz
it's just like second html's.

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.730
So right now I just wrote div.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.510
Your browser is aware of which one,
it's like waiting to close.

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.040
So if you hit, I don't know how to do this
in Windows so I apologize in advance.

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.850
So if you hit option, command,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.750
period it'll close whatever
tag you currently have open.

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.310
And that's a little trick or

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.690
like I was showing them earlier
with Emmit you can just hit tab.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.000
You can type out whatever
the tab name is and hit tab and

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.320
it'll also make it as well.

16
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.120
Just fun little tricks.

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.630
All right so
we're gonna do a div rule, okay.

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.020
It's gonna have a height of 100px and
a width of 200px.

19
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.420
And we'll just give it
a border 2px solid red, right?

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.409
Okay, so now we have this box that
we can start toying around with.

21
00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:26.370
Okay, we also talked a little
bit about border box, so

22
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.360
you're wondering how you actually do that,
so let's just do that real quick.

23
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.310
You just do box, sizing, border, box.

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.260
Border fox.

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.166
Ha, what does the border box say?

26
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool.

27
00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:51.440
So that asterisk right there means
apply this to all of everything, right.

28
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.110
Apply this to everything on my page.

29
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.277
I would recommend never using
it except in this one use case.

30
00:01:57.277 --> 00:01:58.549
[LAUGH] Right.

31
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.290
This will make everything into
the border-box frame of mind instead of

32
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.000
the content box which is the old way and
it's awful and don't do it.

33
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.410
But just grab this snippet and just
throw it on every page that you work on.

34
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.584
That's just my suggestion.

35
00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:25.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
there are shortcuts for lots of things.

36
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.450
For example, I can say margin,
top 10 pixels, right?

37
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.650
Or let's maybe do 50 pixels so
it's a little bit more pronounced.

38
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.960
Okay, and notice it's moving
down the page a little bit.

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.010
We'll just do a background color of

40
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.060
orange or something like that.

41
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.510
I'm a designer, I make pretty things.

42
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.194
Okay, so we have margin top right now and
you can do that,

43
00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:07.500
and you can say margin-left 200 pixels.

44
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.020
It's going to move it in 200 pixels.

45
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.304
And let's just put some text in here.

46
00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:16.199
I am here.

47
00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.456
Right, so now it's going to
have a little text in here.

48
00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:24.188
Right like I don't like that it
pushes right up against this so

49
00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:28.620
I can say padding, top, 50 pixels, right?

50
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you make the CSS so
it shows the top?

51
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
I could just close this one out.

52
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.586
That's just going to have div in
the syntax, so that's all that's gonna be.

53
00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:46.091
Okay so
padding-top is now moving it down 50px or

54
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:50.330
30px or something like that, okay.

55
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.610
So as you notice if I have
to add margins at the top,

56
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.420
to the left to the right to
the bottom it's for both, right.

57
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.720
So I have to write four lines of it.

58
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.420
So they've made it easy and lazy for you.

59
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.050
So, let's just do that really quick.

60
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.632
So, you can just say margin right?

61
00:04:06.632 --> 00:04:10.604
And let's say I want to have the same
margin on my left and on my right, and

62
00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:14.772
I want to have the same margin on my top
and bottom, wich is a really use case,

63
00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:18.910
top and bottom have the same margin and
left and right have the same margin.

64
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.090
So if I say 10 px, 20 px.

65
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.350
Let's do 10 px, 200 px so
it's really pronounced, right?

66
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.430
10 px is going to be top and bottom,
200px is going to be left and right.

67
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.520
Or, if I just delete it.

68
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.740
Then it's all sides.

69
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.498
All sides now all have
a margin of 200 pixels.

70
00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:52.670
[COUGH] Where'd it go?

71
00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe 100 pixels.

72
00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:02.917
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's interesting.

73
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There it goes,
just took awhile, all right.

74
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.560
Okay, so, it's because the server's
taking a long time, that's why.

75
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.710
Okay, so but
that's what that margin does, right.

76
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.370
It's saying, if you have one number.

77
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.330
It knows, okay, apply this to all sides.

78
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.210
If you have two numbers,
it says top and bottom, left and right.

79
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.510
There is a way to do three numbers.

80
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.830
Don't worry about it because no
one ever does three numbers.

81
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.860
But there's one for four numbers.

82
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.834
That's top, right, bottom, left,
which would be opposite for you.

83
00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:44.940
Right, but if I say 50 pixels, 20 pixels,

84
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.990
30 pixels, top is 50 pixels,

85
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.330
right is 10 pixels,
bottom is 20 pixels and left is 30 pixels.

86
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.250
It's just short hand,
if it's super confusing for

87
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.510
you don't use it, right,
just write it out and that's totally fine.

88
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.520
But just be aware like that's,
that exists, that's what's happening.

89
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.780
You'll probably eventually
get to a point where

90
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.210
you just wanna do it because
you're lazy like me.

91
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.930
So that applies to margin,
that applies to padding.

92
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.380
Padding works exactly the same way.

93
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.440
There's a bunch of little
shorthand stuff for it.

94
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.650
In fact we can do that if you want.

95
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.289
Padding, we'll just do 10 pixels,
20 pixels, right and

96
00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.420
then now we'll have that.

97
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.588
Top and bottom 10 pixels,
left and right 20 pixels.

98
00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:40.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

99
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The star,

100
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.010
sorry, is that just a unix star
where it's saying everything?

101
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, wild card,
is what it's called.

102
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.100
It just means apply this
to everything on the page,

103
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.130
every element that ever put on the page,
put a box size and border box on it

104
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.200
and I will again just recommend
putting on every CSS you do.

105
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.540
It'll make your life a lot easier.

106
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.870
And again I would not recommend it for
anything else.

107
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.460
Like, for example,

108
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.920
if you wanted all of your text to have
a different font or something like that

109
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.868
I would recommend putting that on
body as opposed to the wild card.

110
00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:28.198
And say font-family which is what
you do if you wanna change fonts and

111
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:32.469
you can say monospace or
something like that.

112
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:36.345
Change the font to Verdana or
something like that.

113
00:07:40.392 --> 00:07:40.892
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something like that.
