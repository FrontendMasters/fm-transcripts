[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:06.449
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Remember that blog
post that we were looking at earlier.

3
00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:09.660
Open the code pen right here.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.260
I believe it's the same one.

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.660
And I want you to go
give names to everything.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.571
So let's just take a look.

7
00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:33.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about it?

8
00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:41.626
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So when I say names to
everything, everything inside the body.

9
00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:44.830
You're not gonna ever give
classes to things in your head or

10
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.490
something like that.

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.340
Your body will never have a class
cuz there's only one body.

12
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.310
Your HTML will never have class cuz
there's only one HTML on your page.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.460
So everything inside
the body needs a class.

14
00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:08.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another caveat I will give
you is that most things will have a class,

15
00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:12.940
and I wiould say most
things do not have an ID.

16
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.120
This is kind of getting into the way
that Brian develops versus the way that

17
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.110
other developers develop.

18
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.106
I only use IDs when I absolutely have to
address something individually right?

19
00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:26.110
I'm not gonna go and give,
like I was showing blog post one,

20
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.040
blog post two,
I would like never actually like do that.

21
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.200
Unless I actually had to always
address blog post two or

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.580
something like that then I would go do it.

23
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.660
Whereas everything will have a class.

24
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.670
Right?
Even if I'm not even styling or

25
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.060
doing something to it based on class,

26
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.570
I will give it a class
just to label it later.

27
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.020
Kind of just like if you have non
see-through Tupperware you don't want to

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.048
have to open it every
time to see what is it.

29
00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:55.896
You just wanna stick a label on it so that
you can pull it out, say this is meatloaf

30
00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:59.937
or something like that, and then you can
just stick it back or something like that.

31
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:05.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So don't worry about IDs.

32
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.500
You can skip those.

33
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.765
Just give everything a class.

34
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:17.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if there's also any of
those that you don't know what they are.

35
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.337
First of all, that's kind of the good
thing cuz any would look kind of hit home

36
00:02:23.337 --> 00:02:27.027
the points that it's good to label
everything so when you come back to it or

37
00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:28.991
right now you're looking at my code and

38
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:31.337
I wrote bad code cuz I
didn't label anything.

39
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:36.759
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it will kind of drive
home the point that when you're writing

40
00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.860
code for other people, you wanna give
them indicators of what you're doing.

41
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:54.577
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another point to hit
home is that this paragraph, and

42
00:02:54.577 --> 00:03:00.550
this paragraph, they're just
paragraphs in a blog post, right?

43
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.750
So, ideally, they would have
the same class name, right?

44
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.070
Because we wanna treat them the same.

45
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.710
Or if you're talking about
this Blog post 1 and

46
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.970
Blog post 2 titles,
they're both blog post titles.

47
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.120
And so they should both be
named the same thing, right?

48
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.822
Cuz we wanna treat them the same way.

49
00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:28.811
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

50
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.145
Cool.

51
00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:46.131
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This seems kind of like
a pain in the ass it's cuz it is,

52
00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:48.203
it's a pain in the ass.

53
00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:50.390
But you did not come to this class for
comfort.

54
00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.131
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Front and
masters is not a comfortable experience.

55
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:04.331
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should make

56
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.489
that your tag line, I'm just kidding.

57
00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.302
[LAUGH]

58
00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:25.569
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

59
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.531
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So [INAUDIBLE].

60
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:32.219
Conflicting attributes in your
CSS between a class and the ID,

61
00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.262
which one takes priority?

62
00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:35.446
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The ID.

63
00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.212
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which we'll
also talk about later.

64
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

65
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.853
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Typing about the exercise,
she's asking for

66
00:04:56.853 --> 00:05:01.156
naming blog title or,
would you name it something blog titled?

67
00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:05.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that's a really good,
one that's probably what I would call it.

68
00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:12.752
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you like see it's lots
of typing so four, five more minutes,

69
00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:13.990
that feel good.

70
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And
then just kind of asking.

71
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.130
I'm not quite sure if I understand,

72
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.180
but if you want to use the same style
in another part, how would you do that?

73
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.245
Just by using that same class right,
that applies?

74
00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:30.088
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, definitely.

75
00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:31.891
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thanks for answering.

76
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:32.947
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

77
00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:39.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again we'll go in
depth once we hit the CSS section,

78
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.107
which is next.

79
00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:42.312
Probably after lunch.

80
00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:59.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I can go back to
the requirements, if you want to.

81
00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:10.632
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

82
00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:14.470
Worry more about two,
if you get to three than that's cool too,

83
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.251
but I'm more concerned about classes,
that's the more important part here.

84
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:46.867
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is anyone having trouble
discerning what the container is actually?

85
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:50.034
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

86
00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.925
which one is giving you issues?

87
00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:57.828
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [INAUDIBLE]

88
00:06:57.828 --> 00:07:02.936
class.

89
00:07:02.936 --> 00:07:04.002
Right?

90
00:07:04.002 --> 00:07:06.429
And paragraphs, right?

91
00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:07.624
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

92
00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:09.171
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Just giving them names?

93
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm.

94
00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:15.442
&gt;&gt; `
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

95
00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:17.054
essentially I've given you a marker and

96
00:07:17.054 --> 00:07:19.125
told you to label all
the tupperware in the fridge.

97
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:20.280
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's kind of

98
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.330
the exercise here.

99
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But it's already labeled,
I guess I'll just-

100
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.382
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it is,

101
00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:30.732
I mean in as much that you know it's
a dip or you know it's an H-1, right?

102
00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:31.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

103
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
what kind of H-1 is this?

104
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:41.020
Let's say I have a page and this is
only one tenth of what's on the page and

105
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.230
I have 50 different kinds of paragraphs
on there, what kind of paragraph is this?

106
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.560
So this is a blog, right?

107
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.662
And so, these kind of paragraphs
are blog paragraphs, right?

108
00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:57.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Might be kind
of a good thing to call it.

109
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.720
If you call it a blog paragraph, I'm just
throwing out answers left and right.

110
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.369
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: That would be for P, right?

111
00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:04.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

112
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So,
you said they're already labelled,

113
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.789
they're already labelled Tupperware.

114
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
I mean it's like I can go give you

115
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.460
50 different Tupperwares that have,
I mean, they're all Tupperware.

116
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.050
You can just say go and give a mark and

117
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.850
say this is the Tupperware, this is
the Tupperware, this is the Tupperware.

118
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.510
Not very useful, right?

119
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.920
Rather, you wanna say this
type of work contains this.

120
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.440
So this paragraph contains
a blog paragraph, right?

121
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.460
It contains blog type text.

122
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.067
Or like that first div up there,
like what's inside of that div?

123
00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:49.822
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's
an entire blog post right?

124
00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.304
Might can be called of that.

125
00:08:54.963 --> 00:08:56.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something
else I didn't quite.

126
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.020
So let's see,
yeah we'll just start going through it.

127
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.970
Or does anyone need more time?

128
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.336
All right, let's do this.

129
00:09:07.336 --> 00:09:11.752
Cool, so.

130
00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:13.840
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Before you start,

131
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.980
he's saying you want separate classes for
blog posts but titles and

132
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.385
paragraphs and share the same classes.

133
00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:23.496
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I want, so different,

134
00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:28.845
I want the blog posts to all
have the same class, right?

135
00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:32.965
Everything that is semantically
the same should have the same class.

136
00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:34.455
But they might have different IDs.

137
00:09:34.455 --> 00:09:37.655
In fact, if they have IDs,
they should be different IDs.
