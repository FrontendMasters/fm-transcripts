[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:06.449
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Remember that blog
post that we were looking at earlier.

3
00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:09.660
Open the code pen right here.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.260
I believe it's the same one.

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.660
And I want you to go
give names to everything.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.571
So let's just take a look.

7
00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:35.438
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

8
00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:41.626
when I say names to everything,
everything inside the body.

9
00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:44.830
You're not gonna ever give
classes to things in your head or

10
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.490
something like that.

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.340
Your body will never have a class
cuz there's only one body.

12
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.310
Your HTML will never have class cuz
there's only one HTML on your page.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.460
So everything inside
the body needs a class.

14
00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:03.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another caveat I will give

15
00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:08.488
you is that most things will have a class,
and

16
00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:12.940
I wiould say most things
do not have an ID.

17
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.120
This is kind of getting into the way
that Brian develops versus the way that

18
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.110
other developers develop.

19
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.106
I only use IDs when I absolutely have to
address something individually right?

20
00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:26.110
I'm not gonna go and give,
like I was showing blog post one,

21
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.040
blog post two,
I would like never actually like do that.

22
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.200
Unless I actually had to always
address blog post two or

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.580
something like that then I would go do it.

24
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.660
Whereas everything will have a class.

25
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.670
Right?
Even if I'm not even styling or

26
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.060
doing something to it based on class,

27
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.570
I will give it a class
just to label it later.

28
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.020
Kind of just like if you have non
see-through Tupperware you don't want to

29
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.048
have to open it every
time to see what is it.

30
00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:55.896
You just wanna stick a label on it so that
you can pull it out, say this is meatloaf

31
00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:58.827
or something like that, and
then you can just stick it back or

32
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:05.910
something like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So don't worry about IDs.

33
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.500
You can skip those.

34
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.251
Just give everything a class.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

35
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:17.780
if there's also any of those that
you don't know what they are.

36
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.337
First of all, that's kind of the good
thing cuz any would look kind of hit home

37
00:02:23.337 --> 00:02:27.027
the points that it's good to label
everything so when you come back to it or

38
00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:30.418
right now you're looking at my code and
I wrote bad code cuz I didn't

39
00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:34.374
label anything.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

40
00:02:34.374 --> 00:02:37.086
it will kind of drive home the point
that when you're writing code for

41
00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:39.860
other people, you wanna give them
indicators of what you're doing.

42
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:51.451
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another point

43
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:55.999
to hit home is that this paragraph,
and this paragraph,

44
00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:00.550
they're just paragraphs in a blog post,
right?

45
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.750
So, ideally, they would have
the same class name, right?

46
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.070
Because we wanna treat them the same.

47
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.710
Or if you're talking about
this Blog post 1 and

48
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.970
Blog post 2 titles,
they're both blog post titles.

49
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.120
And so they should both be
named the same thing, right?

50
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.811
Cuz we wanna treat them the same way.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

51
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.145
Cool.

52
00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.348
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This seems kind of like

53
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:48.203
a pain in the ass it's cuz it is,
it's a pain in the ass.

54
00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:49.883
But you did not come to this class for

55
00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:59.132
comfort.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Front and

56
00:03:59.132 --> 00:04:03.126
masters is not a comfortable experience.
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]

57
00:04:03.126 --> 00:04:04.331
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should make

58
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.489
that your tag line, I'm just kidding.

59
00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.302
[LAUGH]

60
00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:25.569
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

61
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.531
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So [INAUDIBLE].

62
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:32.219
Conflicting attributes in your
CSS between a class and the ID,

63
00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.446
which one takes priority?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The ID.

64
00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:38.557
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which we'll also talk

65
00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:39.212
about later.

66
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.798
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Typing about the exercise,

67
00:04:55.798 --> 00:05:01.156
she's asking for naming blog title or,
would you name it something blog titled?

68
00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:02.811
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that's a really good,

69
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:08.190
one that's probably what I would call it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If

70
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.752
you like see it's lots of typing so
four, five more minutes,

71
00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:17.050
that feel good.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And

72
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.820
then just kind of asking.

73
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.130
I'm not quite sure if I understand,

74
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.180
but if you want to use the same style
in another part, how would you do that?

75
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.245
Just by using that same class right,
that applies?

76
00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:30.088
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, definitely.

77
00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:31.891
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thanks for answering.

78
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:32.947
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

79
00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:37.861
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again we'll go in depth

80
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:41.107
once we hit the CSS section,
which is next.

81
00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:42.312
Probably after lunch.

82
00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:59.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I can go back to
the requirements, if you want to.

83
00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:10.632
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

84
00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:14.470
Worry more about two,
if you get to three than that's cool too,

85
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.251
but I'm more concerned about classes,
that's the more important part here.

86
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:42.476
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is anyone having trouble

87
00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:47.244
discerning what the container is actually?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah

88
00:06:47.244 --> 00:06:51.345
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So which one is giving you

89
00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:57.828
issues?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [INAUDIBLE]

90
00:06:57.828 --> 00:07:02.936
class.

91
00:07:02.936 --> 00:07:04.002
Right?

92
00:07:04.002 --> 00:07:07.624
And paragraphs, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

93
00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:09.171
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Just giving them names?

94
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm.

95
00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:15.347
&gt;&gt; `

96
00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:15.964
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So essentially

97
00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:19.125
I've given you a marker and told you to
label all the tupperware in the fridge.

98
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:19.830
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]

99
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's kind of the exercise

100
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.750
here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But

101
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.382
it's already labeled, I guess I'll just-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it is,

102
00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:30.732
I mean in as much that you know it's
a dip or you know it's an H-1, right?

103
00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:31.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

104
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.956
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But what kind of H-1

105
00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:34.990
is this?

106
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:41.020
Let's say I have a page and this is
only one tenth of what's on the page and

107
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.230
I have 50 different kinds of paragraphs
on there, what kind of paragraph is this?

108
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.560
So this is a blog, right?

109
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.121
And so, these kind of
paragraphs are blog paragraphs,

110
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.315
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Might be kind of a good

111
00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.160
thing to call it.

112
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.800
If you call it a blog paragraph,
I'm just throwing out answers left and

113
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.369
right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: That would be for P, right?

114
00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:04.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

115
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So, you said they're

116
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.500
already labelled,

117
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.640
they're already labelled Tupperware.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

118
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.560
I mean it's like I can go give you 50

119
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.460
different Tupperwares that have,
I mean, they're all Tupperware.

120
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.050
You can just say go and give a mark and

121
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.850
say this is the Tupperware, this is
the Tupperware, this is the Tupperware.

122
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.510
Not very useful, right?

123
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.920
Rather, you wanna say this
type of work contains this.

124
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.440
So this paragraph contains
a blog paragraph, right?

125
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.460
It contains blog type text.

126
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.680
Or like that first div up there,
like what's inside of that

127
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.457
div?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

128
00:08:46.457 --> 00:08:49.822
an entire blog post right?

129
00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:55.334
Might can be called of that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something

130
00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.120
else I didn't quite.

131
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.020
So let's see,
yeah we'll just start going through it.

132
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.970
Or does anyone need more time?

133
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.336
All right, let's do this.

134
00:09:07.336 --> 00:09:11.752
Cool, so.

135
00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:13.840
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Before you start,

136
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.050
he's saying you want separate classes for
blog posts but titles and paragraphs and

137
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.496
share the same classes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I want, so different,

138
00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:28.845
I want the blog posts to all
have the same class, right?

139
00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:32.965
Everything that is semantically
the same should have the same class.

140
00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:34.455
But they might have different IDs.

141
00:09:34.455 --> 00:09:37.655
In fact, if they have IDs,
they should be different IDs.
