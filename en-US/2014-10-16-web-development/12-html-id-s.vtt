00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.982
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:07.554
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: IDs are quite similar to
classes, that you're gonna put them on

3
00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:12.880
there, and it's just kind of another way
of labeling, what you're having on there.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.920
The big difference in ID's is that
they are unique to your page, right?

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.140
So in the previous example we
saw picture groups, right?

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.690
We can have ten picture groups,
we can have ten blog posts,

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.320
we can have ten paragraphs.

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.841
They're kind of things you can have
multiple of, and they're reusable, right?

9
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.908
I guess that's the biggest thing
I'm trying to get at is that

10
00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:40.628
they're reusable.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: IDs

11
00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:43.520
are different that they're
totally unique to your page.

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.378
So, like for example if I had ten blog
post and I would needed to address only

13
00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:50.580
the second one I could call
that one blog-post-2, right?

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.640
Like you're only gonna have
one blog-post-2 on your page.

15
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.839
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That kind make sense

16
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.510
a little bit.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.295
Yeah, yeah that's the example I used,
good for me.

18
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:14.180
[LAUGH].
So yeah classes are made to be reused.

19
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.960
You're creating classes because you say
like this is going to be useful and

20
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.020
you wanna make things as
generic as possible, right?

21
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.950
Because the idea with writing this html
is you want components to be reusable so

22
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.310
that when I go create my third blog post,
I don't have to redo everything I did for

23
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.820
my second blog post.

24
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.150
I can just reuse everything
I used from my first post.

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.130
And it goes back to,
developers are lazy and

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.360
we wanna do the absolute least amount
of effort to get the thing done.

27
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.227
Again this will become
more applicable with CSS.

28
00:01:48.227 --> 00:01:50.188
Or rather probably it will
just make it more concrete

29
00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:55.278
anyway.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

30
00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:58.590
let's just go straight to the code ben.

31
00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:10.482
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Resolving host.

32
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.019
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go, okay.

33
00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.290
So as you can see here, more cat pictures.

34
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.190
Surprise, surprise, okay.

35
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.000
So here I have two groups of cat pictures,
right?

36
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.990
And say, I, for whatever reason,
like I needed to hide group-2, right and

37
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.750
I only wanted to hide the second one and
I didn't wanna hide the first one.

38
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.148
I now have the ability to kind of hook
into that and say, only hide group-2 and

39
00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:50.570
keep group-1, or something like that.

40
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.527
So they're just kind of like,
again, labelling your Tupperware,

41
00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:58.760
but even being more specific.

42
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.896
So I cannot put another
group-2 on this page.

43
00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:07.065
So here's the reason why this name
is actually a bad name, right?

44
00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:10.360
Group-2 is really not that
descriptive because let's say,

45
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.100
I have like, blog-posts-groups, right?

46
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.460
And I say group-2, right.

47
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.734
Am I referring to group-2 of
the picture-groups or group-2 or

48
00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.150
the blog-posts-groups?

49
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.430
So you wanna be specific enough but
as general as possible.

50
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.480
There you go, that's [LAUGH] that's
your contradiction for the day.

51
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.250
Be as specific as possible.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: On the IDs and

52
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.130
classes they were asking about like,
how many IDs can you use versus classes?

53
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.530
Can you just explain that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Totally,

54
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.180
you can only have one ID.

55
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.720
Like, that's like hard and
fast rule only have one ID, right?

56
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.980
Because ID's in themselves are unique so

57
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.940
there's no point in having
multiple groups, right?

58
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.470
You can have as many classes as you want,

59
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.290
which is kind of fun because now
you can mix and match them, right?

60
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.820
Let's say, I have,
let's just modify this a little bit.

61
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.475
So I'm just gonna put another group here,
this is now group-3, right?

62
00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:07.110
Okay.

63
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.110
So all I've done is just
added more cat pictures.

64
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.470
But let's say I really wanted to
emphasize both first group and

65
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.750
the third group, for example, right?

66
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.990
What I would do is, I would say
emphasis-group or something like that.

67
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.480
Some name like that, right?

68
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.770
And then here, on the picture-group,
I can also put that as well.

69
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.298
So now you can kinda mix them together,
right?

70
00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:40.200
So you can have, I don't know, going back
to our contrived Tupperware example,

71
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.110
you can have this is a vegetable,
and this is also meat.

72
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.960
Right, it has both of
these things in there,

73
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.570
so I'm gonna label with both
of these things, right?

74
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.430
So in this particular group I wanna it to
have all the attributes of being a picture

75
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.620
group, but I also want you to know like
this one's actually really special so

76
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.260
I'm gonna emphasize that one as well.

77
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.510
That's a great question.

78
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.472
But now the second one it
lacks the emphasis-group so

79
00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:14.139
it's not gonna have the emphasis-group
qualities it's just

80
00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.553
gonna have the picture-group qualities.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

81
00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:19.969
that's only if you have CSS?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If this

82
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.040
is gonna be used a lot in CSS and
can be used a lot as well in JavaScript.

83
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But within the browser,

84
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.590
that class label

85
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.920
does absolutely nothing except-

86
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

87
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.401
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, there's no special

88
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:33.450
classes, right?

89
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.720
Everything that you do with class
is gonna be something you define.

90
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.590
Either style that you define or
behavior that you're gonna define.

91
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.020
That's what their one for
labeling your containers, right?

92
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.110
For example, I see picture-group and
I know that one's a picture-group, right?

93
00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.249
Or I can see emphasis, I know this
is a special picture-group, right?

94
00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:04.342
So that's one of the uses but
the second use,

95
00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:09.192
like the part the actually
the users gonna see that's

96
00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:12.980
gonna be from the CSS and the JavaScript.

97
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.090
It's good question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When the DOM interpreters

98
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.200
going through parsing the page what does
it do if it finds two identical ID's?

99
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I believe it actually

100
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.490
ignores them, so it's good to get
different based on different browsers.

101
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.430
I know in old versions
Internet Explorer will handle it

102
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.073
differently.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They're

103
00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:36.284
gonna go into quirks mode,
which is a really bad thing.

104
00:06:36.284 --> 00:06:40.208
It just, does weird stuff to try and
make your code work.

105
00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:41.383
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It varies depending on what

106
00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:42.755
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It'll vary based on your

107
00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:45.920
browser, but for the most part I
think it will actually honor it.

108
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.530
You can have group-2 and

109
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.850
it would just apply everything-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

110
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.540
it'll treat it more like a class then?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually,

111
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.720
I'm thinking about it.

112
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.280
I think what it will do it will
apply it to the first one only.

113
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.680
That's my guess.

114
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.290
And I guess the point of all of
it is just don't do it, right?

115
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.790
Yeah.
