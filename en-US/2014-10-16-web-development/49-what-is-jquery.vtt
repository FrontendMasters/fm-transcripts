2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Using JavaScript
to manipulate the DOM.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.110
This is fun stuff.

4
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.240
I like this stuff because people
start finally saying like, okay,

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.808
we went through all this academic
exercises, I mean, who cares, right?

6
00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:19.340
I'm going to show you
right now why you care.

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.000
[LAUGH] You're actually going to start
making changes to your webpages using

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.590
JavaScript.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.610
So what is jQuery?

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.250
jQuery is JavaScript, right?

11
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.670
jQuery is just a bunch of JavaScript
that some really smart guy,

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.150
his name is John Resig, wrote so that your
JavaScript is way easier to write, okay.

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.680
But again, this is just purely JavaScript.

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.660
This is a JavaScript tool set.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.290
It's main purpose is to make
common tasks in JavaScript easier.

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.089
Like, for example,

17
00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.423
changing a class on a DOM Node can be
kind of difficult for people to grasp,

18
00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:06.600
but in jQuery they just made this
syntax really simple, so it's cool.

19
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.130
jQuery is also used on some 80%
of the top websites in the world.

20
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.730
It's like, as far as like libraries or
tool sets or

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.320
anything like that, it's far and
above the most common.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.580
Everyone to some extent in the JavaScript
world knows at least that much jQuery.

23
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.611
So if you see that $ notation,
like $, then parenthesis,

24
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:35.008
like nine times out of ten
that's gonna be jQuery,

25
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:40.241
like that's kinda like their calling card,
like if you see $, it is jQuery.

26
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:41.141
Yeah?

27
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:44.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question on the difference
between toolkit, tool set, and framework?

28
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH]
The pragmatic answer is not a lot.

29
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:55.439
There's these words thrown around toolkit,
tool set,

30
00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.960
which I take those to be synonyms.

31
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.421
And then there's another word, framework.

32
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.931
That's just, again,
JavaScript someone else wrote, or

33
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:07.240
a code that someone else wrote
to make your life easier.

34
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.010
It's a philosophy difference, and if you
actually wanna get into it, I talk about

35
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.530
it in my other Friend and Masters Class,
which is the JavaScript Showdown.

36
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.931
So, that would actually be
great reference for that.

37
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Two months from now.

38
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Two months from now.

39
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.354
Cool, so $, if you see a $ like that,

40
00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:36.231
that's jQuery's calling card.

41
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:39.370
So, let's actually start
writing some jQuery, okay?

42
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.604
Got a codepen down here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's

43
00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:46.370
just collapse this one right here.

44
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.970
All right, let's first look at
our html real quick, right?

45
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.500
So, I have my html, I have a p right here,

46
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.780
where I have bunch of Lorem ipsum text,
right?

47
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.370
Down here, this is probably
your first time seeing this.

48
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.510
I have a script tag, and

49
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.880
all the script tag is doing is
it's pulling in jQuery, right?

50
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.000
If you wanna be able to use jQuery,
you have to pull it in first, right?

51
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.742
That's what that does, it says hey,
go out to jQuery's website, grab jQuery,

52
00:03:18.742 --> 00:03:19.350
and load it.

53
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.351
So now we have all this JavaScript
on our page that we can now use.

54
00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:25.180
Does that make sense?

55
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.330
Cool, so
you might be asking yourself is like,

56
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.120
I see all this Lorem ipsum text,
it's not showing up over here.

57
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.870
Why?

58
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.285
That's a great question,
I'm glad you asked.

59
00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.912
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

60
00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:48.140
I have this little snippet
of JavaScript right here,

61
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.400
caption-text, and then .text('Magic!').

62
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.890
So, notice over here,
I have a class called caption-text.

63
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.980
Here, you remember the syntax, right?

64
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.760
This looks like CSS, right?

65
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.160
Like that .caption-text is referring
to the class caption-text.

66
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.060
They did that on purpose so
it should feel like CSS to you.

67
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.140
For example, if this had an ID of my
cool ID, how would I refer to it?

68
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.760
Hash my cool ID, cool.

69
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.660
Or again like I could say p here as well,
this would also work.

70
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.950
Because it would refer
to this p right here.

71
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.380
So, you see $ and then in quotes
you're gonna have the selector, right?

72
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.722
So on this,
what I had before was caption-text.

73
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then after that,
this is now essentially that,

74
00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:50.101
this contains that jQuery element for
you to operate on.

75
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.481
Here we're calling the text method,
which is a jQuery method, right?

76
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:57.541
It's not a JavaScript method,
it's built into jQuery.

77
00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:02.660
And I'm saying I want you to
set the text to be Magic.

78
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.289
We're gonna go over this a bunch, so
if this doesn't make sense right now,

79
00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.176
I'm going to hammer it into your head.

80
00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:11.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Hey, what's the $, again?

81
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's essentially jQuery,
essentially it is this jQuery.

82
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So it's telling you that
this line of JavaScript is jQuery.

83
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.992
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: $ is really the name of

84
00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:24.850
the function.

85
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.811
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is.

86
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:29.651
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: It's just a function comp.

87
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.326
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can actually put
jQuery here and it will still work.

88
00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:37.710
But everyone, again,
in the world is super lazy,

89
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.130
myself included, they just do
the $ because it's one letter.

90
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So, it's like JQuery.text.

91
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.001
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

92
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:45.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Magic.

93
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.441
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There you go.

94
00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, good question.

95
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.841
Other questions, we good with this?

96
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:58.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Is there a way to see all
the functions attached to that jQuery?

97
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There certainly is but
I'd say look at the docs, right?

98
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.610
jQuery has awesome documentation.

99
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.091
In fact, let's just go ahead and
pull it up real quick.

100
00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:11.727
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: There's not a way in
a JavaScript object to give a list of its

101
00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:14.711
members, properties, functions.

102
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:29.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, the answer to
that question is not very well.

103
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:35.381
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm sure there
is a way to pull it apart but

104
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:37.560
it's not going to be very useful.

105
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Do some of the IDE tools,
like WebStorm.

106
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They all have jQuery stuff
built into it, so, particularly WebStorm.

107
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:49.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so
jQuery has these documentation.

108
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.644
You just look up here to the like,
what am I looking, API documentation.

109
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.160
Awesome, these documentations have been
edited and re-edited and re-edited, so

110
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.540
they're really succinct.

111
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.740
They're actually really quite useful and
intuitive.

112
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.622
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We have
a course called jQuery.

113
00:07:06.622 --> 00:07:12.466
It's done by the guy who
actually made this documentation.

114
00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:15.475
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, definitely,
so check that out as well.

115
00:07:15.475 --> 00:07:18.572
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, yeah,

116
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.870
anything you would wanna
ever know about this,

117
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.641
I mean let's look at the text one,
we just did that, so.

118
00:07:32.182 --> 00:07:36.846
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it just tells you, this
method does not accept any arguments or

119
00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:40.342
that one doesn't rather,
but we gave it text, so

120
00:07:40.342 --> 00:07:44.190
text right here, this is one that we used.

121
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.420
So I guess that's another good
point to bring up is that these

122
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.670
functions will do different things
depending on what arguments are given.

123
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.500
So if I say .text with no arguments,

124
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.130
what it does is it goes up and
grabs the text and gives it back to me.

125
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.871
Whereas if I give it text, it's assuming
that you want to give it text, so

126
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:02.870
you're actually going to set what it is.

127
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.100
In this particular case,
we did magic, right?

128
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Somebody mentioned in
chat that $.fn actually will list all

129
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.070
the functions.

130
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does it?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

131
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:24.571
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [object Object].

132
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.771
Yeah, that could probably
console.log [INAUDIBLE].

133
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:29.011
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Looks like if
you console.log and it worked.

134
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There you go,
everything, right there.

135
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.570
But again, this is not super useful.

136
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.520
I would still recommend
sticking to the docs.

137
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.934
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Well, for
jQuery, but there's other APIs,

138
00:08:46.934 --> 00:08:52.660
functions that are other objects
that you might not have documented.

139
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.883
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Totally, cool.

140
00:08:56.883 --> 00:09:01.871
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: So it's still the HTML
that's ultimately controlling the output,

141
00:09:01.871 --> 00:09:05.655
in the sense that we don't
need a document.write or

142
00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:10.823
some other way to tell it to put that
on the screen, it's just the HTML.

143
00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:15.583
And we're just,
jQuery is like intervening and changing?

144
00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:18.104
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
that's a good way of thinking about it.

145
00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:21.588
All jQuery is is it's
using raw JavaScript and

146
00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:26.499
just essentially making things
that are kind of difficult to do,

147
00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:30.877
they essentially write all
the difficult syntax for you so

148
00:09:30.877 --> 00:09:34.204
you can have a very clean and
easy to use API.

149
00:09:34.204 --> 00:09:37.304
But there's nothing that jQuery is
doing that you can't do by yourself.

150
00:09:37.304 --> 00:09:40.620
In fact, there's a lot of people
that don't use jQuery because most

151
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.663
of the tasks they use for
jQuery are somewhat easy to do anyway.

152
00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:48.168
But jQuery is a good place to get started,
I mean,

153
00:09:48.168 --> 00:09:52.370
I've been using it forever so
I recommend it.
