[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:05.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the one
we were in before, right?

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:15.040
If I add another paragraph,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's green, right?

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.370
But what happens if I want,
these are now different paragraphs, right?

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.220
This one's like the leading paragraph, and
this one is like a trailing paragraph or

6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.800
something like that, and I want them to be
styled differently for what ever reason.

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.170
Using these p tags, you can't do that,
you can't differentiate between the two.

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.080
So what you need to do is that's when
these classes, all that stuff I just made

9
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.230
you do, and you were banging your head
against table saying why am I doing this?

10
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.642
It's going to start making sense now.

11
00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:55.610
So, lets collapse that right there.

12
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.664
I now have leading paragraph and
secondary paragraph and here.

13
00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.941
Why is this so weird?

14
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:09.401
That's weird, okay.

15
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:17.336
Leading P,
which refers to this one is green,

16
00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:23.041
and secondary P is blue, right?

17
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:28.121
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the dot just
indicate that it's the class?

18
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:28.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

19
00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:30.442
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

20
00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:30.962
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's exactly.

21
00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:32.661
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would you
[CROSSTALK] an id then?

22
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.943
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope use a hash.

23
00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:35.643
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

24
00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:38.623
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
which I think I talk about later.

25
00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:40.423
We'll get to that when we get to that.

26
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:46.620
But, notice here that I have a leading
period in front of the class.

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.100
That's just indicating to CSS,
I am styling right now based on an ID,

28
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.380
because in theory,
I can have both an ID, and

29
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.860
a class that have the same name and
they are totally separate, right?

30
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.240
They're kept in totally different spaces.

31
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.280
So, if I say like here, ID.

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.154
By the way this is a bad idea but
just for demonstration purposes if

33
00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:10.590
I wanted to address this what I would say

34
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.510
is leading-p right,

35
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.059
and that would address this, not this.

36
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.390
So again, contrived example, really bad
idea, but that's the concept at play here.

37
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:34.634
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So my question is here,
if I add another paragraph

38
00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:39.810
with no class, no class,
I crack myself up.

39
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.420
What color would it be?

40
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.281
This is all the CSS right here.

41
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:57.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna be black, why?

42
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.049
It's black because it has no other option
right, it's like nothing is setting it

43
00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.960
to be anything else and the default color
for the browser is black, so it is black.

44
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:14.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,
because no rules are affecting it.

45
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.451
So again we kind of see
where this is going right?

46
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:30.051
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Classes
are extensively used for styling.

47
00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:37.111
And for some people, I'm mostly in
this train of thought but exclusively.

48
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:41.410
I will prefer to never style based an ID,
and

49
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.210
the reason being is
that it's not reusable.

50
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.270
And very rarely do I try and
write things that are not reusable, right?

51
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.825
If I spend all this time writing
this beautiful CSS to make this

52
00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:57.220
little widget really pretty,
I don't want that to be unique right?

53
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.011
Like I want to be able to rip that out and
use it on another page.

54
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:07.871
It's all about code reuse and
ID's are not reuseable for the most part.

55
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:12.040
Cool, so this is kind of what
we've been leading up to is there

56
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.030
are different rules for
styles winning out right?

57
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.440
Or stated differently when two styles
conflict, which one gets applied.

58
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.110
When we're about to talk about that,
here in a second.

59
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.710
Right if I have,
going back to this example over here,

60
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.870
just close these, leave this page.

61
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.530
Leave this page, thank you CodePen.

62
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.870
Leave this page.

63
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.840
Now let's leave this page okay.

64
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.740
Like if this has both
leading paragraph and

65
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.670
secondary paragraph which one wins out,
right?

66
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.020
That question is not intuitively obvious.

67
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.560
So if it's not intuitively obvious
then don't worry because it's not.

68
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.670
But that's again leading up to
this thing specificity that we

69
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.170
are going to talk about.

70
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you just go over once
again how you differentiate the classes

71
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.610
and the IDs in the CSS?

72
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure, so let's just say
this one up here is id="paragraph-1".

73
00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:23.440
Right, I think I talked about,
I have slides on this,

74
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.292
so we'll go over it a couple times,
but it would just be paragraph-1.

75
00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:29.791
So that-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

76
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:31.527
the hash versus the period?

77
00:05:31.527 --> 00:05:32.786
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's the hash.

78
00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:34.250
This hash means that it's an ID.

79
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.596
Say like color yellow should
end up being yellow, yeah.

80
00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:50.947
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right more questions?

81
00:05:50.947 --> 00:05:53.380
Please.

82
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is there a way of setting
up your csf so it's relational?

83
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.940
So you could say the second
paragraph following a div,

84
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.470
I want it to have this style?

85
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah so
there definitely is.

86
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.360
It's kind of beyond
the scope of this class.

87
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.290
That's a bit more of
an advanced technique.

88
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.140
They're called pseudo classes.

89
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.801
I touch on them but
I don't actually go into them.

90
00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:24.441
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'll show you.

91
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.661
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's not going to work.

92
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:41.970
Anyway it has to do with this nth child
selector, this is actually incorrect but

93
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.524
that's what you're gonna use is
you're gonna use colon nth child and

94
00:06:47.524 --> 00:06:51.873
in parenthesis you're gonna
tell which one you want.

95
00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:52.836
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

96
00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:57.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The nth leading paragraph
well the child that is yeah so

97
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.060
it becomes kind of a mess, right?

98
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.690
Because we have different
paragraphs in here,

99
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.290
and we wouldn't necessarily
be referring to the same one.

100
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.270
So that's the general gist
though is that you're gonna use

101
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.019
an nth child pseudo-class.

102
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.117
For what I would recommend while you're
trying to wrap your mind all this CSS,

103
00:07:18.117 --> 00:07:19.888
is just give it a different class and

104
00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:22.981
style based on that class rather
than trying to do relations.

105
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:27.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That tends
to be more clear anyway.

106
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.490
In fact I catch a lot of flack at that
at Reddit because I use nth child

107
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.030
a lot, yeah.

108
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's the long
form of the dot for class?

109
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The long form?

110
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Like would I just say class
leading-p something instead of the dot?

111
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is no long form?

112
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.371
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, so
I have to use the dot to refer to a class.

113
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:50.471
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, and it's just one
of those things you just get used to.

114
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:53.231
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: All right.

115
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:53.731
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question though.

116
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.464
I like where your head's at,
like trying to be succinct and

117
00:07:58.464 --> 00:08:01.181
that's a really good quality
to be having as a programmer.

118
00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:06.841
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

119
00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:09.160
Let's open another CodePen here.

120
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:16.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
expand out here, oops.

121
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:27.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
I believe this is just that one that

122
00:08:27.063 --> 00:08:31.100
you gave all the classes to earlier.

123
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.436
Same HTML, right?

124
00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:39.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Blog-post P Blog post,
blog post title.

125
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.570
This is just kind of an example of
putting some concepts together.

126
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.713
So here I have the blog post right,
which is just everything, right,

127
00:08:48.713 --> 00:08:51.230
everything inside of
a individual blog post.

128
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.360
I gave it a border, which is this
little black thing around it.

129
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.050
I gave it some margin.

130
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.960
And I gave it some padding.

131
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.260
So margin and padding it's like something
that confuses people for the longest time,

132
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.990
it's okay if you find it a little bit
confusing, we'll go over it several times.

133
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.360
But essentially both of them are used for
spacing.

134
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.880
So in particular let's try taking
out the margin bottom, for example.

135
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.390
These are now going to bump up against
each other, so now that line is solid.

136
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.650
But as soon as I put that

137
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.260
back there's going to be just that
little bit of space between the two.

138
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.160
Whereas the padding here,
that's kind of like interior padding.

139
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.189
So I have this blog post, and
if I take this padding out

140
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.000
everything the text is going to
push against the walls, right?

141
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.770
I don't want it to do that.

142
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.930
I just want like a little bit of
space to give it some more breathe,

143
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.900
make it easier to read.

144
00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.249
So, again, margin is exterior,
padding is interior, right?

145
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.210
Again we'll go,
I actually have a whole side,

146
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.790
just talking about like all the different
measurements that we have to worry about.

147
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.515
And also don't worry like, you're seeing
like border or margin bottom like

148
00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:21.404
you don't like to try and memorize this,
they're just like don't try and

149
00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:25.931
memorize anything you can Google and
find out in five seconds right.

150
00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:29.291
That's kinda my rule of thumb.

151
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:34.440
[COUGH] Like for example like what are all
the things I need for a border right?

152
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.190
This is actually the shorthand for

153
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.420
border but it's also the way
that everyone rights it right.

154
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.919
But you can also do like,
border-color red and

155
00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:48.079
that's some like everything will be red.

156
00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:52.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
again notice it says black right here and

157
00:10:52.424 --> 00:10:54.580
it says red right here, why it is?

158
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.761
It's just lower in the CSS that's all.
