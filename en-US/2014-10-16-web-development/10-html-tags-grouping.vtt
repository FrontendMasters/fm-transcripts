[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.684 --> 00:00:05.508
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, grouping.

3
00:00:05.508 --> 00:00:08.300
We kinda talked a little bit
about this with our car example.

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.700
But let's look at another example of this,
right?

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.569
It's a good idea to group
like ideas together.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.898
So if you were doing a blog post the kind
of the semantic that makes sense kind of

7
00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.690
idea is to group every blog post together.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.379
You have blog post one and
it is contained in its own container and

9
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.607
your blog post two and
its contained in it's own container.

10
00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:35.185
Is to group like things together.

11
00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:41.521
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so.

12
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a lot of text.

13
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.428
You kind of get the point.

14
00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:51.665
Let's just make this a lot bigger.

15
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.037
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
this is just a contrived example, and

16
00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:00.650
notice I have blog post one and
I have blog post two, right.

17
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.160
And they just both have a bunch of
Lorem ipsum text in there, right?

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.580
Lorem ipsum text for
those of you not familiar is essentially

19
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.760
text that is there to hold space but
it doesn't actually mean anything.

20
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.843
It's just meant to be a non-distraction
but there for styling purposes.

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
I have a div right here, right?

22
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.380
And this div encompasses this h1 and
another div, right?

23
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.170
And inside of that div,
I have all of my paragraphs, right?

24
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.200
So I'm kind of grouping those together,
right,

25
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.050
because the h1 is different
than the paragraphs.

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.480
And the divs, this div right here,
encompasses all of the text.

27
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.210
So notice that I'm using divs just to
kind of group like ideas together, right?

28
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.490
So this is the first div and
it encompasses one blog post and

29
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.750
there's the second div here that
encloses the second blog post.

30
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.905
And I also have div's
encompassing these paragraphs.

31
00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:11.230
So notice again, we talked about
div's kinda like Tupperware, right?

32
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.180
In this particular case this Tupperware
is a different kind of Tupperware

33
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.940
from this one, all I'm saying is they're
both have some sort of grouping to them.

34
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.420
You kinda follow my logic there?

35
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.270
It's really circular I realize.

36
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.270
But eventually,
we'll start putting labels on these.

37
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.500
These are kinda like black
box Tupperwares, right?

38
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.580
You have no idea what the hell they are,
right?

39
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.930
But there's something in there,
and they're all alike.

40
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.780
I'll teach you how to mark your
Tupperware here in just a second.

41
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.100
In fact I believe it's the next slide.

42
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.295
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's like those
lunch boxes that have the little

43
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.319
Tupperwares inside.

44
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, exactly.

45
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.350
Bento boxes, kind of, right?

46
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.480
There you go.

47
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.190
We're making bento boxes.

48
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.740
I like that example too.

49
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.070
This is gonna make me
really hungry really fast.

50
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.670
So yeah.

51
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.830
That's kind of the idea here,
is we're grouping like things together.

52
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.568
Does that kind of make sense?

53
00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:15.990
It's organizational, right?

54
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.170
Like I can remove this div right here, I
could remove this div right here as well,

55
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.240
in fact, all the div's could
be gone from this page, and

56
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.470
it would look exactly the same.

57
00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:29.540
But here like,
even if I haven't told you what it is,

58
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.110
there's some grouping here,
some grouping going on.

59
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.588
This is going to, again,
to save you just bundles of time later.

60
00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:43.391
These are very small examples when you
start working on a webpage that has 10,000

61
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:44.324
lines, right?

62
00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.097
Grouping stuff together makes
it much easier to find the thing

63
00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:48.330
that you're looking for.

64
00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:52.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

65
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.709
Questions on that?

66
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.880
These are kind of best practices
kind of things as opposed to

67
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.080
requirement to make it display
what you want it to display.

68
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.260
As well later, when we start getting into
CSS, right, the grouping becomes very

69
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.480
important, right,
because I wanna separate my blog posts,

70
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.370
like I want to have them look different,
right?

71
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.360
So say I wanted to give
them a grey background

72
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.640
like split them 15 pixels from each other.

73
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.740
Those divs live say like, take this
group and separate it from this group.

74
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.930
So we're kind of building up to this,
I don't know

75
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.220
some grand reveal where it was like,
and surprise everything was useful.

76
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.270
Now, continue doing it.
