00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Static Assets.

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.240
So, Static Assets are interesting

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.850
because they're essentially things
that you're going to give to the user

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.130
that the server's not going to change,
right?

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.080
So this is going to be like HTML,
CSS, JavaScript images.

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.068
They're just files that you're gonna store
on your server and then send to the users.

8
00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:30.390
You're not gonna look at them,
you're not gonna modify them.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.510
You're just, the user's going to say,
hey, I need an image.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.310
Please give it to me.

11
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.790
So we kind of introduced this
idea of a static asset or

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.180
a, something that's called
a public directory.

13
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.561
Cuz otherwise, you know how we're saying
app.get do this, app.get do this?

14
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:55.600
We could say app.get smileyface.png serve
this smiley face picture to the user.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.900
It's a huge pain, especially if you have
a large site with many, many, many images.

16
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.740
So what we do is we take a folder and we
me say this folder is now public, right?

17
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.390
So anything that's in this folder
can be accessed by anyone.

18
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.370
Express is really good about that.

19
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.670
You just say, hey, Express, serve anything
in this folder to anyone who asks for it.

20
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.160
And it just makes new routes for

21
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.220
all your static assets based
on what their file name is.

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.472
And it'll even,
you know how we set the content type?

23
00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:29.538
We had to say it was plain text, right?

24
00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:33.855
Express is smart enough to figure out
what kind of static asset it's serving.

25
00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:40.863
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, again, it would be
extremely painful if this idea of a static

26
00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:43.326
asset or a public folder didn't exist.

27
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

28
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.990
Let's-
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: So this is

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.090
one of the things that Express adds,

30
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.540
it's not part of [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

31
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.726
So this is an Express feature.

32
00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:07.512
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I, okay, so I have
a folder called, let's clear this out.

33
00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:09.052
CD dot dot.

34
00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:12.289
And we're gonna go to static assets.

35
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.586
And we're gonna do npn install express.

36
00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:22.736
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

37
00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:25.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This should be,
feel like the familiar pattern.

38
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.253
You should be getting sick of it now, and

39
00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:30.145
I'm about to show you how you don't
have to do every single time.

40
00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:34.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But here in a second.

41
00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:38.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All things in good time.

42
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.879
Okay, so we're in static assets, and
we're gonna look at app.js in here.

43
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.892
Okay?
So, even more simple.

44
00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:48.856
Here's an express server.

45
00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:53.058
And we're gonna use app.use,
and then express.static.

46
00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:58.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
this line may look a little cryptic.

47
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.920
It is.

48
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.755
But, express.static is saying I'm
gonna give you this entire directory,

49
00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.180
please serve it just like
we were talking about.

50
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.700
Underscore, underscore, dir name.

51
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.810
That's essentially saying here
is the directory where, it's

52
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.480
essentially the base directory
of where your app is.

53
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.580
It gives, essentially, an absolute
path to find these images, okay?

54
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.376
In this particular case,
if we go here, pwd.

55
00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:40.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The underscore underscore
dir name, it's a node variable, right?

56
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.210
It's gonna be this, right?

57
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.546
So, dir name is going to be
equivalent to this super long string.

58
00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because node is aware of
where it is, you're just telling it please

59
00:03:50.548 --> 00:03:52.760
use your awareness to figure
out where this folder is.

60
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.540
Okay?

61
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.140
And then you say on addition to that
go in to the public directory, right?

62
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.920
Cuz you don't want your server
side code being public, right?

63
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.591
You just want your static
assets to be public.

64
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:05.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

65
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.553
And then after that we're
just saying app.listen.

66
00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:11.005
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?
So

67
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:15.763
let's give this a shot
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're

68
00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:19.620
gonna say nodemon app.js.

69
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.120
Okay?

70
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.800
And now,
all these things in the public directory.

71
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.443
I just wrote a little library right here,
right?

72
00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:32.290
Don't, some CSS, some JavaScript,
a little HTML file.

73
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.100
You don't have to worry too much about it.

74
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.960
You can look at it if you want to.

75
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.659
So let's go back here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: and

76
00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:43.881
we're gonna go to index.html.

77
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully, you're seeing
a large pink button that says press me.

78
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.550
And lo and behold,
of course, what did I do?

79
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.626
It serves cat pictures.

80
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:01.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

81
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.400
And you can just keep
pressing cat pictures and

82
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.836
it will keep serving cat pictures.

83
00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:10.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Kind of
a one trick pony up here.

84
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.684
Sorry, guys.
[LAUGH]

85
00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.643
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, let's look at our

86
00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:19.510
console real quick, right?

87
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.260
And there's this little tab
right here that says network.

88
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.000
Let's go ahead and refresh it, our page.

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.872
And it's gonna record everything
that comes into the page.

90
00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:32.651
So I notice it's getting,
it's getting our style.css,

91
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:38.350
it's getting the HTML,
it's getting the kitties.js.

92
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.570
It's doing all of this without
us explicitly telling Express

93
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.390
serve this JavaScript, Express serve
this CSS, Express serve this HTML.

94
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.826
It would just drive everyone crazy,
it would be impossible.

95
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.885
So instead, I just put all of those
files on a public directory and

96
00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:55.560
say serve this entire directory.

97
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.970
I don't care what's in there.

98
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.666
If they know what the name is,
they can have it.

99
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:01.517
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

100
00:06:01.517 --> 00:06:03.462
Awesome.

101
00:06:05.662 --> 00:06:06.387
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I should
really trademark this app.

102
00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:10.250
It's awesome.
