2
00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:07.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We've been using just
part of the jQuery library so far.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.360
Like I said,
the jQuery library is huge, and

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.780
the DOM manipulation part of it,
while it is the most prevalent and

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.740
the most well used part of it, we will
be talking about another part which is

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.110
called Ajax here in just one second, but
we have some other questions to address.

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The first one is,
why would you use jQuery to add and

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.170
remove styling classes,
versus changing CSS directly?

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a great question,
and

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.724
the answer comes in
the form of it's reusable.

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.125
So, if you're just changing CSS in the
JavaScript, it's kind of an anti-pattern

12
00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.429
and when I say anti-pattern it
means it's just not a good idea.

13
00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.627
Because if I put it into a CSS class and
then add and remove a class,

14
00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:57.970
I can now use that everywhere
on my website, right?

15
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.030
For example, if I have an error
class that jQuery adds and removes,

16
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.990
what happens if I load a page
with an error class, right?

17
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.520
Then I kind of have bifurcated my efforts
here, that I have to maintain both

18
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.230
the jQuery CSS and this other class
that mean essentially the same thing.

19
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.000
Whereas, if I just add or remove classes,

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.960
it's all available always to be
used across their entire website.

21
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.460
Laziness, that's my key
answer right there.

22
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then the next question was,

23
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.330
does the hidden element
still take up space then.

24
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.906
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we saw this
yesterday when we talked about CSS.

25
00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:35.410
The answer is no to that question.

26
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.790
When you set display to be none it
essentially takes the entire element out

27
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.620
of the document flow so it essentially
has no bearing on the DOM itself.

28
00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:51.272
Good question, though.

29
00:01:51.272 --> 00:01:53.094
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well,
it's still there, right,

30
00:01:53.094 --> 00:01:56.632
cuz you could just switch that to
not be hidden, and it would appear.

31
00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:58.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Essentially go re-download

32
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.232
that piece, so it's still there.

33
00:02:01.232 --> 00:02:04.395
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is still there,
correct, definitely.

34
00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.255
You just have to say display block or
display inline or

35
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:10.215
whatever it's supposed to be and
it would show back up.

36
00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:12.775
Or in this particular case
you would just say show.

37
00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:15.695
Yeah, it's still there.

38
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:23.246
It's just not making any
manifestation of itself, cool.

39
00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:28.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Question, did I miss
explanation of the DOM in detail, kind of

40
00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:34.228
what happens with jQuery pulling stuff
out of the DOM, did you explain that?

41
00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:38.526
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not a whole lot,
the DOM is a complicated beast, and

42
00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:43.816
as supposed to diving in and
getting really confusing about it.

43
00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:46.486
I think it's better to just
kind of take a surface,

44
00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:50.396
kind of take it as a black box right now
and say, this is very complicated but

45
00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:54.370
here's a couple buttons I know if I can
press and it will do certain things for

46
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.827
me, but-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's an article on

47
00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:01.344
CSS Trader called What is the DOM?

48
00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:06.163
And it kinda explains
it very laymen's terms.

49
00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:11.740
It's basically a tree-like structure,
and there's these elements.

50
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.444
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But when jQuery pulls
something out of it, does it insert

51
00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:22.226
something back into that DOM that's
kind of a new HTML format or file?

52
00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:25.219
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well,
when you use the jQuery object you're

53
00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.449
just wrapping the element
in the jQuery object so

54
00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.125
it's not taking it out of
the DOM in order to modify it.

55
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:37.290
It's just doing it jQuery's way, right.

56
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.850
It's not really like taking it out.

57
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.800
If you say .remove that will
take it out of the DOM but-

58
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the simple answer to,

59
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.730
I think what you're
confusing here is that,

60
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.430
when I say get the user input, right.

61
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.275
It's not actually yanking it out of the
DOM, it's actually just pointing at it.

62
00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:02.280
It's pointing at it where it is right now.

63
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.810
So it's just referencing
what's already there.

64
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.660
It's not pulling it out,
messing with it and putting it back.

65
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.226
It's just changing it in its place.

66
00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:11.807
Does that make sense?

67
00:04:11.807 --> 00:04:12.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, yeah.

68
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.
