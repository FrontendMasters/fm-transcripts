[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:10.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hi, so this is the grand
finale for the CSS portion of this class.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.760
So go ahead and open this pen.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.640
And then I put an image in there which
I have embedded on the next slide,

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.970
if you wanna see it that way too.

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.096
So I've given you a bunch of HTML,
with of course CAD pictures,

7
00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:28.624
you're welcome, and
I want you to style it.

8
00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.710
You're gonna have to use floats and
stuff like that, and

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.600
I put the box sizing thing on there for

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.690
you which I explained earlier.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.880
you specifically want four and four, or
does it depend how wide your browser.

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.435
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I want four and

13
00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:46.960
four.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.330
I put the solution on there.

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.460
Don't cheat yourself try and
do it the first time,

16
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.190
bang your head against the wall,
that's how you learn.

17
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.599
And then we'll go through it together.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

18
00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:04.470
again, the whole exercise is,
open the HTML.

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.658
Do not touch the HTML and just use CSS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

20
00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:20.129
questions on it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So some hints.

21
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.854
You're gonna have to use text line.

22
00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:27.370
You're gonna have to use that margin
auto trick I just showed you.

23
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.960
Actually no you won't.

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.470
You won't have to use margin auto.

25
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.316
You will have to use padding.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You'll have

26
00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:45.221
to use float.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

27
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:51.526
that's about it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,

28
00:01:51.526 --> 00:02:00.009
I can make this presentation again.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm sorry,

29
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.537
what's the challenge again?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this CodePen right here,

30
00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:07.920
I want you to open it and
I want you to make it look like this.

31
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400
Which is this image,

32
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.070
the one that I've embedded here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So all those boxes

33
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.075
make it line up left to right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

34
00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:16.916
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Without touching what?

35
00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:18.774
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Don't change the HTML,

36
00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:25.390
just change the CSS.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Question is, is it a good

37
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.862
practice to use text align on an image?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes,

38
00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:34.912
absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yes,

39
00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:39.491
you can use, because images are considered
an inline type element like the spans and

40
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:41.200
stuff like that.

41
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.458
You can use text line to center them,
which is pretty cool.

42
00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:48.765
And that's awesome,
nothing wrong with that.

43
00:02:57.234 --> 00:02:58.148
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You also have to use

44
00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:06.986
height, height and width for sure.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did you do it?

45
00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.650
Good job.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Little extra padding.

46
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.065
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's cool.

47
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.985
Padding never hurt anybody.

48
00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:27.309
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My has the code on the top
like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and

49
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.640
then all the display on the bottom.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, you can step.

50
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that like a setting let

51
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.631
you customize?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Uh-huh.

52
00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:36.989
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So long as if you have

53
00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.455
an account there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, would you click here?

54
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:46.252
[SOUND] Trying to remember
if there's a setting for it.

55
00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:50.583
It's down here in the bottom right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can change it and

56
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.251
flip it so it's on the other side.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Great.

57
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.971
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, right there.

58
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about

59
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.590
something that is not clear about it?

60
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.750
Or anything like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right.

61
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.290
Give you like five more minutes,
something like that.

62
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.824
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another little tidbit

63
00:04:39.824 --> 00:04:42.730
that my wife taught me about this is,
never,

64
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.890
ever feel guilty about Googling anything,
right?

65
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.715
It's not cheating.

66
00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:50.650
Like for the first five years, and

67
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.010
probably even longer of your career
you will code by Google, right.

68
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.946
Like it feels like taking pieces of
code that other people have done and

69
00:04:56.946 --> 00:05:03.030
just kinda squishing them together.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Totally cool, right.

70
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.239
Don't memorize anything you
can find in like five seconds.

71
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, my wife felt like it

72
00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:17.408
was a shame right, to Google something.

73
00:05:17.408 --> 00:05:20.760
So just like, cheating on a test or
something like that, but

74
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.128
no one's watching or anything like that,

75
00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:27.484
it's just get the job done.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is

76
00:05:27.484 --> 00:05:29.153
why like stack overflow.

77
00:05:29.153 --> 00:05:31.253
If you're not familiar with that,

78
00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:37.671
it was like a huge help.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another hint is probably

79
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:42.834
use percentage wips as supposed to pixel
wips, right if you have four in a line.

80
00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:45.374
What's a hundred divided by four, right.
