[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can you
go back to the CodePen?

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.152
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think I have them right

4
00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:12.328
now actually,
that's an example of this in particular.

5
00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:14.512
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I want to ask you a question

6
00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:18.595
about the code,
I wanted to use two properties.

7
00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:19.606
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is it this one?

8
00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:20.794
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

9
00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:26.704
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So in the CSS in dot blog

10
00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:30.355
post there I added overflow and

11
00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:36.169
I wanted to use the scroll.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How

12
00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:41.582
do I get it to,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: When I added

13
00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:44.086
more text it just made the box bigger.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

14
00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.395
you have to give the height.

15
00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.946
So if I say height 100 pixels,

16
00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:55.818
okay now you can scroll through it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

17
00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:59.100
overflow applies to the box model.

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.070
It's just saying what do you
want me to do if I overflow?

19
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.920
If I have more content than I can
display what do you want me to do?

20
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.970
So scroll is one of them.

21
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.730
You can say hidden.

22
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.210
And that just says like I
don't care what goes on.

23
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.900
Just throw it away.

24
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.840
It's actually not thrown away.

25
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.410
It's just not displayed, all right?

26
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.692
And the reason why it's constrained like
this is I gave it a height of 100 pixels.

27
00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:21.280
It's just asking me,

28
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.760
what do I do if I can't fit all
my stuff in here in 100 pixels?

29
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.726
Whereas if I take this off, it'll just
expand to however big it needs to contain

30
00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:34.937
all of it's stuff and then it finishes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

31
00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:39.769
if I was gonna style a page and
I wanted the box to be a certain size but

32
00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:44.687
to be the same size on different
screens would I use pixels for that or

33
00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:47.645
what would be a better way to do that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Definitely pixels.

34
00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:48.653
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: To do the height?

35
00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:52.867
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pixels, yep, yep yep yep.

36
00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:59.602
The weird thing about so if I said
like 10ems or something like that.

37
00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:05.080
height: 10em something like that.

38
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.660
So first of all if you don't tell what
to do with overflow it just assumes.

39
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750
I want my box to still be this tall and

40
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.100
I only want it to take
up that much space but

41
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.180
let my content flow outside of it, which
is why you see this awful text thing.

42
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.940
You have to tell it no,
please actually just do hidden or

43
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.029
something like that, right.

44
00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.290
Or scroll, or auto.

45
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.201
I think auto is pretty
much the same as scroll.

46
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:35.404
It gives it the scrolling
things right here.

47
00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:40.548
Okay, so what's weird about is like
you know how like old people get

48
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:45.820
on the computer and just like turn off
like the magnification of it, right?

49
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.611
By if you Cmd-+ or Ctrl-+ makes it huge,

50
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:54.300
ems will mess with the width
of that point, right?

51
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.420
Because it's relative to the font size and
they're making the font size bigger.

52
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.360
Whereas pixels will stay the same.

53
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.058
Right, and the pixels don't actually get
better, but the bigger, but the ems do.

54
00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:10.166
That's why for the most part you
want to avoid doing widths and

55
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.786
heights in ems.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you want them to get

56
00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:16.780
bigger if someone wants to?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Depends, right?

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.760
Like it just depends on what
you want them to do but

58
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.480
like if you have two boxes that need
to be side by side to each other,

59
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.670
if they start getting too big then they're
gonna stack on top of each other right.

60
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.470
Right, because they're gonna run out of
room to go sideways, so it depends on what

61
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.110
you're trying to accomplish, cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: A couple

62
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.520
of questions from there's one on the CSS
where we uncovered how to debug it

63
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.958
with Chrome dev tools.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

64
00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.752
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You had gone over that and

65
00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:46.920
then the flexbox model.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're not gonna go to

66
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.640
flexbox.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We're not.

67
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No way.

68
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.900
[LAUGH] Flexbox is kind of complicated,
it's brand new, and

69
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.990
it's not very well supported.

70
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.280
So we are kind of brave,
we use it in some places on Reddit but

71
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.480
most companies cannot because they have to
support old browsers and we don't care.

72
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.180
It's not supported in old browsers so
I'm not going to go over it.

73
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.260
And it's kind of hard so.
