[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:06.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk more about
these meta tags that we're seeing.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.700
HTML needs to be present,
always needs to be there.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.690
Again, it's just letting the browser
know this is an HTML document,

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.640
please treat it as such.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.880
The head tag is where all your metadata
goes, nothing in here gets displayed.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.080
And the body is like,
that's your actual content on the page.

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.261
So typically your head's gonna be
30 lines, your body will be, if

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:33.183
it's a short page only a couple lines but
it often can also be thousands of lines.

10
00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:38.419
So tens of thousands of lines even.

11
00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:40.530
So we saw some h1s.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.498
There's actually h1 down to the h6 if
you go, if you're using older browsers,

13
00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:50.395
even in the newest browsers you can
actually go to h8, h10, stuff like that.

14
00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:51.840
I don't know why you would.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.900
I don't ever use much more than like h3,
or h4, but it exists, it's there for you.

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.190
And like we saw before, the browser
has some default styles for it,

17
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.070
notice it was bold, it was larger,
there was spacing around it.

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.440
The browser just assumes
that he's given me an h1,

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960
I think he wants it to look like a title.

20
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.490
But we'll see later how to change that.

21
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.820
Paragraphs, just to note, it's like, here
is a block of text that is a paragraph,

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.900
please display it separated
from other things.

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.275
It's just like a paragraph,

24
00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.582
exactly what you think of in terms
of semantically what a paragraph is.

25
00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:37.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, a div is both
very useful and very frustrating.

26
00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:43.770
But it's a separation of content.

27
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.194
Like, it's a container.

28
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:49.660
Just like,
if I give you a piece of tupperware,

29
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.830
you can't assume anything about
what's in the tupperware.

30
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.697
It's kind of like the same idea of a div.

31
00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:57.160
It's just a container
to hold other things.

32
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.570
It has no meaning, like a paragraph
means like I'm gonna have text in

33
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.950
here like it's a tupperware
specifically for text.

34
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.000
That's the weirdest example I've ever
used, but we will stick with that.

35
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.950
A div is a container for anything.

36
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.700
And then, you will kind of
define what's going to be in it

37
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.640
using other means that we'll
kind of discuss later.

38
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.890
But you'll see lots of it and
your temptation when

39
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.410
you're doing web development like I
still do it so you'll definitely do,

40
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.620
it is to put everything in the div, like
everything just like we call div soup,

41
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.520
or dividers, that just like you just
have like this total huge mess of divs.

42
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.786
You'll kind of figure out the balance,
or you won't, like me, and

43
00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:48.764
you'll just continue doing it for
the rest of your life, so whatever.

44
00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:51.268
[LAUGH] Confessions of a web developer.

45
00:02:51.268 --> 00:02:54.179
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

46
00:02:54.179 --> 00:03:01.000
we'll just go over some of the more
used tags, ul stands for unordered list.

47
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.520
You find out there's
a lot of abbreviations.

48
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.280
It's annoying, but
you just get used to them.

49
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.300
So there's an unordered list.

50
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.400
So you notice like on my slides,
I have like a bullet point list.

51
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.800
That's an unordered list.

52
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.359
It's just kinda saying,
I'm about to give you a list of items and

53
00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.440
there's no specific ordering to it.

54
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.130
Like you can re-arrange stuff and
nothing would really change.

55
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.960
No order is implied whatsoever.

56
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.020
Ordered lists is saying,
I'm about to give you a list,

57
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.610
and please maintain the order of
this list because it's important.

58
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.750
The steps to, I don't know,
bathing someone, never mind,

59
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.510
I'm not gonna go there.

60
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.430
Let's think of something else, like-
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Driving somewhere?

61
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.714
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Driving somewhere,
like open the door, get in the car,

62
00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:47.721
turn on the car, and go.

63
00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:49.727
Like you can't really mix those up,
like if you try and

64
00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:52.188
start the car before you're in it,
you're gonna have a bad time.

65
00:03:52.188 --> 00:03:53.328
Thank you.

66
00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:58.100
[LAUGH] I didn't like where that
other one was going, so [LAUGH].

67
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.005
This is a family friendly
audience I think.

68
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:07.220
[LAUGH]
So yes, please like it implies ordered,

69
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.370
please maintain it and you'll notice most
the time ordered lists start with like

70
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.940
numbers or letters like one, two,
three, A, B, C or something like that.

71
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.970
Something to denote that
it has some order to it.

72
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.040
And then,
an li goes inside either one of those,

73
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.710
it's just saying like this is
an element inside of here.

74
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.030
So why is this really cool?

75
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.982
Like if you're doing an ordered list,
and say,

76
00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:34.790
we're going back to
the car driving example,

77
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.470
we forgot to put in the open the door
step, and we had all ready numbers in one,

78
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.454
two, three, four, five, six, seven,
say we had to add a second step in again.

79
00:04:44.454 --> 00:04:47.009
We would not have to go back and
change all those numbers.

80
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.060
I'm sure all of you have done that before,
your making a list on a document, and

81
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.860
you have to go back and

82
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.450
change all the God damn numbers cuz
you added a new second element.

83
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.042
You can have it so your styling will just,
I have five elements,

84
00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:05.473
I know I have to put five tags and so
the second one always gets the second one.

85
00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:09.798
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In the chat, they're asking
for a link to some references on these

86
00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:13.749
tags, I guess maybe the documentation
on listing them all.

87
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] what's that?

88
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I can send one.

89
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.970
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah,
I have [INAUDIBLE] as well.

90
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sure, post it in chat.

91
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that'd be great.

92
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.516
Looks like Nina will take care of it,
but the best place for

93
00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:31.831
documentation for everything web in
my personal opinion is the MDN or

94
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.869
it's the Mozilla Developer Network.

95
00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.380
I'm sure many of you use Firefox.

96
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.060
Great browser.

97
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.400
Great company and so
they put out something called the MDN.

98
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.060
Which is essentially just documentation
for how to be a web developer.

99
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.270
At least for me,
it's the authoritative source of truth.

100
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.960
So if I do not know something,
you can go there,

101
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.630
and if it says it on the MDN,
it is just truth, just solid truth.

102
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.650
So yes, you can search for
MDN space li, and

103
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.894
then, I bet you the top result would be,
well, let's just try it.

104
00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:14.885
So mdn li,

105
00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:20.209
right there.

106
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:21.434
Let's get rid of this.

107
00:06:24.234 --> 00:06:26.909
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I don't expect you to read this, but

108
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:32.112
this will tell you everything that you
have ever wanted to know about the li.

109
00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:37.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, great source.

110
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.100
I will recommend not using W3 schools,
that's usually one of the top results and

111
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.378
it's usually the worst one.

112
00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:48.030
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [INAUDIBLE] W3 schools.

113
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.935
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Thank you Nina,

114
00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:51.370
just kidding.

115
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.715
No, it's fine.

116
00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:53.734
It's very simplified.

117
00:06:53.734 --> 00:06:57.673
And so,
it might be good to start out with.

118
00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:02.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

119
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.221
So do we have any questions about lists?

120
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:08.580
I think we're about to
do an example with them.

121
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.540
So we'll get some hands
on experience with that.

122
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.500
Here's a good example.

123
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.240
So my favorite social media sites.

124
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.207
The top one obviously and
the best ever would be reddit.com.

125
00:07:23.207 --> 00:07:25.557
Thank you.

126
00:07:25.557 --> 00:07:30.560
But let's talk about the fact that
I used an ol versus a ul here.

127
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.100
Like this is implying that
there is an order to this like,

128
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.200
if you put Instagram on the top,
it's not the same list anymore.

129
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.390
Like this one implies that Reddit
is my absolute favorite, and

130
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.820
then Instagram is my third favorite.

131
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.510
That's what that ol means,
if I had put a ul there it's like

132
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.540
here's a list of sites that I like and
no necessary order implied.

133
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.230
Now, you might be asking yourself,
well, why does this matter?

134
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.450
Like ul versus ol?

135
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.800
For the most part it's just gonna
be the developer that sees it.

136
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.480
There are some default stylings to it but,

137
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.440
when we get to the CSS part like
I'll show you how to change it.

138
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.380
You can make an ol look like a ul and

139
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.050
like, it'd be totally
transparent to the user.

140
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.110
So why?

141
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.298
Why do we painstakingly make sure
that we're using the correct tag for

142
00:08:15.298 --> 00:08:16.290
every single thing that we do?

143
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.820
This concept is called semantic HTML,
and it's going to make your life easier,

144
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.056
because you're going to write code,
then you're gonna go back and

145
00:08:25.056 --> 00:08:28.518
do something else for three months and
you're gonna come back to it, and

146
00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:32.036
you're gonna look at it, and it's like,
what the hell was I thinking?

147
00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:34.040
Why did I do it this way?

148
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.380
If you do get into this habit
of doing semantic HTML,

149
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.750
it makes everything just really easy,
because you come back and

150
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:48.600
you say, I made this list and there's
order to it, so I should not change this.

151
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.084
So it's kind of like you communicating
either A, with your future self, or B,

152
00:08:52.084 --> 00:08:53.336
with one of your coworkers.

153
00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:57.398
Cuz your coworker's gonna come in here and
say, why the hell did he do this,

154
00:08:57.398 --> 00:08:57.980
this way?

155
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.310
And you'll find out a lot of the habits
I'm gonna try and get you into, or

156
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.600
we're going to try and
get you into, is for that.

157
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.349
It's for service to your future self.

158
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.098
Because you write something once and
you're like this is the greatest

159
00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:15.319
thing ever, I'm never gonna have to touch
it again and then you're just gonna be so

160
00:09:15.319 --> 00:09:16.722
sad when you have to touch it again.

161
00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:22.710
[LAUGH] It makes the difference to
get into good habits right now.

162
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.548
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They want you to explain
semantic market a little bit more.

163
00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:27.562
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

164
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:35.057
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see, it's semantic
market, and we'll get into more of it as

165
00:09:35.057 --> 00:09:40.210
we go further and further, but it's using
the correct tag for the correct situation.

166
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.520
So for

167
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.310
example, there's another tag that we have
not talked about yet, it's called article.

168
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.700
As you might imagine an article
describes an article.

169
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.446
If you were on a news site you wouldn't
expect your article to be inside

170
00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:01.710
an article tag and then everything inside
of it you knew was a part of an article.

171
00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:07.485
Now, article doesn't have any special
power that a div doesn't have.

172
00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:12.365
It's just an article is special
tupperware just for articles.

173
00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:15.495
And so, when you look at an article,
this is an article,

174
00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:18.655
this container can only contain articles.

175
00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:21.125
But you look at a div, and you're like,
I don't know what's gonna go in here.

176
00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:24.339
You have to go through and read all of the
code to figure out, what the hell did I

177
00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:27.276
stick in this tupperware and
why is it moldy, or something like that.

178
00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:32.124
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm sticking with

179
00:10:32.124 --> 00:10:34.475
the tupperware example,
I'm really proud of this one.

180
00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:38.150
Not as proud as I'm of the bath one,
whatever.

181
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.180
It's like putting a label
on your tupperware.

182
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.340
It's letting your future self
know like this is what's in

183
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.390
here because it's kind of a black box and
you kinda have to like poke around and

184
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.020
figure out what's in there,
it's a labeling system for it.

185
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Does it also make it a lot
easier and more powerful when you start

186
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.750
doing dynamic pages with CSS because you
can reference those tags in the code?

187
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's also true, so it
makes those like tags addressable by CSS.

188
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.609
It doesn't make sense to you right now,
that's okay, we'll get to it but

189
00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:16.320
it's also giving more hooks for
your CSS to pick up on, thank you.

190
00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:22.171
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, is that kind a make
sense that the tupperware labeling sort of

191
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:24.129
example, we'll stick with that.
