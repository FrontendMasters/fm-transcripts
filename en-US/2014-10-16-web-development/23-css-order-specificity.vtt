2
00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:10.144
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Would that apply
to every single div on the html?

3
00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:10.896
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so,

4
00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:16.344
if I put another div in here, it would
look pretty weird, but let's do that.

5
00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:25.764
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another div.

6
00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:27.094
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If you change it to

7
00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.934
div class, would that be different or

8
00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.901
would it still apply?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It would still apply

9
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.010
because it's still a div, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well,

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.750
what if you wanted to change it?

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.250
What if you didn't want those two boxes

12
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.150
to match because you'd have this div and
css, and

13
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.710
then put it in the class of everything.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question, so

14
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.878
lets do one for this-class.

15
00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:58.310
And say background-color green, okay?

16
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.596
Now we're starting to get into
specificity a little bit.

17
00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:08.908
Oops this-class.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

18
00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:12.510
kind of interesting what
was going on here right?

19
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.180
So let's first of all,
you've got the HTML right.

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.230
Like this one is a div with no class.

21
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.160
This is a div with a class
that says this-class okay?

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.460
All right so collapse that.

23
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.220
Let's talk about what's happening here.

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.790
This div does apply to this right?

25
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.110
Like this is still a div so
it's getting all that style applied to it.

26
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.600
But then we have one down
here that says this-class and

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.860
it doesn't contradict all of those
properties it only contradicts one

28
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.530
of the properties which
is the background color.

29
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.040
So now you have a conflict here
in the background class so

30
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.790
it's needs to ask itself
which one wins right.

31
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.220
Like which one gets applied
when these two are conflicting.

32
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.000
This is this idea of specificity
that I keep referring to.

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.470
This-class is more specific,
thus it gets applied.

34
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.690
So, its background color is green, and so
therefore, it would be orange otherwise,

35
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.010
like if I took this property out
it would go back to being orange.

36
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.900
But because it is more
specific it gets applied.

37
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.740
So let's talk a little bit
about specificity now.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.370
Let's go back up here to our html, okay.

39
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.280
I'm gonna have another div underneath it,
oops I don't want that one.

40
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.230
Actually you know what?

41
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.110
Why not?
It's kind of fun.

42
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.380
We'll put the other one right here.

43
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.620
I am also here, okay.

44
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.080
So we now have four divs and
I'm going to give this one ID.

45
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.920
Let's call this one another class.

46
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.444
And then down here, we're gonna have
one that's gonna have another class but

47
00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:13.300
it's also gonna have id="special" or
something like that, okay.

48
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.460
Let's go ahead and change these back out.

49
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.130
So this is gonna have no class.

50
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.370
This is gonna have one class.

51
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.000
Also no class.

52
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.190
Just so it's kind of visually
apparent to which is which.

53
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.820
This is gonna have two classes and
this is going to have

54
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.180
two classes plus id, okay?

55
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.214
So, in no class, one class, also no class,
two classes and two classes and

56
00:03:56.214 --> 00:04:00.770
an id.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops, and

57
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.470
let's expand this one out, okay.

58
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.110
So, these ones that have the class on it
are all getting the green background.

59
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.700
Right, the ones with no class
are getting the orange background.

60
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.250
So if I do well, first of all,
if I do another class, right?

61
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.880
Because these ones with two classes
all have another class on them right.

62
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.741
So, if I say background-color: pink.

63
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nothing changes, right?

64
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.910
Why?

65
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.400
Because this class and
another class are the same specificity.

66
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.590
Because they have one
class on them that match.

67
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.360
So it's gonna pick the one that's lower in
the file, the last one that gets declared.

68
00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.019
But let's do this-class.another-class,

69
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:04.300
make sure that there is no space there.

70
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.660
That's key, that's a very key difference.

71
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.370
And I say background-color: blue.

72
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.690
Two classes, both of them down
here now have a blue background.

73
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.710
I can put this above.

74
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.720
I could, oops, sorry.

75
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.640
I could put this above it, right.

76
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.310
It wouldn't matter what order in the file
it came because now it has two classes

77
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.930
that it's referring to and
therefore is more specific, okay?

78
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.670
Now, just for fun, at the top right
up here, I am going to say #special,

79
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.232
right here and I am going to say

80
00:05:44.232 --> 00:05:51.030
background color: yellow or

81
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.800
something like that, it doesn't matter,
there no huge difference there.

82
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.645
Purple.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

83
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:03.971
background color is now purple, why?

84
00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:07.006
It's because IDs,
no matter how many classes and

85
00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:09.690
I know it's actually not completely true.

86
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.910
But for really all intents and purposes,
no matter how many classes you have

87
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.780
in there, an ID is always more specific
because you're addressing just one.

88
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:26.450
So ID always trumps classes even if
there's like 30 classes on it, right?

89
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.800
Way more than it's actually possible.

90
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.430
I think actually if you have 256 classes,
it will finally beat an ID,

91
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.730
but that's just totally and completely
impractical and will never happen.

92
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.850
Or if that's happening to you,
you really need to come back and

93
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.770
watch this class again.

94
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.140
Because that's not good.

95
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.050
Okay, so we've kind of demonstrated
to you these principles,

96
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.010
yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

97
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.380
there's kind of a hierarchy here.

98
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.320
If div gives like a red background.

99
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.860
They all have red borders.

100
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.850
Sorry, not background.

101
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.540
And f only replaces the things that,
it's kind of pulling from both of them.

102
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, it's cascading.

103
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.130
It is a cascading style sheet.

104
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.011
This is exactly why it's called CSS.

105
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:10.260
A cascading style sheet.

106
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.560
It's cuz the effects cascade down,
kind of like a waterfall, right.

107
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.460
That's the idea here.
