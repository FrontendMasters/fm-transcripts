[00:00:00]

[00:00:03]
>> Speaker 1: So something really important to note here is that Linux and Mac OS, those files are case sensitive. So what that means is if you have all lower case, and you try to refer to maybe an extension that's all upper case, those files are not the same. Except Windows doesn't really care.

[00:00:29]
So that's really something to be mindful of, yeah. Windows honey badger don't care.
>> Speaker 1: So to navigate to a different directory, we would use cd, which I showed in the slide before. Stands for change directory. On Windows we would use chdir. So a little bit of a more of verbose command.

[00:00:58]
If we wanted to move up one directory, and I could do a quick demo of this for you guys.
>> Speaker 1: So here is Brian's terminal. We can go ahead and use some of those commands that we learned. So pwd will tell us that we're currently in the /Users/brian/talks/intro-to-webdev directory.

[00:01:30]
If I wanted to see what the contents of this directory were, I could type ls, and I could see that we have some files and some folders here. If I wanted to use a flag, this ls command accepts a flag, -l. So this is sending in an option to this ls command.

[00:01:55]
So, -l means I want this stuff as a list. And even though we're running the same commands, we're getting the information back in a different format. So to move up one directory, you type in this cd command, and you follow it by two spaces. So now, if we do our pwd again, we'll see that instead of being intro-to-webdev-app followed by the app folder, we've moved up one directory back.

[00:02:28]
So we hopped up to the parent directory. Does this make sense to everyone? Yeah, all right.
>> Speaker 1: So this is a really important slide. And relative versus absolute paths is something you'll just come across over and over and over again in web development. So a relative path is a path that starts from the point in the directory structure that you are in, while an absolute path means it starts all the way from the beginning.

[00:03:09]
So let's go back to our terminal. And we'll go back up one directory. We'll do our directory listing. So here Brian has a bunch of different folders that I represented in pink. If I wanted to get at something that was in the files folder from this point in our directory structure, which we can see via pwd, so we're in Users/brian/talks, we can just say files, whatever.

[00:03:42]
Like whatever file is in here, we can access it from here. And the important thing to note here is there is no forward slash at the beginning of files. If I wanted to get to this file from anywhere else in the tree structure, and know that I was always starting from the root, you would type this forward slash first.

[00:04:10]
And that forward slash is just the root of all the files here on the Mac. So if I navigate to here and list my files, we'll see everything. We got our applications folder, the library folders, the users. So, from here, to access that talks directory, we would do Users/brian/talks, and then we would do files and access anything in that files directory.

[00:04:38]
So, that's providing the whole path.
>> Speaker 1: When you're doing web development, a lot of times you'll be trying to access files and directories in a relative way. So in your web app, for example, you'll have a public folder that might have a js folder with all your JavaScript files or an images folder with all your images.

[00:05:05]
And so you would say, I want image, and so I would do images, then the forward slash, which means the folder, and then access the file in there. Does that make sense to everyone? Yeah? Cool.
>> Speaker 2: Someone once explained to me relative paths versus absolute paths as addresses, right?

[00:05:26]
An absolute address is like she lives on 200 Main Street. If you know exactly where to go, I could say from anywhere in the city, go to 200 Main. It doesn't matter where you are, 200 Main is the same spot. But if I'm giving you directions like go down to the gas station, take a left and then take a right, that is relative to where you are.

[00:05:45]
And if you get that same direction in another part of the city, it's no longer true. So that's relative from where you are and where you're going.
>> Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like that analogy, that's a good one. Yeah?
>> Speaker 3: Is anybody else having trouble with the dir command on Windows, saying command not found?

[00:06:01]
I don't know if when you mentioned to open git, did you have them open git bash on Windows?
>> Speaker 1: So just a quick note on that. If they're using git bash, git bash is smart. And they can go ahead and use the Linux style commands in git bash.

[00:06:16]

>> Speaker 3: But then I think the Windows ones won't work, right?
>> Speaker 1: Right.
>> Speaker 3: And I think we might be-
>> Speaker 2: So if you're on Windows and you want to use the Windows commands open the cmd.exe on your Windows computer.
>> Speaker 1: If you are on Windows and want to use the Unix style commands you can do those in git bash.

[00:06:45]

>> Speaker 1: So here's a visual kind of directory structure. Someone there is trying to hide something. But if I wanted to do an absolute path to c.html, I would do forward slash WWW, forward slash the name of this bottom folder, which is cut off here, forward slash c.html. Now if I was here in this XXX folder and I wanted to access b.html I could just type b.html and I'd be there.
