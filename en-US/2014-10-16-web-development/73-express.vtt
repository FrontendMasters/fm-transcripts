00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.101
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:08.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We've now seen how
to install a global tool for node.

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.880
That's what that -g means.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.150
It means I wanna be able to use
this from anywhere on my computer.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.960
That's the last one I'm
going to install that way.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.460
Everything else is going
to be installed locally.

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.460
So it's only gonna be available in
very small parts of your computer.

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.031
In this particular case, it's gonna
be available in our little apps.

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

10
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, we kinda went
through that, that -g, means it's global.

11
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.670
All right.

12
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.660
So, [COUGH] we just built our first and
last app using just vanilla node, why?

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.040
It's actually really hard
to write just plain node.

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.210
As in like it's kind of beyond me even.

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.290
Or at least I haven't ever tried.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.640
So, like jQuery there's something
called Express that exists for node.

17
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.350
Express is certainly not the only
framework that you can use, but

18
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.720
it's certainly the most common one.

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.930
And it's just like a design to
make writing a node server like

20
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.210
a billion times easier.

21
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.620
Kinda like I said a billion,
maybe a trillion.

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.670
Okay, so go back to your Sublime.

23
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.533
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't
know if you've noticed but

24
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:31.851
I'm certainly not prone to hyperbole,
okay so we're gonna be in Express okay.

25
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:42.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, come back to your
little command line right here.

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.670
We're gonna get out of here so
I'm gonna hit cd..

27
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
We're back in our node exercises and

28
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.170
we can say, okay and
now we need to go to express, okay.

29
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.220
Here, we're gonna type npm install,
very key here do not put -g.

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.250
I'm gonna repeat that,
do not put -g express, okay.

31
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.981
Just like that, npm install express.

32
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, much is going to
happen if you get permission errors again

33
00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:18.805
which hopefully at this time you will not,
then go ahead and

34
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.642
throw sudo before that again.

35
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
that should look something like that.

36
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.685
That look good for people.

37
00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:29.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you show
that command line again?

38
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.542
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so
it's just gonna be npn install express.

39
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're lazy like me,

40
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.720
you can actually shorten this
down to npn i and that works too.

41
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why wouldn't
you install that globally?

42
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's an idea,
a philosophy in node.

43
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.490
That everything should be totally and
completely self contained.

44
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.110
So if I have three apps,
all of them are using Express,

45
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.740
they're not necessarily gonna use
the same version of Express cuz

46
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.410
Express is actually
updated pretty regularly.

47
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.390
And so I don't wanna have to update
all of my apps just because I wanna

48
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.240
update one of them.

49
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.450
So they each can carry
their own dependencies.

50
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.767
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So that means going
in every private directory and

51
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:17.470
you have to expressly install Express.

52
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is, again,
it's something you do once, when you start

53
00:03:20.257 --> 00:03:23.905
a project, and then you work on project
for six months, you don't care, right?

54
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:31.186
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm a huge proponent of
this, so, I think it's a great thing.

55
00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
cool we got Express going now?

56
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Were you in a different
folder or was it the same?

57
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.290
Folder?

58
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so
we're in the Express folder now.

59
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One question is
when do you use the save play?

60
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll talk about it.

61
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

62
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Coming up.

63
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.820
So we were in Basic, right?

64
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.170
We have now moved on to Express.

65
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.601
So I got into the Express directory.

66
00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:08.590
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should now see
this little node_modules folder.

67
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.780
We didn't create that, but
guess what, surprise it's there.

68
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.620
That's where npn keeps all
the code that it brings in.

69
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.552
In fact, if you look in node_modules,

70
00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:23.360
you'll see that there's
a folder called express.

71
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.465
If you look in express, you'll see that
it has a lot of code that to look at it,

72
00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:31.310
like you don't have to, but it's there.

73
00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:36.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Feeling good?

74
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:46.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
let's go back to our code here.

75
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.690
We now are in Express.

76
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.340
We're looking at the app.js
that's inside of Express, okay.

77
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.930
So you notice the first thing rather than
requiring HTTP, we're requiring Express.

78
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.150
So again to [COUGH] reiterate how
node is going to work with this,

79
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.120
you're gonna say give me Express.

80
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.046
It's first gonna go see, do I node,

81
00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:14.480
personally do I own
anything called Express?

82
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.510
I don't.

83
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.360
So I'm going to go look at his
externally installed npn type stuff and

84
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.700
see if it's out there.

85
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.371
It's gonna find Express in there, and

86
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:26.420
it's gonna bring that into our
project here in this express variable.

87
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.129
So that we we've installed npn,
through npn Express,

88
00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.935
it's now available to us
because we installed it.

89
00:05:37.935 --> 00:05:40.325
So now we have Express right here,
and here,

90
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:45.360
we're going to create an instance of
Express using this Express function.

91
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.710
If it looks kind of weird.

92
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.050
It is kind of an interesting pattern but
anyway.

93
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.530
This is the app here is now how we
are going to operate our web server, okay.

94
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.722
So, you remember how we were talking
about HTTP verbs like get and post?

95
00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:09.030
We're gonna say every time
that someone calls a get,

96
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.739
which is what this get right here means,
on hello.txt,

97
00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:17.880
this req and
res should look familiar to you, right?

98
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.660
Please send them Hello World, okay.

99
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.395
This is essentially the same app that
we wrote before, but now on Express.

100
00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:30.535
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about this?

101
00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:35.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again, well, not again.

102
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.840
For the first time, rather.

103
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.710
Server, is an instance of the app that
we've created, we've essentially setup

104
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.080
the entire app right here and
then we get the server running here and

105
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.440
say app.listen, and that's when
actually the server starts going.

106
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.055
If we took this part out right here,

107
00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:56.660
we essentially configure a server and
then it would never run.

108
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.670
This part you're essentially saying,
I've configured everything I want to now.

109
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.316
Please actually start doing your thing.

110
00:07:05.856 --> 00:07:06.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool?

111
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.963
Should we actually see what it does?

112
00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.582
All right, so.

113
00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:15.380
Nodemon app.js.

114
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.441
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, started running.

115
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna go
check out what it does in the browser.

116
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So first of all we have to
go to hello.txt because that's what we set

117
00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:38.639
it up as.

118
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.050
Now we see a Hello World here.

119
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:47.630
What will be interesting, try doing it
with something else or just like an empty.

120
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.340
If we do this,
it's going to say cannot GET.

121
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.460
Or if you go to this,
it's gonna say cannot GET that.

122
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.490
Let's talk about why for just a second.

123
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.780
That pattern of giving, essentially
throwing up anytime someone asks for

124
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.420
anything is like hey, I want this and
you say, no you get this.

125
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.530
And it just every request given that.

126
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.560
We actually wanna route specific
things to specific places, right?

127
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.380
Like you want your index to be
different than your about page,

128
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.330
then you want the about like contact page,
right?

129
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.800
You wanna have different
routes on your web server.

130
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.400
And that's what this makes
this really easy, right?

131
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.726
And we just say any time they
go to mywebsite/hello.txt,

132
00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:30.553
serve them Hello World.

133
00:08:33.053 --> 00:08:34.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We follow,
does that make sense?

134
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.360
You can change it to be something else.

135
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.405
It can be like, thing.txt and then if you
saved it, restarts, come back over here.

136
00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:47.071
thing.txt, now it's being served there.

137
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, makes sense?

138
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.250
It's just like another way
of doing the same thing.

139
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is the structure then that
you would have a lot of get functions for

140
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.320
all the different pages and
at the end you would have the server?

141
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, that's really good,
in fact that's the structure that

142
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.780
we'll see at least
throughout our class today.

143
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.959
And we'll actually even get into posting,
which will be different than a get, right?
