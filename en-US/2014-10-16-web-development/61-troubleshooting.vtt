00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.019
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.879
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one's from, I'm sorry
if I'm saying your name wrong, Siyu?

3
00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.119
S-I-Y-U?

4
00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.559
So this is the one that he sent in.

5
00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.466
This is a really,

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:17.410
really common problem that you're gonna
run in to all time as web developer.

7
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.760
It's not, in fact, you guys saw me do it.

8
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.640
Just like five minutes ago.

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.160
Not getting all the proper names right or
the nesting levels correct.

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.660
That was his problem.

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.340
He just needed an extra data right here,
right,

12
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.730
cuz you have to go inside of the entire
data object and into the data object.

13
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.510
Right, that's why I changed this to
be response as well as this one.

14
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.680
This makes it a little bit more clear,
right, this is the response object and

15
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.640
inside of the response object
I'm going into the data one.

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.430
He also doesn't need this jasonp.

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.840
So let's just get rid of that.

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.770
That wouldn't hurt anything.

19
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.280
It just wouldn't do anything.

20
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.012
So I think now, yeah,
his should work because of that.

21
00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we'll leave this page.

22
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.350
And this is what I was looking at for
Elizabeth.

23
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.410
Elizabeth W, if I recall correctly.

24
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.220
She is essentially all there, but

25
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.020
if you look here in the console,
which by the way is your best friend,

26
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.870
it's telling me that there is
an unexpected end parenthesis somewhere.

27
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.869
I haven't found it yet, but
it's in there somewhere.

28
00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.946
And usually they'll give you a nice,
in fact, I wonder if I can look at it

29
00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.894
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right there.

30
00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:41.824
After the text out of pend photo,
it's not expecting this parenthesis right

31
00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:46.947
there,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

32
00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:50.470
don't think you need that as well so
let's try that.

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.150
So that apparently hasn't worked.

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.550
Let's go back to our console.

35
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.589
Unexpected end of input so
let's check that out.

36
00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.937
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As you can see, the console
is going to be really useful because when

37
00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:10.390
you have errors it is gonna
output the errors to the console.

38
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.480
As you can see here though
it is still a syntax error.

39
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.540
I just haven't quite
figured out what it is yet.

40
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.270
Okay, so we have the AJAX just
start reforming some of this.

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.100
I'm gonna talk about
data here in just a sec.

42
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.969
But for the second just bear with me.

43
00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something else Elizabeth
had is that your search parameters do have

44
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.130
to be inside of data if you're
gonna split them out like she had.

45
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.290
Another word of caution we give you is,
in JSON they expect commas.

46
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.510
So if I had type GET here, and I omit
the comma, the whole world ends, actually.

47
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.590
So I mean,
it's goes down in a fiery blaze of glory.

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.159
So you need commas to separate
different property values.

49
00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.959
&gt;&gt; Female Student 1: I think there's
a missing curly brace in the for.

50
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.802
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,
let's indent this so

51
00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:17.570
I can actually see what's going on.

52
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.210
So this one is matched up to that one,
right success is matched up to this one.

53
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.340
And this one is matched up to Ajax, right.

54
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.594
Not Ajax, the anonymous function.

55
00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:49.185
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
which one is this one matched up to?

56
00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:56.410
It's not, so another issue as you
might be seeing here is like,

57
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.820
matching parentheses, matching curly
brackets, matching square brackets,

58
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.550
it's very important that you get into good
habits or else you run into problems like

59
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.070
these, that you feel like are really
dumb problems but in reality,

60
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:17.220
JavaScript can't read your file
unless it has correct curly braces.

61
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.831
Lets put this back on this line.

62
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:27.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
pack this down a little bit.

63
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.071
So that's the Ajax object.

64
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:30.871
The Ajax object ends there.

65
00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:39.284
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay and then I might need
another curly brace right there to match

66
00:04:39.284 --> 00:04:44.759
With the function, and I need one for
the click, which would be like that.

67
00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:57.929
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Still
unexpected end of input, oops.

68
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope, okay.

69
00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:27.459
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

70
00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, function there.

71
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.786
That one closes there,
this one closes there.

72
00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.150
If you can't see what I'm doing,

73
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.360
you can see when I click on
this curly brace right here

74
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.820
it has an underline right there of the one
that the computer thinks it matches up to.

75
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.820
That's exactly what I'm
doing right now to try and

76
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.440
figure out where everything
thinks that it should be ending.

77
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.460
There's the click button.

78
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.970
So those should all be matched
now from what I can see.

79
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.729
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Is there
anything above or below?

80
00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:15.169
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't see it.

81
00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:24.229
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Success is a.

82
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:27.569
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Yeah.

83
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right so my next
step on a lot of these is just to start

84
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.790
commenting out blocks of code and then
you can start figuring out what's wrong.

85
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.439
All right so
let's just comment all of that out.

86
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.120
What I've done there is,
sorry I don't know the Windows one but

87
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.200
it's Command-/ and that'll comment
out whatever you have selected.

88
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.680
Now this code no longer has any effect.

89
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:04.300
It gives you the ability to
figure out what is going wrong.

90
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.390
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: On video
of this 20 degree portion.

91
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:16.019
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so that means
something in this commented code is wrong.

92
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.399
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Did you try
to cancel logarithm inside it?

93
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:26.763
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
let's just alert here, okay.

94
00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:31.759
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: I guess it
went back to replacement so.

95
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:32.882
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we know for

96
00:07:32.882 --> 00:07:37.370
a fact that something is wrong
with this block of code.

97
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.130
So we are kind of narrowing it down
to where the problems could be.

98
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.460
So you have to take a look at our for
loop here.

99
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.610
Well even this we can
just like comment it.

100
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.100
Comment out the for loop body and
see if it's a problem with our for loop.

101
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:06.809
Then say open back up our console.

102
00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:15.319
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so it looks like
it's something in our console body.

103
00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:22.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
so it's something here.

104
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.290
So we have img src there plus
response.data.children plus that-

105
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.300
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Why is there slash

106
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.810
before img?

107
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.487
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There shouldn't be.

108
00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:38.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: At least now
we're getting somewhere.

109
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.010
Now it's not crashing.

110
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.788
We're just not getting the actual images.

111
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.443
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, we will now
have response.data.children and

112
00:08:45.443 --> 00:08:47.909
she did the exact same thing I did,
she forgot data.

113
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.769
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Puppies.

114
00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:55.733
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Talk about the best

115
00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:56.709
consolation prize, right?

116
00:08:56.709 --> 00:08:57.848
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's,

117
00:08:57.848 --> 00:09:00.489
[LAUGH] you fix the code,
and now you have puppies.

118
00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:02.182
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay so

119
00:09:02.182 --> 00:09:07.920
hopefully that was an interesting
exercise in debugging for you.

120
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.230
It's a difficult skill to learn and it's
one that you don't want to develop but

121
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.580
you have to develop so.

122
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.270
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Sometimes it's
a majority of your time when

123
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.800
you're working on existing code.

124
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll spend whole days,
not writing code and just fixing bugs.

125
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.430
Actually, I'd say recently,
that's been the case a lot.

126
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.820
So, hopefully that was good for
you guys, hopefully somewhat useful.

127
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.850
I was going to talk
a little bit about data.

128
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.160
So, you remember how I had like
the question mark Q equals.

129
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.829
JQuery has a nice little helper for that.

130
00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:46.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's weird, okay.

131
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:52.360
It called data and so they will
just dynamically make that for you.

132
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.750
So instead of having ?q = puppy and
sr true, all you can have to do is give it

133
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.890
an object and JavaScript or jQuery will go
ahead and make that query string for you.

134
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.367
This makes it easy to make dynamic, like
if we wanted to be able to like change up

135
00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:12.469
the query or whatever, all you have to do
is feed it a variable and it'd be done.

136
00:10:15.189 --> 00:10:17.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,
so I fixed two of them.

137
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.150
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: How many did you do?

138
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.952
Two?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Two.

139
00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.492
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Did you get the one?

140
00:10:22.492 --> 00:10:23.252
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I haven't.

141
00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:25.592
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Did
you get the [INAUDIBLE].

142
00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.072
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

143
00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:31.823
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: I don't think I saw any

144
00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:36.579
right there.

145
00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:39.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So full disclosure,
I have not looked at this yet so.

146
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.254
Let's take a look at this.

147
00:10:45.254 --> 00:10:49.610
All right so he has a button click,
let's just see what's going wrong first.

148
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.367
So we gets the loading, let's take
a look what is console saying failure to

149
00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:58.079
alert in secure response,
I bet he has JSONP down here.

150
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:05.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, he has HTTPS.

151
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.139
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it doesn't look
like he's actually making image tags.

152
00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:18.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So first thing,

153
00:11:18.063 --> 00:11:23.000
I wouldn't expect many people
to recognize this right away.

154
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.350
You can't load secure content
onto an insecure page.

155
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.050
Well you can, but
not in this particular case.

156
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.720
So the fact that he has s here which means
it's a secure connection that caused him

157
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.630
some issues and also I don't think it's
served securely anyway for that matter.

158
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.240
So it needs to be served insecurely
because that's what it's expecting.

159
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.540
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: Does it
need a query on there as well?

160
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.200
Does it not have one?

161
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No he has
it right here in the data.

162
00:11:52.551 --> 00:11:53.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and as far as,

163
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.910
like, this he just doesn't have the fist
part of the image in here as well.

164
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.119
So you, I or

165
00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:10.689
ing src equals [SOUND] okay.

166
00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:17.590
And then surprise puppies so
interesting problems.

167
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.270
Any questions about how I did that or
what I was doing?

168
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.984
If you're gonna do any amount
of web development this is just

169
00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:29.799
gonna be something you get
very familiar with doing.

170
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.467
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's also typically
easier outside of CodePen to debug but

171
00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:39.420
a lot of the same techniques still apply.
