[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.805
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
there are a few ways that we can change or

3
00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:08.120
add items in an array.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.400
The first way is that we can
reference them by number and

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.774
just update the value and
that will override it.

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.589
The second way to do it is
to use this method called

7
00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.235
push that's available on any array.

8
00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.335
If we push a new value,
it'll just add it on to the end.

9
00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:35.437
And running this will return the number,

10
00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:38.799
the length of the new list.

11
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.470
There's also a function called pop,
which will

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.370
pop off the last value in that list and
return that.

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.100
So let's do some exercises.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.970
So we have our fruits array here.

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.390
If I wanted to change the first item,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: To,

16
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.770
let's say Apricot,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I

17
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.980
would access this array by index.

18
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.967
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And
then if I look at my fruits array again,

19
00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:24.360
we'll see that the first
item has changed to Apricot.

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.606
To add on a new item to the end of
the list, we'll do fruits.push.

21
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.680
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Add
a new fruit on there.

22
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.760
The value that's returned is
the length of our new array,

23
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.190
which has four values in it.

24
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.827
If we want to start removing elements from
the end of the list, we'll do fruits.pop.

25
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.598
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: This
function takes no values, so

26
00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:59.810
we can just go ahead and
do that until our list is empty.

27
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.942
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a way of adding
something to the head of the list or

28
00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:05.181
does it always have to go to the unshift?

29
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:06.374
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: What's that?

30
00:02:06.374 --> 00:02:07.924
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Unshift.

31
00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:09.764
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Unshift.

32
00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:11.467
So, would you just do this?

33
00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.666
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

34
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.300
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,
let's just add some more values on there.

35
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.095
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
this is our current state of the array and

36
00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:40.480
let's try unshift again
with a different fruit.

37
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.358
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
if we look at fruits now,

38
00:02:46.358 --> 00:02:49.280
we'll see that Nectarine has been
added to the beginning of the list.
