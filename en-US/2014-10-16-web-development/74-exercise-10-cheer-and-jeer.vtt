00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.922
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna have
an exercise with cheer and jeer, right?

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.849
Make an app that has two routes,
which is essentially,

4
00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.543
we're gonna make an app that has two gits,
right?

5
00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:17.850
We're gonna have one that's
called cheer.txt and jeer.txt.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.086
Cheer should send something
back positive to say, and

7
00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:25.503
jeer sends something back quite negative.

8
00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:27.905
The solution is in cheer and jeer, and

9
00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:32.350
remember you're gonna have to
reinstall express in this new folder.

10
00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.225
So, let's just get on to it.

12
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.777
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The whole solution
is here in cheer and jeer, but

13
00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:50.501
we're actually just gonna go ahead and
create a new folder, and call it exercise,

14
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.340
or whatever you want to call it.

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.080
Okay, here, we're gonna have a new file.

16
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.743
We're gonna save it, and
it's gonna be called app.js, okay?

17
00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:08.332
And then we'll have to go back here to our
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Get out of here,

18
00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:11.170
and we're gonna go into our
exercise folder, right?

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.386
And we're gonna do npm install express,
just like we did before.

20
00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:29.653
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question on why
you were saving the app server variables.

21
00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, you definitely
have to save the app variable,

22
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.370
because using the app variable is
how you create the server variable.

23
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.950
The server variable, force of habit,

24
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.410
I don't know if I necessarily
have a good reason for it.

25
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.730
It's just kind of common practice.

26
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.142
I'm sure it's useful, but
I don't know why it's useful.

27
00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:57.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so what I did here
is I just did npm install express,

28
00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:59.490
that's all I did.

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.780
Okay, let's go back to our code here.

30
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.474
You'll notice that in our exercise folder,
we now have the node_modules, right?

31
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:18.469
So, here we gonna say var express
= require, express, okay?

32
00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:25.349
And then, var app = express,
pretty straightforward so far.

33
00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.651
We're gonna say app.get, and

34
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:34.113
we're gonna say /cheer.txt,

35
00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:37.307
function, req, res.

36
00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:40.140
If you want to be verbose,
request and response,

37
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.437
we'll do that at this time just for fun.

38
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

39
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.633
And then you're just gonna say request,

40
00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.750
or sorry, response.end,

41
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.874
You have quite lovely eyes.

42
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

43
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.221
Pretty simple,
can imagine jeer will be quite similar.

44
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
response.end, I don't even know.

45
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.580
Everything that comes to
mind is offensive, so.

46
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're mother was a hamster.

47
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.597
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Your mother
was indeed a hamster.

48
00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.549
[LAUGH] Thank you.

49
00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:45.297
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right.

50
00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:52.903
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: After this, we're gonna
say our server, equals app., see,

51
00:03:52.903 --> 00:03:57.761
like I can't even remember the syntax
off the top of my head, so

52
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:02.824
let's just go ahead and
grab it from the basic, or from express.

53
00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that.

54
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.699
You are free to just go ahead and copy and

55
00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.411
paste that cuz literally
it's not gonna change.

56
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.977
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Very common practice,
by the way, is like,

57
00:04:19.977 --> 00:04:24.986
I know I've done this before, just go out,
see what you've done, and go grab it.

58
00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:26.245
Okay?

59
00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:27.375
Feeling pretty good about that?

60
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:35.721
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] Apparently

61
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:39.649
not [LAUGH].

62
00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is there any questions
about what's going on here?

63
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.453
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully
pretty straight forward.

64
00:04:54.453 --> 00:04:55.947
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you
walk through it again?

65
00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:59.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure,
bringing in express right here.

66
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.040
And then creating an instance of express,
okay?

67
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.840
And then we're doing an app.get,
which is essentially defining a new route.

68
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.655
So if you go to cheer.txt here,
or if you go to jeer.txt, right,

69
00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:16.515
they're gonna get different responses,
then we're giving a call back function.

70
00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:20.280
Call back function, or in this case,
an anonymous function, right?

71
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.579
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this function is essentially,

72
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:32.930
I want you to do this when
they reach this route.

73
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.640
So if they go to cheer.txt,
please run this function.

74
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.160
Here we're doing response,
right, response.end,

75
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.120
which means please send them back this
response if they reach this route.

76
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.080
And we just did that twice.

77
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.292
So we defined two routes.

78
00:05:53.338 --> 00:05:55.013
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And in here,
we just instantiate the server.

79
00:05:58.087 --> 00:05:59.687
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

80
00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:00.263
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That makes sense.

81
00:06:08.024 --> 00:06:11.363
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,
well let's see what it does.

82
00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:14.797
If you want to keep following along,
the whole answer is in the cheer and

83
00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:15.491
jeer folder.

84
00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:22.865
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That shirt
doesn't look awful on you.

85
00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:25.337
I'm a jerk.

86
00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:29.593
I'm pretty sure your scent
is unpleasant [LAUGH].

87
00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:30.620
I totally remember writing that.

88
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.525
But something worthwhile of
noting is like right here,

89
00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:38.550
I'm just saying app.listen, right?

90
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.400
You actually don't have to
have this function right here.

91
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.000
It's just kind of useful.

92
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.534
You can see in the command line,
your server actually did start.

93
00:06:46.534 --> 00:06:47.846
But these are essentially equivalent.

94
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.433
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

95
00:06:55.898 --> 00:07:02.256
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
we're gonna say, nodemon app.js.

96
00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:03.621
It's listening on port 8080.

97
00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:12.451
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
we're gonna go to cheer.txt.

98
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.731
You have quite lovely eyes.

99
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:15.181
Your browser is admiring you.

100
00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:22.942
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And jeer,
your mother was indeed a hamster [LAUGH].

101
00:07:24.568 --> 00:07:25.068
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

102
00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:28.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

103
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.057
Seems, hopefully
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good stuff, right?

104
00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:39.455
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's just remove that, don't save.

105
00:07:42.052 --> 00:07:43.632
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
this is the one we just wrote.

106
00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:53.053
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, this is like,

107
00:07:53.053 --> 00:07:55.889
writing a server site
JavaScript is not easy.
