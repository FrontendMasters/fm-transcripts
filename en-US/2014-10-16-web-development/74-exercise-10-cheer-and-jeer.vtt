00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.922
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna have
an exercise with cheer and jeer, right?

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.849
Make an app that has two routes,
which is essentially,

4
00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.543
we're gonna make an app that has two gits,
right?

5
00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:17.850
We're gonna have one that's
called cheer.txt and jeer.txt.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.086
Cheer should send something
back positive to say, and

7
00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:25.503
jeer sends something back quite negative.

8
00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:30.535
The solution is in cheer and jeer, and
remember you're gonna have to reinstall

9
00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:37.190
express in this new folder.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.550
So, let's just get on to it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The whole

11
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.005
solution is here in cheer and jeer, but
we're actually just gonna go ahead and

12
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.340
create a new folder, and call it exercise,
or whatever you want to call it.

13
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.080
Okay, here, we're gonna have a new file.

14
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.743
We're gonna save it, and
it's gonna be called app.js, okay?

15
00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:08.332
And then we'll have to go back here to our
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Get out of here,

16
00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:11.170
and we're gonna go into our
exercise folder, right?

17
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.386
And we're gonna do npm install express,
just like we did before.

18
00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question on why

19
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.045
you were saving the app server variables.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,

20
00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:34.280
you definitely have to
save the app variable,

21
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.370
because using the app variable is
how you create the server variable.

22
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.950
The server variable, force of habit,

23
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.410
I don't know if I necessarily
have a good reason for it.

24
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.730
It's just kind of common practice.

25
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.862
I'm sure it's useful, but

26
00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:53.811
I don't know why it's useful.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

27
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:59.490
so what I did here is I just did npm
install express, that's all I did.

28
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.780
Okay, let's go back to our code here.

29
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.474
You'll notice that in our exercise folder,
we now have the node_modules, right?

30
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:18.469
So, here we gonna say var express
= require, express, okay?

31
00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:25.349
And then, var app = express,
pretty straightforward so far.

32
00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.651
We're gonna say app.get, and

33
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:34.113
we're gonna say /cheer.txt,

34
00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:37.307
function, req, res.

35
00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:41.895
If you want to be verbose, request and
response, we'll do that at this time just

36
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:46.630
for fun.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

37
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.633
And then you're just gonna say request,

38
00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.750
or sorry, response.end,

39
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.370
You have quite lovely eyes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

40
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.221
Pretty simple,
can imagine jeer will be quite similar.

41
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.091
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, response.end,

42
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.020
I don't even know.

43
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.580
Everything that comes to
mind is offensive, so.

44
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're mother was a hamster.

45
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.803
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Your mother was

46
00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:29.597
indeed a hamster.

47
00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.549
[LAUGH] Thank you.

48
00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:45.297
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right.

49
00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:48.963
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: After this,

50
00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:52.903
we're gonna say our server,
equals app., see,

51
00:03:52.903 --> 00:03:57.761
like I can't even remember the syntax
off the top of my head, so

52
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:02.824
let's just go ahead and
grab it from the basic, or from express.

53
00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that.

54
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.080
You are free to just go ahead and copy and
paste that cuz literally it's not gonna

55
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.555
change.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Very

56
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:21.830
common practice, by the way, is like,
I know I've done this before,

57
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.986
just go out, see what you've done,
and go grab it.

58
00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:26.245
Okay?

59
00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:31.794
Feeling pretty good about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH]

60
00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:39.649
Apparently not [LAUGH].

61
00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:47.013
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is there any questions

62
00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:52.107
about what's going on here?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully

63
00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:55.428
pretty straight forward.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you walk through

64
00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.650
it again?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure,

65
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.940
bringing in express right here.

66
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.040
And then creating an instance of express,
okay?

67
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.840
And then we're doing an app.get,
which is essentially defining a new route.

68
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.655
So if you go to cheer.txt here,
or if you go to jeer.txt, right,

69
00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:16.515
they're gonna get different responses,
then we're giving a call back function.

70
00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:19.837
Call back function, or in this case,
an anonymous function,

71
00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:24.439
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

72
00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.579
this function is essentially,

73
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:32.930
I want you to do this when
they reach this route.

74
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.640
So if they go to cheer.txt,
please run this function.

75
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.160
Here we're doing response,
right, response.end,

76
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.120
which means please send them back this
response if they reach this route.

77
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.080
And we just did that twice.

78
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.466
So we defined two routes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

79
00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:59.687
in here, we just instantiate the server.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

80
00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:00.263
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That makes sense.

81
00:06:08.024 --> 00:06:08.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

82
00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.363
well let's see what it does.

83
00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:14.797
If you want to keep following along,
the whole answer is in the cheer and

84
00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:21.140
jeer folder.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That

85
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.865
shirt doesn't look awful on you.

86
00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:25.337
I'm a jerk.

87
00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:29.593
I'm pretty sure your scent
is unpleasant [LAUGH].

88
00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:30.620
I totally remember writing that.

89
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.525
But something worthwhile of
noting is like right here,

90
00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:38.550
I'm just saying app.listen, right?

91
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.400
You actually don't have to
have this function right here.

92
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.000
It's just kind of useful.

93
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.534
You can see in the command line,
your server actually did start.

94
00:06:46.534 --> 00:06:51.433
But these are essentially equivalent.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

95
00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:59.428
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, we're gonna say,

96
00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:02.256
nodemon app.js.

97
00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:09.855
It's listening on port 8080.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

98
00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:12.451
and we're gonna go to cheer.txt.

99
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.731
You have quite lovely eyes.

100
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:19.869
Your browser is admiring you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And jeer,

101
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:25.048
your mother was indeed a hamster [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

102
00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:28.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

103
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.471
Seems, hopefully
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good stuff,

104
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:38.653
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's just remove that,

105
00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:43.244
don't save.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, this is the one we just

106
00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:52.183
wrote.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,

107
00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:55.889
this is like, writing a server
site JavaScript is not easy.
