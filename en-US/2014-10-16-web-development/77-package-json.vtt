[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.811
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so
now we're gonna talk about package.json.

3
00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:13.143
Hopefully, you are all super annoyed by
typing npm install express at this point,

4
00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:15.213
cuz it is, in fact, annoying.

5
00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:20.974
So, let's go ahead and
fix that a little bit.

6
00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:25.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,
what do I actually.

7
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
go back to your params directory,

8
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.646
which is what we're in right now,
right, ls.

9
00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:38.262
And I want you to go ahead and type this,
it's gonna be rm, which stands for

10
00:00:38.262 --> 00:00:42.953
remove, and then you're gonna put -rf,
so be careful with this command,

11
00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:46.500
cuz it's going to recursively
remove a bunch of stuff.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.990
Or, basically,
remove everything that you tell it to.

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.870
If you say, remove all of my files,
guess what it's gonna do?

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.430
It's gonna try to remove
all of your files.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.200
So, caution!

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.826
Okay, and
then you're gonna type node_modules.

17
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.990
And essentially what this is
gonna do is remove everything,

18
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.345
it's gonna remove everything, including
the folder for node_modules, okay?

19
00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:11.700
So now if you look again,
all you have is app.js, okay?

20
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.600
So now, what I want you all
to type is npm init, init.

21
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.720
If you remember, Nina did git init.

22
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.230
So this is gonna be npm init.

23
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.800
It's gonna ask you a bunch of questions.

24
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
So right here, where it says in the
parentheses, params, it's gonna try and

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.390
take your best guess as like,
what do you want this answer to be.

26
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.970
I want it to be params.

27
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.740
So I'm just gonna hit Enter.

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740
I want it to be version zero.

29
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.920
I'm gonna give a description of,
This is so cool, or This is a cool app.

30
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.303
This is gonna be like a description
of your entire app, right?

31
00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:50.821
Entry point, app.js, that's correct.

32
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.950
Test command,
typically it's gonna be npm test.

33
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.239
Don't worry about that,
we're not actually gonna use it.

34
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.370
Git repository, we don't have one,
so just go ahead and enter.

35
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.670
Keywords, we don't have any.

36
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.990
Author, Me.

37
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.370
And license, whatever you wanna put there.

38
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.790
All that's fine, okay?

39
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.370
So now we have this MPM file
that's essentially saying,

40
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.310
this is what our project
looks like at a high level.

41
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.060
And you say, is this okay?

42
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.870
Yes.
Okay, so now we have a package.json.

43
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.098
If you wanna go look at it here,
it now exists,

44
00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:28.330
so you can see what's actually in here.

45
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.270
Notice that this is just json,
that should look familiar, right?

46
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.780
Cool, right?

47
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.790
Okay.

48
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.127
So now we're gonna say, or

49
00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:43.479
let's actually just do it, yeah,

50
00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.569
npm install --save, okay, express.

51
00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.957
Now it's gonna install express again.

52
00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:58.105
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But notice if we go
back over here, it tells it like,

53
00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.889
this file depends on express.

54
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.864
So now when I'm sharing
my project with Nina,

55
00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:09.054
Nina can just run npm install without
having to know exactly what everything is,

56
00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:13.120
and it'll actually install all
of your dependencies for you.

57
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.908
So, from here on out, I've actually
provided these package.json files for

58
00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:22.598
you, and so you can just type npm install,
super cool, super easy.

59
00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:30.919
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, we'll kind of
get it to that a little bit later.

60
00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:36.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you actually want to
see this in action, let's go ahead and

61
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.670
remove the node_modules again.

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.324
So if you notice,
I just have an app.js and a package.json.

63
00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:48.240
I'm gonna say npm install, and
I'm not gonna put express.

64
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.209
Just npm and install, I'm gonna hit enter,
and it knows that I want express.

65
00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:57.523
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now this doesn't seem
probably that mind blowing with just one

66
00:03:57.523 --> 00:03:59.758
dependency, but
when you have 30 dependencies,

67
00:03:59.758 --> 00:04:01.530
it's pretty mind blowing, right?

68
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.610
You don't have to type npm install for
each one of them.
