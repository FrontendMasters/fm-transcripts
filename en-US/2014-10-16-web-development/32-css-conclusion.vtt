00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.001
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.180
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like HTML,
there's a lot of fun stuff to CSS.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.110
It's a very expansive topic.

4
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.200
We only scratched the surface of all
the different properties you can use.

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.380
Seriously, single-digit

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.060
percentage of all the different properties
that are available to you in CSS.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.430
Like there's, yeah go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Opinion on

8
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.130
floats versus position.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.870
I mean it really depends
on what you're doing.

10
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.530
There's no hard like that,

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.230
we have all these tools because
they fit different things.

12
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.630
And it's kind of like the conundrum
of the hammer and the nail, right?

13
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.820
Like if you have a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

14
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.010
Like you just want to hammer
the shit out of everything, right?

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.940
In reality, you have a whole toolbox
because of your counter of screw, right.

16
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.280
Like you need to pull out your
screwdrivers and then use that.

17
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.780
Like if you're gonna use a hammer on your
screw, you're gonna have a bad time.

18
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.980
So, my opinion is use
the one that's correct.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.669
There are certainly wide uses for
both of those properties.

20
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.760
Just personal opinion like, if floats
apply, then I would say use floats, right?

21
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.820
If it makes sense to use a float,
I would use a float over position.

22
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.420
Position for

23
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.060
me is kind of the last resort, there's
no other way I can reposition something.

24
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.276
Good question though.

25
00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:23.260
Cool, anymore questions?

26
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.900
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just curious,

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.920
if you have advice on next steps,

28
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.920
are there like sites that kind of guide
you through, try to recreate this,

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.901
you know cause that's kind of fun [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Brian: For sure, I know a friend,

30
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:37.607
at Masters,

31
00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:42.540
[INAUDIBLE] has additional CSS courses.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The big one is

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.417
responsive web design.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, and

33
00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:48.470
that-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's actually a really,

34
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.280
really good course.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I guess I just meant more

35
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.250
like practice exercises, or.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like someone giving you a comp.

36
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.660
And then you coding up a comp,
when I say comp, like a PSD,

37
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.790
like a Photoshop document and

38
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.580
just coding it up to look like that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

39
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.180
&gt;&gt; Brian: I don't have a resource off

40
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
the top of my head, but
they exist, definitely.

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.051
And even more so,
if you want to make a bit of money,

42
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:13.881
there's lots of people that
will pay you to do that.

43
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:18.440
[LAUGH] But yeah,
that's actually a really good practice.

44
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.380
It's a really common pattern in
web development is here's a image,

45
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.890
right, like I designed in Photoshop.

46
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.239
Please code this up to look similar to it,
so.

47
00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Good, as a lot of free PSDs,

48
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.130
you know, Photoshop templates out
there that you can, pull down.

49
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.050
And then just, as a practice exercise,

50
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.260
see how close you can make it.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, for sure.

51
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.710
That would be a great way
to practice your CSS.

52
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.168
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And, at that point,

53
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:52.382
you have a little bit of portfolio,
you said you can use PST and

54
00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:55.299
then turned it into this and
you also have,

55
00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.487
you can ask better questions that you
were more experienced than you because

56
00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:05.353
you're actually struggling with
something real versus Yep,

57
00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:08.070
totally, good question, great.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

58
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.660
he was just asking about a real world
example, where you went with absolute

59
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.620
instead of using the floats.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,

60
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.850
let me think about that for a second.

61
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.100
So, why absolute positions can be really,

62
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.270
really useful is that, you need something
on top of something else, right?

63
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.040
So, I have this image, and
I wanna overlay text on the image, right?

64
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.640
Because image are void text, you can't
actually put text inside of an image.

65
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.550
You actually need to use
position relative or

66
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.710
position absolute to move that
text on top of the image.

67
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.770
There are other techniques you
can use to accomplish that.

68
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.550
But let's, for sake of argument, say that.

69
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.420
So, I was asked a question.

70
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.850
Could I elaborate a little
bit more of position absolute

71
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.080
versus floating?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And- He wanted like a real

72
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.172
world example where you
can use that absolute.

73
00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.630
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, so.

74
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.650
I just like while we were away for
a second,

75
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.324
I coded up a little example right here.

76
00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:09.940
So, let's just say I was making a cute

77
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.280
cat picture with inspirational sayings or
something like that, right?

78
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.120
So, I had this image tag.

79
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.540
There is no way to,
because image is a void tag,

80
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.399
you can't put anything inside of it,
right?

81
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.160
So, I need to take something
that's not inside of image and

82
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.040
I need to overlay it on top of the image.

83
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.800
This is where position absolute
is useful because you can move

84
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.460
things where they would not otherwise be.

85
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.440
In this particular case,
I need to put text over an image, so

86
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.390
what I am doing here is,
I'll just go ahead and delete these stuff.

87
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.670
That's kind of a half baked idea.

88
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.300
Okay, so I have this image and
then next to it exists,

89
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.910
this paragraph which is what I want
that be over the kitten picture.

90
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.920
So, what I've done here is
I've put position absolute,

91
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.970
which saying like, I need you to position
this absolute on the entire page, right?

92
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.340
I'm going to give you coordinates.

93
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.370
In terms of the entire browser.

94
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.090
So, I'm saying from
the top of the browser, so

95
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.280
everything is from position
right here in the top left.

96
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.030
From the top of the browser,
go down 180 pixels and

97
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.970
go, from the left, go 180 or
go 80 pixels, right?

98
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.960
So, sometimes people do find it as like
top, left, right, kind of annoying, right.

99
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.540
You're not going left 100 pixels.

100
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.590
It's from the left,
you're going 80 pixels.

101
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.950
So, you're moving something to the right.

102
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.900
So in this particular case, from the top,
I'm going down 180 pixels from the left.

103
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.010
So again, to understand we're using
this to overlay it on something else.

104
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.280
This is not the only case
when you would do this.

105
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.150
There are other cases when
you'd use position absolute.

106
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.310
But I would say this is a common use case
when you wanna kind of stack elements that

107
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.230
otherwise would not stack.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Does that make sense?

108
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.910
It's not super common.

109
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.832
I don't use position absolute daily,
right?

110
00:06:09.832 --> 00:06:11.952
Cool.

111
00:06:11.952 --> 00:06:14.013
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a way of

112
00:06:14.013 --> 00:06:19.640
positioning text inside of an image
that might be different sizes?

113
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.420
Is it resized on the screen?

114
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.420
So, say I just want this
text centered on this image,

115
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.770
regardless of what size the image.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, so

116
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.360
what you kinda get into at this point is,
you have to go and do background images.

117
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.430
So, you have to essentially
allow CSS to govern the image.

118
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.502
So, you're gonna say background-image.

119
00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:49.760
And you're gonna say URL, and inside
the URL you're gonna put this picture.

120
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.590
So, let's just get that,
cut it out, delete this, right?

121
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.470
And now I'm gonna have this
background image in here.

122
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.370
So, and I'll have to make this like, with

123
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.210
a hundred pixels, height, hundred pixels,
or rather four hundred sorry.

124
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.080
Okay, so now I have this div and
its background is an image.

125
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.550
And now I'm free to kind of
mess around with it as I like.

126
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.006
So, now I can say, p color: white,

127
00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:35.350
text-align: center, right.

128
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.790
And I'm just gonna cheat and
say like, margin-top or

129
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.854
actually you can even do another one
which is line-height 400 pixels.

130
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.010
And we'll do like text size, or

131
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:54.598
font size rather,
&gt;&gt; Brian: 30 pixels or

132
00:07:54.598 --> 00:07:57.460
something like that.

133
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.900
So, that's how you would,
kind of like, and

134
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.440
I would probably recommend going this
route than the other way I showed you.

135
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.560
This is easier to kind of wrangle, right?

136
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.340
The issue is that sometimes it's difficult
to know those URL's ahead of time.

137
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.300
Sometimes you have to wait for

138
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.450
your server to know what
the image is to sync it there.

139
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.260
That's a problem that I
constantly struggle with.

140
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.440
But yeah, this will work.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's the line-height do?

141
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.210
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this is one of those hacks

142
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.054
I was just telling you about.
&gt;&gt; [COUGH]

143
00:08:29.054 --> 00:08:30.056
&gt;&gt; Brian: First of all,

144
00:08:30.056 --> 00:08:34.690
this will only work if the text
is short enough to fit.

145
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.760
So, if I do this,
it's gonna look weird, I think.

146
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.160
Maybe not.

147
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.149
Maybe it's just not gonna wrap.

148
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:49.250
All right, cool,
whatever anyway, so line height.

149
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.510
Line height is you know whenever you were
in high school you wanted to double space

150
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.050
all of your stuff, this is the same
thing that governs those spaces between.

151
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.430
So, if I had like lines height two, it
says like whatever your normal line height

152
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.700
it's going to be double it, so it would
be like double spacing something, right?

153
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.750
Or in this particular case,

154
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.600
you can actually tell how many pixels
high you want the line spacing to be.

155
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.900
A hack for vertically centering
something is to set the line height

156
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.350
the same as the height of the div that
it's in, that it needs to be centered in.

157
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.650
In this particular case, I already know
that the heights gonna be 400 pixels, thus

158
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.020
I know I can set the line height to be 400
pixels and it will vertically center it.

159
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.500
That only works if you know what
the height is gonna be ahead of time,

160
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.064
which I would say most
of the time you don't.

161
00:09:40.064 --> 00:09:42.970
So, does that kind of answer your question

162
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.060
in a very verbose way?

163
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

164
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.651
More questions about this kind of stuff?

165
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:51.352
All right.

166
00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:52.590
So, going back here.

167
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.630
Yeah, don't worry if this felt
like drinking from the fire hose,

168
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.810
don't worry if you have not memorized
every property that we've talked about

169
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.640
it's all super available online.

170
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.990
Not only are you not
the first beginner but

171
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.390
there has been like two decades of
beginners that have started on it, so

172
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.200
the internet is just full of people
saying how the hell do I do this, right?

173
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.090
So, every question that you're gonna have,
guarantee it,

174
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.740
you are not the first person
that's had this question.

175
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.960
So, if you just say like how
do I vertically center a div?

176
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.250
Or something like that,
someone else has asked it.

177
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.710
And someone else has already
answered it on Stack Overflow.

178
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.680
Stack Overflow's gonna be
one of your best things.

179
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.400
I recommend going through CSS tricks.

180
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.440
Chris, the guy who writes CSS tricks,
puts a lot of research into what he does.

181
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.340
And like will give you a very
layman's kind of terms for it.

182
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.440
And then the MDN,
if you want the technical explanation,

183
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.950
like what does it suppose to do?

184
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.350
What does it do in this edge case?

185
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.590
Then the MDN is really good place to go.
