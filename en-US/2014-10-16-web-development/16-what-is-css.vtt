[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:08.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's talk about
cascading style sheets or CSS,

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.490
as I will hereto refer to them as.

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.348
Sometimes refer to as California style
sheets, but that's just for fun.

5
00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:19.060
Makes me laugh.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.147
All right, so CSS,
before we've been talking about HTML,

7
00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:25.000
it is the content, right?

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.500
Like it's actually like
the words on the page.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.640
Like if you noticed in the previous
section, there was no style,

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060
it was just black text on a white page.

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.730
Purely the content on there.

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.780
This is going to be taking the content and
making it looked like styled differently.

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.532
So, there's gonna be no text rendered
from CSS, instead you're gonna say,

14
00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:51.515
there's text on the page,
now make the text red.

15
00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.880
Something like that, right,
purely presentational.

16
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.350
So, in HTML,
you're describing your content.

17
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.700
In CSS,
you're giving this content rules and

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320
saying, if you are this kind of content,
you look like this.

19
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.000
So, that's why these CSS things are called
rules, they're blocks of rules.

20
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.020
Yeah, and this is all called
declarative programming.

21
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.720
If you want to use the technical term.

22
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.390
We're about to get into imperative
programming which is what JavaScript is,

23
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.430
but here you're just saying,
I declare this is what it is.

24
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.780
You're just saying here is
the current state of things.

25
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.044
Whereas imperative is much more like,
if this happens than this will be this.

26
00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:45.230
Yeah.

27
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.380
Cool, so let's talk about some CSS rules.

28
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.140
We kind of already saw this
a little bit earlier, but

29
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.350
let's just kind of go over this.

30
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.019
Let's go back to CodePen.

31
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:02.170
So, now we're gonna start
using this little CSS

32
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.146
block down here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

33
00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:12.780
here I made a rule and
this rule affects the body tag, right?

34
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.010
So, it's saying everything in the body now
will have to adhere to these rules, right?

35
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.000
So, now everything is red.

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.540
Or everything can be green,
or it can be blue, right?

37
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.810
So, CSS understands a bunch of colors,
like there's like SlateGray.

38
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.039
Yeah, random ones, right?

39
00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.170
It's got like, I don't know,
probably like 100 colors or so.

40
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.900
You can also give it hex values.

41
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.454
If you don't know what a hex value is,
don't worry to much about it.

42
00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:54.630
But if I say 999,
that'll be some shade of gray, right?

43
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.400
Or you can give it rgb values
which are red, green, blue and

44
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.119
you can do like 125, 0,
0 or something like that.

45
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.834
And that was red, I guess.

46
00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.371
[LAUGH] I didn't know that.

47
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:15.320
I guess it makes sense cuz
it's mostly a red value.

48
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.198
Anyway, there's like a dozen
different ways to give colors to CSS.

49
00:03:21.198 --> 00:03:26.510
And just I don't know how to
generate them for the most part,

50
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.660
I just let Photoshop do it for me and say,
ask me what the hex value is for this?

51
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.170
And it'll give it to you.

52
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.653
Anyway, for the sake of this class,
we're just gonna stick to blue, right?

53
00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:41.644
Because that's just easier to remember.

54
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.433
But I guess what I'm getting at is
there is a way to fine tune that color,

55
00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:54.639
if you really want a specific color.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So,

56
00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.269
that is what a CSS rule looks like.

57
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.160
The color part is the property, right?

58
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.650
It's the part of whatever you're
modifying that you're modifying, right?

59
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.962
So, in this case, we're modifying
the text color of the entire body,

60
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:19.380
and then the part of it, that's like
the red part, is the value of it.

61
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.690
So, the property is color,

62
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.442
the value is red.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would that

63
00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:30.127
affect every type of sub tag
that was inside the body

64
00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.803
that had a color property then?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Everything

65
00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:35.832
in the body will now be red.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

66
00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:40.270
we're about to get into why it's
called cascading style sheets, right?

67
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.066
And the reason for that is, that there is
kind of like, and we'll talk about later,

68
00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:49.370
it's called specificity.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]

69
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But for now,

70
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.570
it's enough that that makes every
piece of text in the body red.

71
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.290
Questions on that?

72
00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.990
Makes sense, right?

73
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.210
So, now let's have two different kinds,
or two different rules, rather.

74
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.546
Oops.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay,

75
00:05:20.546 --> 00:05:24.880
so now we have an h1 here,
that's being affected by this body tag,

76
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.737
right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]

77
00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:26.935
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So, everything in the body

78
00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:28.110
is now red.

79
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.530
But I now have this p1,
that tells the color to be green.

80
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.349
So, now this is red, which note, right?

81
00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.810
If I delete this,
what color is it gonna be?

82
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.785
It's now red, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So, why is that?

83
00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:53.584
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] body.

84
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yes, it is in the body.

85
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.300
So that top modifier,
the body modifier, does effect it, but

86
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.470
the p is lower on the style sheet,
therefore, it is green.

87
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.774
So, we'll get into specificity later.

88
00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:16.569
There's other ways to override it but
for right now, these two things,

89
00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.180
the one that comes last is gonna be
the one that affects it, all right?

90
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.320
I'm pretty sure, let me just double-check
this to make sure that I'm not leading you

91
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.775
astray.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay,

92
00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:35.690
and that's kind of what
I was worried about.

93
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.780
So, in this particular case, it

94
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.260
still does affect it because I don't
think the body tag has specificity to it.

95
00:06:47.628 --> 00:06:54.330
Anyway.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: For the most part,

96
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.820
the one that's gonna be lower on the page
is going to be the one that affects it.

97
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.410
If everything else is considered equal,
it'll take the one that's

98
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.862
last on the page.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's basically because

99
00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:08.009
you're applying it to the paragraph
instead of the body text.

100
00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.998
The body is the parent [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Right,

101
00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:12.550
so it's gonna take the closer one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm not sure how to explain

102
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.960
that but the most specific one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It's the most specific one.

103
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.341
And again, we're gonna throw the term
specificity around a lot which it's just

104
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:22.830
how the rule engine works.

105
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:30.200
But Mark nailed it,
that the p tag is closer, right?

106
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.880
It's the one that's closer.

107
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.440
This one is the parent, so it's further
away and so it's gonna take the green one.

108
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.029
Kind of an edge case like I
wouldn't worry to much about that.
