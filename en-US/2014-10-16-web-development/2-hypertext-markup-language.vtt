[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:07.662
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We're gonna go over three
languages that are gonna cover what

3
00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:11.042
we call client side development,
front end development,

4
00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:15.610
which is front end masters read
that's what it's referring to.

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.840
Front, when we say front end
development we're referring to,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.730
what is actually executed
on your computer?

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.690
Because, like what Nina was saying,
you request something from the server.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.629
The server sends something back.

9
00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.563
We're gonna talk about
the something sent back.

10
00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:34.260
Later we're gonna talk about what's
actually happening on the server.

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.060
That's the nodejs part of this course.

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.590
But the server's actually gonna
send you back like a code and

13
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.580
then your computer or your browser
rather is going to execute that code.

14
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.160
So of that code that is being
sent back to your computer,

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.570
we kinda have three different pieces.

16
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.507
We have the HTML which I'm sure
many of you are familiar with,

17
00:00:55.507 --> 00:01:00.130
we're also gonna later talk about
the CSS and the JavaScript.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.710
So the first part,
HTML is kind of answers the what.

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.910
It's the actual content
that's on the page.

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.370
So if you have a giant blog post,
or a blog,

21
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.117
the HTML's going to be like
the actual words in your blog posts.

22
00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:21.780
It's gonna have the author's name,
the date, it's kind of the what.

23
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.110
It doesn't care about what it looks like,

24
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.130
it just cares about what
is actually on the page.

25
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.542
The what it looks like is the CSS.

26
00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:34.487
And then, if you have things moving
around, or you click a button and

27
00:01:34.487 --> 00:01:38.579
pops something up,
that behavior that you're seeing,

28
00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.113
that's the JavaScript executing,
that's the actual code.

29
00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:47.934
So HTML in and of itself is not
actually code, it's called mark up, so

30
00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:53.743
it stands for hypertext markup language,
that's because HTML doesn't execute,

31
00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:58.580
rather it's just kind of
describing what's happening.

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.853
Kind of think of it like a Word document.

33
00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:04.750
You don't put like,
behavior into your Word document.

34
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.200
Your Word document is not executed,
it's rather just read.

35
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.782
Same diff here with the HTML,
it's just a different format for it.

36
00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:18.129
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So it's gonna actually
have like the words on your blog post.

37
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.760
Doesn't have any style,
that's all in the CSS.

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.950
So if any of you have
ever seen HTML before,

39
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.120
it looks like a bunch of nested tags.

40
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.270
It goes in and out a bunch like that.

41
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.765
So you'll see a lot of that.

42
00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.280
And it starts with the most general and
then it nests further and further.

43
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.990
So let's look a little bit like this is a
contrived example, this is not valid HTML,

44
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.270
this is just kind of to show you
kind of what it would look like.

45
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.110
Like you have a car tag and so
you see the car at the top and

46
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.550
then the ending tag that's flash
car that means it's the end.

47
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.540
So everything inside of
it is describing the car.

48
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.510
Then you have the engine inside the car.

49
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.160
So the engine is part of the car.

50
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.550
That's why it's nested inside of it.

51
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.880
And inside of the engine you have
a transmission and radiator.

52
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.000
So if we look at, for example,
the cd-player right there.

53
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.220
The cd-player is nested inside the stereo,
so the cd-player

54
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.020
is inherently part of the stereo and
the stereo is inherently part of the car.

55
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.520
So that's kind of how HTML works,

56
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.090
is you're saying that this
is nested inside of here so

57
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.680
I know the cd-player is part of the stereo
and the stereo is part of the car.

58
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.740
Kind of get where I'm going with that?

59
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.890
So if we have any sports fans
particularly Seahawks fans

60
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.240
let's look at another example.

61
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.660
So you have a team.

62
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.840
And on the team we have a like
a couple wide receivers down there.

63
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.497
And the wide receiver is
part of the wide receivers.

64
00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:57.330
And the wide receiver
is part of the offense.

65
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.600
So it's just kind of that nested
description further and further up.

66
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.010
So inherently, the wide receiver
is part of the offense and

67
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.590
the offense is part of the team.

68
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.390
Or you can ask,
is this wide receiver part of the team?

69
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.480
Yes, it's part of the team.

70
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.690
Kind of a weird example but
let's start talking about HTML now.

71
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.940
Looks a little weird.

72
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.939
As you'll see, they're just a bunch of
abbreviations that eventually you just

73
00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.025
kind of memorize cuz you'll use them so
much.

74
00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:30.714
So p stands for paragraph,
h1 is like a really big title or

75
00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:33.309
header or something like that.

76
00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.720
[COUGH] And then, you'll notice on every
HTML document there's a head and a body.

77
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.660
You'll never see what's actually in the
head, the head is all like the metadata.

78
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.485
For example, when you click like a tab,
if I can bring this up right here,

79
00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:51.829
this is what's showing up here in this
tab, that's what's comes from the title.

80
00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:54.150
So it's not actually
displayed on the page.

81
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.030
Nothing on the head will ever
be displayed on the page.

82
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.060
It's all that kind of metadata.

83
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.270
Like you can say,
I'm about to give you an English document,

84
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.570
and this English document
is encoded this way, and

85
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.850
it has like, these kinds of
style things to apply to it.

86
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.930
That's the kind of stuff
that goes on the head.

87
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.140
The body is actually what
you're going to display.

88
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.440
So in this case,
I have a header and a paragraph.

89
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.420
So I got down here a code pen link.

90
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.210
Hopefully, most of you have these
slides open so you can click on this.

91
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.320
If not, I'll give you a second to,

92
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.270
does anyone at least here in
the room not have the slides open?

93
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.682
Cuz otherwise,
you can just click on the link.

94
00:05:43.047 --> 00:05:44.114
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Just in case once,

95
00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:48.060
I will give you that link again real
quick if you wanna open the slides.

96
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.328
The slides are right here.

97
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.203
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Some people still typing,
so I'll give you a sec.

98
00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So we're on slide 36.

99
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:16.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
go ahead and just open that.
