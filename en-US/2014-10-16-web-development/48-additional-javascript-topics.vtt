00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Things that
we haven't covered here,

3
00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:10.590
there's another type of loop called
while loops or do while loops.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.210
If you're coming from another language,
they should look really familiar.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.756
I use maybe one a month,
or one every other month.

6
00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:24.970
So, the basic gist of it is that you
loop until something is true, right?

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.930
That's kind of the basic gist.

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.845
It's essentially an if statement that
keeps repeating itself until it's

9
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:36.326
true.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Until

10
00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:39.090
it's false rather anyway.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.698
We're not talking about inheritance like
if you're coming from a language like Java

12
00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:48.242
or from like C++, something that we call
like a classical inheritance language,

13
00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:51.058
that might be a pattern
you're very familiar with,

14
00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:53.180
it's used very seldom in JavaScript.

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.700
It usually it causes more
heartache than it's worth, so

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.070
I tend to stray away from it.

17
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.060
I write very little
inheritance in JavaScript.

18
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.690
But it does exist, it is different though.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.770
We didn't talk about switch statements.

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.390
Switch statements are essentially
if statements that are kind of

21
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.860
condensed down.

22
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.619
Like if you, it's rather than
having if this, else if, else if,

23
00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.220
else if, you can write a switch statement.

24
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.230
It's like if it's this, if it's this,
if it's this, if it's this, so.

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.470
We didn't talk, there's so

26
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.730
much interacting with the DOM,
which is the document object model.

27
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.360
We're about to get into that.

28
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.990
We did document dot write as
interacting with the DOM,

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560
like you're modifying what is the webpage.

30
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.740
But there is so much to it and
it's just like a,

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.803
I'm sure there can be a whole
front end master's class on it.

32
00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:53.771
We didn't get into newer ES6 sytax,
let was the question we asked yesterday.

33
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:56.420
It's coming forward,
it's not actually available right now.

34
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.970
So it's not useful for
a beginner type class.

35
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.260
Just tons more.

36
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.520
JavaScript has been around since the 90s.

37
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.740
So there's a lot to it.

38
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.170
This is just, again,
scratching the surface.

39
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.515
But we have given you the basic tool
set to be like a beginning JavaScript

40
00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:19.340
developer, you can go forward
with these and do awesome stuff.
