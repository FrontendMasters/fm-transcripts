[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.489
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay so I'll give you
the first little bit right here.

3
00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:11.986
You're going to have user dash btn,

4
00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:19.550
sorry period user btn dot click function.

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.800
So that will get your button listening for
that event.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.880
Rather, your JavaScript listening for
the button event.

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.720
Most of us getting at least that far?

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.459
Okay, cool.

9
00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:37.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question was .val and
.text will do basically

10
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.637
the same thing when it's
called on a tag with text.

11
00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.997
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, vals used for
inputs of some sort,

12
00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:50.326
whether that be a check box,
radio button, inputs.

13
00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:53.522
Valid refers to whatever
the user has typed in there, or

14
00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:56.680
the user can type in there for
that matter.

15
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.630
Texts for the other hand is used for

16
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.130
like, paragraphs, divs,
things that are containing texts.

17
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.530
That are not editable by the user.

18
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.725
But conceptually what they're doing,
which is modifying text of an element,

19
00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:13.227
is conceptually similar.

20
00:01:20.287 --> 00:01:24.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right so
I see most people got the click listener.

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.690
Are we getting the value out
of the input how's that going?

22
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.220
Okay so let's just go ahead and do that so
I'm just gonna put it in like word or

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.630
something like that or
even val that's fine

24
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.978
dollar sign, what did I call it?

25
00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:57.309
-user-input.val

26
00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did most of
us get at least this far?

27
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.520
So we've now grabbed what ever is in here,

28
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.970
so if I type this, what ever is in here,
we have now grabbed that out of the input.

29
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.128
Now, the next thing we have to do,

30
00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:29.827
is we have to set that as the text
of this paragraph down here.

31
00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:34.600
User text we're gonna do that
using the .text function and

32
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.468
we're just gonna get that text
function the input that we got

33
00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:42.626
from the user val our user input .val.

34
00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:51.107
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think they're asking
why you're saving it in a variable.

35
00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:53.346
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's certainly
possible to do this in one line.

36
00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:59.046
I'm doing it, one, for clarity, and
two, so I can do it in multiple steps.

37
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:20.387
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: An old adage that I learned
when I first started is it's better to be

38
00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:21.746
clear than clever.

39
00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:28.307
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Clever code
is never a good thing.

40
00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:29.166
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What is not?

41
00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:33.227
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Clever, like doing some
crazy operation in ten characters that

42
00:03:33.227 --> 00:03:37.450
just melts everyone's mind but
no one can understand it, right?

43
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.280
Like it's better to take ten lines and
really be verbose and

44
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.390
say that this is what's happening.

45
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.380
So that somebody can just read it and
say, this is what's happening.

46
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.194
Now in this particular case, you could do
it in one line, it'd be just fine, but.

47
00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.374
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just recommend
do whatever seems clear to you.

48
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:04.873
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
so now we're going to

49
00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:10.433
go ahead and say .user-text,

50
00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:16.934
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .text, okay?

51
00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:18.534
Then what goes in here?

52
00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:19.874
Something needs to go in here.

53
00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:26.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
val goes in there, right?

54
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.580
Because here we've pulled maybe if this
isn't as clear we'll change this to be

55
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.460
like user text right.

56
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.090
Here we'll put user text.

57
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.580
Just so you don't get that confused with
this val because they're separate vals.

58
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.447
Okay so user text and user text there.

59
00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:58.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's it,
four lines of JavaScript,

60
00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:04.846
really could be done on three but
all right, so go ahead.

61
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.407
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: One of the questions is
how would it work doing the one line?

62
00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:12.042
Could you maybe just show
maybe the difference.

63
00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:14.644
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's just go ahead and
comment these out so

64
00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:15.919
that you can see that.

65
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.158
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
here you would just do it dollar

66
00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:28.604
sign user dash text dot text and

67
00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:34.247
then here we will talk a little bit about

68
00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:39.890
nesting functions inside of each other

69
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.730
we are just gonna do user-input.val.

70
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.850
And this should work as well, yeah.

71
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.470
So the question you have to ask yourself,

72
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.960
does this look really weird and
I don't get it?

73
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.950
If you answer yes to that
question then don't do it.

74
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.660
Do this, right?

75
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.477
This is more verbose, but
this is I don't know,

76
00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:05.246
I won't say concise,
but certainly shorter.

77
00:06:10.727 --> 00:06:12.666
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's leave that one commented out.

78
00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:18.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
do we kinda grasp what's going on here?

79
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.506
We're grabbing the value out of the user
input, and then we're just saving it, and

80
00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:24.488
then we're just using it right there.
