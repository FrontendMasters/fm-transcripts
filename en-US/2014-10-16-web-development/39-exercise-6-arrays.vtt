[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.304
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Can you
guys read that? It says,

3
00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.675
My favorite fruit is undefined.

4
00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:11.260
And that's because we have
declared this variable.

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.610
But we don't have anything in it.

6
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.530
So just a super quick exercise.

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.320
Set the variable favoriteFruit to
your favorite item in the array.

8
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.478
Use that square bracket notation.

9
00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:26.853
And then.

10
00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:37.583
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It should update
automatically and print out my favorite

11
00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.130
fruit is and your favorite fruit

12
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.045
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So would need
type along with you guys real quick.

13
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.650
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: My favorite fruit is
an orange, so I'm gonna do fruits and 1.

14
00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:39.109
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So I actually don't
need this because I declared that above.

15
00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:51.242
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sorry, for

16
00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:54.680
those CodePen you're gonna have
to click on Run one more time.

17
00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:00.030
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So everyone have
their favorite fruit coming up?

18
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.010
Okay, so what's gonna happen if
we try to access fruit number 99?

19
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.774
We get undefined again, but
if we open up our JavaScript console.

20
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.570
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We'll just copy and
paste this here.

21
00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:44.946
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
we try minus one, yeah,

22
00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:50.049
there's nothing in that

23
00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.910
spot so nothing going on
