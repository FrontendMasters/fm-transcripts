[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:06.190
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so
let's talk about the command line.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.257
In the beginning there
was the command line, and

4
00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:18.163
really not much else,
if you wanted to do any sort of computing.

5
00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:21.950
This is what you got.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.290
Before Windows, GUI is even something
as simple as a hardware mouse.

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.790
Everyone use this and

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.150
funny enough it's a 30 year technology but
we're still using it today.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.880
It's a little bit different on
every platform, so Macintosh and

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.980
Linux are probably the most similar
although they are not exactly the same.

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.008
At some point the Macintosh OS was
based on Linux but they diverged.

12
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.784
So kind of similar but not that much.

13
00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:57.600
And though we have Windows,
which is a whole different beast.

14
00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:02.579
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
we're still using the command line today,

15
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.014
because you can just complete
repetitive tasks a lot faster.

16
00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:11.990
Instead of clicking there, moving that
over there and copying and pasting that,

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.042
you're just running one command that
can do all these things for you.

18
00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.090
And those commands can be automated.

19
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.550
So if you guys see the terms scripting
out there, that's what that means.

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.970
The other cool thing is that
parameters to scripts can be provided

21
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.270
which means you can run the same script
that does something kind of similar but

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.810
you're passing in different input.

23
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.410
So parameters are a way of
customizing how a command is run and

24
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.770
flags kind of do that same thing.

25
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.140
We'll see flags later on.

26
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.190
So here's what a command
prompt looks like on Mac OS.

27
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.098
And if you guys wanna see that you can
go ahead and open up your Terminal app.

28
00:01:56.093 --> 00:02:02.070
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: On Windows that would
be command.exc, cmd.exc from the start.

29
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.020
Start and run menu.

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.930
So here on my MAC is the name of my
computer which is nina's MacBook Pro 2.

31
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.530
And then nina, which is my username,

32
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.740
the little tilde before nina means
that I'm in my home directory.

33
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.100
And the dollar sign in
the end of the prompt.

34
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.165
So I can type whatever I
want after that dollar sign.

35
00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:33.179
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So our home directory
is on our machine where the most

36
00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.768
common place where we can write files.

37
00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:41.606
So on Mac and Linux if you have your
commend prompt open and you type cd,

38
00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:44.405
it'll take you to your home directory.

39
00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:52.501
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,
on Mac that is /Users/ your username.

40
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:58.325
While on Windows,
it's usually C:\Users\ your username.

41
00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:03.244
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Something really
important to note here is that the slashes

42
00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:05.130
face different directions.

43
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.410
Do you guys all see that?

44
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.300
So, big source of confusion for beginners.

45
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.350
On Unix-like systems
the slashes face forward.

46
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.138
So if you're ever on a server or
using someone else's Mac computer,

47
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.727
this is what their file
structure will look like.

48
00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:33.804
While on Windows the slashes are backwards
and that's Windows and only Windows.

49
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:41.474
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So, here's a way to
find out what directory you're currently

50
00:03:41.474 --> 00:03:44.129
in when you open up your terminal.

51
00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:51.740
So if you guys on Mac OS will open up
your terminal and type the command pwd.

52
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.160
You guys should see what
your home directory is.

53
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.124
For Windows users, that command is cd,
which stands for current directory.

54
00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:08.148
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Does
everyone have that working?

55
00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.286
You guys all, no?

56
00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:12.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

57
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.286
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Go ahead, go ahead.

58
00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:20.227
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just hit pwd and hit Enter.

59
00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:24.769
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Then that'll
print your current directory.

60
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.200
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Does anyone
else have questions about this?

61
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.700
No.

62
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.380
So, here's the command to
list our directory content.

63
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.550
On Mac OS, it's cd.

64
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.160
Or, I'm sorry.

65
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.380
Sorry, the title on this is wrong.

66
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.389
Let me just change that really quick.

67
00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:04.861
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Here we go.

68
00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.870
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sorry guys.

69
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.320
So this is how you would go about
to move to a different directory.

70
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.774
I know it's a little bit
confusing because on Mac,

71
00:05:19.774 --> 00:05:24.207
the command is cd which in this
case stands for change directory.

72
00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:29.723
So you would take cd and
then a space followed by

73
00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:35.540
the path to the directory
that you wanna move to.

74
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.610
And then you would type in ls and
that would list the directory contents.

75
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:46.010
Nope, sorry, I'm wrong again.

76
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.338
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That is just
the same on Windows also,

77
00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:50.558
do you have the DIR
command on your Windows?

78
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.235
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah.

79
00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:55.774
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Cuz you have two
commands under the same title.

80
00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:58.928
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sorry, what I wanted
to do is that is listing directory

81
00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:00.650
contents that we have there.

82
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.950
Sorry guys, I will say this right
now that I am not a Windows person.

83
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.970
And I have not used a Windows
machine in about five years,

84
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.030
so that is definitely not my forte.

85
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.569
So, to list directory contents on a Mac,
you would change directory to

86
00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.341
the folder that you wanna be in,
and then you would type ls.

87
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.289
And you'll get a list of items like this,
so

88
00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.043
you'll get your folders and your files.

89
00:06:33.043 --> 00:06:39.940
On Windows you would type dir and then the
folder that you wanna see the listing of.
