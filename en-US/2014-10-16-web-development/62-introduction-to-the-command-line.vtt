[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:06.190
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so
let's talk about the command line.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.257
In the beginning there
was the command line, and

4
00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:18.163
really not much else,
if you wanted to do any sort of computing.

5
00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:21.950
This is what you got.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.290
Before Windows, GUI is even something
as simple as a hardware mouse.

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.790
Everyone use this and

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.150
funny enough it's a 30 year technology but
we're still using it today.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.880
It's a little bit different on
every platform, so Macintosh and

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.980
Linux are probably the most similar
although they are not exactly the same.

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.008
At some point the Macintosh OS was
based on Linux but they diverged.

12
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.784
So kind of similar but not that much.

13
00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:56.056
And though we have Windows,

14
00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.909
which is a whole different beast.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

15
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.579
we're still using the command line today,

16
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.014
because you can just complete
repetitive tasks a lot faster.

17
00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:11.990
Instead of clicking there, moving that
over there and copying and pasting that,

18
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.042
you're just running one command that
can do all these things for you.

19
00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.090
And those commands can be automated.

20
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.550
So if you guys see the terms scripting
out there, that's what that means.

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.970
The other cool thing is that
parameters to scripts can be provided

22
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.270
which means you can run the same script
that does something kind of similar but

23
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.810
you're passing in different input.

24
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.410
So parameters are a way of
customizing how a command is run and

25
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.770
flags kind of do that same thing.

26
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.140
We'll see flags later on.

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.190
So here's what a command
prompt looks like on Mac OS.

28
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.670
And if you guys wanna see
that you can go ahead and

29
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.331
open up your Terminal app.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: On Windows that

30
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:02.070
would be command.exc,
cmd.exc from the start.

31
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.020
Start and run menu.

32
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.930
So here on my MAC is the name of my
computer which is nina's MacBook Pro 2.

33
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.530
And then nina, which is my username,

34
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.740
the little tilde before nina means
that I'm in my home directory.

35
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.100
And the dollar sign in
the end of the prompt.

36
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.741
So I can type whatever I
want after that dollar

37
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:30.358
sign.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So our home directory

38
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:36.768
is on our machine where the most
common place where we can write files.

39
00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:41.606
So on Mac and Linux if you have your
commend prompt open and you type cd,

40
00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:47.156
it'll take you to your home directory.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,

41
00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:52.501
on Mac that is /Users/ your username.

42
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.224
While on Windows,

43
00:02:54.224 --> 00:03:00.165
it's usually C:\Users\ your username.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Something

44
00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:05.130
really important to note here is that
the slashes face different directions.

45
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.410
Do you guys all see that?

46
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.300
So, big source of confusion for beginners.

47
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.350
On Unix-like systems
the slashes face forward.

48
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.138
So if you're ever on a server or
using someone else's Mac computer,

49
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.727
this is what their file
structure will look like.

50
00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:32.843
While on Windows the slashes
are backwards and that's Windows and

51
00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:38.190
only Windows.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So, here's a way to

52
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.129
find out what directory you're currently
in when you open up your terminal.

53
00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:51.740
So if you guys on Mac OS will open up
your terminal and type the command pwd.

54
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.160
You guys should see what
your home directory is.

55
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.851
For Windows users,
that command is cd, which stands for

56
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:06.750
current directory.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Does

57
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.148
everyone have that working?

58
00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:12.910
You guys all, no?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

59
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.597
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Go ahead,

60
00:04:15.597 --> 00:04:19.382
go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just hit pwd and

61
00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:24.039
hit Enter.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Then that'll print your

62
00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.770
current directory.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Does anyone else have

63
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.200
questions about this?

64
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.700
No.

65
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.380
So, here's the command to
list our directory content.

66
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.550
On Mac OS, it's cd.

67
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.160
Or, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.380
Sorry, the title on this is wrong.

69
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.389
Let me just change that really quick.

70
00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:04.861
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Here we go.

71
00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.870
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sorry guys.

72
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.320
So this is how you would go about
to move to a different directory.

73
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.774
I know it's a little bit
confusing because on Mac,

74
00:05:19.774 --> 00:05:24.207
the command is cd which in this
case stands for change directory.

75
00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:29.723
So you would take cd and
then a space followed by

76
00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:35.540
the path to the directory
that you wanna move to.

77
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.610
And then you would type in ls and
that would list the directory contents.

78
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:46.667
Nope, sorry, I'm wrong again.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That

79
00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:50.558
is just the same on Windows also, do you
have the DIR command on your Windows?

80
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.235
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah.

81
00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:54.565
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Cuz you have two commands

82
00:05:54.565 --> 00:05:56.254
under the same title.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sorry,

83
00:05:56.254 --> 00:06:00.650
what I wanted to do is that is listing
directory contents that we have there.

84
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.950
Sorry guys, I will say this right
now that I am not a Windows person.

85
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.970
And I have not used a Windows
machine in about five years,

86
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.030
so that is definitely not my forte.

87
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.569
So, to list directory contents on a Mac,
you would change directory to

88
00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.341
the folder that you wanna be in,
and then you would type ls.

89
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.289
And you'll get a list of items like this,
so

90
00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.043
you'll get your folders and your files.

91
00:06:33.043 --> 00:06:39.940
On Windows you would type dir and then the
folder that you wanna see the listing of.
