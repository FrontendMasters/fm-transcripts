[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.671
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can put the HTML
here if you want to, not required,

3
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:12.321
I probably will stop doing it after this.

4
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.921
But we'll just do it so
you know what it looks like.

5
00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:23.462
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Brian,

6
00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:28.228
you can change your name by
just clicking your username and

7
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.388
going into settings.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's probably a good

8
00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:33.122
idea.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Go to Editor Settings.

9
00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.952
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then just push

10
00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:45.140
the Classic or Solarized.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's actually do Classic,

11
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.920
that looks good to me.

12
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.319
Can I use Source Pro?

13
00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:56.263
Yeah, cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

14
00:00:56.263 --> 00:01:00.120
then I can just, grandmas use CodePen too.

15
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.130
Let's go with for projection.

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.894
How funny.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any of you

17
00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:08.370
ever read CSS-Tricks?

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.870
It's, first of all, awesome blog
to read for CSS related stuff.

19
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.890
CodePen is done by the guy
that does CSS-Tricks,

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.160
or he is a part of that company.

21
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.281
Super great guy, but he's really
cheeky sometimes, which is also great.

22
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.237
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So now do Ctrl+0 to reset

23
00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:39.527
your browser.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

24
00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:47.631
That's nice, cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that look good,

25
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:48.470
legible?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

26
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.551
much better.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

27
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:01.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just totally messed that

28
00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:08.702
up, all right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right and

29
00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:10.671
then you put head.

30
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:15.385
All right, so we have to give it a title,

31
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:20.516
right, so
this title is going to be an h1 and

32
00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:28.148
it's gonna be MY SUPER AWESOME
LIST OF CAR RELATED GREAT THINGS,

33
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:35.420
cuz I like to yell when I type.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so something

34
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.811
else I noticed with CSS is like you notice
how I'm like indenting everything and

35
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:45.733
not indenting some other things,
like that kind of implies hierarchy.

36
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.080
You can put this back in like that.

37
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.000
And it's not going to affect
the way the CSS, or the HTML works.

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.630
We do it, again, for
our future selves when we're reading it so

39
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.960
we can see the hierarchy that makes it
much more readable for yourself, right?

40
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.626
You look at this,
you see no hierarchy, right?

41
00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:07.220
You assume that the h1
is in a higher hierarchy

42
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.840
than the body is when in reality,
it's not.

43
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.350
It's actually nested inside the body.

44
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.550
So the rule of thumb here is that if
something is nested in something else,

45
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.140
it gets further indented, right?

46
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.960
So the h1 is nested inside the body,
right?

47
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.111
So the body's here,
then the h1 goes here, right?

48
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:31.972
Or if it was nested, there was the body,
a div, and then the h1.

49
00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:33.620
That's why you kind of see that hierarchy.

50
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.720
Or in other words,
white space like tabs, spaces,

51
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.890
new lines, are not important in HTML.

52
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.580
Right, I can also do this
if I wanted to do that.

53
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.390
Which you'll see a lot, right?

54
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.860
So I have this h1 and
then I have my text inside the h1.

55
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.880
See, this white space right here
is not important, the new line.

56
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.660
It's just do whatever is
the most readable for you.

57
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.061
In my opinion, putting the text on
a new line is the most readable.

58
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:10.502
All right, so, we have an h1 here.

59
00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:16.142
This lets us know this is
the title of my page, right?

60
00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:21.900
I believe the next one was an unordered
list of what you look for in a car, okay?

61
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.156
So if we're gonna do an unordered list,
we're gonna use a ul, right?

62
00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:33.297
So ul, and then something else I prefer to
do is every time I create my opening tag,

63
00:04:33.297 --> 00:04:37.656
I just write my closing tag
right at the same time.

64
00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:45.136
It just makes it really easy to
not forget to do that, okay?

65
00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:50.396
And then now since I'm doing a ul,
I'm gonna nest some lis inside of it.

66
00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:55.236
So, I'm going to indent
a little bit further.

67
00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:59.291
Okay, so my first list element is,

68
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:04.576
I don't know, price cuz I'm cheap, right?

69
00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.976
Do you like my beautiful styling?

70
00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:13.216
It has this huge bold header and
little tiny price, okay?

71
00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:15.117
So, let's put another thing in there.

72
00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:22.257
It needs to have a huge stereo,
so we're gonna say stereo.

73
00:05:22.257 --> 00:05:27.251
And maybe some sweet rims.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] You guys

74
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:31.450
probably think I'm an idiot,
which is totally fine.

75
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.410
You can think I'm an idiot.

76
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.160
Okay, so those are [LAUGH], that's
what I look for in a car apparently.

77
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.251
Price, stereo, and sweet rims.

78
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:45.877
Probably gonna end up driving
like a 92 Corolla with these

79
00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:48.931
blinged out Walmart rims or
something like that.

80
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:55.591
[LAUGH] And a huge boombox,
right, not even a stereo in it.

81
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:59.110
Okay, so that's what I look for in a ul.

82
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.856
Is, you have the ul and

83
00:06:01.856 --> 00:06:07.240
then you have the list elements inside
of it, which is what that li is, right?

84
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.040
It's a list element.

85
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.021
Okay, so now let's do an order list
of my top three favorite cars.

86
00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:18.730
Okay, so ol, and again,

87
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.161
we'll just close it right
now cuz that's easiest.

88
00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:27.361
So this one,
it's gonna have some order implied to it.

89
00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:32.155
So I'm just gonna do li again,
and say, I don't know,

90
00:06:32.155 --> 00:06:37.261
92 Corolla,
since apparently that's my favorite car.

91
00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:42.381
I don't know if I'm spelling that right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

92
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.443
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe after that's a 91

93
00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:56.240
Corolla, that's my second favorite car.

94
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.100
And then my third favorite car is
probably let's say, a Tesla Model S.

95
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.785
It's my third favorite car
after the two Corollas.

96
00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:09.601
[LAUGH] Okay?

97
00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:12.321
So, notice that these look really similar,
right?

98
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:17.075
You have the ul and the ol and
they just have li's inside of it but

99
00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:23.120
one of them just has bullets and
one of them has like numbers next to it.

100
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.390
It's kind of the semantic
difference there is that

101
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.550
you can put sweet rims on top of price,
it wouldn't make any difference, right?

102
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.222
It's all just kind of a conglomerate
of information whereas the ol's steps,

103
00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:38.639
right, this is number one,
number two, number three.

104
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.931
But they both just take lis, right?

105
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:44.409
Because let's say, my gosh,

106
00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:49.504
I forgot really my second
favorite one is the 88

107
00:07:49.504 --> 00:07:56.038
Corolla,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,

108
00:07:56.038 --> 00:08:00.111
and then it just does all that
renumbering magically for you.

109
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:05.710
So you don't have, many of these things
is also because programmers are lazy.

110
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.520
I don't want to have to go renumber stuff,
that's dumb.

111
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.428
Right, so
let's make the computer reorder stuff for

112
00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:15.484
us.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So laziness and

113
00:08:15.484 --> 00:08:17.151
then like flexibility, right?

114
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:21.894
Cuz say dynamically, later,
I wanna be able to add things to

115
00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:26.390
this list using JavaScript or
something like that.

116
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.640
Append this as the third element,
so it goes in there and

117
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.610
then I don't have to use JavaScript to
programmatically renumber everything.

118
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.510
The browser just automatically does it for
you.

119
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.880
So, it's like getting free programming for
yourself.

120
00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:47.100
All right, so, specifically on this,
do we have any questions so far?

121
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.692
I think I have to do titles for each one
as well so I'll do that real quick, okay?

122
00:08:52.692 --> 00:08:57.175
So we're gonna put in some
h2s here saying like,

123
00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:07.913
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sweet stuff for my car.

124
00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:14.093
And then this is like,
sweet cars for my stuff.

125
00:09:14.093 --> 00:09:19.210
[LAUGH] Apparently, I make myself laugh.

126
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.840
That's great.

127
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.110
Yeah, so
you just giving titles right there.

128
00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:30.780
So notice this is kind
of all mixed together.

129
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.610
The HTML's kind of not divided very well.

130
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.856
So in order to make this easier for
yourself to read later,

131
00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:44.461
something you might do is you
might wrap these in a div, right?

132
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.332
So I'll put like a div around each one of

133
00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:50.017
these.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

134
00:09:50.017 --> 00:09:51.682
then I need to indent these as well, so

135
00:09:51.682 --> 00:09:55.450
I'll show you a little trick that works
in Sublime as well as in CodePen.

136
00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:01.338
So just select all this text
that's inside the div, right?

137
00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:05.818
So, you might not be able to see it,
but I've selected that h2 and

138
00:10:05.818 --> 00:10:10.458
the ul and then I'm gonna hit Cmd and
actually, can you just hit Tab?

139
00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:11.543
You can just actually hit Tab,

140
00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:15.250
let's just stick with that, that's easier
cuz I think it'll work in both browsers.

141
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.690
You'll hit Tab and it'll actually indent
it a little bit further for you, right?

142
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.410
Because now it's nested inside that div.

143
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.830
It's needs to be nested a little
bit further so it's easier to read.

144
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.991
We follow?
Does that make sense?

145
00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:32.939
That work for you?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Shift+Tab

146
00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:35.291
moves it back up.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Shift+Tab.

147
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:42.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope, okay, yeah.

148
00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.201
And then we'll do the same thing for

149
00:10:44.201 --> 00:10:50.031
this one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops.

150
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:02.151
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

151
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:02.832
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm sorry.

152
00:11:02.832 --> 00:11:04.951
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

153
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:05.551
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I didn't-

154
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:07.051
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE] command,

155
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.771
[INAUDIBLE] command.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry.

156
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:09.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

157
00:11:09.672 --> 00:11:10.823
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't have to hit Cmd,

158
00:11:10.823 --> 00:11:12.412
you can just hit Tab.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

159
00:11:12.412 --> 00:11:12.989
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

160
00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:15.876
there's a couple ways to do it, but

161
00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:20.732
that one works.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, again,

162
00:11:20.732 --> 00:11:25.376
reason why I did this, it's because
you notice the styling over here

163
00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:28.432
actually didn't change anything, right?

164
00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:32.052
But now you look and say this one,
this div right here is all related,

165
00:11:32.052 --> 00:11:35.800
everything in here is related to one
thing and then everything in here,

166
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.540
this other div up here,
it's all related to a different thing.

167
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.240
So you're putting separation in your HTML.

168
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.621
And it's going to save you so much time if
you just kind of start thinking like that,

169
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:53.011
like everything in here should
have its own container.

170
00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:55.791
It's also gonna make your CSS way easier.

171
00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:57.900
You're not gonna have these
crazy CSS things, so.
