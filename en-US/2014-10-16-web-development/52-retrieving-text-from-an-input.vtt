[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right so let's go
ahead and go get some text from an input.

3
00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:19.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here we have
an input and we have a button, right?

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.820
Remember the void tabs right?

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.020
That's an input right here.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.820
And then we have this button right here,
the alert button, it says click me.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.870
And then we're loading the script.

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.754
That's all the HTML does.

9
00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:38.173
Let's go ahead and
just make this a lot bigger, okay.

10
00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:39.314
Pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:46.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,
we're gonna set up an event listener.

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.280
That when they click it it's gonna
grab the name out of the name input.

13
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.340
Which is this one right?

14
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.110
And then we're gonna grab the value out of
it which is what the .val function does.

15
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.090
And then after that we're going to alert
that name so, if I say Brian right here.

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.220
And then click me it's gonna
give me back my name right or

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.074
you can even have it greet you and say,

18
00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:19.390
hey, okay.

19
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.720
Again, we can type Brian and
it's going to say hey Brian.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.440
So again this is kind of
a contrived example but

21
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.340
I'm sure you can see why
this would be useful right?

22
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.250
Like if you're trying to
log someone in right?

23
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.220
You need to get the user name and
password out of the form and

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.440
send it to your server so you can verify
it and then it can be sent back down and

25
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.640
say you have good credentials or
you have bad credentials.

26
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.530
Questions about that?

27
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.730
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Can you show the HTML for
this?

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

29
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380
&gt;&gt; Student 1: I think there's a question.

30
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.990
The button there, it has the type in it.

31
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.790
They're saying that sometimes
they see it with that.

32
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.060
Sometimes they see it without that.

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
I think I've done both.

34
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.750
So that's a fair accusation.

35
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.140
Buttons by default are what
are called submit buttons.

36
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.360
So if they're in a form,
they're gonna try and submit the form,

37
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.500
which without going into a whole lot of
detail about what that actually does,

38
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.710
it's actually gonna try and
reload your page or it's gonna try and

39
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.070
go to a different page if you don't
tell it what type of button it is.

40
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.335
In this particular case I
believe I could just remove it.

41
00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:35.450
No one would care because it's
not actually in a form right.

42
00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:42.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
it's a good habit to get into.

43
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.290
As you can see I'm not always in said
habits so but if it was inside of a form,

44
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.050
it would make a bigger difference.

45
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.440
&gt;&gt; Student 2: By inside a form,
you mean inside a form tag?

46
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Literally a form tag,
all right?

47
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.990
Form, wow, I did not want to do that.

48
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.420
So, inside a form tag like this and

49
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.320
then there is a view closing
form tag down here, right?

50
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.999
And then this would make a difference.

51
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.472
But because there's no form tab,
because we're not worrying about it,

52
00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:12.493
it's cool the way it is.

53
00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:16.418
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question, though.

54
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:17.954
Other questions about this?

55
00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:24.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully
it's pretty straightforward.

56
00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:30.231
Let's just take a level of
one step further here, oops.

57
00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:31.740
So, after we alert the name.

58
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.074
We dont wanna keep alerting
the same name over and over again.

59
00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:37.020
So, what we wanna do is we
wanna clear out the input.

60
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.260
So, I'll show you that effect first and
then I'll explain to what it is.

61
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.070
So, that's my name.

62
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.980
Click me, it's gonna say hey man and then
it's gonna clear out the input, right.

63
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.850
That's what this val if you
give it a string is gonna do.

64
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.730
In this particular case I have
given it an empty string so

65
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.315
it's going to set the input
to be an empty string.

66
00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:02.019
Like if I said hey, and I put Brian here.

67
00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.440
Type a bunch of stuff and you click me.

68
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.790
What's it going to say after I click OK?

69
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.870
It's going to say Brian, right?

70
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.891
So this dot val with
the string provided to it,

71
00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:15.613
it's going to set the value of the input.

72
00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:21.038
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But again,
we're just going to set it to be blank

73
00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:24.990
because that's kind of
an intuitive thing to do, right?

74
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.010
We want that to say hey Nina.

75
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.913
It says that right there.

76
00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:33.859
Then you click OK and then it's gone.

77
00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:35.889
&gt;&gt; Student 3: So that's a blocking,

78
00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.854
the alert box is kind of
a blocking type input.

79
00:04:39.854 --> 00:04:46.531
What happens if you have multiple
functions, multiple listeners?

80
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:49.838
Is JavaScript multi-threaded?

81
00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:51.395
Is it going to handle this simultaneously?

82
00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.245
Or is it just going to
block on that first one,

83
00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:56.878
whichever one it randomly caught first.

84
00:04:56.878 --> 00:04:57.378
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's going
to block first of all.

85
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.720
So the sum of that story is don't
actually use alerts in production.

86
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.260
Because the alert will
actually pause the execution

87
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.200
of JavaScript until
the user interacts with it.

88
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.020
It's really bad user experience.

89
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.340
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Not quite sure
what they're referencing, but

90
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.730
what about if it was a placeholder?

91
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah sure,
I mean we can show that too.

92
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.125
You can say place folder right here,

93
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.880
your name, okay?

94
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.000
This is HTML right?

95
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.150
This is, we're going back to HTML,

96
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.510
this has nothing to do with jQuery or
JavaScript.

97
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.720
But I'm sure you've seen this before,

98
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.560
like the grayed out wording in
the background right there.

99
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.420
It's kind of hard to see right now,
see how it says your name right there?

100
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.310
And then as soon as I start
typing it disappears.

101
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.837
That's an HTML5 thing,
super useful, but yeah.

102
00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:54.255
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, more questions?

103
00:05:56.698 --> 00:05:59.955
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This makes sense,
using the values, clearing out the values,

104
00:05:59.955 --> 00:06:01.950
that kind of stuff?

105
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.450
Cool.
