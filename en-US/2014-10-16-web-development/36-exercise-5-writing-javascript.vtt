00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:06.760
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's
write our first JavaScript.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.636
We're going to use one of those
annoying popups, and we're gonna create

4
00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:16.291
a variable which is our names, and
then we're gonna popup a message.

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:25.718
So let's open this codepen here.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,

6
00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:30.643
here's my stuff.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Set a variable to

7
00:00:30.643 --> 00:00:32.540
myName and popped up an alert.

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.151
You can go ahead and comment that out
if you want to keep it at the top for

9
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:41.973
a reference.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

10
00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:46.263
I'll give you guys a few
minutes to do this exercise.

11
00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:51.351
So add a second string,
have it be a variable name.

12
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:56.359
Add a third variable called age,
set it to your age and

13
00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.943
then create an alert that will
popup your name and your age.

14
00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:14.127
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They're asking, how to you

15
00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:19.164
bring the console up in CodePen?
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Same, you would go to

16
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:28.400
View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: But

17
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.450
if you output your results using an alert
you won't need to look in the console.

18
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: As part of the browser,

19
00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.410
not part of the web page.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: What's that?

20
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.592
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The console is part of

21
00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:42.109
the browser-
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yes.

22
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.249
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Not part of the webpage.

23
00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.380
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Exactly.

24
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:03.510
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Thank you CodePen,

25
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.138
for being helpful.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

26
00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:12.430
you can use either a single or
double quote but to stay consistent,

27
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.437
I'm going to use double quotes.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Doesn't

28
00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:21.660
matter which one you pick as long
as you pick one and stick with it.

29
00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:28.419
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Are numbers just numbers,

30
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.760
are they integers or floats or?
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Depends.

31
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, so it does have that

32
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.788
capability of distinguishing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No,

33
00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.517
it doesn't.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It

34
00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:37.570
doesen't?
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: No.

35
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Everything is

36
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.010
a number in JavaScript which is a float.

37
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.393
So doing math in JavaScript sucks.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yes,

38
00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:47.900
don't use JavaScript for math.

39
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.599
But you can declare it for a kind of-
There are libraries that can help,

40
00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.259
we need to do like more precisely.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

41
00:02:54.259 --> 00:03:01.412
everything's a float.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So.

42
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:08.026
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,

43
00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:10.650
let's do this exercise.

44
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.896
So, I'm gonna use Brian's name.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm gonna say,

45
00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:22.767
he's about 105.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]

46
00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:23.695
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Don't forget your

47
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:29.124
semi-colons like I did.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so,

48
00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:35.944
we're going to use an alert and
we're gonna say name and

49
00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:40.890
use a plus sign to put together strings.

50
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.490
And were gonna type is in here.

51
00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:52.850
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Brian's 105 years old.
