2
00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:06.760
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's
write our first JavaScript.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.636
We're going to use one of those
annoying popups, and we're gonna create

4
00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:16.291
a variable which is our names, and
then we're gonna popup a message.

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.105
So let's open this codepen here.

6
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.929
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So, here's my stuff.

7
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.540
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Set a variable
to myName and popped up an alert.

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.151
You can go ahead and comment that out
if you want to keep it at the top for

9
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.909
a reference.

10
00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:46.263
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So I'll give you
guys a few minutes to do this exercise.

11
00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:51.351
So add a second string,
have it be a variable name.

12
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:56.359
Add a third variable called age,
set it to your age and

13
00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.943
then create an alert that will
popup your name and your age.

14
00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:16.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They're asking, how to
you bring the console up in CodePen?

15
00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:24.640
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Same, you would go to
View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console.

16
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.950
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: But if you output
your results using an alert you

17
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.450
won't need to look in the console.

18
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: As part of the browser,
not part of the web page.

19
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.410
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: What's that?

20
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.384
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The console
is part of the browser-

21
00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:42.109
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yes.

22
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.249
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Not part of the webpage.

23
00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.380
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Exactly.

24
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:04.583
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Thank you CodePen,
for being helpful.

25
00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:11.050
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So you can use
either a single or double quote but

26
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.588
to stay consistent,
I'm going to use double quotes.

27
00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.891
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Doesn't matter which
one you pick as long as you pick one and

28
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:21.660
stick with it.

29
00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:30.434
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Are numbers just numbers,
are they integers or floats or?

30
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.760
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Depends.

31
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, so it does have
that capability of distinguishing.

32
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.415
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it doesn't.

33
00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:37.083
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It doesen't?

34
00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:38.680
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: No.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Everything is a number

35
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.010
in JavaScript which is a float.

36
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.710
So doing math in JavaScript sucks.

37
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.900
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yes,
don't use JavaScript for math.

38
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.599
But you can declare it for a kind of-
There are libraries that can help,

39
00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.156
we need to do like more precisely.

40
00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:54.734
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, everything's a float.

41
00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:01.412
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So.

42
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:10.650
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
let's do this exercise.

43
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.175
So, I'm gonna use Brian's name.

44
00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:19.290
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm gonna say,
he's about 105.

45
00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:23.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Don't forget your

46
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:24.975
semi-colons like I did.

47
00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:32.897
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so,
we're going to use an alert and

48
00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:35.944
we're gonna say name and

49
00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:40.890
use a plus sign to put together strings.

50
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.490
And were gonna type is in here.

51
00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:52.850
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Brian's 105 years old.
