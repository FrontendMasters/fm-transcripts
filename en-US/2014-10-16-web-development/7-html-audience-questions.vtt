[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.321
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
why would you use a div instead of a span?

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.634
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm going to address
that here in just one second, but

4
00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.061
the answer is you can't use a span there.

5
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
I'll address span right after this.

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.740
Is there anymore questions as
related to what just happened here?

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.336
Okay, I'm just gonna throw
out a disclaimer which I'll

8
00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:31.111
probably say several more
times over the next 48 hours.

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.911
If you feel like you're drinking from
the fire hose, you totally are, right?

10
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.685
This is just like spitting tons of
information out here, because to get

11
00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:45.017
a basic foundation of web development,
you have to understand a lot, right and

12
00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:50.291
it's kind of like once you have the
foundation, then you can start moving up.

13
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:53.300
So if you don't grasp
everything like right now,

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.111
which is why my wife hates talking
to me about web development.

15
00:00:57.111 --> 00:01:00.445
It's okay, and
it's just repetition, practice, and

16
00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:02.880
you're just gonna have your aha moment.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.670
It's like, okay, that's why that idiot
was up there bumbling about this, right?

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.860
Okay, so don't get too frustrated
with yourself if you don't feel

19
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.770
like you're getting it right away.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.650
In my opinion, no one gets it right away.

21
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.880
I certainly didn't, like I.

22
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I have to remind myself
of that cuz I've been doing this for

23
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.990
years now.

24
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.160
So, we're okay.

25
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.920
Breathe, okay.

26
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.740
This is not yoga with Bryan.

27
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.310
Okay, cool, let's talk a little bit about
span since seems to be the hot topic.

28
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.140
So we have divs and we have spans.

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.320
They're related in the sense that
they are these containers that

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.020
are just containers that have no
description to what's going to be in them.

31
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.220
The big difference here is that a div is
meant to encompass other things, right?

32
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.720
So in this case,
our div is encompassing RH2 or OL.

33
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.330
It's going to encompass many things.

34
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.670
The span just goes over a bit of text,
right?

35
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.820
So for example.

36
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Say I really like yeah,
let's do that.

37
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.680
We're gonna put it over all the Corollas.

38
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.440
Or even better, models.

39
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.680
Let's go over models.

40
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.099
So
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't

41
00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.960
have to follow along with this if
you don't want to, but whoops!

42
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.130
Put the space there, okay.

43
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.610
And Model S right there.

44
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.590
So in this particular case what

45
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.820
I've done is I've put a span
around all of the models.

46
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.160
Later we'll talk about CSS so
if this doesn't make sense right away,

47
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.450
that's okay.

48
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.781
But say I wanted to make the models
look different than the makes or

49
00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:15.260
the years in this case.

50
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.160
In this particular case,

51
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.010
I could do that because I've put
spans around all of the models.

52
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.470
And what I'm essentially saying here is
span is just gonna go around like a little

53
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.030
bit of text that you want to be different
from the rest of the text, right.

54
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.840
So, in this particular case, again,

55
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.840
don't worry like we'll explain
CSS like a couple hours.

56
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.320
But let's say color red or
something like that, right?

57
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.250
So now notice that I've
made all of the models

58
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.970
look different than the rest of the text,
right?

59
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.370
That's why you would use a span.

60
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.440
Kind of makes sense a little bit right,
like it's just meant for

61
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.090
a little span of text.

62
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.166
Ha, there you go, that's why they call
it a span, it's a little span of text.

63
00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:08.906
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, moving on?

64
00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:09.986
Moving on.

65
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I address your question
there in the back with the awesome hat?

66
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I guess,
is there still that block in line?

67
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so we'll go over that
ad nauseum when we go over in CSS, but

68
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.520
divs are meant to encompass blocks right?

69
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.750
And a blocks just like other
elements that are blocks.

70
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.470
Like for example a paragraph is a block,

71
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.045
a div is a block, article,
what I mentioned earlier that's a block.

72
00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:45.480
Whereas like there's span, there's like,

73
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.479
there's one called e-m which
just stands for emphasis.

74
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.320
Like you notice this one is no longer red.

75
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.670
It's now emphasized so it's italics.

76
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.650
Or there's also strong which as you

77
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.298
might guess is, come on, nope,

78
00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:09.622
slash strong, bold, right.

79
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.111
So those are in line elements.

80
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:19.221
Things that are meant to go around just
like little pieces of text like spans,

81
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:22.611
strongs and there's a couple other ones.

82
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:26.788
So that's kind on the difference there is
that a div is a block level element and

83
00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:30.600
that a span as an in line element
meaning that it's kinda stays in line.

84
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.070
But yeah, we'll address that more in CSS
because that kind of talks more about

85
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.190
style as opposed to, yeah, content.

86
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.200
Which is what HTML,
HTML is to describe content.

87
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.735
So I guess what I'm saying is I'm going
to give you an incomplete answer,

88
00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:52.481
[LAUGH] that's what I'm
really trying to say.

89
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, leave this page.

90
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.510
Something else,
I learned a lot about teaching.

91
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.250
Sorry, go ahead.

92
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.925
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There's this question on
why you used span instead of div for

93
00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:07.740
that particular.

94
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Shit, I closed it.

95
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.510
All right,
well let's just open CodePen back up.

96
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.680
That's a great question.

97
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.397
Here's your, I was following
along while Nina was coding so.

98
00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:20.638
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go away.

99
00:06:20.638 --> 00:06:26.922
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

100
00:06:26.922 --> 00:06:32.106
let's say I have like just a paragraph

101
00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:39.240
that says like a paragraph of text,
right, okay.

102
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.770
So I have this just like random words,
this is just going to be contrived example

103
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.090
and let's say I want to do
something special to the of,

104
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.750
like every preposition needs
to have a span around it.

105
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.090
So, or needs to be like red
instead of something else.

106
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.330
So, I'd put a span right there.

107
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.890
First of all, going back to semantic HTML.

108
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.350
This is the more semantic way to do it,
cuz you're just letting it know,

109
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.550
I'm putting something in here and

110
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.050
I just want to affect this
particular piece of the text.

111
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.170
That's what a span semantically means

112
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.030
I say that because I can go in and
I make a div act like a span.

113
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.500
Right, like it's possible using
the browser like the browser just like

114
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.520
here's some good ideas but go ahead and
shoot yourself in the foot I don't care.

115
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.560
Which is kind of like a general theme for
programming.

116
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.520
But in this particular case if
I would make that a div now.

117
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.394
Right, is actually going to split the text
up, because the div is saying like

118
00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:43.664
a paragraph, I want this to be
different from the rest of my text,

119
00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:45.830
like it's a different container.

120
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.080
And so it assumes the different
container wants a new line.

121
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:55.430
So you notice over here, it's actually
split on different lines now,

122
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.830
which is not what we were intending to do.

123
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.900
We just wanted to make it
stand out a little bit.

124
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.030
Furthermore, I don't think you can
put div's inside of paragraphs so

125
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.660
this is actually not valid HTML.

126
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.472
Right, because spans can
go inside of paragraphs,

127
00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:14.710
div's can not go inside of paragraphs.

128
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.750
And that's actually one
of the rules of HTML.

129
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.162
There you go.

130
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:24.999
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
again as a general theme,

131
00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:30.290
these are general rules to help yourself
and you're welcome to break them, right?

132
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.330
Like no one is gonna stand over your
shoulder, well your three months self from

133
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.030
now might stand over your shoulder and
say you're an idiot, why did you do this?

134
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.800
Just about all these rules
can be broken if you want to.

135
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.637
All right,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any

136
00:08:46.637 --> 00:08:50.262
more questions on that exercise?

137
00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:59.099
Cool so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

138
00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:05.320
this was just a completed
example if you wanted to see it.

139
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Bryan?

140
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

141
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I have a question.

142
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So in the top here, and this

143
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.899
a little, we have bullets in there, and
under my favorite cars, we have numbers.

144
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.540
How did you produce that part?

145
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.998
How do you change from bullets to numbers,

146
00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:26.751
because all of mine
are listed under numbers.

147
00:09:26.751 --> 00:09:29.412
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay yeah, great question.

148
00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:32.560
So you notice here that I have an UL and
I have an OL.

149
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.600
So the UL is going to be bullets because
it's implied that there's no border.

150
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.240
It's an unordered list.

151
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.638
So my guess is both of yours are OLs,
right?

152
00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:44.331
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

153
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:45.222
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

154
00:09:45.222 --> 00:09:51.793
if you put them in OLs, like if I change
this for example right now to be an OL,

155
00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:58.486
all of a sudden now price is more and
more important than eco-friendly.

156
00:09:58.486 --> 00:09:59.643
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay.

157
00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:00.522
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

158
00:10:00.522 --> 00:10:04.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.
