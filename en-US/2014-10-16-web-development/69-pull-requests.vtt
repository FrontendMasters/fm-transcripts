2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.569
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: One person online said
they are at the pull request page, but

3
00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.314
can you maybe just explain generally
more what the pull request is.

4
00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:11.911
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sure.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.970
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So a pull request is
me, I've taken a copy of Brian's code.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.630
I've hacked away on it.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.850
I did something really awesome.

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.330
And I wanna be like,

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.901
hey Brian, you should use this code
that I've wrote in your project.

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.109
So by creating a pull request,
what I'm doing is

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.720
making a summary of all the changes that
I did, so and Brian goes to look at this?

12
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.418
He can see that I made these additions,
I made this deletions.

13
00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:53.193
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And
he can decide whether or

14
00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.370
not he wants to take the code that I made.

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760
And put it back into his own repository.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.940
So he's merging it back in.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.590
If he chooses to accept my pull request,
if he chooses not to, nothing happens.

18
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.930
His code remains exactly
the same that it was.

19
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.273
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So a pull request is
really a message to Brian saying

20
00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:18.789
take a look at this,
you might wanna merge it back in.

21
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.221
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah, exactly.

22
00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:23.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
Nina's workflow stops here.

23
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.080
She cannot force me to
accept her pull requests.

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.380
Later, I'll get on and
I'll look at her code.

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.280
I'll either approve it or like I'll give
her some messages like, I like this but

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.670
change this and this and this first.

27
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.430
We can push it back to her to make more
changes or I can say, okay, I like it,

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.280
and then you merge it in.

29
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360
So now, both of our code bases kind of
merged all of their changes together.

30
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.580
And now when we have one code
base with both of our changes.

31
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.110
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm actually going
to go ahead and use Brian's account and

32
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.320
accept all your pull requests.

33
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.760
So that he can have his super awesome
project that you guys are all a part of.

34
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.151
So let me open up his account.

35
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:08.647
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: See if you're on here.

36
00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:18.490
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so Brian's
GitHub has all these messages on it.

37
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's
like 20 pull requests.

38
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.600
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And all these people
are like knock knock Brian, you know your

39
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.300
code was a nice starting ground but I made
something better with it, I've changed it.

40
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.354
So if Brian goes to his product, his

41
00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:45.990
view of

42
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.750
the pull requests looks
a little bit different.

43
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.588
I had one pull request and

44
00:02:54.588 --> 00:03:00.102
that was the pull request I was making,
he's got 20 of them.

45
00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:00.987
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's pretty intimidating.

46
00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.597
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And just a quick note,
the emoji work in the comments but

47
00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:08.720
not in the title.

48
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.990
You guys are artistic.

49
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.880
I like the ghost, kinda looks like
a pirate, it's got one big eye and

50
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.690
one little guy.

51
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.218
We got some cats,
someone used my commit message.

52
00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:27.970
Someone is telling me that I messed up.

53
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.411
[LAUGH] So
when you put in your pull requests,

54
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:40.345
the person whose code you branched off
of will see all this guy, all this text.

55
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:45.017
And really instead of the ghosts and
stuff, you should be putting in a reason

56
00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:49.184
why Brian should, if his project was real,
pull your code back in.

57
00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:58.705
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Aw,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: You

58
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.460
got to know you did one.

59
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.896
Let's see, we got some cats and
that guy is me.

60
00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:11.150
All right so
as Brian I'm looking at this pull request.

61
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.170
I see that there is some comments here.

62
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.160
There is Marks's text
file then he changed it.

63
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.230
Can go to these tabs at the top,
I can see the comments.

64
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.390
And I could see the files that he changed.

65
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.590
Awesome, hockey is super fun.

66
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.955
So I'm like all right, this pull request
is awesome, I'm gonna go and merge it in.

67
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:40.837
So merge this pull request.

68
00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:53.970
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So now after this
merge now my project has mark.txt in it.

69
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.830
So my project and
Mark's project both share that file.

70
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.086
Two projects were merged together.

71
00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:14.105
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm gonna
accept some more pull-requests.

72
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:21.090
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm gonna go with
this ghost one cuz ghosts are awesome.

73
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.590
I'll show you guys another feature.

74
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.291
If I go to these tabs at the top and
look at the files changed, this summary,

75
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:34.989
what I can do is actually comment
on individual lines of code.

76
00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:40.695
There's this little comment icon,
it's a little bit off the screen,

77
00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:44.510
but if I click on it,
I'm gonna write Vi sucks.

78
00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:51.757
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Now let's see.

79
00:05:56.224 --> 00:05:59.146
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Thumbs down.

80
00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:00.290
And I'm gonna leave that comment.

81
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.492
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can't put that as me.

82
00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.850
[LAUGH] You know what?

83
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.767
I'm on your logic.

84
00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.810
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH] Wait!

85
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.990
I can't or I did?

86
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.178
Because I think I did.

87
00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:15.720
Sorry Jong.

88
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.880
Anyhow, when Jong goes
back to his pull request,

89
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.600
you'll see this comment that Brian made.

90
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.076
That Brian made.

91
00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:30.564
[LAUGH] All right, so just dropped

92
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:35.830
some knowledge on you guys.

93
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.360
This is a lot.

94
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.000
It's a new tool, a new website.

95
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.110
Does anyone have questions?

96
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.460
Is any of this confusing?

97
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.715
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You might
wanna refresh the page.

98
00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:47.670
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH] Do I?

99
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.643
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I think so.

100
00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:57.010
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH]

101
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:05.377
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]

102
00:07:05.377 --> 00:07:06.028
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: No laughing.

103
00:07:06.028 --> 00:07:07.254
This is serious business.

104
00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:14.722
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay I'm

105
00:07:14.722 --> 00:07:18.520
serious though does anyone
have any questions?

106
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.140
Because for

107
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.580
the final project we're going to be
cloning a real repository of Brian's.

108
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.098
So if there are any steps that
you missed please let me know.

109
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:35.043
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay?

110
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.891
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's do one more.

111
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.270
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
I've been Rick Rolled.

112
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.660
Awesome, Vermont rocks, so.

113
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:08.160
I think this pull request is great,
I am going to merge it in.

114
00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:21.055
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,
now my pull request project has two more,

115
00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.743
one more text file in it.

116
00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:26.964
So if you guys were
starting from scratch and

117
00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:32.276
you forked this project right now you
would get the errand dot txt file and

118
00:08:32.276 --> 00:08:36.300
the mark dot txt file along
with that original readme.

119
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.466
It would be a snapshot of what
the project looks right now.

120
00:08:47.723 --> 00:08:51.700
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
talked about all this stuff.

121
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.760
And a lot of this is in the slides.

122
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.680
I thought it would be a lot more
interesting to do a live demo.

123
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.160
But if you need a copy of
the commands here they are.

124
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.630
Talked about get status.

125
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.060
We talked about our unstaged changes.

126
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.230
We did a Git Add and added that file and
it's being helpful and

127
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.170
telling us what changes are going to be
committed the next time I run commit.

128
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.820
We do our commit and

129
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.990
we push that back up to
Origin which lives on GitHub.

130
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.920
We made a pull request.
