2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.569
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: One person online said
they are at the pull request page, but

3
00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.314
can you maybe just explain generally
more what the pull request is.

4
00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:11.911
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Sure.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.979
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So a pull request is

6
00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:21.970
me, I've taken a copy of Brian's code.

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.630
I've hacked away on it.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.850
I did something really awesome.

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.330
And I wanna be like,

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.901
hey Brian, you should use this code
that I've wrote in your project.

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.109
So by creating a pull request,
what I'm doing is

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.720
making a summary of all the changes that
I did, so and Brian goes to look at this?

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.640
He can see that I made these additions,

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.893
I made this deletions.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

15
00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:56.370
he can decide whether or
not he wants to take the code that I made.

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760
And put it back into his own repository.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.940
So he's merging it back in.

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.590
If he chooses to accept my pull request,
if he chooses not to, nothing happens.

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.910
His code remains

20
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.085
exactly the same that it was.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

21
00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:16.593
a pull request is really a message
to Brian saying take a look at this,

22
00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:19.761
you might wanna merge it back in.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah,

23
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.407
exactly.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

24
00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:23.830
Nina's workflow stops here.

25
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.080
She cannot force me to
accept her pull requests.

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.380
Later, I'll get on and
I'll look at her code.

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.280
I'll either approve it or like I'll give
her some messages like, I like this but

28
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.670
change this and this and this first.

29
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.430
We can push it back to her to make more
changes or I can say, okay, I like it,

30
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.280
and then you merge it in.

31
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360
So now, both of our code bases kind of
merged all of their changes together.

32
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.860
And now when we have one code base with

33
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.440
both of our changes.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm actually going to

34
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.320
go ahead and use Brian's account and
accept all your pull requests.

35
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.760
So that he can have his super awesome
project that you guys are all a part of.

36
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.151
So let me open up his account.

37
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:08.647
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: See if you're on here.

38
00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:13.680
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,

39
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.257
so Brian's GitHub has all

40
00:02:16.257 --> 00:02:19.290
these messages on it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's like 20 pull

41
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.630
requests.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

42
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.450
all these people are like knock
knock Brian, you know your code was

43
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.300
a nice starting ground but I made
something better with it, I've changed it.

44
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.354
So if Brian goes to his product, his

45
00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:45.990
view of

46
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.750
the pull requests looks
a little bit different.

47
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.011
I had one pull request and
that was the pull request I was making,

48
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.987
he's got 20 of them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's pretty intimidating.

49
00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.513
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And just a quick note,

50
00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:08.720
the emoji work in the comments but
not in the title.

51
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.990
You guys are artistic.

52
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.880
I like the ghost, kinda looks like
a pirate, it's got one big eye and

53
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.690
one little guy.

54
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.218
We got some cats,
someone used my commit message.

55
00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:27.970
Someone is telling me that I messed up.

56
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.411
[LAUGH] So
when you put in your pull requests,

57
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:40.345
the person whose code you branched off
of will see all this guy, all this text.

58
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.046
And really instead of the ghosts and
stuff,

59
00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:47.718
you should be putting in a reason why
Brian should, if his project was real,

60
00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:52.660
pull your code back in.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Aw,

61
00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.356
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: You got to know you

62
00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:01.460
did one.

63
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.896
Let's see, we got some cats and
that guy is me.

64
00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:11.150
All right so
as Brian I'm looking at this pull request.

65
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.170
I see that there is some comments here.

66
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.160
There is Marks's text
file then he changed it.

67
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.230
Can go to these tabs at the top,
I can see the comments.

68
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.390
And I could see the files that he changed.

69
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.590
Awesome, hockey is super fun.

70
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.955
So I'm like all right, this pull request
is awesome, I'm gonna go and merge it in.

71
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:46.510
So merge this pull request.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So

72
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.970
now after this merge now my
project has mark.txt in it.

73
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.830
So my project and
Mark's project both share that file.

74
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.086
Two projects were merged together.

75
00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:13.178
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm gonna accept some

76
00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:17.855
more pull-requests.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm

77
00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:21.090
gonna go with this ghost
one cuz ghosts are awesome.

78
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.590
I'll show you guys another feature.

79
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.291
If I go to these tabs at the top and
look at the files changed, this summary,

80
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:34.989
what I can do is actually comment
on individual lines of code.

81
00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:40.695
There's this little comment icon,
it's a little bit off the screen,

82
00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:44.510
but if I click on it,
I'm gonna write Vi sucks.

83
00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:51.757
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Now let's see.

84
00:05:56.224 --> 00:05:59.146
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Thumbs down.

85
00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:02.492
And I'm gonna leave that comment.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can't put that as me.

86
00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.850
[LAUGH] You know what?

87
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.810
I'm on your logic.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH] Wait!

88
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.990
I can't or I did?

89
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.178
Because I think I did.

90
00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:15.720
Sorry Jong.

91
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.880
Anyhow, when Jong goes
back to his pull request,

92
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.600
you'll see this comment that Brian made.

93
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.076
That Brian made.

94
00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:30.564
[LAUGH] All right, so just dropped

95
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:35.830
some knowledge on you guys.

96
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.360
This is a lot.

97
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.000
It's a new tool, a new website.

98
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.110
Does anyone have questions?

99
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.402
Is any of this confusing?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You might wanna refresh

100
00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:47.670
the page.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH] Do I?

101
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.643
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I think so.

102
00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:57.010
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH]

103
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:05.377
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]

104
00:07:05.377 --> 00:07:06.028
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: No laughing.

105
00:07:06.028 --> 00:07:08.630
This is serious business.
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]

106
00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:15.370
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay I'm serious

107
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.520
though does anyone have any questions?

108
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.140
Because for

109
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.580
the final project we're going to be
cloning a real repository of Brian's.

110
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.705
So if there are any steps
that you missed please let me

111
00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:35.043
know.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay?

112
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.891
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's do one more.

113
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.664
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,

114
00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:57.270
I've been Rick Rolled.

115
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.660
Awesome, Vermont rocks, so.

116
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:08.160
I think this pull request is great,
I am going to merge it in.

117
00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:16.575
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So,

118
00:08:16.575 --> 00:08:23.743
now my pull request project has two more,
one more text file in it.

119
00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:26.964
So if you guys were
starting from scratch and

120
00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:32.276
you forked this project right now you
would get the errand dot txt file and

121
00:08:32.276 --> 00:08:36.300
the mark dot txt file along
with that original readme.

122
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.466
It would be a snapshot of what
the project looks right now.

123
00:08:47.723 --> 00:08:48.492
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,

124
00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:51.700
talked about all this stuff.

125
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.760
And a lot of this is in the slides.

126
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.680
I thought it would be a lot more
interesting to do a live demo.

127
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.160
But if you need a copy of
the commands here they are.

128
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.630
Talked about get status.

129
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.060
We talked about our unstaged changes.

130
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.230
We did a Git Add and added that file and
it's being helpful and

131
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.170
telling us what changes are going to be
committed the next time I run commit.

132
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.820
We do our commit and

133
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.990
we push that back up to
Origin which lives on GitHub.

134
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.920
We made a pull request.
