[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Hold: This is going
back to semantic stuff.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.220
If you feel like I'm talking about this
a lot, it's because I am and I meant to.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.230
So I'm really hammering this home because

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.680
it's really tempting as a beginning
developer to not do these things.

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.960
And you're going to find out
the hard way that you should,

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
so it's better just to
start by doing it this way.

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.880
Naming is just shitty in
all of computer science.

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.470
You look at something like, I need to name
this, I do not know what I need to name

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.609
it, it needs to be a good name, but
I don't know what the good name is.

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.480
Very, very tempting in HTML and CSS to
say I have a container, it's purple so

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.810
I'm going to call it the purple-container
or this is my right-navigation.

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.650
It's a navigation bar and
it's on the right so

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.280
I'm going to call it my right-navigation.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.170
This is bad.

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.090
Do not do it,
you're going to make yourself sad later.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.140
Because say you're redesigning your site
and you have your navigation on the right

18
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.640
whereas your redesign calls for
it to be on the top.

19
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.550
You now have a thing called
right navigation that is on

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.200
the top of your page.

21
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.330
You're just gonna confuse the hell out of
yourself, out of others, it's just bad.

22
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.644
So, rather than naming something based on
it's presentation you're going to name it

23
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:21.240
based on what it is.

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.411
So, instead of calling it
right-navigation or side-navigation

25
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:30.400
you're going to call it minor-navigation
or I can't remember what we call it.

26
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.730
It might be inferior navigation.

27
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.900
Inferior and superior navigation right.

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.220
Something that implies hierarchy or
something like that.

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.390
So, it is very tempting to
give those names, don't,

30
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.220
call them something based on what they
are rather than based on how they look.

31
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.880
Again if you call it purple container.

32
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.600
And you have your purple
container which is green.

33
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.560
I guess what makes it really different
is that you're going to go look

34
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.160
at your code and you're gonna say, there's
something wrong inside of this container,

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.790
and you go look at it in your CSS,

36
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.930
and you're not gonna find it
because you're gonna be looking for

37
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.240
something called green container, when in
reality, it's called purple container.

38
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.170
Right, something that like, they just make
for weird things that are hard to find.

39
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.350
And the point is that,

40
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.190
when you change things later you
don't want to have to rename things.

41
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.170
And that's just a question you need to ask
yourself, is like if I need to change this

42
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.650
in three months, am I going to
screw myself up if I call it this?

43
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.820
Or if I need to find this later and
my co worker has modified this or

44
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.150
someone else I'm working with has
modified this to be different,

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800
is this name still valid, right?
