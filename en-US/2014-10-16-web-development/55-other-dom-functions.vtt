2
00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:07.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So other cool functions
here that we're not really discussing,

3
00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:09.434
we talked a little bit about CSS.

4
00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:13.860
That one just allows you to get and
set our CSS values, right?

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm wondering what color
is this div right now?

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.130
I can ask, what is your color?

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.180
It will give that back to me.

8
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.977
Or I can say, make your color orange.

9
00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:24.611
That, you would use CSS for that.

10
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.918
HTML is very, very similar to text.

11
00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:33.862
The only difference is, if I give strong,
this is cool end strong tag,

12
00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:37.640
HTML will actually honor that HTML, right?

13
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.200
So you can actually feed it like HTML
strings and it will render it like HTML.

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.158
If you use text,

15
00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:46.653
it will actually literally just
print out your tags for you.

16
00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:52.274
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .show and .hide,
it's exactly what it sounds like.

17
00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:55.755
If you wanna show something on a page,
or if you wanna hide it on a page,

18
00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.234
you used to use show and hide.

19
00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.829
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .addclass and .removeclass.

20
00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.919
So, for example, if you have a class
like this div is now emphasized,

21
00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.007
you can add an emphasis div.

22
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.051
And then once they change their
emphasis to something else,

23
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:15.178
you can remove the emphasis from one and
then add the emphasis to another, right?

24
00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:19.818
So you can dynamically add and remove
styling and classes and stuff like that.

25
00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:20.550
Really useful.

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.630
And then .append.

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.240
So, up until now we've been
doing text about HTML which

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.300
destroys whatever is in there and
then sets the new text.

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.930
If you actually want to add to
the bottom of it, you can use .append.

30
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.820
Yeah?

31
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Back to the .show and
.hide, what does hide actually do?

32
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It sets
its display to none.

33
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.520
So it uses CSS to hide it.

34
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.380
There are ways to actually
remove things completely,

35
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.230
like if that's what you're
interested in doing.

36
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.120
I would say nine times out
of ten that's unnecessary.

37
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.035
Just doing display none is fine.

38
00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:02.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, and all this stuff
is in the jQuery docs as well, so.

39
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.450
Let's go to the next slide.

40
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.490
jQuery is just ginormous, right?

41
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.630
Like, there's tons and tons and
tons of facets to jQuery.

42
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.400
It has 300 functions, it's just huge.

43
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.740
So, if you wanna know like how to hide
a div in jQuery just put into Google,

44
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.550
jQuery how to hide a div.

45
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.060
And you're going to find, seriously
probably like six pages of valid answers.

46
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.770
Just because everyone uses jQuery, and
everyone's always asking questions about

47
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.500
it, so everything that you want to know
about it is very, very well documented.

48
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.240
So you have Stack Overflow
is top notch for jQuery.
