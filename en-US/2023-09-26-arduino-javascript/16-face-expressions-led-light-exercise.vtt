1
00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:05.398
We have connected
the Get User Media API to some

2
00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:12.825
AI face tracking software to
an Arduino to create a face theramin.

3
00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.099
There you have it folks.

4
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.875
Tell you what, I think it'd be
fun to wire up the RGB LED,

5
00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:22.452
you can show different colors
depending on what's going on as well.

6
00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:25.352
If you look, this thing has four pins.

7
00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:28.209
It's an RGB LED, you always need a ground.

8
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:31.941
I'll let you take a lucky guess why I
picked the colors of the wires that I did.

9
00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:37.567
RGB red, green and blue one ground.

10
00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.269
Now, I will say this now.

11
00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.911
When I was going through this
particular kit, I had to play around,

12
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.390
I don't know if it was human operator
error or when I did before but

13
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.034
I'd like switch around some of
the colors to get it to work right, so

14
00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:56.338
I am mentally prepared for that.

15
00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:58.817
Maybe it was an operator
error last time I did this.

16
00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:02.650
Maybe it's these are slightly
different than I'm expecting.

17
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.618
We'll find out together.

18
00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:09.196
We're gonna go with this
initial layout first.

19
00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:13.502
And if I make it red and
it turns green, we will adjust course

20
00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:18.691
accordingly either through code,
probably we'll just do it in code.

21
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.362
So, we'll kinda get all
of that in place as well.

22
00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:29.092
So yeah, as you can see, this one has
four prongs, ground, R, G, and B.

23
00:01:29.092 --> 00:01:35.716
It's up to you if those are the colors
of wires that you choose to use.

24
00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:39.359
I personally would suggest it, but

25
00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.860
you make your own choices,
and I trust you.

26
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.291
Inherently so, you can try that out and

27
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:53.257
let me know but
I'm gonna try to do the same so

28
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:59.298
I've got this RGB I used to
say the bread board here and

29
00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:03.862
the longest pin, if I'm not mistaken,

30
00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:09.982
I can pull up the schematic just for
the pin as well.

31
00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:11.295
There's my face.

32
00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:13.525
I think the longest one is the ground, but

33
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:18.178
it's one of those things which is I feel
I'm pretty, I'm like 99% confident, but

34
00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:21.577
because you're all in the room,
I am double guessing myself.

35
00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:26.120
I'm pretty sure that longest
pin should be the ground.

36
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.470
&gt;&gt; You can't tell from that diagram.

37
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.739
&gt;&gt; I know.

38
00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.365
And at one point I
definitely memorize this and

39
00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.461
I said do not forget whatever you do.

40
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.799
And I've forgotten.

41
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.756
But it stands to reason.

42
00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:49.088
&gt;&gt; So, we don't have resistors in series
with these, is that gonna be a problem?

43
00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:50.488
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

44
00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:51.470
In my experience, no.

45
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.317
How about that?
&gt;&gt; I think this has higher resistance,

46
00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:56.195
in a way.

47
00:02:56.195 --> 00:03:00.421
&gt;&gt; And so I've plugged these,
this schematic's different than, like,

48
00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:03.066
you can plug in any
digital pins in this case.

49
00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.175
It doesn't really matter.

50
00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:10.736
Looks like I have it in 9, 10, 11.

51
00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:14.259
I know just in our live coding we
have something in 11, so yeah,

52
00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.325
three digital pins of your choosing.

53
00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:35.955
Bend that slightly so

54
00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:39.401
I can see it until also anyone
looking at the film can see it.

55
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.761
All right, we'll do the blue and

56
00:03:43.761 --> 00:03:47.976
I guess I'm gonna put this one.

57
00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:56.077
Eight, nine and ten.

58
00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:57.855
Eight.

59
00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.003
Nine,

60
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.779
Get a little crowded on my board,
it's all gonna be fine.

61
00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:28.388
Ten.

62
00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.472
I just need something to go to the ground.

63
00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:41.103
I really want a different color wire,
it's really important to me at this point.

64
00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:48.207
Like I said colors wires
don't really matter.

65
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:12.285
So, as you wire that I am
gonna go flip over to my code

66
00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:14.436
to make sure that I am not insane.

67
00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:15.977
At least, that I'm not wrong.

68
00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:36.686
For those watching my screen,
it's very much like the LED,

69
00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:38.611
you just give it an array of pins.

70
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.458
And so that will say RGB.

71
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:53.829
So with Johnny-Five,
it takes any CSS color,

72
00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:58.795
like the known ones like Blanched Almond.

73
00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:01.226
As well as the hex code color.

74
00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:03.897
I said what I said [LAUGH]

75
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.598
I don't see my light.

76
00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:15.764
So flash for a second there.

77
00:07:15.764 --> 00:07:18.576
&gt;&gt; I think it's given me
the wrong colors though.

78
00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:21.495
&gt;&gt; That's what I said before,
which is like I followed the schematic and

79
00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:22.494
I had the wrong colors.

80
00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:24.480
I had to like adjust the pin slightly.

81
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.434
So I am not surprised by that either.

82
00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:30.344
So we'll talk about how like
&gt;&gt; I got yellow, blue, and red.

83
00:07:30.344 --> 00:07:32.826
Should I get red, blue, and green?

84
00:07:32.826 --> 00:07:40.246
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you might have, like I had
to swap the numbers around and so.

85
00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:44.090
Yeah, so I think I said this before,
I remember when I I had to, like,

86
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.075
swap two of them.

87
00:07:45.075 --> 00:07:48.462
So, out of hypothesis, I'm gonna swap
the same ones I swapped last time.

88
00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:58.030
Like I said, it was not Let me
see if that does the trick.

89
00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:16.627
Red.

90
00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:26.016
Blue, yeah, I am not totally sure,
I know the experiences before.

91
00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.654
I don't know if it's the parts and
these kits or what,

92
00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:33.860
but I had to swap it slightly,
so normally they'd be an order.

93
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.167
I had to do it so the highest value.

94
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:41.805
So it's basically three one two
which is before when I tried it.

95
00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:46.769
I was like, maybe it's just me right now
at this moment, so I was spiritually and

96
00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:50.135
mentally prepared for that but
I had to swap those two.

97
00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:54.654
And so like it was one of those things
which is why you have the REPL it is

98
00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:56.950
very nice to be able to go in there and

99
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:02.235
just like be able to change the color
in the REPL and get the feedback that you need,

100
00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:05.852
and be able to kind of make
those adjustments on the fly.

101
00:09:05.852 --> 00:09:10.482
That's one place where the REPL is
just super helpful in this case.

102
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.551
So I'm gonna go back to my face theremin,
and

103
00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:18.057
I'm going to not have the music piece for
a little bit.

104
00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.413
I know.

105
00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:21.330
We'll put it back later,
or you can put it back later.

106
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.250
I'm just gonna comment out a lot of code.

107
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.702
It's gonna be okay.

108
00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:27.500
But I also, I'm gonna grab this and

109
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.898
also see if I can get it to
change colors based on my mood.

110
00:09:31.898 --> 00:09:33.774
Seems like a legitimate thing to do.

111
00:09:43.988 --> 00:09:47.387
So if I'm not mistaken, yeah,
there's this expression.

112
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:50.436
I'm just gonna socket.emit.

113
00:09:50.436 --> 00:09:53.901
If I'm already emitting the face,

114
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:58.831
I could just emit it as
the second argument as well.

115
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:04.220
So we'll emit the face position
as well as the expression.

116
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.778
We are going to slightly
disable the piezo for a second.

117
00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:09.550
You can uncomment that line
when you're ready, but

118
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.456
just I think I've caused
enough chaos with the audio.

119
00:10:12.456 --> 00:10:16.488
[LAUGH] For this workshop, I'm going to
try to be at least a little bit polite

120
00:10:16.488 --> 00:10:18.478
to our friends at Frontend Masters.

121
00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:21.049
Like a little, not a lot,
just a little bit.

122
00:10:25.863 --> 00:10:28.103
So now we've got that.

123
00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:32.561
I'm gonna pull in that code
where I swapped out slightly.

124
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:38.446
Now when the face comes in,
we've got just console.log the data.

125
00:10:38.446 --> 00:10:45.296
I think it is all in that same Data,
we'll start this up.

126
00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:53.752
And I should see the X, Y,
and the face expression,

127
00:10:53.752 --> 00:10:56.014
RGB is not defined, I called it LED.

128
00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:16.211
All right, starting up red.

129
00:11:16.211 --> 00:11:18.131
And if we go here.

130
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:27.046
I got the X and the Y,
might be the second argument then.

131
00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:31.793
So data, Expression.

132
00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:50.231
Am I sending that all through?

133
00:11:55.844 --> 00:11:59.057
Rank expressions first face,

134
00:11:59.057 --> 00:12:04.118
let's save that Instead.

135
00:12:15.706 --> 00:12:20.826
Happy, okay, so now happy is coming in.

136
00:12:20.826 --> 00:12:25.035
So with that on the server side, we should
be able just starting like this actually

137
00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:28.268
is just a helper function cuz
actually gives you the weights and

138
00:12:28.268 --> 00:12:30.176
confidence for every single phase.

139
00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:33.882
When I'm like, I don't care about
the weights and conferences tell me which

140
00:12:33.882 --> 00:12:37.485
one one, says all this function does
is like literally just sort the keys.

141
00:12:37.485 --> 00:12:43.482
So we'll send that there was a second
argument, and back in we go and so now,

142
00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:56.365
If expression is happy, rgb.color green,

143
00:12:56.365 --> 00:12:59.884
I feel like angry should be red.

144
00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:00.912
We know that, right?

145
00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:03.992
Cool.

146
00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:10.152
[LAUGH] If expression equals angry,

147
00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:17.755
you've seen the movie inside out, right?

148
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:23.540
Okay, just making sure if you're like,
no, I haven't like, that's cool.

149
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.311
It's not actually important for
this at all.

150
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:28.654
And I forget what the other,

151
00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:33.259
was sad one, we'll have that be blue.

152
00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:38.522
So ideally now based on
the expression coming in,

153
00:13:38.522 --> 00:13:45.683
I should be able to change the color
of the RGB LED to my mood, right?

154
00:13:45.683 --> 00:13:50.141
Now how do I wire this up to a zoom
meeting is the big question but,

155
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.878
Just turned it off so far.

156
00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:10.645
Some of these, somebody's work,
so I got we can see go blue I

157
00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:15.068
wonder if not all the colors
are represented in here or not all

158
00:14:15.068 --> 00:14:19.788
the above we got the faces right but,
&gt;&gt; You need a base case or like a default.

159
00:14:19.788 --> 00:14:22.169
&gt;&gt; Neutral,
you got neutral in there somewhere.

160
00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:22.805
&gt;&gt; Neutral, but

161
00:14:22.805 --> 00:14:27.455
like that should just not trigger any my
coach just leave the previous one, right?

162
00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:33.919
I mean,
we've got the major point of this, right?

163
00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:37.106
[LAUGH] We can go, well,
we'll see how that works.

164
00:14:37.106 --> 00:14:41.515
But, arguably, we're in the part of,

165
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:52.109
Also wonder if I got those pins right but
like we'll see in a second.

166
00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:57.085
It starts out red.

167
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:01.470
Angry.

168
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.768
Happy seems to be problematic.

169
00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:05.510
It was a sad.

170
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.604
Sad works, it's really just happy that
seems to be the the issue right now and as

171
00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:14.020
I was playing around with I wonder if I've
got the pins like totally correct, right?

172
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.110
Because green would be if i have
this thing flipped the wrong way,

173
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.667
green will be the problematic one and
because we're going back and forth.

174
00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:22.820
I wonder if part of this is,
I just got to flip it.
