WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.767
So we've got a bit of read system
information and expose it as well.

2
00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:06.656
That's cool, I guess.

3
00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:10.609
But there's some other things
that we can do, which is again,

4
00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.952
we have the full power of Node.js,
we have the full power of the web.

5
00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:19.762
The other interesting thing we can do is
if we go into, if you don't have, and

6
00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.832
the README is install ngrok,
if you don't have that installed,

7
00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:26.284
just do a brew install ngrok right now.

8
00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:29.386
You might have to make an account,
unclear, but

9
00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:32.952
we'll kinda walk through it
a little bit as well, too.

10
00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:37.050
And so,
what we can do is also theoretically,

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.266
one of the examples I have
here is just using it.

12
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.179
You might wanna have a more robust
setup than what I'm gonna do, but

13
00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.661
theoretically you could have it listen for
webhooks from GitHub repos.

14
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:54.530
New PR or new star on the repo, you could
have it display that information as well,

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.034
right?

16
00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:56.572
And there's a bunch of
options you can do there.

17
00:00:56.572 --> 00:01:00.417
And really, that's just exposing the
Express server, setting the webhook link.

18
00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:04.729
You might choose to do something a little
bit more robust, but we could try it out.

19
00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.575
So let's actually pull that in.

20
00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:09.494
I'll do the same file just
to keep life easy for us.

21
00:01:11.213 --> 00:01:16.914
And so what we can do in this case is, I'm

22
00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:22.569
just going to pull in some of that Express
stuff that we used earlier, as well.

23
00:01:23.857 --> 00:01:28.735
And so let's go ahead and
open all that up.

24
00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:35.572
So what we'll do is we'll say
that we want to pull in Express,

25
00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:39.520
import express from 'express'.

26
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.920
They all spell express, right?

27
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.637
I don't know.

28
00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:46.997
So pull in express, and

29
00:01:46.997 --> 00:01:52.205
then we'll say make an express app.

30
00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:57.205
And we'll say, we'll pull on port 3000.

31
00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:01.592
Or if you have an environment variable set
to another port obviously that's all that

32
00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:02.408
code is doing.

33
00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:07.290
If not, default to 3000 cuz
that seems reasonable to me.

34
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.225
And then just like we had in all
the examples earlier, we'll just say,

35
00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:16.842
app.post, and I'm just gonna
make an endpoint /api/update.

36
00:02:16.842 --> 00:02:22.944
And that will take a request and
a response, as we've seen before.

37
00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.943
And we'll start out with
just res.sendStatus.

38
00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:35.007
Cuz we're gonna use an external service,
so

39
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:37.547
we wanna be able to say
that everything is okay.

40
00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:41.584
Cool, and let's also console.log that.

41
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.628
And see what we have in this case.

42
00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:56.778
So now we have the ability to
have a webhook in this case.

43
00:02:56.778 --> 00:03:01.628
And what we'll do is I will comment out
this code cuz we might need it later.

44
00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:05.437
We'll say when that comes in.

45
00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:06.981
I don't remember exactly
what the payload is, so

46
00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:09.166
we'll start with console logging it,
but we'll start with the app.

47
00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.239
And just put that all in place.

48
00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.625
I don't really need a callback,
we'll just say, console.log,

49
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.634
Web Server is up and running!

50
00:03:31.634 --> 00:03:34.270
All right, and we'll start that up.

51
00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:44.360
Let that web server start.

52
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.561
And then I'm gonna go over to terminal.

53
00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:02.512
So we've got ngrok here, what we can
bind it to, we'll do to HTTP and

54
00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:04.018
we're just gonna go to 3000.

55
00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:12.327
So I'll do ngrok http 3000 and,

56
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.241
That's gonna forward from this
domain over to my local web server.

57
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.767
And so I could theoretically do
something like go onto GitHub,

58
00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:24.840
let's go into this repo right here.

59
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.062
We'll do Settings, Just set up a webhook.

60
00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:33.453
And then all we wanna do is,
and we said API,

61
00:04:33.453 --> 00:04:36.582
did I call it update, what did I call it?

62
00:04:39.506 --> 00:04:42.593
Update, update,
we'll have it send some JSON.

63
00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:46.068
I should secure it, eh, send everything.

64
00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.354
Looks like something came in,
I didn't, req.body.

65
00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:55.941
I didn't set up that bodyParser.

66
00:04:55.941 --> 00:05:00.272
Good thing I did this on just
a random thing at first.

67
00:05:00.272 --> 00:05:05.093
Cool, let's just steal that
from one of the other ones.

68
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.744
BodyParser.

69
00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:13.341
Pull that in.

70
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:21.896
We want, import bodyParser from
'body-parser'.

71
00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.662
Let's kill that server and restart it.

72
00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:38.833
And let's go ahead and let's,
I don't know, star the repo.

73
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.266
Not that I'm looking for
stars or anything like that.

74
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:47.291
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you had
selected push everything.

75
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:54.727
It looked like the box above it was-
&gt;&gt; We got, just send me everything.

76
00:05:57.011 --> 00:05:59.985
Now it should send an,
I didn't put the full endpoint in here.

77
00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:04.012
So that'll do it.

78
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.867
Cool, I don't know that.

79
00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:15.256
All right, one more time with feeling.

80
00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:22.262
So yeah, we did send a post to 404.

81
00:06:22.262 --> 00:06:23.767
It didn't send anything when I updated it.

82
00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:26.044
So I'm gonna delete this one more time.

83
00:06:26.044 --> 00:06:28.953
Cuz it sends an initial event for
you to validate everything works,

84
00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:31.822
which is good because it helps me
validate that everything works.

85
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:39.420
And I'll just make sure that
that's still the right address.

86
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.052
Yep, looks like it is.

87
00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:44.617
Cool, cool, cool.

88
00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:49.882
Send me everything at that webhook, and
I should see a brand new event in here.

89
00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:51.477
There it is, we got everything.

90
00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:54.033
So now every time that something happens,

91
00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:58.158
I should get a full payload of
everything that happened from GitHub.

92
00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:03.037
And then what I wanna do is I would like
to forward that over to this LCD screen

93
00:07:03.037 --> 00:07:03.897
over there.

94
00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:08.001
So let's go ahead and
I'm gonna star my own repo.

95
00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:15.357
And so I should get, as you can see,
all that data is coming in,

96
00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:18.248
maybe not the most easiest
to read way possible.

97
00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:20.116
But we've got starred on what repository,

98
00:07:20.116 --> 00:07:23.357
it'll tell you everything from the name
and everything along those lines.

99
00:07:23.357 --> 00:07:25.804
Well, that's the started one, not starred.

100
00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:30.709
But yeah, you can clearly see that it was
me that did the starring because I get all

101
00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:32.600
that information based on it.

102
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.417
I've got other people starring it now.

103
00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.871
Wee, so cool.

104
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:41.114
We can actually say that when these come
in we can go, the repo was starred and

105
00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:43.608
who starred it, and
something along those lines as well.

106
00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:46.427
So if I grab this real quick,
I can grab one of these.

107
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.750
You get the full notification's URL,
something along those lines.

108
00:08:11.777 --> 00:08:16.425
We know that we get an action in there,
that was the webhook was created.

109
00:08:16.425 --> 00:08:18.539
But anything that kinda comes
in we can play around with here.

110
00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:22.256
I can totally play around
with this all the way, but

111
00:08:22.256 --> 00:08:25.212
let's just do payload action, right?

112
00:08:25.212 --> 00:08:27.428
Cuz we know that comes in.

113
00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:32.190
So when something comes in, we'll go
ahead and we're going to take the,

114
00:08:44.632 --> 00:08:46.616
lcd.clear.

115
00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:50.102
We'll print the payload.action.

116
00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:53.322
We should see whatever that is kind of
come in and play around at the same time.

117
00:08:53.322 --> 00:08:57.640
So I'm gonna kill this server, and we
can now hook it up so it receives stuff.

118
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.256
So it' like you can actually have a little
red light go off when a new PR comes in

119
00:09:01.256 --> 00:09:04.669
that you should have code reviewed
while you're doing something else.

120
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:08.952
Whatever it is, any of those stuff,
your Arduino can now get messages

121
00:09:08.952 --> 00:09:13.754
from the outside world and be able to show
you any of these things along the way.

122
00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:20.252
Cool, so that clears, and then I'm gonna
go ahead and star and unstar, undefined.

123
00:09:20.252 --> 00:09:24.610
Well, I'm getting messages pushed,
so that's kind of cool.

124
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.467
Cuz it should be the payload,
if you get the full payload.

125
00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:29.939
I'll grab one of these in a second.

126
00:09:29.939 --> 00:09:33.899
But the general idea here is that we've
got stuff coming from the outside world

127
00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:36.899
that kind of comes in and
we can display it on the screen, and

128
00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:39.136
we've got that full loop happening there.

129
00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:40.254
All right, moment of truth,

130
00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.633
we've got just a message saying
your repository was starred.

131
00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:46.170
We could do a bunch of
stuff with the payload.

132
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.123
The little problems with actually
parsing it are slightly outside of this.

133
00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:53.875
So we're gonna post a star, so
right now if we look at the LCD screen,

134
00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:57.259
it says waiting,
the GitHub repository triggers a webhook.

135
00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:59.300
It says your repository was starred.
