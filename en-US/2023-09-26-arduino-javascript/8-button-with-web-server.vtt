WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.880
So now I think it's time
to bring in a web server.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.723
Cuz now it's cool to have this LED
tell me if the button is pressed or

3
00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:12.370
not pressed, but
rather Chrome tell me, right?

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.125
And so there's another example in there
that kinda gives us the basic setup and

5
00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.586
by navigating to folder
called button with web server,

6
00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:24.281
which I think is a good name for
what I seek to do at this point.

7
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:29.102
So I'm just going to navigate into there.

8
00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:34.201
And I've got a slightly
different setup in there for us.

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:38.916
All right, so let's talk a little
bit about the code that's in here.

10
00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:42.512
It shouldn't be anything too fancy.

11
00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:45.997
We've got just the bare bones Express app.

12
00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:50.497
I use Express cuz I feel like
that's possibly things people

13
00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:52.390
are most familiar with.

14
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.228
If you wanna use whatever, the heapster,
HTTP server as of the day, or if you wanna

15
00:00:57.228 --> 00:01:02.017
go real artisanal and just pulling Node's,
HTTP library, you can do that as well.

16
00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:04.364
I just chose to use Express.

17
00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:10.815
And so essentially use an Express app,
but then we also set up Johnny-Five.

18
00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.888
I'm setting repl to false simply
because Express is gonna start up, and

19
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:19.180
that's gonna take over most of the console
and I don't want them fighting.

20
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.125
I just wanna see the Express
logs in this case.

21
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.481
So this will not send you into the repl.

22
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:32.710
And all I have right now is not
a lot happening in here, right?

23
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.667
I have that button that I had wired
up before, and we start up a server.

24
00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.460
What I wanna do is I wanna
bridge the gap here.

25
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.132
What I wanna do is when I go to a given
endpoint, I should get a response back,

26
00:01:44.132 --> 00:01:47.770
is this button presently pressed or
not pressed, right?

27
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.404
And yeah, so we're gonna build on it.

28
00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:51.023
There will be WebSockets.

29
00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:55.114
We will start pushing that information
to the browser, but baby steps here.

30
00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:59.227
What we wanna do is just basically see,
can we, cuz one,

31
00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:03.516
we theoretically could see
whether the button is there, or

32
00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:09.210
we could theoretically go ahead and
trigger the LED from the browser, right?

33
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.048
But let's start by just saying,
is our button pressed,

34
00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.128
is our button not pressed at this moment?

35
00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:17.540
And then we'll kinda
build on it from there.

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.599
And so
whatever endpoint you try to use is fine.

37
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.310
I'm gonna do app.get request
to just slash at this point.

38
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.431
So we'll go ahead and
we'll just have a get request.

39
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:34.100
And right now, no, wrong cursor,
we'll say just res.send Hello World.

40
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.156
Basically, make sure our server works,
first and foremost,

41
00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.975
and then after that, then we'll get
a little fancier with our lives, right?

42
00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:43.401
So it was just a quick
little get endpoint.

43
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:47.340
If you wanna make an API,
do whatever you want.

44
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.201
In my case, we've got a slash.

45
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:53.040
We're just gonna say Hello World, and
we'll kinda build on it in a second.

46
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.790
You can make an API or whatever.

47
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.303
Cool, cool, cool, so I've got that.

48
00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:02.782
Let's fire up the server and
take a look at what we've got.

49
00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:05.536
So we'll say node just index.js.

50
00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:08.746
You can see it spins up
Johnny-Five cuz the server

51
00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:11.431
doesn't start up until board's ready.

52
00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:13.586
And now my server is running on port 3000.

53
00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:19.672
I see Hello World.

54
00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:21.260
So I have a web server.

55
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.988
That's cool, I guess.

56
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.568
But now let's actually
hook it up to the button.

57
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.214
And whether or not a button is pressed,
that's cool, but

58
00:03:32.214 --> 00:03:35.418
we've also got some sensors that we can
play around with a little bit later to

59
00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:38.440
then have a web server which is like,
tell me the current temperature.

60
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.255
Tell me the light in this room or
something along those lines is pretty easy

61
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.910
once we have some of these
foundational concepts.

62
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.403
All right, so one of the things we're
probably gonna do is we do need to,

63
00:03:50.403 --> 00:03:54.815
as far as I know, and
I'm pretty sure I checked, the LED,

64
00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:57.626
you can figure out if it's on or off.

65
00:03:57.626 --> 00:04:01.497
The button,
I think we've gotta set ourselves.

66
00:04:01.497 --> 00:04:08.488
So we'll say that the button is not
pressed when the button is down.

67
00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:10.679
We'll say that isPressed is true.

68
00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:19.368
And when the button is up,
We'll say that isPressed is false, right?

69
00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:27.210
Great, so same as down up,
we have to return the LED on and off.

70
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.481
You can even steal that code
from yourself if you want.

71
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:32.623
We'll just change
the boolean at this point.

72
00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:36.973
And then Hello World, or we could say,

73
00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:45.067
Yeah, I like that ternary, right?

74
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:46.233
I'll say,

75
00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:05.653
Pressed, Or not pressed.

76
00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:11.619
Period.

77
00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:16.465
All right, so let's try that out and
see what we've got.

78
00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:17.775
Now I've gotta kill everything off again.

79
00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:32.405
So I should refresh, the button
is not pressed, moment of truth,

80
00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:35.398
hold down button, the button is pressed.

81
00:05:38.763 --> 00:05:43.302
So I've now started to bridge
the gap between browser to Node,

82
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.450
Node to the Arduino, right?

83
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.387
So we've got the foundational pieces
here of what can hopefully begin

84
00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:53.240
to bridge these three things together.

85
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.526
Now, this is where it gets interesting,
right?

86
00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:57.770
We've got a lot of options here.

87
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.828
We can also go the other direction, right?

88
00:05:59.828 --> 00:06:03.905
We can send post requests to the server,
which have access to Johnny-Five, right?

89
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.842
That can then control stuff on the board,
right?

90
00:06:06.842 --> 00:06:11.599
So we can have various, either other
things in our house, our browser itself,

91
00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.170
send things to the board.

92
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.504
Or if there are other sensors in this
packet, I think there's a temperature

93
00:06:17.504 --> 00:06:21.041
sensor, a light sensor,
a tilt sensor, few other sensors.

94
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:25.617
And when we talk about sensors a little
bit, most sensors are super cheap.

95
00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:26.878
They're three bucks, right?

96
00:06:26.878 --> 00:06:32.067
And so this one didn't come with one
of these soil moisture sensors, but

97
00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:37.345
you can see a world that one could
theoretically either push a WebSocket,

98
00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:40.346
use something with something like this.

99
00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:42.745
And I think these costs $4, right?

100
00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:45.768
The same concepts will apply to
literally anything that we're doing.

101
00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:47.825
We're just gonna stick to
the things in the kit for now.
