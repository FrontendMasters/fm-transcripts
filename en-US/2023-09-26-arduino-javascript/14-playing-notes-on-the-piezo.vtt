1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.640
So we are going to wire up the piezo.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.520
As far as I can tell I don't
think this one is polarized.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.656
I know that when I ran through this before
I just put it in there and it didn't work.

4
00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:14.520
It did work unlike some
other things today.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.985
The nice part is is that
if we mess this up, or

6
00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.560
throw it Fixing this
circuit is pretty easy.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.719
We have got one side going to the ground
and the other side, cause this is, again,

8
00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.150
this is the opposite of
what we have been doing.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.680
This is not a sensor,
this is an actuator, right?

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.790
Our code has it do stuff, right?

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.860
So we are not reading, this is like,

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.250
we will send signals from the Arduino
board to the actual code itself.

13
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.980
So we can,
I'm gonna put it in on the other side.

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.930
I just gotta make sure I have
all the connections places.

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.350
I'm running out of room.

16
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.040
The one thing I will say about this one,
it is big.

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.881
And thereby somewhat hard to remember
exactly where you plugged it in so

18
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.881
if you're putting the pins in it makes
sense to look at the numbers of where

19
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.790
you're placing it.

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.335
I'm going to place it on this other side
just in the very first spot cause it

21
00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:11.373
makes it easy for me.

22
00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:14.578
But if it doesn't work,
one of the things I will

23
00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:19.077
realize is that I just got the wrong
pin cause I'm trying to see it.

24
00:01:19.077 --> 00:01:25.217
And then look it looks like
if I put in this first pin,

25
00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:31.649
it looks like I end up five
pins later on the other side.

26
00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.400
Four pins later, so we'll go Doesn't
give you a lot of room to work with me.

27
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.550
We'll go there and
I put it in six doesn't really matter.

28
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.089
It does as long as you have
a pulse width as long as squiggly

29
00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.704
Six and
then the ground is just the ground.

30
00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:59.723
Cause this diagram makes it look like
they're right next to each other,

31
00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:01.888
as you can tell, that's a lie.

32
00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.484
But the basic concept is true.

33
00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.480
All right, so for this one.

34
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.120
I've got a directory called piezo.

35
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.807
We're going to.

36
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.920
I didn't need to fill up
an entire window for that.

37
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.132
We'll go in to piezo.

38
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.160
Again, if you plugged it into a different
pin than six, you will need to adjust that

39
00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.100
It could be interesting to also
play around with the light and

40
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.179
the REPL to see what some of the other
options were, because IntelliSense wasn't

41
00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:09.295
totally running,
it was like trying different stuff.

42
00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:11.735
So we can try that in a second
while we're in here, too.

43
00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:14.975
But let's get it working with the piezo.

44
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:17.345
So this one, again,
I have no server on this one.

45
00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.235
We can pull it into
a server in a little bit.

46
00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.479
But let's just try to play
with the piezo itself first.

47
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.977
So go ahead and do And
we'll inject both into that rapport.

48
00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:43.590
So piezo It's got this play.

49
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.190
And you can see I injected
a song in there, too.

50
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.477
And the songs are basically you just
give it the notes of the frequency,

51
00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:54.540
like a tempo and fractions for
quarter notes or whatever.

52
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.490
And then theoretically, it should play
the song if I've wired it up correctly.

53
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.420
[MUSIC]

54
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.110
Perfect, right?

55
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.230
Yeah, that happened.

56
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.120
Just deal with it [LAUGH].

57
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.298
So we can look at the song itself and

58
00:04:13.298 --> 00:04:18.009
see that code let's go into
the song At some point,

59
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.280
there's a reason why I broke
it out into its own file.

60
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.513
Not that I really if any of you looked at
this and knew what was going to happen,

61
00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:30.400
you would have gotten a gold star,
but just in case.

62
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.100
So there's a bunch of different options.

63
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.668
You can make it work at a certain
frequency and as I pull it back up,

64
00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:36.890
I'll show you.

65
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.936
You can give it a bunch of notes, but

66
00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:43.450
otherwise an array of notes it will like
figure out the tempo, and play for is.

67
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.331
Again these are just abstractions
right there are libraries that like

68
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.720
just help out with this.

69
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.679
But you could also grab

70
00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:58.382
it and say like, is.

71
00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:00.827
Frequency and given 440.

72
00:05:05.007 --> 00:05:10.172
Would work on either duration for

73
00:05:10.172 --> 00:05:14.231
4500 milliseconds,

74
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:18.606
right that's a 440.

75
00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:22.130
You can go to 880, it's an octave higher.

76
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.974
[SOUND] Welcome to Music Theory 101.

77
00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:29.095
[LAUGH] Fun fact, 220 is an octave lower.

78
00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:33.991
[SOUND] Great, so you can theoretically,
you can get whole whooshing

79
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:38.560
sounds if you want, all of those things,
but you can take that.
