00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.354
It sounds maybe it's time for
the photoresistor,

2
00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:10.248
okay, so I will warn you, once again,

3
00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:14.850
there's a lot of things
I like about this kit.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.727
The photoresistor does not look like the
normal photo resistors that you've seen.

5
00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:22.656
If I pull up the schematic real quick,

6
00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.733
that's what a photoresistor
looks normally, ours do not,

7
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.375
ours look like there's a whole thing
with a little clear plastic head.

8
00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:34.198
As I go shuffle around my side table
over here, I will find it, but

9
00:00:34.198 --> 00:00:37.292
it looks almost like a flat-topped LED.

10
00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.153
All right, so this is our photoresistor,

11
00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:45.009
now that you'll notice this one also
has the long pin and the short pins.

12
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:50.673
The long pin is what we put in first and
it's not dissimilar from the LED

13
00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:57.307
with the addition of the fact that we also
then read somewhere in the middle there.

14
00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.596
So I can go plug that one in,

15
00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:08.107
I'm gonna try to just use two,
cuz I'm gonna be a little bit

16
00:01:08.107 --> 00:01:13.053
careful with spacing,
cuz I have not taken a lot out yet,

17
00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:17.193
which is intentional,
so that should be good.

18
00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:20.634
Let's focus on the ground part first,
kind of do it backwards.

19
00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:36.613
That's the ground, then there is a 10k
resistor kinda in the middle here.

20
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:42.108
I usually in this point had the wires
between the power rail and the component,

21
00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:47.363
because I couldn't figure out how to
make Fritzing make them long enough.

22
00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:51.675
So you can either jump over and
have an extra step, or

23
00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:57.263
you can go directly with the resistor
over, let's see if I regret.

24
00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:04.077
And then,

25
00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.979
I'm gonna plug it into A1 here,

26
00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:23.951
So insofar,
that it's called a photoresistor,

27
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:28.110
you can guess that it is a resistor in and
of itself.

28
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.403
So it's basically the more light we have,

29
00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:36.444
the more the electricity really
can't go and so we get to read it.

30
00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:41.508
All right, let's kind of
verify that any of this works,

31
00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:46.045
because, again,
before I talk too much about it,

32
00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:51.214
between live coding and
live wiring, the opportunity for

33
00:02:51.214 --> 00:02:54.770
me to make boo-boos is high, right?

34
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.558
So one thing about the light sensor
is that there are lots of models,

35
00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:05.210
but I think in this point we should
be fine, I plugged mine into pin 1.

36
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.611
And so I'm gonna do here is,
[SOUND] that's the wrong,

37
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:16.239
That's the client code, yes, it is the
wrong file, cuz I'm in the client code.

38
00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.115
With any of this, we can go ahead and say,

39
00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:36.897
Five, .Light,

40
00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:44.807
And here, I'm just gonna start with just
saying pin: 'A1', now, I could just put

41
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.900
the A1 in there, I'm gonna show you
why I'm gonna do this in a second.

42
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.290
But first I wanna make sure that I have
not somehow totally messed this up.

43
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.385
So I'll get that kind of in place,
I have that saved,

44
00:03:56.385 --> 00:04:00.766
I'll put the code right here for
now, it's way of help.

45
00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:11.891
Say value and raw,

46
00:04:21.718 --> 00:04:24.500
Actually, let's pull it in
from the light sensor itself.

47
00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:40.183
All right, so now, we're gonna
see did I wire this up correctly?

48
00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:50.265
Okay, I've got some light sensor in here,
there's apparently no raw on this one,

49
00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:54.787
but we've got a value, which is
pretty high presently and ideally,

50
00:04:57.107 --> 00:05:03.715
Interestingly, I think I might have it or
we're reading it slightly backwards.

51
00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.841
So covering it when the value go higher,
but

52
00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:08.552
I am getting a reading from
the sensor at the very least.

53
00:05:11.942 --> 00:05:14.700
I don't know that bottle cap is
as effective as we want it to be.

54
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.667
Okay, so I've got to figure out for
a second,

55
00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:21.027
why my value seems slightly
in the wrong direction.

56
00:05:21.027 --> 00:05:24.109
But as I do that,
I also wanna point out something,

57
00:05:24.109 --> 00:05:27.639
there's a lot of data coming
from here right now, right?

58
00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.582
One of the things you can do with some
of the options in here is you've got two

59
00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:36.214
other options you can give this, which is
frequency, which is how many milliseconds,

60
00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:38.130
how often should we read this?

61
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.529
So hypothetically, as I go to look
at what I need to change here,

62
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.567
If I change this to 500, you'll notice,

63
00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:56.458
The values are coming in at
a lot less rapid of a rate.

64
00:06:00.138 --> 00:06:05.204
And so we've got that, and then also,
I can also give it a threshold.

65
00:06:06.947 --> 00:06:09.599
And so I'm gonna go with 5,

66
00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:15.464
don't emit another change unless
it's changed more than 5.

67
00:06:15.464 --> 00:06:17.820
So if you're getting too much data,

68
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.988
you can kind of throttle it a little bit
between the frequency and the threshold.

69
00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:32.572
Right, we're pulling this in
a lot more infrequently, so

70
00:06:32.572 --> 00:06:36.948
it's going to find it every 200 or
also if it changes.

71
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:43.174
Right, but mine, theoretically, not the
worst thing in the world that's going in

72
00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:46.871
the wrong direction, but let me take
a look at it and see if I can triage it.

73
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:50.157
For everyone,
I had two adjustment circuits slightly,

74
00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:52.420
unclear where the operator error was.

75
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.050
It wasn't me staring when I wired it
up previously and making the diagram?

76
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.290
We don't know, and so
I had a suspicion when I was explaining,

77
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.610
I was like, something seems off.

78
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.462
And then faced with reality, it became
a lot clearer, which is power goes in,

79
00:07:07.462 --> 00:07:10.119
goes through the photoresistor, right?

80
00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:14.422
It's very much like
the potentiometer in a sense, right?

81
00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:18.795
Before we had the knob, now, we are just
in the same way with the button by

82
00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:20.967
stabilizing it with the resistor.

83
00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:25.132
But power goes in, a certain amount gets
through and what we read as the result,

84
00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:28.570
it's kinda like the middle pin
of the potentiometer basically.

85
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.161
So I did have to adjust this slightly to
kind of have the power, go directly into

86
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:37.754
the positive of the LED, and then I read
right before it goes to the ground, and

87
00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:40.170
that spiritually makes more sense.

88
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.622
So now if I go back,
we'll start that back up,

89
00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:52.355
And I've got,
other than the server starting up,

90
00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:57.310
some ambient light hand over,
it drops to almost nothing.

91
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.193
Let's do the ultimate scientific result
of grabbing my phone and turning on

92
00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:09.021
the flashlight, And watching it go up to
nearly 1,000, and pulling it back down.

93
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.456
I don't think there is a scale
on this one out of the box, so

94
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:21.042
we might have to write
a little bit of our own code.

95
00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:26.243
Let's see what the methods on a light are,

96
00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:31.156
so we'll say on change, I'm just gonna

97
00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:36.079
curious light., It does seem

98
00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:40.900
to know a lot what's going on here,
it just got everything involved here.

99
00:08:45.615 --> 00:08:52.375
So let's see, we'll say,
we're hovering around 50 normally, right,

100
00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:59.750
let's say that that is our medium,
and we'll say that 100 is, right?

101
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.819
So along those lines,
let's pull this into where we had,

102
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:11.638
This other code, and I guess,

103
00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:15.719
we're gonna get rid of letting
the potentiometer change.

104
00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:19.171
And we're gonna go with
the light in this case, but

105
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:21.591
we will steal this code right here.

106
00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:30.869
But not the potentiometer, let's
change this to ('light', and we'll do,

107
00:09:39.043 --> 00:09:45.186
In this case, we'll omit that as we
go through, we'll start with that and

108
00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:50.746
tweaking the grade exactly how we
want it is probably an exercise for

109
00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:55.837
the reader, because that's
just me being very particular.

110
00:09:55.837 --> 00:10:00.628
So say light, we've got the value
coming in, let's just go for

111
00:10:00.628 --> 00:10:06.323
it all the way, let's just live our best
lives and we'll do it live as I say.

112
00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.683
We got a collapse, and
we'll start back up again now.

113
00:10:28.332 --> 00:10:33.288
All right, So go back over,

114
00:10:33.288 --> 00:10:37.818
cover it up, a page gets dark,
take my hand off,

115
00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:41.475
it gets lighter, point my phone at it,

116
00:10:43.953 --> 00:10:47.680
We're all the way on, so
depending on the light in the room and,

117
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.444
yes, you could adjust those values
somewhere between 1024, or 1023 and

118
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:57.434
0, it's something a little bit more, light
goes on, light goes off, cover it up.

119
00:10:57.434 --> 00:11:02.983
Now, my web page is less about what
the user wants and more about what I want,

120
00:11:02.983 --> 00:11:06.994
cuz that doesn't have enough
in my day-to-day job.

121
00:11:06.994 --> 00:11:11.994
And so we've got this idea that
the sensor can now control things in

122
00:11:11.994 --> 00:11:15.393
the DOM based on everything
we have in place.

123
00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:17.923
There are some other sensors in here,
I will warn you,

124
00:11:17.923 --> 00:11:21.180
there's a temperature sensor,
there's a tilt sensor.

125
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.428
Do you know the difference between what
I just did with the light sensor is and

126
00:11:24.428 --> 00:11:27.330
what we would do with any
of those other sensors are?

127
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:27.830
Nothing.
