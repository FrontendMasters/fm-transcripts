WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:02.006
Right?
And so again,

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:07.554
kind of as the concluding
thoughts around a lot of this.

3
00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:11.880
There's a bunch of really basic primitives
that open up a lot of possibility, but

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.890
I think the most interesting
parts come not from, okay,

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.477
what can I just do with an Arduino board,
right?

6
00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:20.999
What can I, obviously we've used
the web browser before, right?

7
00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.054
But okay, cool.

8
00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:25.637
Can I take the web audio API and make
a keyboard with a bunch of buttons and

9
00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:28.229
make a musical instrument
out of an Arduino board?

10
00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.816
As it sends the web sockets and

11
00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:32.492
then triggers notes on the web audio API,
right?

12
00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:33.557
And make a whole bunch.

13
00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:37.731
Can I turn my browser into a hardware
synthesizer with an Arduino plugged in?

14
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:41.830
And theoretically, Johnny-5 is great,
and you should probably use that.

15
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.780
Theoretically, you could take
the node out of the equation,

16
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.900
just do it through here as the serial
bytes were coming through and

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.959
you could parse it and make an instrument.

18
00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:54.064
Could you take, as we saw before,
the get user media API and

19
00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:58.020
stream your face to have it
do all sorts of stuff, right?

20
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.532
Whatever it is, right,
control different things.

21
00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:04.537
The interesting part I think is taking
all the interesting browser APIs or

22
00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:06.742
Webhooks as we saw towards the very end.

23
00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:08.730
Any of those things and try to mix and

24
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.588
match all these technologies
do creative things.

25
00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.362
One of the examples in there
is p5.js which is processing,

26
00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:20.330
could you literally have art that
changes based on a temperature sensor?

27
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.038
What are all the interesting
parts between, again, and

28
00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:24.625
there's a lot of other sensors.

29
00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:25.921
I think I showed you before.

30
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:27.796
There's stuff like a soil sensor.

31
00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:31.566
Could you use the push notification API or
hook it up to Twilio or

32
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:35.642
something like that to text you
when your plant is thirsty, right?

33
00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:39.830
I think there's a bunch of really kind of
interesting pieces that are maybe not so

34
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.802
easy to do or
approachable with just an Arduino, right?

35
00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:46.987
Obviously, all of the node in JavaScript
you have is trapped inside of this like

36
00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:48.932
Internet box that you have, right?

37
00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:51.264
And so a way to get a lot of
these outside world things and

38
00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:54.077
be able to build really cool stuff and
be able to integrate those.

39
00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:55.885
I think that's where the fun part is.

40
00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:59.367
And my hope is that a week from now,
you'll be walking down the street, and

41
00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:01.410
you will come up with some cool idea.

42
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.390
And all the primitives are here,
and it's incredibly approachable.

43
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.489
So yeah, questions?

44
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.475
Yeah.

45
00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:16.453
&gt;&gt; In terms of accessing
user devices on the browser,

46
00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:22.262
what kind of security issues
should we be concerned about?

47
00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:27.353
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, so you get a bunch
in there from Chrome to begin with.

48
00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:31.720
So for instance, for
the Web Audio API, for the serial API,

49
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.810
it will now let you just like, okay, cool
and that script j.s or whatever, right?

50
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.647
There are a lot of times they have to take
some interaction with the page, right?

51
00:02:42.647 --> 00:02:45.460
To make the connection,
otherwise Chrome won't let you.

52
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.158
And it's one of those things,

53
00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:51.282
that's a moving target because a few
years ago that wasn't true, right?

54
00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:53.340
If you control the page,
it's obviously a lot easier.

55
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.909
Dustin.

56
00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just to follow up,
Maximiliano Firtman has a course

57
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.787
"Tour Web Capabilities" that covers the
serial API and a bunch of other of these.

58
00:03:00.787 --> 00:03:01.419
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

59
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.455
&gt;&gt; Edge case APIs and the security around
them, how you have to get permission and

60
00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:06.690
those kinds of things.

61
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.377
&gt;&gt; Yep, the nice part is in this case,
you are both sides of the user, right?

62
00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:14.213
These are mostly for
your kind of interesting projects.

63
00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:15.987
So it's you can choose,

64
00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:21.745
you have a little more flexibility cuz
it's you versus you versus a lot of these.

65
00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:24.658
I don't know that I would build full
production things on top of any of these

66
00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:27.031
things, especially Chromium
only kind of things, right?

67
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:31.326
But for your own interesting projects,
whether they be around the house or

68
00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:34.733
art projects, I think you get
a little bit more latitude and

69
00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:36.869
flexibility in those cases as well.

70
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:37.835
Yeah.

71
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.431
Awesome, thank you so much.

72
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:42.429
Yeah.

73
00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.470
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
