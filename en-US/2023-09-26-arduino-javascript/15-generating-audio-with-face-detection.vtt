1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.483
That's cool I guess.

2
00:00:02.483 --> 00:00:07.505
I think it would be cooler if
there was some way that we

3
00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:12.540
could control those
frequencies from the browser.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
Could I put a range input on a page and

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.926
could I slide it up and
down over and over?

6
00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:25.120
Would that be fun?

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.235
Yeah, I like that sound, that we've
whoops sound, reminds me of Theremin.

8
00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:40.570
I'm thinking we go into this directory
that I have which is called face-theremin.

9
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.945
And we go ahead and
we see what's happening in there.

10
00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:47.100
I don't know what could be in there.

11
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.139
We got some, I got this.

12
00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:52.280
We got to shrink down a little bit.

13
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.021
We've got a little bit of
code to write here, but

14
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:59.222
we need to start out by getting some data.

15
00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:04.350
At this point we're gonna,
I could do a range slider.

16
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.823
A range slider makes sense.

17
00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:10.629
Let's actually see what I've got
going on in this directory and

18
00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:13.270
see what we can use that for.

19
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.685
So I'm just gonna do, node index.js.

20
00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.500
And let's just take a look at
the client-side code that we have.

21
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.323
We'll look at the DOM,
then we'll look at the client-side code.

22
00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:34.585
I will grab that, I'm already there.

23
00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:41.866
Let's see, Make that normal-sized,
I hit this play button over here,

24
00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:48.972
Looks like I've got some
face tracking software.

25
00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:53.570
Looks like it's keeping track of the X and
Y of where my face is.

26
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.919
It also, for other fun things, like I have
it also tracking your facial expressions,

27
00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.529
so fun project you can do that
we're not gonna do, I mean.

28
00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:06.428
I'm not gonna say we're not gonna do it,
but you could theoretically have a bunch

29
00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:09.141
of LEDs that change based on
your facial expression, and

30
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.650
you could control the Arduino
board with your face.

31
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.929
I might make the LED light up if I'm
smiling or angry, we'll see how I feel.

32
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.973
But first, I'd like to take the X and
the Y on my face here, and

33
00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:27.760
I think we have a frequency, and
I heard some whooshing sounds.

34
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.316
What if we could tie all this together?

35
00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:36.596
What if, as I move my face, we sent some
instructions to the Arduino board and

36
00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:41.418
could theoretically change
the tone of the piezo?

37
00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:42.678
Let's try it out.

38
00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:45.250
Pause that for a second.

39
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.821
All right, so
we've got some client-side code.

40
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:52.415
We've got some server-side code.

41
00:02:54.343 --> 00:02:59.100
Right now the most things we need to get
those movement events from the browser.

42
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.717
And we need to send them
back to the board, right?

43
00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:05.090
So let's go ahead and
go into the client-side code here.

44
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.225
Now there's a lot of code in here,
but that's mostly as I'm pulling

45
00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:15.456
in the faceapi.js library
that's doing the face tracking.

46
00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:20.046
So don't concern yourself too
much with that, it is waiting for

47
00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:25.800
a socket connection, which we need
to just wire up on the server-side.

48
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.977
But if we scroll down a little bit.

49
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.510
Really what we want to do is,
as I move in,

50
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.264
you can see I'm changing the DOM with
the X and Y of where my face is, right.

51
00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:43.313
I also wanted to send it back
to node of the face has moved,

52
00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:45.260
here is where the face is.

53
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:55.220
So, we'll go ahead and we're just gonna say,
Well, don't ruin it for me, autocomplete.

54
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.820
socket.emit.

55
00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:03.214
Face, and the facePosition, sure.

56
00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:09.607
And so now as the face moves, we ideally
seek to send that over the WebSocket

57
00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:15.710
back over to our node server,
where we will be ready and waiting for it.

58
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.599
And so we'll go back over into,

59
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.433
That, and we're just gonna say,

60
00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:33.994
we've got to grab the piezo too,
I guess, right?

61
00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:38.838
So we got the board, so
we'll say const piezo,

62
00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:44.153
new five.piezo(6), and we'll say,

63
00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:50.200
When we get a new connection,
when we hear from that socket,

64
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.638
we're gonna say, We want face.

65
00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:59.024
Socket on face and then really,
we've got the data,

66
00:04:59.024 --> 00:05:01.667
you can care about the X or the Y.

67
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:08.555
It's up to you, it's your face theremin,
you do what you want with it.

68
00:05:08.555 --> 00:05:09.831
It's your face, right?

69
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:14.084
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do with your face.

70
00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.976
I'm gonna care about
the X in this case.

71
00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:20.505
Well, what the copilot thought I wanted?

72
00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:22.540
I might explore that in a second.

73
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.543
So, we've got the x in there and
we say if x is

74
00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:33.333
greater than 0, we'll go ahead and say,

75
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:40.551
You might have to adjust this
to tones that you prefer.

76
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:44.742
We'll do it for just 100 milliseconds.

77
00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:50.287
But it's gonna keep getting data so
it's totally fine.

78
00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:52.300
Yeah, so let's try that out.

79
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.560
And so now, as the face comes in,
the server should be receiving that.

80
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.620
And it should be talking to
that piezo that it knows about.

81
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.130
So let's spin that up.

82
00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:11.904
We're gonne hit play.

83
00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:14.573
[SOUND].

84
00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:18.947
Dustin, I don't

85
00:06:18.947 --> 00:06:24.198
even know how you're

86
00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:29.157
gonna handle this,

87
00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:33.250
the recording.

88
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.561
[SOUND]
