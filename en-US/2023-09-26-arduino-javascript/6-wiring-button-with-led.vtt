00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.307
And with that,
it is fun to make a LED fade in and

2
00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:09.166
fade out and blink, and
yes, let's be very clear,

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:13.373
could probably amuse us all for
a solid hour.

4
00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:17.913
I'm thinking what we're gonna do next
is add in some interaction, right now,

5
00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:19.762
with the computer to the board.

6
00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.265
It's time to go the other direction,

7
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:26.646
which is taking at least a very first
amount of the outside world and

8
00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:31.281
bringing it in, which is we're gonna
start out with a button, cool.

9
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.675
All right, so
let's talk about this circle a little bit.

10
00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:36.603
And then we will talk
about what's happening.

11
00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:39.947
So you look at this one is
one of the ones that spans

12
00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:44.362
that little chasm there which is
we start by sending five volts.

13
00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.585
If you look over at
the bottom of that diagram,

14
00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:48.930
we start by sending five
volts out to the button.

15
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.933
Now again, it might go into the rail or
something along those lines as well.

16
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:58.463
And then it goes to the button,
which the button now will,

17
00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:02.170
it's kind of like a choose
your own adventure.

18
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.081
The button either will
send it to the ground and

19
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:10.310
nothing will make it back
to the pin we're using.

20
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.575
Or when you press the button,
it connects that yellow wire up top.

21
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:19.454
All right, which will then actually
send voltage back to the board.

22
00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:23.260
So either the board is going to get
nothing cuz it's a closed loop, or

23
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.068
it's gonna get the five volts that
is sent back and receive it again,

24
00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:28.333
which is how it knows.

25
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.553
Did they push the button?

26
00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:31.482
Did they not push the button?

27
00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:33.573
Right so I'm going to wire
that up a little bit as well.

28
00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:41.787
For the moment of truth,

29
00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:46.720
did I wire mine up correctly
before we get too invested, Mark?

30
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.252
&gt;&gt; The way Steve connected his wires
looks different than the diagram.

31
00:01:50.252 --> 00:01:52.177
I don't see the black wire on the right.

32
00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:54.030
Does that not make a difference?

33
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.150
&gt;&gt; So yeah,
I can either kind of go cuz again,

34
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.375
the resistors are also effectively wires.

35
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:04.264
So I can go over in here and

36
00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:09.275
then do another bridge as well.

37
00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:10.618
That is the same.

38
00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:13.327
Let me look for another little guy.

39
00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:18.462
That is the same as going in there
it's also in the diagrams it's

40
00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:24.070
hard to like I can't like do the same
things I can do with bending wire so

41
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.233
we can also do this as well for
ideally the same effect should look

42
00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:42.328
Now we're off by one.

43
00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:50.402
That should give you the same effect.

44
00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.516
Assume I've got everything lined up.

45
00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:52.258
Yep.

46
00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.833
As long as this circuit itself
makes it to ground, we're good.

47
00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.658
All right,
let's find out if I messed anything up.

48
00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:06.500
You can move to a different like,
there's also a folder called buttons.

49
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.181
I can also write it in
the same file as well.

50
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:10.221
It doesn't matter.

51
00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:14.607
I mostly did this for when you see that
when I load in the completed ones.

52
00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:15.947
I'm gonna write the code here.

53
00:03:15.947 --> 00:03:18.251
We'll have it in the button directory.

54
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.887
So in this case, I've got my LED.

55
00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:23.913
It is still currently plugged
into 11 cuz I did not move it.

56
00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:27.454
But now we have this idea of a button,
right?

57
00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:32.138
And so
this should be strangers to no one we do

58
00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:37.083
const button is new five
LED button two right.

59
00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:42.163
Cuz I pin if again if you did not plug
into two you plugged into a different

60
00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:47.682
pin guess what the change to the code is
you change number two to whatever pin.

61
00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:48.881
You plugged it into.

62
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.044
I'm gonna get rid of that pulse code for
a second.

63
00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:56.403
We're gonna say, we'll go with this,
we'll go to button.onPress.

64
00:04:00.404 --> 00:04:02.113
We'll just start there.

65
00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:05.791
I'm also validating that I
wired mine up correctly,

66
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:09.885
which if I didn't we will fix,
but I would like to find out.

67
00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:12.652
Sooner than later.

68
00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:17.076
So again kind of looking real
quick we pull in I'm not using

69
00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:22.133
the elite I mean the LED is still
being loaded into there Johnny 5,

70
00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:24.776
I will do stuff with it in a second.

71
00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:31.061
But for the most part, I am mostly seeing,
did the button get pressed?

72
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:36.002
And that is my kind of validation
that I wired this up correctly.

73
00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:39.752
Button press, button press,
button press oddly satisfying.

74
00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:42.939
It's like the first time I ever
made an Ajax call and jQuery and

75
00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.404
saw something changed in
the dom based on that.

76
00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.688
Made me shockingly happy.

77
00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:52.648
So we've got that in place.

78
00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:57.269
The interesting thing to do would
be to blend the two things that we

79
00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:58.790
have done together.

80
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.812
Before we do that, again, I wanna just
pull up the button docs real quick

81
00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:10.663
And you can see that there are again,
different methods and events here.

82
00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:12.394
Use the down value.

83
00:05:12.394 --> 00:05:16.587
The other thing to look at is
there's a few there's press release.

84
00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:19.448
They do what you think they do.

85
00:05:19.448 --> 00:05:24.631
They have other friends known as up and
down, does anyone want

86
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:30.625
to venture guess what up and down mean
in relation to press and release?

87
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.505
You push the button down,
the button goes up, right?

88
00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:39.203
And so i can swap out this code for
up or down rather.

89
00:05:39.203 --> 00:05:40.080
So let's see.

90
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.983
Here we say button down.

91
00:05:42.983 --> 00:05:47.105
Button on up,

92
00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:53.947
button up, Right?

93
00:05:53.947 --> 00:05:56.078
I'm gonna load that code in instead

94
00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:08.522
Button down, button up,
button down, button up.
