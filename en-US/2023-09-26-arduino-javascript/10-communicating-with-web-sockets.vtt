WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:02.896
I'm not gonna say
the circle is complete yet,

2
00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:05.446
because I still want to
be able to push stuff.

3
00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:10.981
Holding down the button and
refreshing the page is fine.

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.525
I think what I would rather do
is now press the button and

5
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:16.923
watch something change on the page.

6
00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:22.236
I think that is gonna give me the warm
emphasis in a deeper and nicer way.

7
00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:26.151
So, going into that, and
again, the for a lot of these,

8
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:31.301
the only difference in those folders,
is a slightly different HTML file.

9
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:33.122
[LAUGH] All right?

10
00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.656
Or some setup, right?

11
00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:39.059
So we've got that, we are going into
this button and sockets over here

12
00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.178
Cd../button with sockets.

13
00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:52.339
Nope, and sockets.

14
00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.845
Cool.

15
00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:58.344
If we go into this directory, again,
the major difference here is a slightly

16
00:00:58.344 --> 00:01:02.982
different HTML file where I'm going to
now be able to just show live, whether or

17
00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:05.290
not the button has been pressed or not.

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.792
That is the large difference in this
case between that and the previous file.

19
00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:15.714
So we'll kind of bring this all together
cuz now once we have the ability

20
00:01:15.714 --> 00:01:19.979
to go in both directions,
we can start to have some real fun and

21
00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.458
who doesn't like to have real fun?

22
00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:27.093
I mean, if anyone has anti real
fun like please let me know now,

23
00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:29.726
I think that's an important note.

24
00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:34.370
Only new things in here that
nobody wanted to watch me type

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.545
where some of you have
probably experienced that.

26
00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:42.247
One time, you could just send post
requests to Express and everything worked.

27
00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:46.471
And then another time, they decided to
take out the ability to parse a JSON body

28
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:50.132
and put it into its own library and
made you add it back in every time.

29
00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:52.729
So, I've got that in here.

30
00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.370
Other than that, it's just a create board.

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.934
And then we've also set up Socket.io.

32
00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:01.445
For those of you not familiar,
Socket.io is a super great WebSocket

33
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:06.214
library that basically, again,
makes working with WebSockets easy.

34
00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:11.202
So we're just kind of taking, and this is
one of the reasons why I like doing a lot

35
00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:16.507
of this stuff with Node, because you do
get the entire power NPM ecosystem, right?

36
00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:20.427
One, also like as a JavaScript developer,
I can write JavaScript faster in C++.

37
00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:20.960
And two,

38
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.028
the idea that I can pull in all of these
libraries that are kind of custom,

39
00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:29.516
bespokely built for creating really cool
web things and tie them all together.

40
00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:34.989
And then adding in a lot of this
hardware stuff as the PC resistance,

41
00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.973
if you will, to put it all together.

42
00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.676
A lot of this is just the boilerplate for
me,

43
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:44.185
right now other than creating and
waiting for the board,

44
00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:48.295
all of this is very much just
boilerplate Express and Socket.IO.

45
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:53.467
And to be clear, for this part,
I have to look it up every single time.

46
00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:57.633
So I just didn't want to so
here it is kind of done for us,

47
00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.925
because I can't handle that kind of stuff.

48
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:03.643
Cool.
So right now if I look at my board,

49
00:03:03.643 --> 00:03:08.156
I've got a button wired up at two and
I've got that LED at 11.

50
00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:12.700
So we're gonna kind of start with that
as our kind of like basis in this case.

51
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.282
I don't have a lot that I need
to do with the LED just yet.

52
00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:18.579
Let's start with that
button that we had before.

53
00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.670
So the button is gonna be a new five
button that is gonna be a tube and

54
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.985
we've got that in place now,

55
00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:30.892
we don't necessarily care that
is pressed what we wanna do is,

56
00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:35.455
so it's not gonna do we know
when a browser connects to us.

57
00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:38.555
And so we're gonna need that.

58
00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:41.289
I could make another one
of those wait events, but

59
00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.532
we wanna make sure that we've got
the socket connection at all for starters.

60
00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:49.791
So I'm gonna just do
this io.on connection.

61
00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:52.092
And before we worry too
much about the button,

62
00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:56.223
we're just gonna make sure that we've got
our web sockets hooked up appropriately

63
00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:57.832
because it would be really sad.

64
00:03:57.832 --> 00:04:01.428
If we went through working with
the Johnny-five stuff for the button, and

65
00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:04.579
then we found out that I messed up
just the basic web socket stuff.

66
00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.090
So let's doll out our like happy
dopamine hits one at a time here.

67
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.028
And so, that's not the appropriate emoji.

68
00:04:13.028 --> 00:04:14.358
Hold on.

69
00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:17.942
Where is it?

70
00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:22.006
There we go, a plug when we have
a socket connection established and

71
00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:25.947
then we'll just kind of on a disconnect,
we'll send that back.

72
00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:27.909
I don't even care about that right now.

73
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.882
So the socket is going to be
the individual browser that is connected

74
00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:35.685
to our WebSocket server in this case.

75
00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:39.586
And this point, we're just simply gonna
make sure that we've got that connection

76
00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:43.206
which at first we will not see because we
have not written any of the client side

77
00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:44.111
code yet, right?

78
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:50.152
So we will need that but this will get the
server piece in place first and foremost.

79
00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:54.827
So we're gonna go ahead and
have that client right now we've just got

80
00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:58.945
that button state is a span that
should be the words on or off.

81
00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:03.084
So we'll get that in place as well.

82
00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:07.282
And so we've got this button state.

83
00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:10.351
Let's go ahead and
just figure out whether or

84
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.481
not we've got something set up and
ready to go at this point.

85
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.401
So same kind of basic idea,

86
00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:21.416
which is Socket.IO has both the client
side and a server side library.

87
00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:24.583
So we can pull in IO from,
it's slightly different than Socket.IO.

88
00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:27.186
At this point it is, yeah.

89
00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:28.636
Which one do you think it is?

90
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:31.672
Wanna take a lucky guess
which one goes on the client?

91
00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:32.589
That's right.

92
00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.127
[LAUGH] I'm gonna just
take the smiling and

93
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.979
nodding to assume that
it was the client one.

94
00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.674
And then we just get an instance of that.

95
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.313
Very similar to what we did on the server,
but

96
00:05:44.313 --> 00:05:47.095
this will just give us
that socket connection.

97
00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:51.824
And we'll say socket.on connect.

98
00:05:51.824 --> 00:05:56.439
Let's see if I can spell
right socket.on connect.

99
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.032
Let's go ahead and just say

100
00:06:07.474 --> 00:06:09.565
Set up on the client side.

101
00:06:09.565 --> 00:06:13.253
And this should hopefully
just make sure that

102
00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:17.631
we've got everything in
place in either direction.

103
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:21.751
All right, so what I shouldn't be able
to do now is I pull up my terminal,

104
00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:23.790
I'm just gonna do node index.js.

105
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.706
So nothing special happening in here.

106
00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:27.938
Unless I have a giant error message.

107
00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:30.952
The board starts up.

108
00:06:30.952 --> 00:06:34.461
Server starts,
I'm gonna go grab it in Chrome.

109
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.178
The button is currently off.

110
00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:41.263
If I press the button,

111
00:06:41.263 --> 00:06:44.242
it will stay off because there is
no code to update that at all.

112
00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:47.860
So ideally, when the button is happening,
rather than before we were going and

113
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.208
hitting a request and that was telling
us whether the button was on or off,

114
00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:54.360
right now, I wanna press that button
I wanna see the webpage change.

115
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.622
I don't wanna ask if the button is there.

116
00:06:56.622 --> 00:06:57.947
I just wanna press the button.

117
00:06:57.947 --> 00:06:59.819
And I wanna see, right?

118
00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.779
And so we kind of have to take a bunch of
the stuff that we've done previously and

119
00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:04.864
tie it all together.

120
00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:10.562
So we'll go back in server and
say, all right when the button

121
00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:15.365
is pressed,
we're gonna wanna do is send a message

122
00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:20.187
to a given socket that we
are ready to rock and roll.

123
00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:24.923
So we'll say when we've got the socket,
we'll say the reason I've

124
00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:29.348
got two socket connections is
because Safari is still running.

125
00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:33.726
So button on, on down.

126
00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:34.840
So I can emit button down.

127
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.043
I like it, yeah.

128
00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:44.638
And then button on up.

129
00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:49.689
Well, we'll say that the button went up,
so basically, the server will now listen

130
00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:54.695
to Johnny Five for those events on whether
or not the button is being pressed or not.

131
00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:56.460
And it's going to send
a message to any and

132
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.945
all connected browsers that
the button is pressed or not.

133
00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:03.833
So if I could have a ton of windows open,
they would all receive the message.

134
00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:05.485
They don't do anything
with that message yet.

135
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:09.327
But then they can theoretically
all see the DOM together.

136
00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:10.133
So we'll have that in place.

137
00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:12.237
So here we're just saying
when the button goes down,

138
00:08:12.237 --> 00:08:13.556
admit that the button went down.

139
00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:19.228
And when the button comes back up
we'll admit that the button went up.

140
00:08:19.228 --> 00:08:24.093
Actually, if I wanted to buttons
currently off, I like up and down more so

141
00:08:24.093 --> 00:08:28.802
we'll probably change this cuz I'm
gonna make some like very pedantic

142
00:08:28.802 --> 00:08:31.249
decisions in the heat of the moment.

143
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:36.893
So now in that client code, we can
listen for those two things as well.

144
00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:38.705
So we've got that connection here.

145
00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:44.595
And we're just gonna say
socket on any message.

146
00:08:44.595 --> 00:08:47.695
We have different channels and messages,
we don't really care that much.

147
00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:52.516
Whenever we get a message from the server,
let's start out by just console,

148
00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:53.936
logging the message.

149
00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:56.120
We'll build up from there.

150
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.701
So ideally, I don't know if I
have to kill the server or not.

151
00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:01.056
We'll find out together.

152
00:09:01.056 --> 00:09:02.309
Yep, I will actually want that.

153
00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:09.193
Let's park it in digitalized bottom right.

154
00:09:09.193 --> 00:09:10.713
Cool, we're set up on the client side.

155
00:09:13.112 --> 00:09:16.115
I might have to kill that server because I
think I changed the server code as well,

156
00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:16.830
so we'll do that.

157
00:09:24.193 --> 00:09:25.703
Awesome.

158
00:09:28.841 --> 00:09:31.920
Nope, I guess nothing just yet,
so let's check it out.

159
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.011
What we've got going on.

160
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:39.723
&gt;&gt; I have it listening to button and
then it is doing it on the client side.

161
00:09:39.723 --> 00:09:42.194
So instead of message,
I just switch that to button.

162
00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:44.285
And it started getting
the button messages.

163
00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.037
&gt;&gt; On the button channel, or?

164
00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:50.749
&gt;&gt; So it admits button.

165
00:09:50.749 --> 00:09:54.113
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I'm sitting on the button
channel, and so instead of just

166
00:09:54.113 --> 00:09:58.304
admitting it or sending it, I actually put
it on the button channel, you're right.

167
00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.702
So this one right here?

168
00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:04.051
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

169
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:08.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, silly,
let's go back to my console log.

170
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.158
There it is.

171
00:10:10.158 --> 00:10:15.173
Silly typing, this is why you should
pair program with like six of your

172
00:10:15.173 --> 00:10:19.933
friends simultaneously because as
you were talking and coding and

173
00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:25.381
you make silly boo boos you have friends
that will catch you and help you out.

174
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:29.815
Okay, so now we just need to
basically tie it all together,

175
00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:34.885
which is to say, instead of logging
into the console, we'll say,

176
00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.612
We'll just change that.

177
00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:50.070
Let's not totally [LAUGH] make our
lives worse than they need to be.

178
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.359
All right, moment of truth.

179
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.222
I can press the button as it goes up and
down, the website changes.

180
00:10:57.222 --> 00:11:01.783
So now the Arduino go all the way
through node all the way to my browser.

181
00:11:01.783 --> 00:11:04.558
So now we've got a bunch
of different sensors.

182
00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:09.911
Like I said before, the Arduino starter
kit comes with temperature sensors,

183
00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:13.480
light sensors, a tilt sensor,
which is exercise,

184
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.592
sometimes in frustration, but
like it's there, a bunch of these sensors

185
00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:23.564
that can now theoretically emit the stuff
that we can see in the browser.

186
00:11:23.564 --> 00:11:27.269
And from the browser,
we can go all the way to the board, right?

187
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.360
So now we've got the entire power
of the web and all of its API's.

188
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:38.813
And we've got the ability to do to do
stuff from the other direction as well.
