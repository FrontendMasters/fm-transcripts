1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.780
Let's talk a little bit about sensors.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.729
We've got basically kind of two major
things we've played around with so far.

3
00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.390
And like a lot of things, we're gonna
do fall into one or two classes,

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.052
sensors and actuators.

5
00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:17.384
The button I guess is
technically a sensor.

6
00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.945
But sensors are outside world in,
right, get stuff and

7
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.780
kinda pull it into our world.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.080
Actuators are things
that from the board out.

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.230
So the LED, we control the LED, the button
more told us what were happening.

10
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.822
So with sensors, we've got a whole bunch
of different options available to us.

11
00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:40.932
Like I said before,
in the kit that you have, there is, well,

12
00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:46.847
there's potentiometers, which are knobs,
right, that you can turn, those are cool.

13
00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:52.663
And really, a lot of the other sensors
are a version of turning a knob, right?

14
00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:55.976
The potentiometer is simply something
you can turn all the way down.

15
00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:58.993
No, in the same way the button is
either on or off, so it's digital.

16
00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:02.833
Potentiometer, a lot of these sensors
are the analog versions of that, right?

17
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:07.440
And so they're either turned all
the way on or turned all the way off.

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.790
And how much voltage makes through
is how much happens, right?

19
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.469
And so zero to one for the digital.

20
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.347
Voltage, it's trickier
cuz it's like how much?

21
00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:21.430
The Arduino does it at 10-bit resolution.

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.110
You're like, what does that mean?

23
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.106
That just means 0 to 1023,
also known as 1024 values, right?

24
00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:30.600
And so we'll break it down
to somewhere in between.

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.440
So at any given point, you can get a sense
of how much room you have along there.

26
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.259
And so basically, any of these sensors
send some amount to the ground and

27
00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.887
some amount back to the board
by turning the knob,

28
00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:44.340
which maybe we'll do that one first,
right?

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.059
We'll have that in place, and
then once we've got that basic idea and

30
00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:52.040
setup in place, we'll grab a sensor
that speaks to us and we'll use it.

31
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.755
There's one slight deviation for
this diagram,

32
00:01:55.755 --> 00:02:00.802
mostly because there are only so
many potentiometers in Fritzing.

33
00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:05.806
But yours, if you look,
it's split on two sides, right?

34
00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:10.137
And so the three here are all three of
them on the same side, ours are two,

35
00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:15.040
the two ground and hot, and then the one
that we're gonna read from in the middle.

36
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.109
It doesn't actually change the diagram,

37
00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.423
it's just they look like they're all three
in a line, yours look split up, it's okay.

38
00:02:21.423 --> 00:02:24.945
It's the same theoretically in so
far that the rows are the same,

39
00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:28.598
nothing really changes,
unless you go over, you bridge that gap,

40
00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:30.923
you just gotta wire it
from the other side.

41
00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:35.140
But it is the same, it's just that
one wasn't inside the software.

42
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.080
So I picked the next best one.

43
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.537
I'm not gonna unwire anything of mine.

44
00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:42.694
I'm just gonna keep adding
to this until I regret it.

45
00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:45.529
So I'm gonna keep everything here.

46
00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.149
Someone asked what's the assembly?

47
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.363
You take thing and you shove it in there.

48
00:02:50.363 --> 00:02:53.702
And now it should turn,
look mostly like that, except for

49
00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:58.440
the fact that one of the pins is
slightly different than the other two.

50
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.344
And so if you look at this,
there's three pins.

51
00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:03.435
And the red and the black,

52
00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:09.680
the red is going to the 5 volt on
the other side where we've got the power.

53
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.760
The black is the ground.

54
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.673
So if you look at it,
power goes in one side and

55
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:17.380
the full circuit kind of goes
to ground on the other side.

56
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.113
It's that middle part, which is how
much is not going to ground, right?

57
00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:23.714
And that is the part we're
gonna read from, and

58
00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:26.393
then we should be able to
kind of see that as well.

59
00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:31.014
So what we can do now is
I've got a little bit of,

60
00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:36.644
Again, I'm bridging from the other side

61
00:03:36.644 --> 00:03:41.478
just cuz it's already hard to see
from this angle for me to begin with.

62
00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:46.360
And so that yellow one is gonna go any
of those analog ports A0 through what

63
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.550
have you,
whichever one makes you happiest.

64
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.260
I'm gonna use A0 for now because that is
easiest for me to find from this angle.

65
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.052
And then at that point, really,

66
00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:03.319
we just have the power going to and
from the boards.

67
00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.221
I'm gonna actually use slightly
smaller ones in this case.

68
00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:15.368
So whether or not, cuz we got the five,
actually, let's see,

69
00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:19.984
we've got, The power going.

70
00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:22.916
Let's actually put the power.

71
00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:27.158
If you're not using the button, you can
literally just take that same power cord,

72
00:04:27.158 --> 00:04:30.567
but if you wanna share it,
I'm gonna put it in that plus sign rail.

73
00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:35.449
But as long as you got power going from
that 5 volt to your potentiometer,

74
00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.805
you should be good.

75
00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:42.219
As I both stay out of the way the camera,

76
00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.516
also try to get in the right
hole simultaneously.

77
00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:55.522
&gt;&gt; So the signal is the yellow wire?

78
00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:56.173
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And

79
00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:58.944
that's the middle prong on the thing?

80
00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:02.068
&gt;&gt; Yes, yours just happens
to be on the other side, but

81
00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:04.270
it's the same circuit regardless.

82
00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:11.233
And because those pins line up,
the columns on the breadboard

83
00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:15.975
doesn't really matter if it just
looks slightly different, that's why.

84
00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:34.780
All right, so I should have that all
in place now, famous last words.

85
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.769
With the wiring, the feedback loop is
not as [LAUGH] quick as we might want.

86
00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:45.712
So we've got to wire it up, and
then I'm gonna just plug this back in.

87
00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:50.110
And think about some of the code.

88
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.140
Like I said before, for
almost everything, there is a folder in

89
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.208
the public directory diagrams for
almost all combinations of what we may do.

90
00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:05.881
Or all combinations I could predict that
I was going to do in advance of this,

91
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:10.055
depending on how our spirit moves us and
the questions that you ask.

92
00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:14.475
I have done this enough times in my life
to know that somebody's going to ask me

93
00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:15.680
a question.

94
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.811
Or we will go on some thought
exercise that might deviate slightly.

95
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:24.897
But for the most part, and I tried
to predict all of those in advance.

96
00:06:24.897 --> 00:06:26.364
We'll see how my prediction skills went.

97
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:35.842
Okay, so now, again, that diagram,

98
00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:40.790
I can put it back up, but
it's also in that directory.

99
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.550
Before I talk too much,
I do want to get some of the initial

100
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.474
dopamine of whether or
not I did anything right.

101
00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:53.505
That seems really dark.

102
00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:59.191
I do lots of things right [LAUGH] whether
or not I did this in particular, right?

103
00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:01.718
I'm just gonna keep in the same file.

104
00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:05.779
The other is a web server in here,
everything's fine.

105
00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:06.420
In fact,

106
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.240
I'm already set up to send sockets to
the browser if I really wanted to.

107
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.012
So let's keep this code.

108
00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:15.062
Let's not switch directories.

109
00:07:15.062 --> 00:07:18.970
There is a folder for
just a potentiometer as well.

110
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.498
Again, there's way more than we ever
intend on doing in our workshop together,

111
00:07:23.498 --> 00:07:27.427
but they are ways for you to kind of
extend and play around with stuff and

112
00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:31.170
have fun after the workshop or
with other things that come to mind.

113
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:39.560
So for here, we've got the potentiometer,
which I plugged into A0.

114
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.952
That's analog 0.

115
00:07:41.952 --> 00:07:43.350
Again, it doesn't really matter.

116
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.660
There's A0 through what, 6, 5?

117
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.588
A0 through 5, right?

118
00:07:47.588 --> 00:07:48.975
There are six of them, but

119
00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:52.520
we zero index everything in computers
cuz why make anything easy.

120
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.481
Except CSS, which is one indexed
just to throw you off, right?

121
00:07:57.481 --> 00:08:00.470
And I did a workshop on Scratch yesterday
where everything's one indexed, too.

122
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.900
So now I live in chaos.

123
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.626
So we've got the potentiometer in this
case that is rocking and rolling.

124
00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:16.320
And let's start out with
potentiometer.on change,

125
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.536
and we should get the value in that case.

126
00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:23.750
Let me just quickly refresh myself.

127
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.990
And so we get that on.

128
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.836
Anytime it changes, we wanna know.

129
00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:29.117
And actually,
I don't really particularly care.

130
00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:32.710
And we'll talk about some of
the other things in a second.

131
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:38.922
Let's just do, it's already trying
to give me the console log.

132
00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:40.544
Let's do potentiometer.

133
00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:49.285
Just if you use the regular people
functions, not the fancy ones

134
00:08:49.285 --> 00:08:55.182
that I'm used to using all the time,
you can use this.value in this case.

135
00:08:55.182 --> 00:09:00.274
But arrow functions
are better in a lot of ways,

136
00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:03.341
except in this one use case.

137
00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:05.123
So you type potentiometer.

138
00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:09.668
If you use a regular function declaration,
you can just type this.

139
00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:14.097
But generally speaking, I'm gonna do
this cuz it makes me happier, and

140
00:09:14.097 --> 00:09:15.486
I deserve to be happy.

141
00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:20.304
Cool, so right now,
I'm just gonna switch over to my console

142
00:09:20.304 --> 00:09:24.394
because it's got the bigger font,
and now it does.

143
00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:28.149
Source, this one was in button and
sockets.

144
00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:32.592
There's also a space you can do
this just for a potentiometer.

145
00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:34.517
But for those of us following along live,

146
00:09:34.517 --> 00:09:36.721
it feels rude to keep
switching folders on you.

147
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:40.310
And so I'm gonna do node index.

148
00:09:45.286 --> 00:09:46.279
And we're not doing it from there.

149
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.363
We're gonna do it in here.

150
00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:02.841
All right, so now, as this changes,

151
00:10:07.843 --> 00:10:12.746
I can turn it all the way down to 0,
I can turn it all the way up to 1023.

152
00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:18.659
I can turn it all the way down to 0,
I can turn it all the way up to 1023.
