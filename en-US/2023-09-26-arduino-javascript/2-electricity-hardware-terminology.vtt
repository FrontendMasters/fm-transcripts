1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.830
All right, with that,

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.806
let's talk about just enough
electronics to make you dangerous,

3
00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:10.290
which is literally the bare minimum of
this cuz you do not need a ton of this.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.850
You just need to know a few concepts
that will help us out along the way.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.128
So this is my very helpful diagram
to help explain Ohms law to you,

6
00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:24.450
which is basically, we have three
major concepts that we care about.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.360
Voltage, the euphemism.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.445
If you look up how do I explain Ohms
law's is I use water in a hose,

9
00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:35.640
which I feel is somewhat inappropriate for
electricity and somewhat rude.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.210
So I chose to just modify it a little bit
which is how much pressure do you have?

11
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.490
How much voltage you starting out with, if
you have a lot, you have a little, cool.

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.990
There's a lot coming in there, right?

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.250
The current is, how wide is the tube?

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.360
As you know they're in a series of
tubes that cats run through, right?

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.540
So how many cats do you have?

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.164
That's the voltage, right?

17
00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:01.429
How wide is the Internet tube in which
the cat memes can go through it and

18
00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.260
then anything that constricts
that is the resistance, right?

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.383
So you could have a lot of
cat memes running through and

20
00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:13.758
then all of a sudden you have maybe
something limiting the Wi Fi then there is

21
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:15.880
less cat memes going through.

22
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.060
In a lot of cases like most of
the Arduino pins create 5 volts.

23
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.350
All those digital pins, they send 5 volts,
they don't send 5 volts.

24
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.080
The 5 volt pin,
spoiler alert, sends 5 volts.

25
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.440
The 3.3 volt pin, which we will not
use today, sends 3.3 volts, right?

26
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.550
Sometimes, that is enough
to cause trouble, right?

27
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.228
So sometimes we will use a resistor
to kind of limit that a little bit.

28
00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:52.354
The LED that we're gonna plug in in
a second, could you send 5 volts to it?

29
00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:54.465
I can confirm that you can.

30
00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:55.775
Should you?

31
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.770
You should not, right?

32
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.742
And one of my goals today with this
workshop is I obviously hope you

33
00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:03.660
learn a bunch of stuff you get
a lot of value out of this.

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.154
If I do not set this place on fire, we're
gonna count that as a total win, right?

35
00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.310
So for some of this stuff,

36
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.297
we will be responsible that we will
use the resistors when appropriate.

37
00:02:16.297 --> 00:02:20.520
I will tell you at one point in particular
when we get to the temperature sensor,

38
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.813
if you smell plastic burning,
just unplug the thing please.

39
00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:28.323
[LAUGH] All right, there are one or
two pieces that if you put them in

40
00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:32.350
backwards and then you smell
a funny smell just unplug it.

41
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.147
[LAUGH] I say this from experience.

42
00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:41.222
So just already don't
assume everything is fine.

43
00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:45.009
When in doubt unplug it and
we will deal with it from there.

44
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.630
But I think that amount
kind of starts us out.

45
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.207
And then we've got, where this also
becomes important is we've got polarized

46
00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:55.690
and non-polarized components.

47
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.460
Now, I assume that most of you
have used a battery before, right?

48
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.259
And in those cases, we know that there
is a right way to put in a battery that

49
00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.900
works, and a wrong way to put in
a battery that doesn't work, right?

50
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.190
And for most appliance,
we have to put it in twice.

51
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.390
It's kind of like a USB cord, right?

52
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.950
You got to try both sides before
you realize which one works.

53
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.420
Some things we're going to use
a polarized, which are the LEDs.

54
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.202
We're not gonna use a battery, but

55
00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:24.775
some things matter the order that
they go in, the temperature sensor.

56
00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:27.128
Some things do not matter,
right, like a button,

57
00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:28.949
something along those lines, right?

58
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.227
And so in some cases it matters.

59
00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:35.090
In other cases, it does not matter.

60
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.968
I could run through a whole bunch
of electronics terms that will

61
00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.830
maybe one day become useful for you.

62
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.877
But in this case, understanding that for
the most part, we've got a bunch of little

63
00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:50.690
components like LEDs, like buttons,
like sensors that we're gonna use.

64
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.025
We've got some resistors.

65
00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:52.879
We've got wires.

66
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.830
That's about like you're now caught up.

67
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.345
All right,
that's about as much as you need.

68
00:03:58.345 --> 00:03:59.560
There's some other fun stuff in there.

69
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.756
I will say like we are not doing this
today because involved bringing stuff that

70
00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:09.793
you don't have but they're like the last
example in the Arduino starter kit

71
00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:15.020
is how to hook up something to one of
your remotes and control it with code.

72
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.694
I was not gonna say, hey everyone, please
bring a TV remote you're happy to lose,

73
00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:19.720
that felt rude.

74
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.010
But on your own, [LAUGH] for
your own edification afterwards.

75
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.180
That is definitely a thing you can do.

76
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.768
But we're gonna keep it mostly
simple cuz our main focus today

77
00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:31.918
is not just the electronics pieces.

78
00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:35.899
But actually what new and
really aspirational things can we do with

79
00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:40.588
the Venn diagram of not only the fact that
we have hardware at por disposal, but

80
00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:45.377
then also the fact that we have all of
the JavaScript ecosystem at our disposal.

81
00:04:45.377 --> 00:04:47.610
And we only got a day together, right?

82
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.379
And so let's laser focus on that.

83
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.120
Awesome, so let's look at this first LED.

84
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.500
So we've got that built in one.

85
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.556
We should also talk a little bit about how
to actually do something from the outside

86
00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:09.740
world cuz yes, it was very rewarding
to make the little built-in LED blink.

87
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.913
I'm glad we all had to share
that experience together, but

88
00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:15.330
now let's hook up some
external stuff to it.

89
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.005
So the LED is one of the first kind of
like polarized components that we'll use.

90
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:23.565
The long tail is the positive side, right?

91
00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:26.705
All circuits kind of run from
the source all the way into ground.

92
00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:28.855
So from positive to negative, right?

93
00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:31.505
Like any good emo album.

94
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.567
And we start with the positive
through the negative so

95
00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:39.305
that this is one of those polarized
components that we care about as well.

96
00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.885
We're also gonna use a resistor, right?

97
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:45.983
And resistors have color codes on them.

98
00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:49.390
You'll notice that there
are two different ones here.

99
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.644
There are four bands and
there are five bands.

100
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:57.615
May having opened one of these kits a few
weeks ago I think we have the five bands

101
00:05:57.615 --> 00:05:58.174
in there.

102
00:05:58.174 --> 00:06:03.022
But I show both diagrams just in case we
all open these kits and find a surprise or

103
00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:05.593
later when you're watching this video or

104
00:06:05.593 --> 00:06:10.460
watching at home You have different ones
lying around those will work as well.

105
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.055
It's not that the blue ones
are different than the brown ones,

106
00:06:15.055 --> 00:06:20.840
it is simply that the blue ones have more
bands to help you try to figure it out.

107
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.370
But like it's basically each
band represents a digit, right?

108
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.284
And so Brown is 1, black is 0 so
it looks like a 10k ohm.

109
00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:33.620
One other box.

110
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.110
I'm thinking yeah.

111
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.110
And so a lot of times you can stare at it.

112
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.633
The other life hack that I will tell
you is if you just order capacitor or

113
00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:46.001
I'm sorry, resistors off of Amazon,
they come in a little baggy,

114
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:49.330
that just tells you
the answer on the back.

115
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.220
So you can squint and
hold it up to this chart.

116
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.281
And I think you might have
to a little bit today,.

117
00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.324
But I'm gonna show you a cheat sheet in
a second 'cause we're only gonna use two

118
00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:02.325
different values and you can just kind of
look at those two different values and

119
00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:02.933
figure it out.

120
00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:07.009
Like right now but in general, the life
hack that I use is if you just order them

121
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.856
and don't throw .away the packaging,
the answer is in the packaging.
