00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.483
There are a few interesting
things that you can do here,

2
00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:11.912
which is if you want values
from 0 to 1023, you're in luck.

3
00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.058
Because you know what this emits?

4
00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:19.490
Values from 0 to 1023.

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.239
That's good.

6
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.876
What if you're building something else?

7
00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:28.437
What if you're building something where
you want the volume to go from 0 to 11,

8
00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:29.011
right?

9
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.795
Or what if you're trying to, I don't know,

10
00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:37.489
you're trying two RGB colors
that go from 0 to 255?

11
00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.674
You can write math,
that's a thing that you can do.

12
00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.939
[LAUGH] I was like, no,
I could write math.

13
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.875
I didn't get into JavaScript
to write math, right?

14
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.352
There's a world of 1 plus 1 equals true,
right?

15
00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:52.062
I'm not [LAUGH] writing math.

16
00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:57.117
[LAUGH] With that, I'll just show you
something real quick that you can do here.

17
00:00:57.117 --> 00:01:04.070
You can do potentiometer, .scaleTo.

18
00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:08.388
And we'll talk about some of
the other options because,

19
00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:09.400
a lot of the other options.

20
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.264
So 0 to 100, right, I can save this,
restart the server,

21
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.288
And turn the knob.

22
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.544
I wonder why I didn't get what I wanted.

23
00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:34.834
Let's try that.

24
00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.026
Just be scale.

25
00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:46.963
Now, I turn it, I go from 0 to 100.

26
00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:50.108
It basically takes the full range and

27
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:54.683
just puts into whatever
range that you want, right?

28
00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:56.397
So why don't we do this?

29
00:01:56.397 --> 00:02:00.535
I've got an idea, and this is why I warned
you and go off script, and I'm going to.

30
00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:03.675
So let's go ahead and let's hide
my bigger terminal for a moment.

31
00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:07.181
Let's say, actually,
I don't need the terminal.

32
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.706
That big for a second.

33
00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:14.911
Let's say we're gonna go from 0 to 255,
right?

34
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:20.243
And I'm gonna move this code
here where I have the socket

35
00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:26.929
in scope, And we'll emit,

36
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:36.190
The potentiometer value.

37
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.191
One quick note is, just to show you,
even if you use a scale,

38
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:47.041
if you want the full one,
there's also a .raw.

39
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:51.751
That should be the raw value
from 0 to 1023 regardless.

40
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:57.927
So now we're also going to admit
that the potentiometer changed.

41
00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:02.116
And if I go back into
the client side code,

42
00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:08.126
we're gonna say socket.on, potentiometer.

43
00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:09.356
We got the value and a raw.

44
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.462
Let's just console.log in for a second so

45
00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.635
that I know that I
didn't mess anything up.

46
00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:19.719
And I am gonna kill that server and
restart it.

47
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.882
Turn the knob, okay?

48
00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:33.213
You can see both the raw value and
the regular one.

49
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.584
So it's all the way up.

50
00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:40.011
The value, cuz I scaled it, is 255, but

51
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:44.658
the raw value is the original 1023,
like we expected.

52
00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:50.095
I can turn the knob, and down it goes.

53
00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:55.904
So what I'm gonna do now is
there's a lot of talk on,

54
00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:59.875
people apparently like dark mode.

55
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.762
Which is, yeah, if I wanted a UI that
was less thought out than light mode,

56
00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:05.320
I too would turn on dark mode.

57
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.032
I don't live in just dualities of
light mode and dark mode, right?

58
00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:13.106
There's many shades.

59
00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:15.038
That's kinda force users.

60
00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:18.598
We know about the Sith and the Jedi,
but there's also Gray users as well.

61
00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:27.426
So what we're gonna do is
document.body.style.backgroundcolor.

62
00:04:30.568 --> 00:04:35.118
And we're gonna change the background
color of the body to where I have turned

63
00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:36.242
the knob, right?

64
00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:40.570
And now, we can figure out why,
yeah, I had to work on web pages, and

65
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.196
I said that I tried all different values.

66
00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:46.415
Why am I doing that to myself
when I could just turn a knob and

67
00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:49.662
try all the different values
of colors on my page, right?

68
00:04:49.662 --> 00:04:52.053
This is a next level web development
that no one's talking about.

69
00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:55.931
[LAUGH] Now, hypothetically,

70
00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:02.906
I can turn down the lights
[LAUGH] on this web page.

71
00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:06.977
[LAUGH] And I think what should really
happen is that there's, you can imagine,

72
00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:11.067
we're gonna keep this code cuz I know
what the next sensor we're gonna grab is.

73
00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:13.625
And I give you a hint,
it's gonna be the light sensor.

74
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:18.018
And I think I need a webpage that is
always the kind of light that's currently

75
00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:19.263
in my house, right?

76
00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:20.067
And that's what you see.

77
00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:23.444
It's not about whether you're in light
mode or dark mode, it's whether or

78
00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:26.150
not I'm in light mode or
dark mode is what you're gonna see.

79
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.289
So now we can reach over, we can turn
the knob on our page and slowly.

80
00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.245
[LAUGH] Now, there's some contrast issues.

81
00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:40.145
At one point too, I will leave
it as an exercise to the reader

82
00:05:40.145 --> 00:05:44.957
to reverse the font color as well and
get all that working.

83
00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:49.862
But generally speaking, and
do I set the button code?

84
00:05:49.862 --> 00:05:51.860
Yes, I've got both.

85
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.151
[LAUGH] I got both press the button and
turn the knob.

86
00:05:57.151 --> 00:06:00.316
Really, all I'm missing is some
way to trigger the LED, and

87
00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:02.503
I think we started to tie it all together.

88
00:06:02.503 --> 00:06:07.158
So I can have all of that kinda in place,
and we can see that now we've

89
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:11.750
got this fun interaction between
a lot of our different hardware.
