1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.739
We are gonna pull into possibly,
the challenge mode now.

2
00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:07.290
Are you ready?

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.010
Ready for the challenge mode?

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.546
And it's like, I know that we're feeling
a little high confidence after getting two

5
00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:16.260
out of three colors.

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.550
We'll play around with that.

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.749
So in our kit, we have an LCD screen.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.890
This is an LCD screen.

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.316
As you can see,
there are a lot of pieces here, right, but

10
00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:36.500
let's kinda talk through it.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.000
It is not as bad as it seems, right?

13
00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.095
Yeah, you don't look
confident when I say that.

14
00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:51.759
[LAUGH] Right, let's talk through it.

15
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:55.890
We've got the black and
the red going to the two power rail,

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.958
the two rails, okay, great, killing it.

17
00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.520
This is just a potentiometer, right?

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.430
We've done that before, all right, cool.

19
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.340
And that's just going to
adjust the screen brightness.

20
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.575
Theoretically, if one wanted to,

21
00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.851
they could just go to one of
these analog circuits and

22
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:17.410
then try to control the brightness
via code, that is totally an option.

23
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.114
In this case, I chose to do it
with a potentiometer, all right?

24
00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:25.310
As well as effectively,
the screen brightness.

25
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.850
Over here, we've got screen brightness and
the potentiometer, right?

26
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.575
So we've got three of
the wires already set for us.

27
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.220
We've got, if you look, we've got seven.

28
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.806
We're going one to the ground, eight, and
then really, it's just four in a row,

29
00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:48.480
going to four in a row, and then power and
ground for the LCD itself, right?

30
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.353
So we've got the ability to kind of adjust
the colors, adjust the brightness rather,

31
00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:55.500
as well as program in the data itself.

32
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.960
So really it's, if we think about it,
the potentiometer, then brightness

33
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.116
controls the four kind of resetting
the various characters, more power.

34
00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:10.570
So it does feel like a lot of wires and
we'll take it very slowly.

35
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.950
But I guess take a second,
get that one out.

36
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.470
I'm gonna kind of pull everything out or
you will.

37
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.142
As you can see, you will need most of
the room on your breadboard, right,

38
00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:22.310
at this moment.

39
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.578
So kind of take a second, we'll get
ready for that and we'll wire it up and

40
00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.290
we'll see some things we can
play around with there as well.

41
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.730
All right, friends, so we did skip the
live wiring on that one for a few reasons.

42
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.600
One, it takes a while, and two,
I need to keep some amount of my pride.

43
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.610
Two, most of us gave up on
the color coding at some point.

44
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.400
Did anyone fully stick with
ground is dark colors?

45
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.930
Yeah, at a certain point, we went with,
what wires do we have and

46
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.900
what do we have in place?

47
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.994
I have a second one here to show you
that there are labels on the pins.

48
00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:00.860
When we look at some of the Johnny-Five
code, you'll see that label.

49
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.950
You can also see them on top, but

50
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.360
I kind of just have a second one
here kind of ready to go as well.

51
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.047
And so I've just sent a quick sketch here,
which will kind of write together in

52
00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:16.876
a moment to show basically, for me before
we went live to to make sure that it still

53
00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:20.300
works, cuz that would
have been embarrassing.

54
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.100
So we've got that kind of in place.

55
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.048
There are a lot of pins that
control the two rows, but

56
00:03:25.048 --> 00:03:27.490
it is kind of the first time that we can.

57
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.445
Previously, every time we have
seen any data from our Arduino,

58
00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:33.140
it has been on our browser.

59
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.800
So again, to show this kinda two-way
connection here, we now have

60
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.060
the ability to show some amount of
information on our board itself, right?

61
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.450
Again, I would go with the diagram.

62
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.187
I know it is a little stressful, but
you can get there versus trying to

63
00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:56.090
stare directly at this because
there's a lot to look at on here.

64
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.351
But we will look at it to see
the niceties of all of our

65
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:04.230
hard work of slowly
wiring this all together.

66
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.610
With that, the Johnny-Five piece is at
least that is very straightforward.

67
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.900
And I think you can do some
really interesting stuff here.

68
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.117
So for instance, like most things,

69
00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:21.190
it is a great abstraction library
that kind of keeps the detail.

70
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.560
I mean, Arduino is already a great
abstraction library over this.

71
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.238
Right, and then obviously, Firmata
then brings it over to JavaScript, and

72
00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:31.890
then Johnny-Five puts another
abstraction layer on top of that.

73
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.750
So we can go ahead and
instantiate our board.

74
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.798
And like almost everything else,

75
00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:41.280
it's kind of just instantiating
a different object off of Johnny-Five.

76
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.331
In this case, we give it a little bit
of information, which is the pins.

77
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:56.060
And the pins, if we look at the docks line
up to different pins on the board, right?

78
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.493
And so they are effectively,
if you squint, and

79
00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:03.444
I have a neck cramp right now
from looking very closely.

80
00:05:03.444 --> 00:05:07.451
A pro tip that I forgot to throw on
the slides, I might toss in the slide for

81
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.331
those watching later, is you take
your iPhone or your Android phone,

82
00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:15.370
it doesn't matter,
whatever phone makes you happy.

83
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.350
You've take a photograph of
the little labels on those pins.

84
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.959
And then you zoom it [LAUGH]
right up real big, otherwise,

85
00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:27.560
you will go insane like I almost went.

86
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.250
But the array here lines up to these
pins and what they have in the case.

87
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.060
And so, we just went with
the standard diagram in this case.

88
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.124
That's why we took off
literally everything else.

89
00:05:40.124 --> 00:05:44.281
So in this case, let's see what is,
I went with the standard set,

90
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:48.607
which is the 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, so let's grab that.

91
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:55.350
Not the bespoke wiring
diagram that I did earlier.

92
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.520
Neat, so we've got that.

93
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.150
And then you just have to give
it a little more information.

94
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.480
In this case, how many rows does it have?

95
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.020
We don't need to look that up.

96
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.450
And I believe columns, I think there's 16.

97
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.290
16 looks right, cool.

98
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.220
And so we've given us some information
about what it has to work with.

99
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.180
Let's inject that lcd into the repl
when we run it, I love it.

100
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.116
But let's also say lcd.cursor,
don't cheat.

101
00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:28.660
Lcd.cursor will start at, this is row 0,
row 1 for those of us who are humans.

102
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.610
0, 0, so we can put the cursor somewhere
along there, and we can print.

103
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.450
I'm just gonna print hello,
and you can see this.

104
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.504
I'm gonna print something else that's
not currently on when I was just making

105
00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:39.166
sure it worked.

106
00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:45.023
Goodbye, seems dark, howdy.

107
00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:55.550
And then we'll actually say lcd.cursor,
and let's actually push it off of 3.

108
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.731
Actually no, second row, 3 in,
and we'll say world, right?

109
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.741
And we'll try to push
this off to the board.

110
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:08.231
&gt;&gt; It's not 4 in?

111
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:09.638
&gt;&gt; Hm?

112
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.171
&gt;&gt; The 0, 0, is it zero indexed or?

113
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:13.198
&gt;&gt; Zero indexed, yep?

114
00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:13.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.
[LAUGH]

115
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.610
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, it is not like CSS.

116
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.770
It is zero indexed in this case,
so that will be the fourth one.

117
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.830
And you can see,
it now says Howdy World on there as well.
