1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.990
I'm gonna give you a few minutes.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.050
Your job is you now have an LED and
a button.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.570
LEDs can go on and off.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.510
Buttons can go down and up.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.764
In fact, I'm not even gonna tell
you that when the button goes down,

6
00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:18.680
the LED should go on.

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.540
If you wanna go the opposite way,
that's fine.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.350
But like, if you need some guides, I would
say button goes down, LED should go on.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.300
Button comes up, LED should go off, right?

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.120
We will now blend the two things.

11
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.275
If you wanna get crazy and
fade the button in,

12
00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:36.390
you're on a pulse-width modulation pin.

13
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.660
You do what you want.

14
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.364
But generally speaking,
control the LED in a way that makes you

15
00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:45.934
happy from the button in
a way that pleases you.

16
00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.138
All right, so

17
00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:55.531
our mission was simply to try to see
if we can get the button to turn,

18
00:00:55.531 --> 00:01:00.420
or the LED to turn on when the button
is pressed and turn off when it's not.

19
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.490
So kind of combining the two here.

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.395
So ideally what we ought to be able to
do is to say when the button's down we

21
00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:07.300
wanna do LED on.

22
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.400
When the button is off
we wanna do LED off.

23
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.900
So this is my sanity check as well
to make sure that this all works.

24
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.530
Load it up and back over I go.

25
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.726
Hopefully find out, okay so we got a look.

26
00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:29.322
Did I miss anything up?

27
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:34.768
Check out my code I'm gonna start
by just doing a quick console

28
00:01:34.768 --> 00:01:39.596
log coz that was working so
verify visit my button for,

29
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.525
I didn't change much while we were
wiring this all up, so we'll find out.

30
00:01:56.537 --> 00:01:58.820
All right, let's see, is it my button?

31
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.750
The button works so it looks like
it's my LED going on and off.

32
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.420
That's our issue at this moment.

33
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.550
So let's take a look.

34
00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:18.346
No shouldn't go into the ground.

35
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.068
So the next thing to do to triage
this a little bit is to see,

36
00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:28.220
can I get my LED to blink?

37
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920
&gt;&gt; Someone asked online, the wire for
the LED doesn't go to the ground?

38
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170
&gt;&gt; I'm off by one, that's it.

39
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.619
I was just off slightly from this angle.

40
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.320
All right, code work is off by one,
which is the ground from the LED.

41
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.980
And then that ground wire there was just
off slightly so, I was one position over.

42
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.070
So, fixing that, solved my issue.

43
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.150
So, there's some other things I can play
around with here if I wanted to explore.

44
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.800
I can, for instance, we could say.

45
00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.171
Via that fade in and fade in,

46
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:12.200
I believe takes a number of milliseconds
we say fade in over half a second.

47
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200
And then we can fade out.

48
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.260
Let's try that out as well.

49
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.120
And again, if you're not plugged in
to a pulse width modulation pin,

50
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.685
then you will get an error if
you try to fade in fade out,

51
00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:33.081
coz fading involves something
between a 0 and a 1.

52
00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:34.941
So try that out.

53
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.410
Fades in, fades out.

54
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.817
My fade out was a little bit slower than
my fade in cuz I didn't put a value in

55
00:03:47.817 --> 00:03:49.180
here, which is totally fine.

56
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.450
The code still works.

57
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.650
Now we can fade in and we can fade out
on that same pin as we hit the button.

58
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.980
&gt;&gt; What is the default value for
a fade in and fade out?

59
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.102
&gt;&gt; It doesn't say clearly in the docs, but
my sense is given the fact that I have

60
00:04:05.102 --> 00:04:10.560
500 milliseconds for the fade-in,
and the fade-out seems slower.

61
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.529
I'm going to guess, I can probably dig
into the actual source code over lunch,

62
00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.660
but, like,
my guess is that it's a thousand.

63
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.100
And I'm doing that from,
that seems fast that seems slower [LAUGH].

64
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.797
Seems by my scientific calculations
about twice the length and

65
00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:29.750
speeds I'm gonna guess.

66
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.500
And also like 1000 seems
like a good default.

67
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.820
So all of those factors combined I'm gonna
go with 1000, but as you can see that is

68
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.600
not based on like particularly good
science that is based on feels.

69
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.030
Just like most of JavaScript.

70
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah just a little
question about the circuit.

71
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.390
Why does the button need the resistor
if it's going to ground?

72
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.826
&gt;&gt; Yeah a big part of that is for
just the, to stabilize the amount going,

73
00:04:55.826 --> 00:05:01.560
otherwise, there's a variability
we can get false positives, right?

74
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.258
So having a certain amount
of standardization,

75
00:05:04.258 --> 00:05:08.271
whereas a certain amount is getting
absorbed no matter what is easier for

76
00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:11.242
the circuit to leave,
I had to research that.

77
00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:14.220
And I'm like,
no one's gonna ask me this question, but

78
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.342
I should know [LAUGH] cuz I was like, why?

79
00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:17.776
And that is the case.
