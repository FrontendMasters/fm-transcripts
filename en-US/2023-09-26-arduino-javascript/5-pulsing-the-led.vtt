1
00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:04.030
I'm gonna give you a side quest for
a moment, which is if we go and

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.272
look at the Johnny-Five docs, There

3
00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:17.310
are a bunch of different
methods on the LED.

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.434
So let's go ahead and
let's take a look there.

5
00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:26.380
We can see that we've got,
in this case, there's another diagram.

6
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.797
They're not using a resistor.

7
00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:29.410
I'm gonna use a resistor.

8
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.334
We've got blink.

9
00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:32.783
We've also got the ones,
I showed you before in the repo.

10
00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.038
There was fade in and fade out.

11
00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:40.384
There's pulse, which we can't use just
yet, but actually, why don't this point,

12
00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:44.941
why don't you set it to actually a given,
let's see, what could be fun?

13
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.221
We can't fade just yet.

14
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.679
And I'll tell you, actually you
can fade because we're on pin 13,

15
00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.742
actually let's do pulse and
then I'll explain how it works.

16
00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:57.440
Awesome, so we saw that blinking works,
we saw we can manually turn it on and off.

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.217
Interesting things happen if
I try to use like pulse or

18
00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:06.265
fade in or fade out,
which is I get yelled at.

19
00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:13.347
Once it loads, like I said, I have my font
very big and it's a very long message.

20
00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:20.085
But the important part here, it says,
pin 13 is not a valid PWM pin.

21
00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:21.410
What does that mean?

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.182
Let's talk about it.

23
00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:28.042
So if you get a regular light
bulb like the old-school ones,

24
00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.485
you can kinda fade them on and off, right?

25
00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:38.519
And the way that that works is you send
it more electricity or less electricity.

26
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:43.115
If you send it less electricity,
it is less bright.

27
00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:45.610
If you send it more, it is more bright.

28
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.721
And that's, again,
that voltage, current kind of stuff.

29
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.419
Here's the thing about digital.

30
00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:57.248
Digital is 1s and 0s, which is on or off.

31
00:01:57.248 --> 00:02:02.326
There's no in-between in computers
at the time of this recording,

32
00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:06.978
there's no in-between 1 and
0, it's a 1 one or it's a 0.

33
00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:12.535
So like 0.5,
how do you fade between 0 and 1?

34
00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:16.971
The answer is you cheat, obviously, right?

35
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:22.123
And the way that we cheat is something
called pulse width modulation,

36
00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:25.012
which is we just say 1 and 0 real fast.

37
00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:30.004
[LAUGH] Right, because, yeah, we've got
the fourth dimension of time, right?

38
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.292
Things can only be 1 or
0 at a given moment in time, but

39
00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:37.668
most of this is computers, you turn it
off and you turn it on really fast.

40
00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:41.556
And the speed at which you
were turning it off or

41
00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:48.050
turning it on is how we simulate a certain
amount in between 0 and 1, right?

42
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.000
So, just consistently 5 volts would be on,
consistently 0 volts would be off,

43
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.935
but the rate at which that square
wave kind of fills in is all

44
00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:04.691
the values between 0 and
1 through cheating, right?

45
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.340
And I think I said this before.

46
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.120
Some of those pins have
a little squiggly line.

47
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.580
Some of them do not.

48
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.214
That squiggly line, as you can see
by this very scientific graph,

49
00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:23.017
suggests that there's a pin that
supports pulse width modulation,

50
00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:27.818
which, jives with the error message
that we got from Johnny-Five,

51
00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:30.463
which is, this is not a valid PWM pin,

52
00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:35.940
which makes total sense because
there's no squiggly line, right?

53
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.274
And so our next mission now
is to both do two things.

54
00:03:41.274 --> 00:03:44.123
Take that yellow wire or
I use the yellow wire,

55
00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.690
you use whatever color wire spoke to you.

56
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.930
And what we wanna do is
both update the code and

57
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.282
switch the wire to use
a pin that supports PWM or

58
00:03:55.282 --> 00:04:01.328
scientifically has a squiggly
line next to the number, right?

59
00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:05.245
So I'm gonna go switch over and do that in
a second, and you can join me as well and

60
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.000
we'll take a look at it.

61
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.204
So I am going, I'm a responsible person,

62
00:04:09.204 --> 00:04:12.278
I'm gonna unplug my board
because I'm in front of people.

63
00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.992
If you don't at home, I forgive you.

64
00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:23.751
So, I go here and
if I look closely I can see, okay, 13,

65
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:27.785
the next one that has a squiggly line,
it doesn't matter which one you use,

66
00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:30.390
it only matters that
you've got the squiggles.

67
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.401
So I'm gonna move it down into 11,
and then I can go plug it back in.

68
00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:50.180
And then I go back over to my code and
some really complicated code change.

69
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.492
You're ready?

70
00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.352
I'm gonna take this 3.

71
00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:57.443
I'm gonna turn it into a 1.

72
00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:01.480
That code changes it from 13 to 11.

73
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.461
I should make sure it works before
I actually really, [LAUGH].

74
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.119
Go let it start up.

75
00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:17.671
And now if we look back over my board,
it is now pulsing,

76
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:21.300
cuz now we can simulate,
even though it is a digital pin,

77
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.554
we simulate that we are changing
the amount of voltage going to it.

78
00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:29.309
And we are through a lot of on and
off real fast.

79
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:33.246
The LED doesn't understand the difference
between digital and analog.

80
00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:36.785
It is simply two conductors and an LED.

81
00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:42.396
But as far as we're concerned, the LED
doesn't concern itself with anything.

82
00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:47.590
As far as we're concerned,
it is emulating the idea of pulsing

83
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.686
through just rapid,
giving it electricity and not, right?

84
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:57.893
And so, generally speaking,
if you do need to do something

85
00:05:57.893 --> 00:06:02.477
that is analog-esque but
from computers, right,

86
00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:07.179
you do have some analog ports
as well that you can use.

87
00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.430
But in this case we're
using the digital ones.

88
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.412
You can simulate that by any pin that
happens to support pulse width modulation,

89
00:06:14.412 --> 00:06:18.016
which again,
very scientifically uses squiggly lines.
