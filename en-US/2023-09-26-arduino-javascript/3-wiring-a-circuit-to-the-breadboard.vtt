WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.219
So for this first one,
we're gonna pull out a few things.

2
00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:07.694
The 220 ohm resistor,
some wires, and an LED.

3
00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:10.572
And we're also gonna use this
thing called a breadboard.

4
00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:15.876
The breadboard gets its name because
people originally just used breadboards,

5
00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:20.323
the boards that you put bread on,
[LAUGH] to wire out their circuits.

6
00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:25.491
Because, yes, for a lot of these diagrams,
you're gonna see later, I use this

7
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:30.583
app called Fritzing where you can develop
the circuit and you can literally have

8
00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:35.601
them print you little boards that you
can put all the components into, right?

9
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.501
But generally speaking, before you
figure out if your circuit works,

10
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:42.881
you probably don't wanna pull
out a soldering iron, right?

11
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.168
I mean, maybe you do, I don't, all right?

12
00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:49.158
And so a lot of times you wanna prototype
just by kinda putting some stuff together,

13
00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:49.957
see if it works.

14
00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:53.512
And once you have your amazing circuit
that you're ready to mass-produce,

15
00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:54.940
then you can go ahead and do it.

16
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.145
We will not be using actual breadboards,

17
00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:59.793
we're gonna use this thing
called a breadboard.

18
00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:04.436
And you'll see that it has lots of
little holes, and there's some rhyme or

19
00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:05.921
reason to those holes.

20
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:09.327
So along the top,
those are all connected, right,

21
00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:12.277
on the kind of those tops and
bottom two rows.

22
00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:14.638
And it's a mirror image of itself, right?

23
00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:16.211
Those are all connected.

24
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:22.224
And the pluses and minuses don't actually,
you can do whatever you want, right?

25
00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:24.198
You just need to know
that they're connected.

26
00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:28.966
The pluses and minuses is to help you
live a life that has some meaning and

27
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.567
[LAUGH] structure to it.

28
00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.288
But if you wanna plug
the negative into the plus and

29
00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:38.548
the positive into the negative,
you do you, all right?

30
00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:41.049
That's fine, but
just know that they are connected.

31
00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.167
So you can plug your five volt
into any one of those, and

32
00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:53.307
then it is available as if you connected
two wires anywhere along that rail.

33
00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:57.159
Similarly, those are all connected.

34
00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.652
So you can plug the ground
into any one of those.

35
00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.855
If you need other components that
also need to plug into the ground,

36
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.436
you can plug it into any of
the other spots in there, and

37
00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.650
that will also connect to the ground,
right?

38
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.520
So it's kinda like those are all wired,
and those are all wired.

39
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.507
And then along the actual,
kind of then everything changes

40
00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:19.806
once you cross that little
threshold right there.

41
00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.205
Those are all connected as well kind
of on a vertical or horizontal,

42
00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:28.683
depending on which way you've
already entered the breadboard, but

43
00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:31.173
perpendicular to those other rails.

44
00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:36.983
So anything along the one, two,
three, or four are connected as well.

45
00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:41.482
In the middle, there is that gap,
so the connection stops, right?

46
00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:44.959
But that's similar, everything is
mirror image on the other side of it.

47
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.193
So it's an easy way, so
you're not sitting there and

48
00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.042
trying to crimp different wires together.

49
00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:52.557
You can just kinda plug two
ends of the breadboard,

50
00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:56.807
plug another two ends where you
need the other piece of it, and

51
00:02:56.807 --> 00:03:00.437
everything will work ideally as expected,
right?

52
00:03:00.437 --> 00:03:02.949
So I'll kinda have that
ready to go as well.

53
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.808
Let's take a look at the circuit
that we're gonna build, and

54
00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:11.742
let's talk about it before
we actually build it.

55
00:03:11.742 --> 00:03:17.039
So this is our LED circuit
where we will go from pin 13.

56
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.638
Yes, the same pin as a built-in LED.

57
00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:22.366
We'll go from pin 13.

58
00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:28.911
We'll go into a 220 ohm resistor so
that we do not burn out the LED.

59
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:30.588
Have I tried it without the resistor?

60
00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:31.143
I have.

61
00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:32.019
Should you?

62
00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.285
Not in front of me.

63
00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:37.338
[LAUGH] At home, you do whatever you want.

64
00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:39.147
And then we go into the ground.

65
00:03:39.147 --> 00:03:43.530
So because we only have one component, we
don't need to go into those two rails, and

66
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.284
then from the rails into the LED.

67
00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:46.980
Later on, we might very well do that.

68
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.544
If you really want to as an extra
credit thing, you are also welcome to.

69
00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:54.393
I'm not as well, I'm not going to.

70
00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:59.575
There is probably a question on,
I have a lot of colors

71
00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:04.885
of wires in these bags,
right, do the colors matter?

72
00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:11.718
No, however, right, generally speaking,
we think about black with ground and

73
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:16.881
then red or whatever with
the actual voltage coming through.

74
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.597
You can use whatever
color wire that you want.

75
00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:23.128
This is kind of like guitar pedals
where purple ones sound better.

76
00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:28.558
Right, they are not purple ones, but
you can use whatever colors that you want.

77
00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:32.998
I would just, for my own sanity,
use the darker ones for ground and

78
00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:36.663
the lighter ones for
the actual positive part of that.

79
00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:38.319
But you do you.

80
00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.539
So we're gonna put this circuit together,
and

81
00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.412
then we're gonna basically
run that same Arduino code.

82
00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:47.466
And ideally, we should see.

83
00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:50.521
And again,
what LED you choose is up to you.

84
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:52.232
I know there's a whole
bunch of colors in there,

85
00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:53.710
you pick the one that makes you happiest.

86
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.040
I chose red, and honestly I
don't feel like changing it now.

87
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.280
So I'm gonna go with red.

88
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.105
But if you really want to do the blue
one or the yellow one, go for it.

89
00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:06.950
And the resistor,
it doesn't have to be the 220-ish.

90
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.789
Sometimes you can, depending on
how bright you want it to be, but

91
00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.813
we're gonna stay with
the standard kit here.

92
00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:21.264
And I have this breadboard.

93
00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:22.827
And like I said before,

94
00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:27.134
everything on the kind of horizontal
ones are connected as well.

95
00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:31.666
So what we can do is,
we can go from pin 13.

96
00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:36.346
Right, and it's also on the side,

97
00:05:36.346 --> 00:05:39.466
which might be easier.

98
00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:42.578
I will say this,
I think I said this during the break,

99
00:05:42.578 --> 00:05:45.843
you should unplug your board
whenever you work with it.

100
00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:48.557
As somebody who is just handling it,
not unplugged.

101
00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:52.618
I was reminded on why that advice exists.

102
00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:57.567
Because otherwise,
there's electricity, and

103
00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:00.402
sometimes that can get fun.

104
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:04.886
Okay, so I plugged it into one of
these holes, and like I said before,

105
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:09.157
if you look at the circuit,
it starts out by going into a resistor.

106
00:06:09.157 --> 00:06:13.878
A resistor is a non-polarized component,
which means it doesn't matter.

107
00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:16.901
You don't have to match the stripes,
and that's using the three-band one.

108
00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:19.728
But I think this kit came
with the five-band ones.

109
00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:22.735
It's kind of a mix of both kinds in there,
so it might depend on you.

110
00:06:22.735 --> 00:06:25.643
But I showed the previous
picture of the blue ones.

111
00:06:25.643 --> 00:06:28.261
You can kind of color-code it in a second.

112
00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:32.365
And the nice part is that if you
use too much of a resistor, one,

113
00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:37.485
maybe that wasn't enough electricity LED,
but you will not break anything.

114
00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:39.098
And two, you'll know your code works,

115
00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.718
you'll still see the built-in
one cuz that's also on pin 13.

116
00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:46.091
So it's likely you are gonna be okay,
but if you don't see anything,

117
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:49.671
that's probably that we'll
troubleshoot in a second.

118
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.790
So I want to take the five volts,
go into the resistor so

119
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.846
I can kind of taper that out a little bit.

120
00:06:56.846 --> 00:06:58.855
And then I can go just one over.

121
00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:00.699
I'll move my hands in a moment so
we can kind of see.

122
00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.092
I'll bend this a little bit to
make it a little more obvious.

123
00:07:03.092 --> 00:07:09.860
So I plugged in from pin 13 over
into what looks like row 26.

124
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.844
And I just bridged it over one, right?

125
00:07:13.844 --> 00:07:18.321
And then from there,
I'm gonna go into my LED, again,

126
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.196
we go from positive into negative.

127
00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:23.097
So I'll go along that same rail.

128
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.860
And one over again.

129
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.486
And then finally, I will go from
the negative end of that into the ground.

130
00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:39.186
If your circuit is not complete,
it will not work.

131
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:46.936
And we can plug that in as well.

132
00:07:46.936 --> 00:07:50.534
I'm gonna bend myself a little bit,
mostly so

133
00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:55.062
it's easier for you to see,
but also the diagram as well.

134
00:07:55.062 --> 00:07:57.992
So you can see everything kind of there.

135
00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:03.502
And with that, the nice part is,
as I said before,

136
00:08:03.502 --> 00:08:07.800
whatever code we wrote previously,
it's still running on the board.

137
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.778
So unless while I was talking and
wiring simultaneously, I made a boo-boo,

138
00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:13.936
we should see it.

139
00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:18.797
And the same Arduino code that we had
before should be lighting it on and off.
