00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.377
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, next we're going to get
into what's called, controlled flow.

2
00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:10.490
So, we're gonna go back to
our sky is blue example.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.378
Const sky is blue.

4
00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:18.513
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's just do, is sky blue.

5
00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:29.104
&gt;&gt; Brian: So again, naming convention,
I like to make boolean questions,

6
00:00:29.104 --> 00:00:32.740
because it's either a yes or
no answer, right?

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.910
So is sky blue, by reading that, you can
look at that, and without ever having seen

8
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.600
the code where is sky blue is defined,
that's gonna be a boolean, right?

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.887
Because it's asking you a question,
to which there is a yes and a no answer.

10
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:52.346
&gt;&gt; Brian: So.

11
00:00:56.777 --> 00:01:00.512
&gt;&gt; Brian: Here we're gonna say,
if is sky blue.

12
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:09.598
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna say console.log

13
00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:14.840
the sky is blue, else,

14
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.518
console.log.

15
00:01:18.518 --> 00:01:22.980
The sky is not blue?

16
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.479
Question.
[LAUGH]

17
00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:34.876
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is called an if statement,

18
00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:36.665
intuitively, I would hope.

19
00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.430
[LAUGH] So you're gonna say if, and
then between these parentheses here,

20
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.760
you're going to ask some sort of question,
right?

21
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.000
That's going to be answerable
either by a yes or no.

22
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.850
What's inside of your house to
evaluate to a boolean, right?

23
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.750
It has to be the true or has to be false.

24
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.310
It's in some capacity, right?

25
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.640
So in this particular case, I've
already done statically defined above,

26
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.000
that sky is blue, is going to be true.

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.720
So in this case, this block is
always going to be executed, right?

28
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.550
And this will never be executed because,

29
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.490
I've defined is sky blue
up here to be true.

30
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.823
So if you go over here and
refresh, you can see it says,

31
00:02:12.823 --> 00:02:16.677
here the sky is blue because,
this is being evaluated to true.

32
00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:25.368
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, if this is true,

33
00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:29.880
it's going to execute what's
ever in this block, right?

34
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.420
When I say block, I mean, whatever is
between these particular curly braces.

35
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.110
Right?

36
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.995
So I can have multiple things in here.

37
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.338
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right?

38
00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:47.549
And then this block ends whenever
this curly brace finishes,

39
00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.768
right, when you ever you
close that curly brace.

40
00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:56.089
&gt;&gt; Brian: And actually,
you don't even need the else,

41
00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:57.701
the else part is not required.

42
00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:06.202
&gt;&gt; Brian: But as you may imagine,
&gt;&gt; Brian: If this is not true,

43
00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:10.660
if this is false, right, it's going to
evaluate whatever is in the else block.

44
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.220
So just to demonstrate that,
I'm gonna change this to be false.

45
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.330
And now what would you expect to happen?

46
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.051
Sky is not blue.

47
00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:27.960
&gt;&gt; Brian: Is called conditional or
if statements, right?

48
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.600
This helps you do conditional logic.

49
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.290
So, maybe you might have something,

50
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.800
if the temperature is above 80 today
then you say, it's a nice day.

51
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.010
If it's below 80,
then it's not a nice day.

52
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.780
I don't know, I'm making things up.

53
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.510
I'm very picky about my weather.

54
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.740
Says the person who lives in Seattle.

55
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.130
You can even do fun things like this.

56
00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:00.300
If we say let
&gt;&gt; Brian: Greeting, right, I don't know.

57
00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:05.016
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
then here I can say greeting,

58
00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.276
&gt;&gt; Brian: Equals.

59
00:04:10.742 --> 00:04:11.957
&gt;&gt; Brian: It must be nice weather.

60
00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:21.390
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then here inside of the else
block I can say, greeting, bad weather.

61
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.780
Right, cuz if the sky's not blue today.

62
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.218
And down here I can say,
console.log greeting.

63
00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:34.414
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,
since today the sky here is grey,

64
00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:38.605
what would you expect to be
logged out here on line 11?

65
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.422
&gt;&gt; Brian: It must be bad weather, right?

66
00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:49.960
Because is sky blue is false, so when
it asks this question, if sky is blue,

67
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.510
then it's gonna hit the else block and
says, it must be bad weather, right?

68
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.410
And so I can conditionally
define how these are done.

69
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.990
I'll talk about in a second, why I defined
greeting outside of the if statements, for

70
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.622
now, roll with me that that's
why I had to do it that way.

71
00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:15.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And you had to use let,
couldn't use const.

72
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.960
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right.

73
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.300
Correct.
