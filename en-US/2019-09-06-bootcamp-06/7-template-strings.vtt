00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we just did the sentence here.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.880
Hello plus first name, plus last name.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.040
This is quite burdensome,
right to actually have to go and

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.490
concatenate all the spaces together.

5
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.130
It'd be better if there was
a better way to do this, right?

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.912
There is, there's a better way to do this.

7
00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

8
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.870
thanks to recent revisions in JavaScript.

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.470
There's now an easier way to do this, and

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.020
it's with those backticks
I was talking about.

11
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.870
So make sure everyone
can find the backtick.

12
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.430
Again, if you're on an American keyboard,
that is to the left of the one.

13
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.130
Not the tilde, right, that's what
happens when you hit shift that.

14
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.620
It's just that without shift,
you get little backticks here, right.

15
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.840
Now I can say hello.

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.470
And then there's this curious thing you
can do with dollar sign, curly brace.

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.840
So curly braces are there
next above the square braces,

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.740
you have to hit Shift
one which is next to p.

19
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.083
Again, on the American keyboard,
and now I can put hello first name.

20
00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:11.485
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, we'll just
start with that for just now and

21
00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:13.422
then we'll get to the other part of it.

22
00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:21.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's talk about this
for a second, dollar sign curly brace, and

23
00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:26.320
then inside of there,
this can be bits of JavaScript, right?

24
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.672
So whatever the value of this inside of
here is going to be outputted into that

25
00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:31.699
string, right.

26
00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:34.709
So if I say this refresh,
now it says hello Brian.

27
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.150
So this is just an easier way for

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.410
us to make these big strings out of
other strings work a little bit easier,

29
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.470
right, rather than having to do plus this,
plus space, plus that, right.

30
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.446
You can just do the dollar
sign curly brace.

31
00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.762
And they're just relying on that being so

32
00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:57.120
unique that you would never accidentally
put that into your strings, right?

33
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.656
Even if you do, you can actually
do a backslash right there and

34
00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.929
then it'll just,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right now if I

35
00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.716
go in here those say,
hello first name, literally, right?

36
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.517
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, now I can put a space
in here, dollar sign curly brace last

37
00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:20.271
name,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How are you?

38
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:23.840
Let's make this a little
bit bigger over here.

39
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.050
So you can see here the, it's almost
more like writing normal English.

40
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.582
And here, again you can see
hello Brian Holt, how are you?

41
00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:37.925
And this is nice cuz I
can come up here and say,

42
00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.593
like I can put my wife's name in there,
Niki Holt.

43
00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:44.434
It says, hello Niki Holt, how are you?

44
00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:46.760
She'll be mortified to know
that I was talking about her.

45
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.242
No one tell her, please.

46
00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:55.893
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

47
00:02:55.893 --> 00:03:02.034
So these are called template strings,
and they're pretty new, from 2015 which

48
00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:08.020
is relatively new for JavaScript,
which is a 25 year old language.

49
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.323
So, I use them all the time,

50
00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:16.705
they're quite convenient, any questions?

51
00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:19.343
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In this case,
where does this space come from?

52
00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:24.352
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the space between
Niki Holt, is that what you're asking?

53
00:03:24.352 --> 00:03:25.018
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

54
00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:26.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

55
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.500
Notice here that I literally
just put a space here.

56
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, so that's working?

57
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.396
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so if I delete that,
notice that NikiHolt becomes one word.

58
00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:38.417
Does that answer your question?

59
00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.033
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

60
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.419
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

61
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.317
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And then I'm just wondering
how often new identifiers are added,

62
00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:47.580
like the dollar sign to JavaScript?

63
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.201
Is it updated regularly?

64
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.395
How often do you have to go and
learn these new tags and stuff?

65
00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:56.155
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're talking in
too much of a history lesson,

66
00:03:56.155 --> 00:04:00.161
it used to happen very infrequently,
and now it happens every year.

67
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:00.697
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

68
00:04:00.697 --> 00:04:02.924
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, there is a new revision
of JavaScript every year that has,

69
00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:04.360
I'm gonna say one to ten features in it.

70
00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:11.880
So, ES2015 or
ES6 as it was previously called,

71
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.110
which came out in 2015,
had a lot of stuff in it.

72
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.710
And now we get two or
three features a year.

73
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.820
So, this was obviously possible before,

74
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.850
doing the old way that I showed you,
right?

75
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.360
This just makes it a ton easier to do it.

76
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.740
Very infrequently do we get new paradigms.

77
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.620
The only one I can really think of
that was totally new was generators.

78
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.280
Everything else has been which we're
not talking about generators today.

79
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.926
That's above my pay grade.

80
00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.982
Does that answer your question?

81
00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:43.875
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yes, I do.

82
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, anyone else?

83
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.650
Good questions, yeah.

84
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So for part of the sentence
I put I am, and then dollar sign without

85
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.920
a space, and bracket and
then my age is one of the variables I did,

86
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.040
and it does have a space between the M and
my age.

87
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.820
So, does the dollar sign, etc,
automatically put in the space?

88
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.783
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did you put
a space between the two things?

89
00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:19.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: No, so if you put some
text in between, those two, yeah, that.

90
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.970
Is there any space that gets?

91
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.528
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice that it's
all shoved together there.

92
00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:33.226
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not going to
automatically insert anything for you.

93
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:35.687
It's gonna do exactly
what you tell it to do.

94
00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:40.640
One more thing about template strings.

95
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.780
So if I wanna put a hard return in here.

96
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.960
So if I hit enter a couple times, this
is actually valid with templet strings.

97
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.699
So now if I save this and run it again,

98
00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.320
notice that there's
a lot of space in here.

99
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.410
You can't do this with single quotes or
double quotes.

100
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.791
So if I change this from a backtick to a,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

101
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:06.500
is not valid because it doesn't
know what to do about that.

102
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.243
So, with backticks,
you can also put hard returns in there.

103
00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:16.469
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great,
