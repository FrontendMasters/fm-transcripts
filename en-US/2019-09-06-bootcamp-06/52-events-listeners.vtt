00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.752
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
we're gonna do some events.

2
00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:08.795
This is gonna make your pages interactive,
right?

3
00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:12.009
That's one of the big points of using
JavaScript in the browser is you wanna

4
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.960
make things respond to
people doing things.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.140
So I'm about to show you the most annoying
JavaScript feature in the entire world.

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.760
It's called alert.

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.200
So if you do click me right there,
hate it.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.131
It's the laziest programming, right?

9
00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:35.141
Alert is only for debugging purposes.

10
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:38.575
If any of you ship websites with
alert in it, I'm gonna find you.

11
00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:41.453
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's the worst, right?

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so in fact,
yeah, let's refresh the page here.

13
00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:00.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if you start like typing and retyping,

14
00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.658
it's gonna to add event
listeners multiple times.

15
00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:05.323
So you can actually listen to
the same event multiple times.

16
00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:07.916
Every time I type in this,
it reruns all of the scripts.

17
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.979
So that's why it keeps adding itself.

18
00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.521
So okay, event button Click me, right?

19
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.552
So this is just a normal
button right here.

20
00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:16.902
Here I'm grabbing the button,

21
00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:19.254
document.querySelector.event-button,
right?

22
00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:21.574
Follow me so far.

23
00:01:21.574 --> 00:01:25.180
Button.addEventListener.

24
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.598
And basically we're saying,
whenever this event happens and

25
00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:33.108
in this case,
click event happens run this code.

26
00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:34.826
This is called a callback, right?

27
00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:38.566
You call it back whenever
something happens.

28
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.492
So whenever this happens,
I'm saying, hey, alert, hey there.

29
00:01:41.492 --> 00:01:45.460
So whenever I Click me, it runs that code.

30
00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:49.938
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

31
00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:52.486
So click is obviously one
of the more common ones.

32
00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:56.446
It doesn't have to be done necessarily on
buttons though, I'm going to implore you=

33
00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:59.990
if you're going to put an event listener,
it probably should be on a button.

34
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.662
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you're going
to make a drop-down menu,

35
00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:05.274
would you use a click event for
the button?

36
00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:08.671
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there are built in
drop-downs in the browser already,

37
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.620
you can called selects, right?

38
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.833
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like this and

39
00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:32.350
then you can use styles to make
this look however you want to.

40
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.400
So I would say in general, this is better.

41
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could make a navigation
bar with that all sorted now?

42
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.689
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's always good,
absolutely.

43
00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.254
The reason why I would say stick to this
rather, you absolutely can do that with

44
00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:45.911
just like divs and JavaScript and
CSS and stuff like that.

45
00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:49.754
The reason why this is better is this
is way more accessible to someone

46
00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:52.603
that's visiting your site
using a screen reader or

47
00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:57.191
it's also more accessible to Google when
they're doing their SEO kind of stuff.

48
00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.494
So I'm huge on accessibility, right?

49
00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:01.869
The internet's for everyone, right?

50
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.161
So we shouldn't make websites
that people can't use.

51
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:09.202
So that's why I say use buttons
when you're doing click events,

52
00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:12.961
because screen readers know
how to handle buttons, right?

53
00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:15.373
They're built to use the internet
as people would expect it.

54
00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:19.048
But if I put like,
I made this like a div, right,

55
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:24.094
this is no longer first of all,
no longer has the style of a button.

56
00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:25.152
This still works.

57
00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:30.090
It would still work, if I just got to

58
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.039
run this again in the browser here.

59
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:39.238
So now if I do this in the click,
right, it does still work, right?

60
00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:42.242
So I can add event listeners on
things that aren't buttons, but

61
00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:45.312
a screen reader is gonna have no
idea what to do with this, right?

62
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:47.053
It doesn't know that there's
an event listener on this.

63
00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:50.494
It wouldn't know to show that to
a person that was using a screen reader.

64
00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:53.745
So I'm going to say that,
that's not ethical, right?

65
00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.897
It's not ethical,
because we should be, again,

66
00:03:56.897 --> 00:03:59.623
making websites that everyone can access.

67
00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:00.132
Yeah.

68
00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:05.908
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: On ethical things,
could you create alerts that are hidden?

69
00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:08.043
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not using
this kind of alert, right,

70
00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:11.446
this kind of alert is gonna pop
over everything, right, and

71
00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:14.930
you have no control over what it
looks like or how it does that.

72
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.294
But there are ways to do modals and

73
00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:20.508
various different ways
that are more shady.

74
00:04:20.508 --> 00:04:21.569
I'm not gonna teach you that.

75
00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.757
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

76
00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:27.946
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So for accessibility
reasons, if you were writing a paragraph

77
00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:32.212
and you wanted to put a tag in there
to bring them to another page,

78
00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:34.756
would it be better to use a button tag?

79
00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:35.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, so in that case,

80
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.060
an anchor tag is gonna be much
better anchor being in a tag, right?

81
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.062
So screen readers are also very,
very good at finding anchor tags and

82
00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:44.927
to take people various places.

83
00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:50.162
In fact, if I wanted to, I could say,

84
00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:55.411
document.location here = google.

85
00:04:55.411 --> 00:05:02.083
Let's put in frontendmasters.com.

86
00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:08.854
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if I click on this,
let's just open that again.

87
00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.727
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Fine, whatever.

88
00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let button two,
button two, okay?

89
00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:40.053
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now if I come in here and I click on this,

90
00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:44.405
it should take me to
frontendmasters.com which it did.

91
00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:46.190
You should always use an anchor tag for
that.

92
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.625
Because again, screen readers don't know
how to handle buttons in terms of click

93
00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:52.261
events, but they don't know that,
that's gonna be a link and

94
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:54.223
it's gonna take someone somewhere, right?

95
00:05:54.223 --> 00:05:59.173
Furthermore, for just everyone, I use
Cmd-click all the time to open things

96
00:05:59.173 --> 00:06:04.050
in a separate tab and that doesn't work
if I do redirection this way, right?

97
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.240
So if you're linking somewhere that
should go to a different page,

98
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.000
it should be an anchor tag.

99
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.680
Did I answer your question?

100
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.336
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

101
00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:18.822
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
I've shown you click event.

102
00:06:18.822 --> 00:06:23.376
Click events are gonna be something that
often that you're going to respond to

103
00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:24.764
hopefully on buttons.

104
00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:27.580
I'm not gonna get too much into
like how to do it without buttons.

105
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.051
You can still make it accessible
without a button using things like that

106
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.297
are called like rolls and RTA tags.

107
00:06:34.297 --> 00:06:36.010
It is possible.

108
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.860
So sometimes you have to do it that way,
but just make sure that you're keeping

109
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.620
an eye on making sure that it works
with the screen and stuff like that.

110
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.164
If you're a professional web developer,
you should have a screen reader

111
00:06:46.164 --> 00:06:49.177
installed on your computer and
you should check your site with it.

112
00:06:49.177 --> 00:06:53.028
And like I was alluding to earlier,
if you make your site accessible,

113
00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:54.868
you make it SCL friendly as well.

114
00:06:54.868 --> 00:06:57.904
So you get the added advantage that
you'll rise in Google ranks, as well.

115
00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.984
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does that work with just
the built in screen readers too for

116
00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:06.450
Firefox and stuff or
should you get a specific one?

117
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.663
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The one I use is Jaws,
I think that's the one that everyone uses.

118
00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:17.653
By no means an expert, but
I at least try and check, right?

119
00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:20.545
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was just wondering
if there was like any problem that

120
00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:24.282
wouldn't show up if you use the in
browser screen reader versus the-

121
00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:24.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That seems like it

122
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.749
should work to me.

123
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.866
I mean, people over at Mozilla
are pretty smart or Google or whatever.

124
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.866
So it doesn't offend me,
I'll put it that way.

125
00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:34.403
[LAUGH]
