00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:03.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I wanna show you how to
get this working in Visual Studio Code.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.320
So let's go and
open your Visual Studio Code here.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.207
I have a brand new project here,
and I'm gonna create a new file,

4
00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:19.060
and I'm just gonna put this on my desktop,

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.467
in a new folder called,
experiments, I guess.

6
00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:28.785
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm gonna make an index.html.

7
00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:41.061
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're going to create
our index file, which you should have been

8
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:45.380
doing HTML already,
I'm sure Jen did a fine job with that.

9
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.490
I can never remember the outermost
layer of what to put in index files.

10
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.570
Luckily, VS Code just kind of does it for
me.

11
00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.840
So if I put html:5, and just hit Tab,
it just completes all of that for me.

12
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.059
So we're gonna call this one JavaScript,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Experiments.

13
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:15.163
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm just gonna put a little h1 here, h1.

14
00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.701
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: JavaScript Experiment.

15
00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna put
a script tag down here at the bottom.

16
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
let's talk a second about script tags.

17
00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.041
There's kind of two ways
you can handle script tags.

18
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:37.095
I can easily just hit Enter here and
directly put JavaScript in here.

19
00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops.

20
00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:48.926
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
between the script tag here,

21
00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:52.320
it'll execute any code
that you put in here.

22
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590
Now, I don't actually really
want you to do it this way,

23
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.626
this is kind of bad practice.

24
00:01:56.626 --> 00:01:59.590
You wanna keep your HTML and your
JavaScript separate from each other, so

25
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.930
that they're kind of easier to follow.

26
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.161
So rather than do that,

27
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:10.369
we're going to put a src here, a source.

28
00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.791
In the same directory, I want you to
go look for an experiments.js file.

29
00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:24.773
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
then we're gonna create a new file here.

30
00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:30.720
In the same directory as our index.html,
and we're gonna call it experiments.js.

31
00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:42.673
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna put the same

32
00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:47.846
thing that we had before there,

33
00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:53.786
const monthlyRent = 500; const

34
00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:59.342
yearlyRent = monthlyRent * 12

35
00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:05.110
/ console.log(yearlyRent).

36
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.777
Now, I want you to open
your favorite browser,

37
00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:14.319
and you can do Open File here or

38
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.010
Cmd+O on Mac, or Ctrl+O on Windows.

39
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.236
I think it's Ctrl+O.

40
00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:23.188
No, maybe not.

41
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.108
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not
like I work at Microsoft.

42
00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:35.164
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

43
00:03:38.657 --> 00:03:43.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In Jen's class,
they had the open browser extension.

44
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.915
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So they could just

45
00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:47.371
right-click on the HTML file and
then [INAUDIBLE]

46
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:48.129
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then do that.

47
00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.581
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

48
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.057
I'm gonna open here, let's actually
gonna do this in a new file.

49
00:03:57.057 --> 00:04:03.529
Open and Desktop &gt; experiments
&gt; open your index.html file.

50
00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:08.032
And you should just see
JavaScript Experiments up here.

51
00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:13.520
But we are gonna open
our developer console.

52
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.521
So Web Developer.

53
00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:22.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I wanna open the Web Console.

54
00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:29.004
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The other way you can
do that is just right clicking and

55
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:31.310
say, Inspect Element here.

56
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.820
And then just click on the Console,
in your dev tools.

57
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.237
I'm using Firefox, but I imagine many
of you are using Chrome, probably.

58
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:43.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You Google sell outs.

59
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.258
Just kidding.

60
00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:47.526
I'm kidding.

61
00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:49.389
I'm gonna get fired for that one.

62
00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.499
Okay, it's relatively similar though.

63
00:04:54.499 --> 00:05:00.280
So come in here, Desktop &gt; experiments

64
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.557
&gt; index.html, Inspect Element.

65
00:05:05.557 --> 00:05:10.723
And you click Console and you should see
something similar to that one down there.

66
00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:14.930
Okay, I'm gonna do it in Firefox,
cuz that's what I'm more familiar with.

67
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.902
So you should see that 6000 there,
so this is the console.

68
00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:22.201
I will make that a little bit bigger so
you can probably see it a little better.

69
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:28.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When you're
linking the script source,

70
00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:33.517
the .backslash experiments.js,

71
00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:37.930
do you need the .backslash?

72
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.606
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Forward slash.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Forward slash?

73
00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:40.142
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

74
00:05:40.142 --> 00:05:43.879
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, do you need those
two things if they're in the same file?

75
00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.034
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yeah,
let's talk about that.

76
00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:49.629
It's a good question.

77
00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.780
So I'm gonna close this, close that.

78
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.540
So the question here is on line 13.

79
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.489
Do you need the ./ here?

80
00:05:58.489 --> 00:06:04.076
And the answer to that question is,
this will work as well.

81
00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:10.864
I'm sure of that, but
let me validate my assumption here.

82
00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:14.428
So, ./ means same directory, right?

83
00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:18.845
And I put it there just to be explicit,
and also just kind of by force of habit.

84
00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:23.090
[LAUGH] Jen mentioned that
she talked about that ../,

85
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.625
means go up a directory, right?

86
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:27.573
And ./ means stay in the same directory.
