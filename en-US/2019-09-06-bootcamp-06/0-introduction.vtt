00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I am not Jen.

2
00:00:05.843 --> 00:00:08.852
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] You probably

3
00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:10.277
noticed that.

4
00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:14.931
My name is Brian Holt, and I was making
this comment earlier to Jen that I feel

5
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.856
like I'm the bad cop of good cop,
bad cop here.

6
00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:20.524
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That you gotta learn this

7
00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:24.278
awesome HTML, CSS stuff,
and the payoff for HTML and

8
00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:28.784
CSS is very immediate, and
it's very gratifying up front, and

9
00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:33.055
JavaScript is a little bit more
difficult to learn up front.

10
00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:36.530
So just before we even get started here
I just want to give you permission to

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.163
feel like this is hard,
because it's kind of hard, and

12
00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:41.537
when I say kind of hard
it's actually quite hard.

13
00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:44.398
So, [LAUGH] if you're sitting
there despairing a little bit,

14
00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:47.094
I guarantee you you're not
the only one feeling that way,

15
00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:50.632
in fact your teacher might actually be
feeling that way at the same time too.

16
00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:58.590
So, given all of that, just to give a bit
of an introduction, I am Brian Holt.

17
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.082
I am currently living in Seattle,
Washington.

18
00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:07.277
This is my, I can't even count how many
times I've been back to Frontend Masters,

19
00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:11.287
but umpteenth time back to
Frontend Masters, and I'm really,

20
00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:14.205
really excited to be
teaching this bootcamp.

21
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:19.613
So, you can see here we're
on the course website here,

22
00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:27.454
and we're gonna be starting here from
section 9: Programming Fundamentals.

23
00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:31.436
So, we're gonna kind of switch
gears here a little bit.

24
00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:34.700
We're gonna move from more of
the declarative nature, which means,

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.745
inform a computer, this is how this looks,

26
00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:40.004
this is where this goes, to more of
what we call an imperative nature,

27
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.756
which is going to be telling
the computer how to do things.

28
00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:49.156
We're going to be writing notes down that
the computer will then execute for us.

29
00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:51.810
It's almost like writing an essay that
your computer knows how to execute.

30
00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:58.268
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, you can see
here I have this, what is code?

31
00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:02.249
It's kind of a dumb question,
but it may surprise you.

32
00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:05.126
So I actually stole this idea
from a different Frontend Masters

33
00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:08.110
teacher who's name is Kyle Simpson,
who, after the bootcamp,

34
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.100
would be a very good teacher for
you to watch.

35
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.621
Code is for humans first, and
that kind of seems counter intuitive,

36
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:16.928
you would think well,
we're writing code so

37
00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:20.526
that computers can execute this, so
why are we writing it for humans?

38
00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:23.435
Well, in reality you never
write code just once, right?

39
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.343
In reality, when you're shipping code
at a company, you write code and

40
00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:29.155
then you're gonna have to come back and
change it, and change it, and

41
00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:30.742
change it again, and change it again.

42
00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:33.446
And then there's gonna be a bug,
and you have to go fix it, and

43
00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:35.734
then you're gonna have to
add more features, and so

44
00:02:35.734 --> 00:02:38.646
you're gonna have to modify it,
and then the designers decided to

45
00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:42.083
make this animate a different way, and
you have to go back and modify it again.

46
00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:45.850
So in reality, the code that you
write is really for your future self.

47
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.620
It's for your future coworkers so
that they can go back in later,

48
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.080
understand what your intentions were, and
then be able to change that in order to

49
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.960
fix the bug, or change the feature,
or whatever that may be.

50
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.584
So, that being said, you always want
to write the most clear code possible.

51
00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:08.512
If you have two choices of being clever
and terse, or being explicit and

52
00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:11.151
verbose, always go with the ladder.

53
00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:13.548
It's better to write more if
it's more understandable.

54
00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:17.329
Always, always err on the side
of being more understandable.

55
00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.862
When you have problems later then you can
go back and change it to be clever, but

56
00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:24.625
for the most part,
you always want to be clear.

57
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.208
So that is what I am gonna try and teach
you today, and that's kind of something

58
00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:29.533
that I want you to hold onto,
because it is a bit counter-intuitive.

59
00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:33.211
We kind of want to play what's
referred to as code-golf,

60
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:35.094
how condensed can I get this?

61
00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:36.791
Every character is another stroke, right,

62
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.722
so you want to get this down
to as small as possible.

63
00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:44.562
In reality that's, as your future
possible coworker, don't do that, please.

64
00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:49.021
[LAUGH] Please, write clear code.

65
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:52.550
So that's what I want to get into.

66
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.002
It's worth sitting down and
taking the time to write clear code.
