00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
right now on line four,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.580
were you saying friends at your party
called friends at your party plus one.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.286
There's a bunch of ways to do this.

4
00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:10.070
And I'm gonna show you all of them,
because you will see all of them.

5
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.840
There's kind of just
shorthand ways of doing that.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.249
But I wanted to talk a second
about comments first.

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.771
So if I put slash slash,
this is some comment to my future self.

8
00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:30.261
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the way that you
can document code, especially if you're

9
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:33.949
doing something that's not immediately
clear what you're doing, and

10
00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.061
you want to let your future self know, to
have a shortcut to into your mindset, or

11
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:39.000
your co workers.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.480
Comments are good way of doing that.

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.160
And the way you do that in
JavaScript is with slash slash.

14
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.470
And then whatever comes after the slash
slash until the end of the line,

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.170
will not be executed by
JavaScript religious be skipped.

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.670
Okay?

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.334
The called comments, the other way
you can do it is can do slash star,

18
00:00:56.334 --> 00:01:01.356
and then everything will be
a comment until you do star slash.

19
00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:05.440
So everything in here is a comment.

20
00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:09.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The reason
why I tell you that is,

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.300
sometimes it is useful
to comment out code.

22
00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:18.342
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here I've commented this
code out by abusing the comment system,

23
00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:22.160
and just say, hey, don't execute this
line, but I wanna leave it there for now.

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.800
So that's what this does.

25
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.440
You can just do slash slash space in
front of it, and you're good to go.
