00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:01.282
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something
else I want to say here, so

2
00:00:01.282 --> 00:00:02.479
that people can get frustrated by.

3
00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:06.581
There's things that are called
keywords in JavaScript.

4
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:08.551
In other words,
things that I cannot call my variable.

5
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:13.446
So if I try and call this var, right, it's
going to say, I don't know what that is.

6
00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:18.381
You're trying to declare variable or
I can say const let, or const const.

7
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:20.342
So I can't have a variable called const,
right?

8
00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.410
Because that confuses JavaScript.

9
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.235
So there's a whole slew of those,
like class is another one or for.

10
00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.931
It's kind of a minefield [LAUGH].

11
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.224
Or with, that's another one
that people don't expect.

12
00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:41.147
Anyway, that's another one that
you should be aware of okay.

13
00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:48.308
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can actually
have this be multiple layers deep.

14
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:55.909
So I could have const monthsInAYear = 12.

15
00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.660
And then here, instead of doing this,
I could just put that there.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.124
So that makes sense, yearlyRent =
monthlyRent times monthsInAYear.

17
00:01:05.124 --> 00:01:09.758
And often, because as far I know there's
no plan to change how many months

18
00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:11.571
there are in a year, right?

19
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:16.035
This'll never be reassigned to something
else, this would be considered a constant.

20
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.467
So you can put this in what's
called screaming case.

21
00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:26.488
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: MONTHS_IN_A_YEAR,
they call it a screaming case cuz,

22
00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:29.740
obviously, it's all in capital letters.

23
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.204
And this is just to let you know,
this is a constant,

24
00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:34.566
this is just a fixed value
that will never change.

25
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.986
Now, there's nothing special about this.

26
00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:39.901
I'm just showing you that this is
a convention we choose to adhere to.

27
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:45.155
And it just lets people know,
here's this constant that we have.

28
00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:46.185
And that's what it means, right?

29
00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:46.685
Does that make sense?
