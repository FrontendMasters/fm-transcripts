&gt;&gt; Mike North: I am Mike.

2
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.970
I do a lot of work with LinkedIn,
where I train all of their web developers.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.880
I focus on JavaScript and
progressive web app technologies, and

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.470
there I am also part of their Ember Core
team, and the web frameworks team.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.810
So we maintain the tech stack that all
of the LinkedIn stuff is built on.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830
It may seem like many big tech companies,

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.670
it may seem like a seamless experience
from the outside, but there actually

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.985
several freestanding apps that are all
sort of built on the same stack.

9
00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:37.670
And progressive web app technologies have
been a huge part of what we've focused

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.750
on recently.

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.170
I'm thrilled to be
teaching this with Steve.

12
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.410
Steve is one of the most gifted
teachers in the industry.

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.240
And he is at the top of the list of

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.750
people that I would love to be
teaching this material with.

15
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.560
So we are really lucky to have him,
and I am excited to be a part of this.

16
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.160
And I hope that we'll be able to talk
about some like fundamental building

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.490
blocks, and season it with a dose
of real world experience and

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.240
war stories from a big tech company
that is using the stuff right now.
