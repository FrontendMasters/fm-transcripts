00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.090
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's
dive into measuring apps.

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.092
Because I want us, as we iteratively
work on this example, right,

3
00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:09.481
there are 14 different steps
we're gonna go through.

4
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:15.136
We wanna be sure that we're watching
something quantitative that helps us

5
00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:21.430
understand that we are moving our position
closer and closer to where we want to be.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.090
And there are a couple metrics that
I want us to pay attention to.

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.940
These two metrics you'll
see all over the place.

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.110
So there's time to first meaningful paint,
and

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.630
this is just sort of starting
when the request is sent out.

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.860
You click on a URL, how long until
the user feels like the loading experience

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.679
has finished, or they can at least start
going about what they intend to do, right?

12
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.630
If it's a news article,
maybe they can start reading already.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.146
There is time to interactive, and so

14
00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:59.939
this is where you can start touching on
navigation elements and tapping buttons.

15
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.495
And they actually work, right,

16
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:07.440
they're not just visually on the screen,
but not yet wired up.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.352
And I like to threw a third metric in here
that you're not going to see widely if you

18
00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:13.807
go and read about PWAs.

19
00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:19.578
But I think it's an important milestone
that we need to pay attention to.

20
00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:24.010
And that is the time to dynamic
data showing up on the screen.

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.152
We put this here because it helps us
understand that if we move the first

22
00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:34.469
paint so that it's really, really fast,
but dynamic data comes much,

23
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.019
much later, we haven't really
done our job completely yet.

24
00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.003
Right, so we need to be able to
show something on the screen,

25
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:43.880
not just have a spinner.

26
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.608
I mean that's good, that is certainly
like a massive step up from a blank

27
00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.800
screen to at least show
that we have this booted.

28
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.922
You might buy yourself a second and
a half or two seconds of additional

29
00:01:56.922 --> 00:02:01.910
patience by showing that the link
you tapped is not broken.

30
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.610
We are working on it.

31
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100
We're going to get stuff for you.

32
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.610
But then data has to
come shortly thereafter.
