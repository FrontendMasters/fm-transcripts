WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
&gt;&gt; Mike: So with that,

2
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.550
let's begin with talking about what
a progressive web app is, right?

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.416
It's it is a term of art these days, and

4
00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:13.580
it was coined I believe

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.590
in 2014 by Alex Russel and Jake Archibald,

6
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.050
who are Google Developer advocates
that work closely on the Chrome team.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.660
And it was an effort to put a name behind
a forward looking web experience, right?

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.560
Something that is no longer looking at
the oldest most limited browser that

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.700
we have to support, but rather adopting
this idea of progressive enhancement.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.810
So we say progressive enhancement
as a core tenet and the idea is,

11
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.140
where something is available to
enrich our users experience?

12
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.300
We use it, we don't wait for everyone,

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.370
all of the browsers that we need to
support to build in what we need.

14
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.870
It's not the lowest common denominator
that is driving the way we think anymore.

15
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.790
It is allowing us to have
a rich experience with these

16
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.250
superhero characteristics for those
modern browsers that can support it and

17
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.490
then gracefully, degrading or
falling back to a more basic experience.

18
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.830
And this would be what like maybe
your IE10 user or IE9 user might see.

19
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.560
A common characteristic of PWAs or

20
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.280
Progressive Web Apps is that they
surprise and delight users by

21
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.580
delivering things that people don't
typically see in web applications, and

22
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.340
this includes working offline,
the ability to have push notifications.

23
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.510
These are things we typically
see in native apps.

24
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.360
These used to be reasons where you'd say,
a web experience is not,

25
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.270
that's not going to cut it for our

26
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.700
flagship mobile app,
web technology is holding us back.

27
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.260
And the idea is we're starting to chip
away at that and now there are fewer and

28
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.720
fewer little reasons that would sort of
kick you into developing a native app.

29
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.070
Nowadays it's almost
like if you need games,

30
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.810
if you need hardware accelerated graphics,
things like that,

31
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.970
now maybe that is what propels you
into we must use a native app.

32
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.050
But more and more, like the web
is offering better primitives and

33
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.930
options for us that look pretty promising.

34
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.160
As far as what these options are,
and again, I'm borrowing this from

35
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.280
Alex Russel and Jake Archibald.

36
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.800
So these are ten characteristics
that they list and

37
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.150
these are sort of the superhero powers.

38
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.130
So progressive web apps,

39
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.400
they are progressive in that they work for
a variety of browsers.

40
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.630
But where modern features are available,

41
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.280
like the ability to send push
notifications, we take advantage of that.

42
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.840
They're responsive because
mobile web traffic has eclipsed

43
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.050
desktop traffic in every way.

44
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.800
In page views, in number of unique users,

45
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.454
we're past every benchmark
that we care about.

46
00:03:17.454 --> 00:03:22.470
Mobile web that is not
the niche experience anymore,

47
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.890
it is the the main sharer
of most business' traffic.

48
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.630
So progressive web apps should
work regardless of flaky or

49
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.390
absent network connections.

50
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.180
And this is traditionally,

51
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.510
a big limitation that you have to
deal with when building for the web.

52
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.310
If you have no Internet,
you can't download that java script for

53
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.100
that CSS, your AJAX doesn't work.

54
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.420
These are things we need in order
to do anything interesting at all.

55
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.000
Progressive web apps are app like,
meaning you are prompted to

56
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.420
add them to your home screen
with the home screen icon, and

57
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.420
you can launch them from there,
potentially without the browser UI.

58
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.080
Like the back button in
the bookmark button,

59
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.750
it can be a sort of full screen web
experience that a user might forget

60
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.670
that they didn't get
this from the App Store.

61
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.580
They might be so seamless that
it trick them to that extent.

62
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.840
PWAs should get up to date content
when it's available without a complex

63
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.470
installation process.

64
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.260
So raise your hand if you
enjoy app updates when you

65
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.210
have 14 apps that I need to download.

66
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.590
And that's like a gigabyte
of Swift code and

67
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.274
libraries that are compiled just for
that device.

68
00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:47.980
We wanna be able to stay at most a couple

69
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.170
hundred kilobytes and be able to send
a new file over to the user seamlessly.

70
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.510
Where they don't have to click anything or
install anything.

71
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.350
Security is a big deal, so
we've got about 56% of the Internet

72
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.620
on HTTPS now and
it is linearly increasing.

73
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.310
So many of these technologies we'll
be working with today require HTTPS.

74
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.003
And so, it was an opportunity where
certain things were getting rewritten, and

75
00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:18.840
these standards were developed.

76
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.910
And while we were at it the idea is, well,

77
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.080
let's say that this feature only works
if we're operating in a secure way.

78
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.930
And so we will start to see
that become a common theme.

79
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.410
And that by the way is
why the setup process for

80
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.090
this project is a little complicated.

81
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.350
Currently and hopefully in the future,
this will be less necessary or

82
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.440
unnecessary.

83
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.078
Currently we need to build our own
self-signed certificate that we can use so

84
00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:53.169
that even in development
mode we're working in HTTPS.

85
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.349
&gt;&gt; Mike: PWAs are discoverable so
they should have rich metadata associated

86
00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.726
with different URLs so
that when you search on a search engine,

87
00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:10.570
you got a rich tile that comes back with
all that needs structuring data around it.

88
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.630
And not sort of the Wikipedia article
not to ripe with the Wikipedia but

89
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.990
that is the basic experience.

90
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.096
If the web browser is a document viewer,

91
00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.980
that is a site that is
comprised of documents.

92
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.411
PWA should be re-engageable and

93
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:29.680
we will see that today in
the form of notifications.

94
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.740
Meaning the user can do something,
close their tab,

95
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.900
walking away, and then get a notification
that sorta pulls them back into the app.

96
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.270
Again, this might have been the leading
reason, or it was very high on the list

97
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.830
for reasons people opted out of using
web technology for mobile apps.

98
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.400
They needed push notifications and
there was only way to get that.

99
00:06:56.014 --> 00:07:01.682
&gt;&gt; Mike: PWA should be durable and by that
we mean they should be able to store data

100
00:07:01.682 --> 00:07:07.180
in a way that survives across
different browser tab lifetimes.

101
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.960
And you're probably used to cookies,
local storage,

102
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.720
things like that,
we're not going to be using those today.

103
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.160
They're very limited and we'll go
into reasons why they are limited,

104
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.980
but that is what we mean by durable.

105
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.720
Like we store data in a way that

106
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.540
it doesn't evaporate as soon
as the user walks away.

107
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.650
And then finally,
one of the great things about

108
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.690
the web that is influenced
native mobile apps is URLs.

109
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.580
The ability to hand someone something to
click on and they'll get just to the right

110
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.260
view that they were shared,
that someone shared to someone else.

111
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.000
In native apps,
this is done by way of deep links.

112
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.430
So if you've ever seen Spotify:// and
then some song title

113
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.250
you can click on that and Spotify will
kinda grab that and respond accordingly.

114
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.710
PWA should bring along all of these
important defining characteristics

115
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:09.410
of web applications while introducing
this native paper as well.

116
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.840
So we're trying to have
the best of both worlds

117
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.329
not compromising any of that web goodness.

118
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.610
So, a lot to think about,
we're going to touch on

119
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.570
all of this,
we have 14 exercises plan for you.

120
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.804
And we're going to take every
one of these boxes, which it is

121
00:08:30.804 --> 00:08:36.210
gonna be a very well rounded PWA
experience, will get today and tomorrow.
