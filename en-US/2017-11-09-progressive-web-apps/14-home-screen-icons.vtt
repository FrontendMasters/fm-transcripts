00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're starting to get to
the way a native app looks and feels.

2
00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.092
Here's another one,
Home Screen Icons, right?

3
00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:10.221
We want to have a nice home screen icon,
not just a minimized like snapshot

4
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:15.120
of like the layout of the page,
that's often what you get by default.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.292
So here's a little cheat sheet for
you for different.

6
00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:24.252
I don't need to, yes I've got the seven
on there, but a cheat sheet for

7
00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:28.660
square dimensions that you need
to have for all of these devices.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.198
The big nit picky thing is the image
has to be exactly the right size or

9
00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:38.050
the device will often behave as
if you provided no image at all.

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.526
The stars have to align just perfectly.

11
00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:43.640
You have to give it an image,
it has to be able to download it and

12
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.750
then it has to be the perfect size.

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.270
It will not try to resize it for you.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.460
It wants it, the idea is they're
encouraging people to make it pixel

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.640
perfect so these icons look great.

16
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.010
That is Apple and Android wanting
your home screen to look beautiful.

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.670
So and you create meta tags
that look like this for Apple.

18
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.318
Older versions of Android have
meta tags that you can use, but

19
00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.614
more and more the way forward
is that web app manifests,

20
00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:16.130
where you have that icons array and
you can specify different things there.

21
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.380
For things like iOS that don't
read this web app manifest yet,

22
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.841
there is a great tried and
tested library called Add to

23
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:31.209
Home Screen that basically will
float down this little bubble.

24
00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.970
And this little tick at the bottom will
point right to the location of the Share

25
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.190
button on that specific device for
that specific OS version.

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.890
They've gone and figured out
exactly what the layout should be.

27
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130
It's even orientation sensitive.

28
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.590
So it's basically gonna point
to the share button and

29
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.220
say tap this, add me,
add to the home screen.

30
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.110
This has been around for about ten years.

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.710
It is still the go to solution.

32
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.080
It's fantastic.

33
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.480
And it's a great example of a library that
does something simple, where if we all

34
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.610
tried to it ourselves we would leave out
a lot of important edge and corner cases.

35
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180
It does one job and
it does it really, really well.
