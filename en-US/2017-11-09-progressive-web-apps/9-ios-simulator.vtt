00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.854
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Here's one step better.

2
00:00:01.854 --> 00:00:05.242
It's iOS-specific, but
you can install things,

3
00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:07.860
I believe that you can install Xamarin.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.605
If you have Windows, they have tools that
will allow you to spin something similar

5
00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:14.759
up, where you get an iOS simulator.

6
00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.654
And this is a brilliant emulated iPhone,

7
00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:23.669
right down to emulating
the architecture of the CPU.

8
00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.529
This is closer to a virtual
machine than anything else.

9
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.346
This is great because it lets you test
something that we don't really have

10
00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:35.385
a means for
testing in desktop world, right?

11
00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:40.434
And if we think about Chrome that runs
an Android, most Android browsers

12
00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:46.170
are Chrome-based, even Samsung's browser,
it has a Chrome core.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.500
Those are pretty similar to
desktop Chrome, more or less.

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.410
In many ways, mobile Safari is very
dissimilar from desktop Safari.

15
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.212
So this is sort of something that's
easy to install, it comes with Xcode.

16
00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:06.750
And one of the convenient things you get
is local host, as you can see up here.

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.910
That's gonna to point to your laptop,
not to the simulator itself.

18
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.700
So it's not looping back into the device,
it's looping back to your machine.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.220
So you could fire this up and
put it in localhost, and

20
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.462
you can see our app running here.

21
00:01:22.462 --> 00:01:25.612
But, so it lets us test a blind spot,
if you will,

22
00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:28.390
the ability to see what
mobile Safari does.

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.130
In some versions of iOS, there
are actually two JavaScript runtimes.

24
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.020
There is the one that works
in Safari like this, and

25
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.880
then in some versions of iOS when
we add to home screen, that is

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.450
a completely separate JavaScript runtime
that behaves a little bit differently.

27
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.405
So there are these two kind a blind spots
that this gives us the ability to poke

28
00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:51.190
around in.

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.140
Additionally, it is really easy
to connect Safari to this thing.

30
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.590
So if you enable the develop menu,
which is in the Safari,

31
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.750
desktop Safari preferences, you will see
that if a simulator is fired up like this,

32
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.330
you can connect to it under
the simulator option here.

33
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.280
And furthermore, if you have an iOS device
connected to your laptop with a cable,

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.940
with your charging cable,

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.930
you'll see those devices pop up
in this develop menu as well.

36
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.290
And then you can proceed to kind of do
the same things that you would do in dev

37
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.300
tools.

38
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.560
Here I'm hovering around in
the elements tree, and you can see that

39
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.690
that is highlighted on the left side,
just as you'd expect in Chrome.

40
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.990
This is really, really powerful.

41
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.313
You could set a debugger in there for
user breakpoint and

42
00:02:40.313 --> 00:02:46.450
figure out what's going wrong,
what is this iOS Safari thing?

43
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.300
That doesn't seem to be
happening on Chrome.

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.215
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And so there's really
no excuse for not using this,

45
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.874
you should have this installed,
you should be using it.

46
00:02:57.874 --> 00:03:02.845
It lets you do things like add to home
screen, making sure that that flow works

47
00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.287
completely, making sure
that subtle differences,

48
00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:10.416
like the height of your app,
when there's an address bar here,

49
00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:14.324
versus no address bar,
versus the battery bar being there.

50
00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:18.003
It's really, there's no substitute for
doing it this way,

51
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:19.640
short of an actual device.
