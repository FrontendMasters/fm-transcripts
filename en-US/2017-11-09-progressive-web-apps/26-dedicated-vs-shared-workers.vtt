&gt;&gt; Mike North: When talking about
dedicated workers and shared workers, so

2
00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:06.531
dedicated workers are by
far the most common.

3
00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:11.148
And when a script creates a worker
using that worker constructor,

4
00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:16.517
let's say it's our app.js, inside there,
we're creating this worker.

5
00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:22.083
Only that frame in which that script
is running can talk to that worker.

6
00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:26.262
So if you were to have an iframe,
and even if it's in the same origin,

7
00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:29.450
it's not going to be able
to connect to that worker.

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.515
So whatever, the creator can talk to it,

9
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.115
it can talk back to the creator,
and that's it.

10
00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:39.758
For our purposes, the exercise we're
going to work on is we're going to

11
00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:42.701
take something that is
computationally very intensive.

12
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:47.669
And move it so that it's done in parallel,
off of our main thread,

13
00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:50.353
this will suit our needs just fine.

14
00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:55.734
Shared workers allow inter-frame
communication to happen, right?

15
00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:59.853
So you could have one worker running,
and three iframes,

16
00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:04.993
two browser tabs, and another window
are all connecting to this thing.

17
00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:12.545
You'll basically open up sockets and can
allow multiple things to connect to it.

18
00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:17.425
While this is interesting,
usually it is not the tool that you need,

19
00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:21.392
in terms of just taking
advantage of pure parallelism.

20
00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:25.482
So just know that it exists,
know that if you want to build

21
00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:29.331
some app that has five iframes
talking to each other.

22
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:32.378
This is probably something
that you should research, but

23
00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:36.120
that is not really taking us further
down the progressive web app road.
