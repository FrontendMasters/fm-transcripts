1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
let's just hop into the solution for this.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.822
We'll bring this over,

3
00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:11.769
go into our service worker,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Call

4
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.513
it,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

5
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.399
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So when it gets pushed,

6
00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.510
we have this textData
text which is coming in.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.860
And if that textData is TERMINATE,
well, we have an action in place here,

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.650
but if it's not,
we might do some other things, right?

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.569
If it's TERMINATE,
we'll do it, and we will end.

10
00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.470
So this gives us an opportunity,
what other push notifications do we have?

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.074
Depending on your application, it could be
a whole bunch of different kinds, right?

12
00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.880
For instance, in Chrome on my computer,
Google Calendar will send me

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.990
a notification for one of my many, many
meetings, and I'll get notified of those.

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.490
I don't have to have Google Calendar open
in order to see those, cuz that would

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.180
defeat the purpose having a notification
if I'm looking at the calendar, right?

16
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.020
In this case, it will receive those and
I will see it on the screen.

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.786
So in this case we have this event,
and the event has some data, and

18
00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:12.171
let's get the data from there,
and we'll console log it.

19
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and let's go ahead
and start by console logging it for now.

20
00:01:31.272 --> 00:01:33.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And let's just
head back over to our application.

21
00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:39.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's get results 50,
50 here.

22
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.103
All right, Frontend grocers, we'll go
ahead and we'll put something in the cart,

23
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:52.202
give myself a console in here
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, let's see.

24
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.750
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's check this,
am I online?

25
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.869
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Server is up.

26
00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:11.876
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

27
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.862
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, that's the
thing about these progressive web apps,

28
00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:23.250
it's hard to tell when the server's
not up because your app works offline.

29
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.790
All right, so we'll add that in.

30
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Put some bread in there,
and let's just order some bread.

31
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.342
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
so it's been complete,

32
00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:34.900
and we get this notification object.

33
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.860
Now, this isn't doing us a lot of good.

34
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.448
Right, it's great to
have it in the console,

35
00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:40.525
because we all know that as soon
as you order some groceries,

36
00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:43.160
the first thing you do is you
check the console, right?

37
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.438
That's what my mother
does when she does it.

38
00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:50.600
It's obviously a tried and
true user interface pattern.

39
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.700
No, that's not good enough for us.

40
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.580
What we're gonna do is we're going to send
them a notification alerting them that

41
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.180
their order has been placed.

42
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.547
So what we'll do is again, we'll see,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: if

43
00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:10.013
('notification',
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If we have a notification

44
00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:11.009
property, right?

45
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:15.990
Let's not do anything in here,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: In the jsonData.

46
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.259
All right, so
if there is an event.notification,

47
00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.320
let's just pull that out
using destructuring.

48
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.308
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll have access
to that, and then where were we?

49
00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:38.440
self.registration,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .shownotification.

50
00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.415
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
that takes the two arguments, and

51
00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:46.891
we got a little bit of help from
Visual Studio code in this case,

52
00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:49.370
where it takes the title and
the notification options.

53
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.208
So what we'll do is we will pass
in the notification.title and

54
00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:57.676
the second option will just be a body for
now,

55
00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:01.168
I'll just give it a body and
an image with it.

56
00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:05.220
Which will be the body of
the notification, right?

57
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.970
We can see if we look right
here what we have to work with.

58
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.140
We have a title and we have a body.

59
00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.560
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we can also display an icon.

60
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.680
So for the https we have,
remember this is a progressive web app.

61
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.380
We created icons that were gonna
go on the home screen, right?

62
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.702
We can use those same icons in the
notifications so that the user can see.

63
00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:28.531
Cuz on Chrome on the desktop they're
actually gonna see the Chrome icon and

64
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:31.870
that will be off to the side,
this let's them know that it's us,

65
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.230
we're saying hi, cool.

66
00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:40.283
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Localhost:3100,

67
00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:48.258
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: /launcher-icon-4x,

68
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.256
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Awesome, so

69
00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:59.433
that will update our app,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This

70
00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.575
will be our event data.

71
00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:09.958
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

72
00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.700
we'll add, what do I wanna do?

73
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.799
Some unsweetened organic almond milk?

74
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.029
Throw that in there, and
I'm going to CHECKOUT.

75
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.839
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm
just gonna close that.

76
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Look at that.

77
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.740
Even with the window closed, I just got
a notification saying my order was placed.

78
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.214
It's almost like I installed an app in
my browser and it was able to listen for

79
00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:41.530
things when I didn’t have a client
connected to it, right, really cool.

80
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.977
Again, this is creating that
feel of a native experience but

81
00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:49.170
getting all the great parts of the web
where you can just get the things that

82
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.539
have changed in cache.

83
00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.049
You don’t have to download
a new app every time, right,

84
00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:55.574
it’s kind of like you get to
have your cake and eat it too.

85
00:05:55.574 --> 00:06:00.378
I do wanna show you something slightly
more advanced that we'll just kind of

86
00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:01.664
look at in the code.

87
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.869
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Which is you
can put a click [INAUDIBLE] so

88
00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:14.263
when the notifications click, and
that is for all service workers,

89
00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:18.150
you install it the same as fetch,
or install, or activate.

90
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.251
You say service worker, when someone
clicks on one of my notifications this is

91
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:23.380
what I want you to do.

92
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.595
And the notification that they
actually clicked will be,

93
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.150
in this case again, event.notification.

94
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.720
And so we'll have a tag on it,
but we can close it,

95
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.640
we can also see hey,
do they have any windows from us open?

96
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.428
If so go ahead and
just use one of those windows,

97
00:06:40.428 --> 00:06:43.159
we don't need to open a brand new one,
right?

98
00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.760
So we can do very interesting things,
and again, there's that extensibility.

99
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.550
We can go ahead and
figure out our surroundings.

100
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.940
It's not like hey,
this is the default behavior.

101
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.690
Take it,
you have all of JavaScript behind you and

102
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.340
the ability to kind of figure out
what's going on in the browser.
