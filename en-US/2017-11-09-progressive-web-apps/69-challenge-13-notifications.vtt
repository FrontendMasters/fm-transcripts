&gt;&gt; Steve: So what we're gonna do is
we are going to implement it in our

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.160
application, our job is right now,
Mike set up push.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.229
And push, he set up for
that termination, but

4
00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.470
we can also send other
things from there as well.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.373
What we're gonna try to do is,

6
00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:22.634
we're getting already a JSON payload
every time an order is placed.

7
00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:27.518
So every time an order is placed we will
receive that payload and we're gonna

8
00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:32.723
notify the user that hello, everything's
great, your order has been placed.

9
00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:35.059
This is ideally an Instacart clone, right?

10
00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.061
So they have placed the order,
they have gone about their business,

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.720
we wanna tell them after the fact
that everything is good to go.
