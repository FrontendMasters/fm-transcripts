00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thankfully, we're not going
to get into server-side rendering for

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.200
an exercise.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.840
It is not a small project.

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.240
There's really no way to do it,
at least with React, in 30 minutes, but

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.580
we're going to do our enhanced
client-side rendering.

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.680
So here's what I want us to do,
in index type EJS in the body, I want

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.150
us to have something that has the nav bar
or the menu bar at the top and the footer.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.950
And you may just strip away everything
that looks like it's URL specific.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.523
So you might see on the root of the app,

10
00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:41.170
you might see something with a class
called home, that's home specific content.

11
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.750
So if you just looked at the home or

12
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.070
the route URL of the app and
delete that home dev and

13
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.084
everything inside it, you'll be left with
basically all of the URL agnostic UI.

14
00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:03.080
And optionally,
you can go to the site spinkit,

15
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.380
which is, these are some
great CSS only spinners, and

16
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.430
you can wire that up and put that in
place of where that home used to be.

17
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.330
So we have a nice little
spinner while we wait for

18
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.720
the client side stuff to download.

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160
Lastly, because I'm only gonna
give you about ten minutes for

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.200
this, I wanna show you how you
can really easily grab HTML here.

21
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.900
So I've got my elements tab here.

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.370
I'm gonna click on.

23
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.860
I heard that Steve, you were thinking it.

24
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.660
So if I right click on this, I can see
that there's an edit as HTML option.

25
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.780
And what we end up with
is a nice big text area.

26
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.890
So you can copy this.

27
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.430
Maybe Google for HTML beautifier or

28
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.850
something like that to sort
out this jumbled thing.

29
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.360
But it should be a good indication
of what you want there.

30
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.090
Make sure it's only stuff that is inside.

31
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.750
It should really be the root element, so
that you don't add in extra script tags or

32
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.880
anything like that.

33
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.440
But everything inside root should work,
and this is that home thing, so

34
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.190
you basically delete that.

35
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.446
Grab what's in root,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

36
00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:15.612
you should be pretty much good to go.

37
00:02:15.612 --> 00:02:17.820
All right, so ten minutes for this.

38
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.370
And I do want you to look at
the Performance tab here.

39
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.410
And have the Performance tab open,
reload, and you'll see that snapshot,

40
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.030
like the film strip of images look
much better than it did before.

41
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.320
You should get below two seconds.
