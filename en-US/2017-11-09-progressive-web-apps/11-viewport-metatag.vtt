00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:05.337
&gt;&gt; Mike: So when we start simulating with
these virtual devices, we're going to be

2
00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:11.540
able to start seeing how we can make our
web application seem more native app like.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.260
And this comes by way of adding
extra metadata to our app,

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.800
little metatags and links and we'll talk
about something called the webap manifest.

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.329
But now that we have a means of running
our code on something that simulates

6
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.502
these devices, we'll start to see
that new kind of look-and-feel

7
00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:39.319
improvements start to pop up when we run
the device in those simulated modes.

8
00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:44.661
The first one, and let me also say
the current state of the project,

9
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:50.590
as if someone has paid absolutely no
attention to mob experience, right?

10
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.039
So the first thing we need to worry about
is making the view port look reasonable.

11
00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.554
And my favorite memory of
why this is important has to

12
00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:04.280
do with the original iPhone launch.

13
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.545
Where Steve Jobs pulls out the iPhone and
he's so excited.

14
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.060
There's a desktop class
web browser in this thing.

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.980
And he fires up the New York Times and

16
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.950
it's five columns wide with print
that's so tiny you can't even see it.

17
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.650
And the big feature that he was showing
off was he can double tap on a column and

18
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.720
it will smartly zoom in to a page.

19
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.750
And then you can double tap again and
it'll zoom out.

20
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.420
This is a crappy way
to experience the web.

21
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.227
It's almost like microfiche.

22
00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:35.189
I'm aging myself a little bit here.

23
00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.787
You could get little copies of newspapers
on little tiny film images and

24
00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.730
you had to zoom way in to
see what was going on there.

25
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.330
We don't want to make that
our user's experience.

26
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.810
They will leave us and go find someone
else that has done a better job.

27
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.860
So here, with this meta tag,
we can set the view port size so

28
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.420
that it is in alignment with what
users expect from native apps.

29
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.040
We'll see a bunch of metatags here,
but we'll call this the viewport one.

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.455
You'll see this common convention
as we've got a name attribute and

31
00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:11.160
a content attribute.

32
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.457
Think of this as key value pair.

33
00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:17.683
Viewport has this value,
the string for content here.

34
00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:24.224
And we can specify comma separated options
here that help us define what the initial

35
00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:30.440
size of the viewport is, and whether
the user can pinch to resize things.

36
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.730
And my advice here is to go for a native
app like experience, you cannot open

37
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.350
the Twitter native app and zoom in on
the Twitter logo in the address bar.

38
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.509
There's certain, maybe on an image you
can zoom in, but the vast majority of it,

39
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:46.970
it's sort of fixed in size.

40
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.620
So that would be this last option here.

41
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.350
User scalable?

42
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.920
No, but
this is a good starting point here.

43
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.530
I might add user scalable to
the end of this for many apps.

44
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.860
And you can see that we have device
width as an available value.

45
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.200
So the browser will detect that, and
it will know that the device is this wide.

46
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.890
And it will sort of put that in instead
of having to specify the number there.
