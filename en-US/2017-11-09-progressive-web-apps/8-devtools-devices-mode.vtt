&gt;&gt; Mike North: The thing I wanna talk
about next is, now that we have this app

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.770
running, hopefully you got
a chance to measure it and

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.650
maybe you tried to see that tree diagram
where we can see the breakdown of things.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.740
This is great in terms of instrumenting
things, but we also wanna make sure that

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.790
we can see what this thing
looks like on a mobile device.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.618
So let's talk for a moment about kind of

7
00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:27.258
simulating what it is to
see this app on mobile.

8
00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:32.122
So the first thing that you should reach
for in Chrome, and also in Firefox,

9
00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:33.952
and I believe Safari, now.

10
00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:38.671
They have a devices mode
where you can pick a popular

11
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:43.281
mobile phone version like
a Google Galaxy 5S, or

12
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.926
something like that, or an iPhone 6.

13
00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:50.919
And it will set the screen dimensions
exactly to what you can expect there

14
00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:56.240
because that's probably the highest level
problem that people typically encounter.

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.770
Something's too wide or
the text wraps when they shouldn't.

16
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.520
There are certain very
narrow versions of iPhones,

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.280
like if you try an iPhone SE size here.

18
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.520
I think the shopping cart icon might
wrap on to a second row on the app bar.

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.650
So we can see that even with this, which
I did not put that in there as a bug for

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.500
you to find, that was just I
failed to checked that one thing.

21
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.030
But this is a great starting point.

22
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.090
You should think of it as really limited
to two things, or really, three things.

23
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.390
One is the screen dimensions,
the second is the user agent.

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.220
So there are sometimes things
that will sniff user agents and

25
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.160
do certain things for like a mobile OS.

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
Maybe you know there's a special
mobile version of some site and

27
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.020
you wanna be sure that you get that if
you hit it with an iPhone user agent.

28
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.672
This would be effective for
testing that, and

29
00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.208
the third is a little difficult
to see on the right, here, but

30
00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:57.812
you can provide simulated input for
certain types of sensors.

31
00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:02.759
So you can provide GPS coordinates,
and if your web application requests

32
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.489
the user's latitude and longitude,
and the browser supports that.

33
00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.819
You can say,
let's pretend I'm in Antarctica, and

34
00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.670
it'll read you location there, and
your app will behave accordingly.

35
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.780
Which is great for testing things where,
maybe if you're in an airport and

36
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.160
you're building the Delta app, you
could have something that pops down and

37
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.810
have maybe a test that you could run,
where you can simulate that really easily.

38
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.860
Also, you can simulate orientation, you
can change the way touch events happen.

39
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.990
So by default,
when you're in this device mode,

40
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.970
you're going to be aligned much
closer to the way mobile events work,

41
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.640
in terms of a long press
representing a right-click.

42
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.970
So everyone knows how that works, right?

43
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.830
You know how you tap to select text,
you kind of hold on it and

44
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.650
then you can sort of stretch it out?

45
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.280
So clicking in the screen with
your trackpad or your mouse.

46
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.450
It will feel more like mobile style.

47
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.330
But you can opt out of that at the bottom
here with this touch option go away

48
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.290
from device-based to the other option,
which it sorts of best up style.

49
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.886
So great, but limited.

50
00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:15.830
This is still in Chrome.

51
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.830
This is not the same thing
that's running on your devices.
