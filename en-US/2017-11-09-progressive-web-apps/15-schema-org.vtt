&gt;&gt; Mike North: The last thing
that I want to point out,

2
00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:06.868
I say this because one of our attributes
of progressive web apps is that they

3
00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:11.160
should be linkable and they should be
rich and discoverable when we search for

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.691
them and
when they show up in search results.

5
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:18.201
Schema.org metadata and
you can take the SEO Frontend Masters

6
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.419
course if you want to
dive deeper into this.

7
00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.659
But the idea is either we can add
attributes to our existing HTML or

8
00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.564
we can put script tags,

9
00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:33.629
which is just a way of placing
inert information into our HTML.

10
00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.439
It's not visible in any way to the user.

11
00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.919
It comes at almost no cost.

12
00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:44.111
But we can just drop this in often into
the same components that are used for

13
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:48.070
things that we wanna kind of
give machines clues about.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.112
So if we had a list of
groceries on a page,

15
00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:55.330
we might wanna represent them
as a product with a price.

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.495
And that means you have a much better shot
of a search engine potentially rolling out

17
00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:07.939
an update that says, okay, well if we find
products, now those are shopping result.

18
00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.460
And we'll show the product image and
the price, and a link there.

19
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.955
And that's, as opposed to a generic
search result, where it's like,

20
00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:22.201
here's a web page sir,
ma'am and a description of it.

21
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:25.699
The metadata will almost always work for
you and improve engagement.

22
00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:30.554
And that is what our next exercise
is all about, enhancing the app and

23
00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:33.410
making it look kind of like a native app.
