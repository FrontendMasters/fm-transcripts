00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
what we wanna do is take some step to

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.621
prompting the user to add to home screen.

3
00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:08.170
You can do that just with the web
app manifest if you like.

4
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.078
But if you're feeling ambitious you
may try to hook up this add to home

5
00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:18.085
screen library, it's not set up for
you yet but it's pretty simple.

6
00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:23.024
I want us to have FEGrocer as the app
name as opposed to using the title of

7
00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.312
the HTML page which is the default
that you'll fall back on.

8
00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:31.999
We should hook up a home screen icon,
and the icons are there for

9
00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.373
you, I've sized them they should all work.

10
00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:39.838
And we'll use that display attribute
in the web app manifest and

11
00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:44.302
the Apple specific meta tag to try and
strip the browser UI away,

12
00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:49.110
set up some theme colors, start_url,
this is an interesting one.

13
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.156
We're gonna set the start_url to period,
this is to try to make it so

14
00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:59.376
that no matter what page a user might
be on when they decide to add your app

15
00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:04.429
to home screen, the app will always
launch from the particular URL.

16
00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.608
And so imagine you're on a news site and
you're reading through it, and

17
00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:12.732
you say, this is very insightful,
I will add this to my home screen.

18
00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:16.828
You're always going to enter the app
through that specific article that you

19
00:01:16.828 --> 00:01:19.781
read, right, and
that is not how native apps behave.

20
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:25.808
They're sort of shattering the illusion
that we got this from the app store,

21
00:01:25.808 --> 00:01:28.603
and set your viewport up properly.

22
00:01:28.603 --> 00:01:31.386
So those were the requirements,
here are the tips so

23
00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:34.494
you don't have to worry about React and
webpack too much.

24
00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:39.127
So, there's a file in the client
folder called index.ejs,

25
00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:43.490
think of this as index.html,
so anything you add there,

26
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.762
like meta tags and link tags,
those will show up in your index.html.

27
00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:53.712
We have reached a point where we need
a new file, you'll notice that app.js,

28
00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:59.113
when we looked at that 80 kilobyte file,
everything is sort of packaged into that.

29
00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:04.414
We want a separate file and so
you're gonna go into either indexjs or

30
00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:08.227
app.jsx and
just add this line up at the top, and

31
00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:12.319
I believe if your webpack
efficient out there is even

32
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.989
an efficiency improvement I can make,
but this will work.

33
00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.435
And this would basically make it so
that when the app is built,

34
00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:23.300
that new file exists,
it's part of the built app.

35
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.569
It'll be in your dist folder if
you do NPM run build prod, and

36
00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.594
then make use of this mobile simulation
stuff either using, if you have

37
00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:37.972
simulator already installed, play with
it a little bit, see how it works.

38
00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:41.516
You may notice that some
things pop up in iOS,

39
00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:46.572
some little glitches that have to
do with the way webpack works.

40
00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:52.045
And right there we've discovered that the
world is not the same in mobile Safari,

41
00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:53.868
and if you have extra time,

42
00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:58.963
jump into this file here which represents
those little grocery item tiles.

43
00:02:58.963 --> 00:03:03.901
See if you can figure out how to add the
schema.org data, using the stuff I had on

44
00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:09.086
the slide for that product data, use that
as a template and just drop that in there.

45
00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:13.390
That would be adding that, making
things even more discoverable, right?

46
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.408
Great for e-commerce type applications.
