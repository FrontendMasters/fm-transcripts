00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can
also do the checkout.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.870
So you put stuff in the cart, neat.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.230
That's an exercise in futility if
you can't actually place the order.

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.580
In the cart store,
there is a method called do checkout.

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.750
This is very important, it handles the
very important job of doing the checkout.

6
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.602
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And in the other case,
we're going to want to go ahead and

7
00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.600
actually send the order, right?

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.490
After the API call is completed,
and we have dude the checkout,

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.130
we want to call restore cart to upstate
the client's view with any other change

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.720
that might have happened as a result
of the order creation, right?

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.790
The order's been created, empty the cart,
so on and so forth, right?

12
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.350
There is a restore cart method.
