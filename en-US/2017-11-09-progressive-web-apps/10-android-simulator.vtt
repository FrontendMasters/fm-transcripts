00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.836
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The Android equivalent
is a little bit more challenging but

2
00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.710
also valuable.

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.250
The first thing you will realize is that

4
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.650
local host doesn't work the same way
as it does in the Safari simulator.

5
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.325
So there is a special IP address,

6
00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:17.800
10.0.2.2 that represents
the machine running the simulator.

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.060
And you can connect to it with Chrome
dev tools in a way that's very similar

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.380
to the way I described
connecting to Safari.

9
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.580
So this is part of Android Studio,

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.270
which is an Android specific,
customized version of Eclipse.

11
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.970
It's a popular Java
development environment

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.820
with a bunch of Android
tools baked into it.

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.800
And we'll kind of walk
through the process here.

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.440
Now, this is significantly more
involved than getting set up for iOS.

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.180
But at least someone on your team
should have this set up ready to go.

16
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.870
Because there's certain things we're
going to deal with, today and tomorrow,

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.830
that are core fundamentals of
progressive web app technology

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.180
that really only start to
appear on Android devices.

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.910
Because Google sort of leaving
the chart with the specification and

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.670
with implementing it.

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.870
Android is the first place
we see some of these things.

22
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480
So once you have this development
environment installed,

23
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.520
the place to look here is
the Android Device Manager,

24
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.170
the AVD, or
Android Virtual Device Manager.

25
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.100
And when you fire it up,

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.390
you'll basically have the opportunity
to create a virtual device.

27
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.104
You'll quickly see that there are many,
many different options.

28
00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:38.213
I would encourage you to use a preset of
a popular device, rather than trying to

29
00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:41.824
customize your own, because Android
is such a flexible platform.

30
00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:49.510
You can design a device with 337 pixels
wide and get really weird with it.

31
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.180
That's not going to be useful for
your testing purposes.

32
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.870
But just pay attention to the screen size,

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.440
the screen resolution, meaning like,
the device/pixel ratio.

34
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.270
How many dots per inch there are, and

35
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.530
the Android version itself,
because that will generally let you know

36
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.370
what is the newest version of Chrome that
you can use on that Android version.

37
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.630
So you'll end up creating a system image.

38
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.340
This is sort of the disk for the device.

39
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.350
Think of it that way,
like if you install apps,

40
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.730
they stay on this virtual device, and

41
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.010
it's sort of like, this file represents
the hard drive, think of it that way.

42
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.610
And then you'll see that it shows up
in this list of virtual devices here.

43
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.930
So you could have a couple different ones.

44
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.748
I would say, a good starting point
is one tablet, one popular phone.

45
00:02:42.748 --> 00:02:44.300
That is good enough.

46
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.260
And then, you get a very similar
experience to that iOS simulator here.

47
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.960
So on the left,
you can see that is our web application so

48
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.670
this is running in Chrome.

49
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.410
And then on the right,
we see we've got our Android device.

50
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.500
And it looks pretty similar and
by connecting dev tools,

51
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.660
you can pause JavaScript,
and run lines of code,

52
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.370
and check to see if certain things
work and certain things don't.

53
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.580
So a really valuable set of tools,
and very important for

54
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.350
progressive web app technologies.

55
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.330
You will see there as a die-hard
focus on mobile usability.

56
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.800
So this is now something that
needs to be on your radar.
