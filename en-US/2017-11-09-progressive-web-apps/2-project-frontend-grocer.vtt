00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.590
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's talk
a little bit about this

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.730
example project that you checked out.

3
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.020
And part of the reason that Steve and I
spent so much time building this thing was

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.490
a lot of the example PWA apps out
there are really rudimentary.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.704
It's almost like TodoMVC, in a PWA sense.

6
00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:24.232
And the whole point of building rich
experiences like this is you should be

7
00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.898
able to do something that's
a little bit complex, right?

8
00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:31.939
That maybe it holds some state,
and the user can go offline and

9
00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.846
they can still do almost everything
that they were able to do while online.

10
00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:40.752
They should be able to reconnect to
the Internet and sync their data, and

11
00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:43.069
they should be able to get notifications.

12
00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.480
We're not looking just to make
a fast booting, single-page app.

13
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.910
We're looking to do things
that specifically were

14
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.472
just not possible in classic
web application land.

15
00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:03.446
And we're gonna do, not just one or
two things, not just, it works offline but

16
00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:08.590
it's still mostly just a web app, we're
gonna hit all of those different boxes.

17
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.338
So this will feel like where those
superhero abilities can be taken

18
00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:14.560
advantage of.

19
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.882
This will feel like a native app.

20
00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:21.302
And the idea here, if you've ever used
something like Instacart or a grocery

21
00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:26.440
delivery service of sorts, you have
different categories of groceries here.

22
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.810
And you can add some stuff to a cart and
increase the quantity and

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.520
you can see a total price.

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.395
And then you can check out and
at that point,

25
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:38.528
the contents of your cart become
an order that has been placed.

26
00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:43.528
And there are entire businesses
that are a much prettier,

27
00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:46.599
richer-looking version of this.

28
00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.760
But it involves holding state.

29
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.472
It involves retrieving data from an API.

30
00:01:52.472 --> 00:01:55.700
It involves pre-fetching a lot
of stuff in the background.

31
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.500
So some of these categories have
hundreds of grocery items, and

32
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.630
we don't wanna download 600 or

33
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.190
700 images in advance just so that we
can take advantage of them offline.

34
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.550
So we're going to really pour a heaping
helping of PWA sauce on this thing.

35
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.497
And what we're starting with is
really a classic, single-page app.

36
00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:21.234
This one happens to be built with React,
but

37
00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:26.140
the intent is that it's sort
of a generic view layer.

38
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.980
You're not going to be
touching the components.

39
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.410
We're gonna be working exclusively
in vanilla JavaScript modules.

40
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.910
So the only thing that you really need
to know is JavaScript fundamentals.

41
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.170
And we may introduce a couple concepts,
like if you're not used to promises, we're

42
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.320
gonna dive into those pretty deeply just
to make sure everyone's on the same page.

43
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.387
But other than that, you should see
this app evolve from a conventional

44
00:02:55.387 --> 00:03:00.962
2011 style mobile web experience to
something that when you show people,

45
00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:05.958
they will not believe that this is
purely built using web technology.

46
00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.520
We're gonna touch so many different areas.

47
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.829
And if you can't tell,

48
00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.900
I am super excited to be able to guide
you through this non-trivial example.

49
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.393
If you don't, like listening to
all of the wishes you had for

50
00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:26.857
things that could be done in the browser,
if you don't get to have a little

51
00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:32.058
taste of something that gives you new
ideas about the way you could take

52
00:03:32.058 --> 00:03:37.114
your product in a new direction,
we have not done our job properly.

53
00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:41.570
I mean, we're tasting the whole
buffet here of PWA technologies.
