1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.298
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So Mike just covered how
to push notifications from the server to

2
00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:06.310
the client.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.009
Now, this is really useful for
doing a lot of things.

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.570
You could update data and
IndexedDB database.

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.810
You could terminate a service worker.

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.930
But occasionally you're going to
want to actually show the user

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.020
something that happened.

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.670
And this again, is something that
we take for granted in native apps.

9
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.800
Whether we take for
granted every time I look at my phone,

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.321
that there's like a wall of different
notifications from seven different apps.

11
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:33.495
Turns out that we can also participate
in this inside of the browser.

12
00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.832
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But as Mike covered
earlier, we do need permission, right?

13
00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:40.662
If the user does not grant us permission,

14
00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:42.920
then we canâ€™t send them
any kind of notification.

15
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.220
This is true of native as well,
the user has to give us permission,

16
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.460
and the interesting part is if a user

17
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.170
denies us permission,
then we're denied forever.

18
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.317
And this is slightly problematic,

19
00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:04.260
this is why sometimes you'll see
a not real notification first.

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.640
Like hey, wouldn't it be great to get this
notifications and then if you hit yeah,

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.590
would be, then you get prompted.

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.483
That is a situation where they don't
want to show you the browser's request

23
00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:18.263
permission because if
that were to happen and

24
00:01:18.263 --> 00:01:20.911
you said, no, they are shut out forever.

25
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.040
So, the notification permission
is in one of three states.

26
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.550
Default, which is you
haven't been asked yet.

27
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.581
Granted, which means you have
turned on the fire host and

28
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:33.180
you already started
receiving notifications.

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.500
And denied, which means you've
turned them off forever.

30
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.990
You can check that later

31
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.046
using Notification.permission to see
what permission you actually have.

32
00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:46.790
So again, in the same way we checked does
service worker exist in this situation,

33
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.370
we can do the exact same thing by
checking notification permissions and

34
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.110
see where we are.

35
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.509
So, one thing you might choose
to do is see if it's default,

36
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.480
then go ahead and try to show them the fun
pop up and then show them the real one.

37
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.194
This is what it looks like,
this is on this page, if they hit the x,

38
00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:08.409
they actually stay in
default at this point.

39
00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.069
They have not officially said block.

40
00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.902
They haven't said allow, but
they haven't said block either,

41
00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.350
and this will allow you another attempt.

42
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.847
Now, most users don't know
that little x exists and

43
00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:24.670
they are most likely to block you if they
don't wanna see those notifications.

44
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.368
You can also see that
Notification.requestPermission returned

45
00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:31.456
a promise
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

46
00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:35.270
like everything else,
we wanna use progressive enhancement.

47
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.323
Our code will theoretically throw
an exception if there is no notification

48
00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:39.540
object in the window object.

49
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.909
If we try to call requestPermission or any
of those properties, that will blow up.

50
00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.533
So we do the same thing we
do with service worker,

51
00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.740
we check to see if the notification
object is in the window.

52
00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.649
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If it is and
we haven't asked for permission yet, so

53
00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.104
we're default,
then we go ahead ask for permission.

54
00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:01.647
If we've gotten that permission,

55
00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:06.680
then creating a notification
is relatively straightforward.

56
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.970
We create a new notification.

57
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.150
And again, this is where that checking
on the first line to see if notification

58
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.590
exists is really useful.

59
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.931
With that notification
we can give it a title,

60
00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.159
which is the first
argument is that string.

61
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.829
The second argument,
which we'll take a look at in a second,

62
00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.249
is a object of options.

63
00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.483
Not dissimilar from some of the other APIs
that we've looked at over the course of

64
00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:29.990
the day.

65
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.185
In this case, we're setting the body,

66
00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:35.749
which you can kinda think of as
the subtitle of the notification.

67
00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:38.160
We can also include an icon.

68
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.663
And when we go over the options,

69
00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:42.849
different options are supported
by different operating systems.

70
00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.986
This includes mobile as
well as desktop browsers.

71
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.800
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If we've been denied,
then we can do other obnoxious stuff.

72
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.400
Don't do this, nobody will like
you if you do this, thank you.

73
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.579
That's my public service announcement for
the day.

74
00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.729
We can also trigger notifications
from service workers.

75
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.909
All right, this means that when
something happens in the background,

76
00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.150
if that browser tab isn't open,
you can still trigger a notification.

77
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.650
But the syntax is a little bit different.

78
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.450
If you just say new notification,
the user will never see that notification.

79
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.102
The syntax from doing it from
a service worker is to get the service

80
00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:29.020
worker's registration and
trigger the show notification method.

81
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.915
And that takes all of the same options as
new notification does, but you do need to

82
00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:36.485
find that registered service worker and
trigger it through that method.

83
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I don't know,
I don't make the rules.

84
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Cool, so, notifications, two arguments.

85
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.460
A single string for the title and
that object full of options.

86
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.509
We can kinda think about the options
broke apart in three different sections.

87
00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.869
Which is the visual options, like is
there an icon, what is the body of it?

88
00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:01.970
Behavioral options, like what happens
when the user starts to interact with it?

89
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.120
And other kind of informational
options that we'll take a look at.

90
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.080
So the visual options.

91
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.896
We have the body,
which we saw in the icon,

92
00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:13.044
which is a small image
that'll go along with it.

93
00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:15.010
Other operating systems,
you can do a larger image.

94
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.026
This would be, if you had an OS that
supported a notification where the image

95
00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:20.300
was the notification.

96
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.510
You wanna notify them about a new
Instagram picture or something like that.

97
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.600
I think that this is primarily
supported on Chrome OS, so

98
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.630
some of these are very specific.

99
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.510
The normal ones you're going
to use are body and icon.

100
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.239
Vibrate, that is mobile specific, my
laptop as far as I know does not vibrate.

101
00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.889
Sound, you can attribute a sound with it.

102
00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.280
And direction, left to right or
right to left for different languages.

103
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.650
By default it's auto, which is
probably what you want in this case.

104
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.630
The behavioral options,
these are kinda interesting.

105
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.530
So you have a tag, the tag is
what kind of notification it is.

106
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.040
Right, this way, let's say you're
sending a notification for

107
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.419
every 10% of upload progress.

108
00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.961
You probably don't wanna
send ten of those.

109
00:06:03.961 --> 00:06:05.963
So the tag is the type of notification so

110
00:06:05.963 --> 00:06:09.910
they can be grouped by operating
systems that support grouping.

111
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.720
Data is literally any object
that you wanna include.

112
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.980
This could be important information
that you wanna handle on a click, or

113
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.080
anything along those lines.

114
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.380
When we trigger notification
on the MacOS or

115
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.460
Windows, you'll see that
automatically goes away.

116
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.920
RequireInteraction, it will stick around
until the user interacts with it.

117
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.691
Renotify will actually show back up,
this is mobile only.

118
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:42.100
And silent, it'll be silent.

119
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.173
So talking about notifications is kind
of hard to capture in slides, and

120
00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:49.200
it's also fairly boring
to talk about in slides.

121
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.938
So what we'll do is we'll play around
with them in a little contrive safe space

122
00:06:51.938 --> 00:06:52.440
for a second.

123
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.899
So this is a little glitch
called notify the authorities.

124
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.069
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And loading it, cool.

125
00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.896
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so you see the first
thing, I am prompted to allow, so

126
00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.609
we will allow notifications.

127
00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:16.350
And we can see that thanks for granting
permission, we promise not to abuse it.

128
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.770
Cool, the other thing we can do is we say,
show me an image, and

129
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.569
this is literally just
something to trigger.

130
00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.440
This one is actually gonna
come from the service worker.

131
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.031
We'll take a look at the code in a second,
but we click it.

132
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:31.210
Oops, what happened to my image?

133
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.488
Let's see, let's take a look at our code.

134
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: My remote
Bill Murray didn't work.

135
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.910
That's okay, we'll check that out.

136
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.269
Let's take a look at the code.

137
00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:56.279
So in this case, if we try to get
that mystery.png, what we'll do is

138
00:07:56.279 --> 00:08:00.450
we'll say self.registration will
show a notification in this case.

139
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.710
This will be the fetching
my mystery image.

140
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.580
We'll give it an icon, which just happens
to be in assets is just a png file.

141
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.620
This is the URL for it.

142
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.600
Then we have some data.

143
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.130
This is, theoretically in this case,

144
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:20.530
the site that the image came from and just
some arbitrary data of favorite color.

145
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.908
And this object we can use, when they
click on the event it will be included

146
00:08:24.908 --> 00:08:28.010
with the event.notification in this case.

147
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.780
We can also include actions,
which I'll show you in a second.

148
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.630
On different operating systems
this'll look different.

149
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.580
Like in one case we have
just a general click.

150
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.460
On other operating systems like Android
you'll have the ability to take different

151
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.390
actions based on the notification.

152
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.670
This is also true when we see it
in Chrome there'll be a more and

153
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.870
you'll actually see
a few different options.

154
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.150
And you'll see that there's
just action and title.

155
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.070
And the action is much like
a tag in this case, and

156
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.396
the title is what will actually
be displayed to the user.

157
00:08:58.396 --> 00:09:03.940
And then in a service worker,
we only have access to notification click.

158
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.740
Inside notification click,
that'll be where we have an event object.

159
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.330
That event object will have
a property called notification, and

160
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.520
notification will have all
of the different, the data,

161
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.960
which action was clicked,
if any, so on and so forth.
