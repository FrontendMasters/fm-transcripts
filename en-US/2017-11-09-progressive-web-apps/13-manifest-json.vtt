00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.990
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Here is something that is
part of the progressive web app standard,

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.230
and it is the concept of
a web application manifest.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.790
So you will end up creating
a new JSON file, and

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.890
essentially referring to
it from your index.html,

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.030
which is to say here is where you may find
my manifest, here's the path to this file.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.090
And in this manifest we
can do a couple of things.

7
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.050
We can define our app name,

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.660
again this is something short
that goes underneath an icon.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.410
We can specify icons which, they're
little objects that we can put in here.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.750
So, at the very least,

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.680
you should make sure that you
provide a 192 and a 512 pixel image.

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.620
These are used for
the home screen icon, and

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.100
for a splash screen on Android devices
that support this kind of thing.

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.020
So as the app boots up,
while you're making that first request, or

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.560
while it's sort of restoring memory
to give you like your state back,

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.950
this is what you'll see.

17
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.860
So it will like make a splash screen for
you.

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.130
And then we get a theme color and
a background color, and that just well,

19
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.010
if the browser supports it, it'll color
sort of the address bar and the menu bar,

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.470
so you could make that
like your brands color.

21
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.610
And background color is sort of
like if you do not color the body,

22
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.310
this is sort of what unstyled area of
your HTML body will look like sort of.

23
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.590
And also, when you pull down,
if you have pull to refresh or

24
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.880
something like that,
oftentimes that'll sort of like

25
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.810
hidden space that'll be
the background color as well.

26
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.590
This display option in this manifest is
very much like that full screen mode.

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.130
There are four options we can use,
no browser currently supports them all.

28
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.850
But let's go from bottom to top here,
so browser this is like the default.

29
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.600
If you don't specify anything at all,
you get browser.

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.990
You get the full address bar
like the complete browser UI,

31
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.970
just as if you visited that link and
it was not a progressive web app.

32
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.150
Minimal UI,
it is defined as a light browser UI.

33
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.240
The way I can best explain this if
you've ever been in an Android or

34
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.290
an iOS app and you've visited a URL that's
posted in a tweet or something like that.

35
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.470
You find that you're sort
of taken to that page but

36
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.900
you don't have the ability to then
like access that URL and change it.

37
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.250
It's not a full web experience and

38
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.940
you might not have bookmarks there,
maybe just the share button.

39
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.580
So you can log in, but it's a very
abbreviated browser experience.

40
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.430
Stand alone is what you'll get, it's as
close as we can get to full screen in iOS.

41
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.110
Now we can't get rid of the battery or
the clock or

42
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.910
like the cellular and Wi-Fi signal
strength, but it's pretty good.

43
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.940
We're like 40 pixels short of full screen.

44
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.580
And then finally full screen is every
pixel, this would be great for a game.

45
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.010
Where there might not be an up
direction to this thing, and

46
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.980
you just want to take over
all of the real state.

47
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.140
The ones that are currently supported
broadly are standalone and browser.

48
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.600
And the idea is, if a browser doesn't
support what you've asked for

49
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.370
it will go down to the next one.

50
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.220
So if you say I want full screen,
you might end up with standalone.

51
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.617
It's as good as it can get, and that's why
it's sort of a linear progression like

52
00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:42.054
that, and ultimately fallback to browser.

53
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:45.369
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Did you have
a question about this?

54
00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.556
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That, think it and it'll
happen, you perfected that just there.

55
00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:51.578
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sweet, sometimes people
call it psychic pizza just as you're

56
00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:54.270
thinking about it I've already
got something for you.
