&gt;&gt; Mike North: And finally, hopefully,
you're a little bit terrified by

2
00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.253
the syntax I showed you, this is
pretty miserable stuff to work with.

3
00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:12.285
There is a library called IDB and

4
00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:20.350
it is written by a Chrome
developer advocate, Jay.

5
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.380
It's basically, conceptually, an identical
API, except it's all promise-based.

6
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.870
So we can use promises instead
of all of these strange

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.170
decades old callback
style of doing things.

8
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.930
here's an example of us
opening a database and then

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.500
passing in this upgradeDb callback, that's
gonna be the same as onupgradeneeded.

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.860
You're gonna get the same
argument passed to it.

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.970
It's an attempt to really preserve
the API, but just to make it promisified.

12
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.210
So it's a super lightweight library.

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.668
And honestly, I would advise you
not try to use IndexedDb by itself.

14
00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:06.710
Don't do it, use this.

15
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.300
There's another good one
called local forage,

16
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.600
which can use IndexedDb or local storage.

17
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.096
But it abstracts the IndexedDb
concept away from you a little bit,

18
00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:23.390
because it's just designed
differently with different goals.

19
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.320
But not a bad library to
use if it meets your needs.

20
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.900
Here, you can see that we get this
promise from opening the database.

21
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.280
We have this callback for
upgrading the database.

22
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.460
And then by the time the upgrade is
complete, the promise will resolve,

23
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.910
and then we get this db object in
this second block of code here.

24
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.460
We can create a transaction, do some stuff
as it relates to one of these object

25
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.110
stores, and then complete the transaction
and the operation will finish.
