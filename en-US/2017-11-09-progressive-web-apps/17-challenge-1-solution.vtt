WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:04.787
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're going to go through
the process of adding some mobile

2
00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:11.220
optimized metadata to this app so it does
not look bad anymore on a mobile device.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.710
So let's go on over to our editor here.

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.950
And I'm on the master branch,
let me just open up the files.

5
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.960
So the first thing I wanna do
is make it a little bigger.

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.230
I wanna worry about the web app
manifest because this is sort of

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.000
a less trivial thing to do
with some of the other things.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.090
And we'll just put the icing
on the cake at the end.

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.020
So what I will do is in this
client folder, we need a new file.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.663
This JSON file, I just wanted to exist
as sort of a static thing that is passed

11
00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.220
through as part of our production build.

12
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.272
And if we look in the dist folder,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We've got the certificates,

13
00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:58.290
those we put there manually, index.html.

14
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.110
You see like our CSS gets embedded in
there and we'll talk about that next.

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.770
But we don't have a web app manifest,

16
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.710
we have these images here and
that is interesting.

17
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.181
These launcher icon things.

18
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:17.940
But if we want a new file, so
here's what we're gonna do.

19
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.460
We'll create a new file, and we're gonna
just call it web-app-manifest.json.

20
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.109
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And I'm just gonna go
back to my slide here with this sample.

21
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.170
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And unfortunately,
we'll have to copy this in two halves.

22
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.220
Sorry for the screen swiping.

23
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.729
But here we are and
we won't worry about icons just yet.

24
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.590
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
this is sort of a very basic manifest.

25
00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.770
And if I were to build here,
I'm gonna do npm run build.dev.

26
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.790
I'm just doing it that
way cuz it's faster and

27
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340
it doesn't get optimized quite as much.

28
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.200
And in this dist folder, I was I was
hoping that WebAp Manifest would show up.

29
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.030
It in fact does not.

30
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.009
The reason here is that the build
tool we're using Webpack by default.

31
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.265
It's just looking for
certain things that are necessary and

32
00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:29.320
connected to critical resources that we
define as these are the things we need.

33
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.177
So this file exists but
think of it as like, it exists, and

34
00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:40.140
then it is found to be unused, and
then not included in our dist folder.

35
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.720
What we wanna do in order to say that we
need to use this is we're gonna use this

36
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.190
file loader thing.

37
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.733
And I'm just gonna copy one of
the existing entries there.

38
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:55.589
And that the way this works in case
you're curious is like we can't

39
00:02:55.589 --> 00:03:02.282
get rid of this if we want so we say file
loader and then an exclamation mark and

40
00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:08.140
then everything after that is
like what are we loading?.

41
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.708
So we can just say web-app-manifest here.

42
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.230
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now we could add this name
thing, think of it like a query param.

43
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.240
If the file in our project
structure was named

44
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.700
differently than what we want this
thing to be when we build the app.

45
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.192
So if I add this here,
I'm just gonna call it foo.json.

46
00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:38.899
Build again,
we should see a foo.json pop up in dist.

47
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.470
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And indeed, there it is.

48
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.989
And it's the web-app-manifest.

49
00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.835
So what we were saying here is,
the convention is keep the name the same.

50
00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:54.920
But this name, like option,
allows us to change it.

51
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.840
But we're not gonna worry
about the name option,

52
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.340
we're just gonna keep it like this.

53
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.780
Now the reason I did it for
these images above is I

54
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.310
had them in a image folder and I kind of
wanted to take them out of the folder.

55
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.580
So more than just renaming,
this can be sort of reorganizing as well.

56
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.410
Think of the name of the file as
the relative path within that dist folder.

57
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.820
So great,
we've got our web app manifest and

58
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.910
the last thing we need is this
important meta tag up at the top.

59
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.510
We'll have to slightly, oops,
pardon me, slightly alter it.

60
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.350
So we're gonna look in
this index.ejs file.

61
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.690
This represents our index.html.

62
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.630
We're gonna be working with this a lot.

63
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.960
The EJS just means that we
can embed JavaScript, EJS.

64
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:52.117
So we could even put in here,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We get 12.

65
00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:53.802
So if you've used Ruby
on Rails you've seen-

66
00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:54.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You get seven.

67
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.263
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What's that?

68
00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:58.159
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You get seven.

69
00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.514
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You had a plus,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Plus four, sorry, seven.

70
00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:05.648
And I, 9, we would get 12.

71
00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:08.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No, we get seven.

72
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.850
It's hard to talk and
type at the same time.

73
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.060
So on my clipboard hopefully,
nope, don't have it anymore.

74
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.060
So we've got this tag and we just need
to change this to web-app-manifest.

75
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.635
I'm naming this very deliberately
because when we start working,

76
00:05:25.635 --> 00:05:29.460
getting deeper into progressive web apps,
we may have like up to three or

77
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.420
four different types of manifests.

78
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.383
We will regrettably
touch on the app cache,

79
00:05:35.383 --> 00:05:38.229
hopefully at the very end of this journey.

80
00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.012
And we're gonna have that a cautionary
app cache tale that has a manifest.

81
00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:45.606
When we talk about pre caching,

82
00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:50.330
assets we know about it build time we've
got a manifest there, here's a third one.

83
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.490
So name name wisely.

84
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.910
And now if we build again,

85
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.190
we're gonna see that in this
dist folder at the very bottom.

86
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.520
Expect this thing to pop up.

87
00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:06.493
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Where did you go?

88
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.760
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Maybe I do need the name.

89
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.970
Interesting, I do need the name,
by default it's the hash of the file.

90
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.760
That's why we had this filename as 9010,
that's the checksum, so here we go.

91
00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.018
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
the thing that makes that complicated,

92
00:06:32.018 --> 00:06:37.300
is now I need that to be in my HTML, so
I need to pass that value around, not fun.

93
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.570
All right, Web app manifest at the bottom.

94
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.140
There we go.

95
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.586
And if we fire the app up,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just with run serve.

96
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.570
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
I'm going to open up my devtools here.

97
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.330
So now this is the running app.

98
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.890
And I want to show you a way that we can
kinda take a look at this as a first pass.

99
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.602
So this application tab, if you haven't
been using progressive web apps much,

100
00:07:06.602 --> 00:07:09.626
if you haven't been playing in this area,

101
00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:14.520
you've probably been hardly
even noticing this thing.

102
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.820
There's a lot of good stuff in here.

103
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.760
We're gonna be working with it all day.

104
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.962
Manifest is right at the top of
the list and you can see that yes,

105
00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:30.410
I have in fact found that file and
we're not saying much here yet.

106
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.670
Let's see what's going on.

107
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.669
I have some errors.

108
00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.920
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I expected
to see some stuff here.

109
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.252
Let's make sure the file's
where it's supposed to be.

110
00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:48.584
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Also make sure you
don't have an old service worker.

111
00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:49.620
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Could be, I do.

112
00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:01.420
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Web app manifest,
there it is.

113
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.640
Is it invalid JSON?

114
00:08:05.814 --> 00:08:09.450
Display standalone, it's the comments,
the comments are screwing me up.

115
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.180
Good old JSON, we can thank good
'ol Doug Crockford for that.

116
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.780
Another illustrious
Frontend Masters instructor.

117
00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:26.268
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So you're seeing already,

118
00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:33.560
we have to be kind of wise when debugging
these things in that I got no feedback.

119
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.960
This is one of the down sides
of progressive enhancement or

120
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.610
one of the debugging challenges
of Webb app manifest was found.

121
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.450
It couldn't be processed,
and so I was told nothing.

122
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.239
So now hopefully we're in a better stage.

123
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.990
And we are.

124
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.659
There's my theme color,
there's my background color,

125
00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:54.079
little color swatches there.

126
00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:56.060
I've got Frontend Masters up there.

127
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.803
Let me actually bring this into my code.

128
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.129
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I could add
a short name really easily,

129
00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:13.700
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Like that, and

130
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.600
it should pop up right here.

131
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.530
And it does.

132
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.890
So now we're in a pretty good state.

133
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.990
Frontend Grocer, and
let's add an icon here.

134
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.190
So I'm gonna add,
I have to cheat a little bit.

135
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.720
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Where are those icons?

136
00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:46.890
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There's one,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Again, comments, no good.

137
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.340
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And that's the wrong
file name, I will fix in a moment.

138
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.810
So I'm just gonna look in my dist folder.

139
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.162
And I see I've got image, and

140
00:09:59.162 --> 00:10:05.500
then launcher-icon-,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: 1x, 2x, and 4x.

141
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.565
So if you open these up in your
favorite little image editing

142
00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:14.579
software,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You could

143
00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:19.980
have figured out that, I think,
2x is the 192 pixel one.

144
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:26.560
Let me double check that that's the right
file name, launcher.icon -1x.png.

145
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.030
And we'll add our 512 which is the 4x.

146
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.863
&gt;&gt; Mike North: If we refresh
we should start to see, hey,

147
00:10:47.863 --> 00:10:50.360
some nice images popping up.

148
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.860
So this is sort of giving us a little
summary of how this is going to work here.

149
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.601
So when we start to look at,
and let's add a start_url here,

150
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:01.051
that was one of our requirements.

151
00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:09.130
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm gonna run our first
Lighthouse score after we add this in.

152
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:16.200
Okay, so
it is unfortunate that we have a little

153
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.180
back flip we have to go through to run
Lighthouse and it has to do with HTTPS.

154
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.610
I will show you step by step how to do it.

155
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.750
Step one, make a build of your app.

156
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.870
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And step two is
going to be serve it over HTTP/2.

157
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.360
And the reason is,
we're using two different servers here.

158
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.313
One of the checks involves trying
to make a plain HTTP request,

159
00:11:46.313 --> 00:11:48.840
and being redirected to HTTPS.

160
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.336
Your apps should do this in production,
web pack does not do that.

161
00:11:54.336 --> 00:11:59.260
Web pack dev server just serves over
HTTPS, it doesn't even listen on HTTP.

162
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.710
So now we can do run, serve and
add this HTTP2 option.

163
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.499
And I just wanna prove to you that this
actually works the way I claim it does.

164
00:12:10.516 --> 00:12:13.673
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
we look at the network request here.

165
00:12:13.673 --> 00:12:16.728
The protocol htttp1.1.

166
00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:20.050
So we'll launch it in this other mode.

167
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:26.608
We're gonna change the port to 5000.

168
00:12:26.608 --> 00:12:30.850
And so we can see that our app
is being served at over h2.

169
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:37.420
But you can also see that HTTP1 is used
for our fetch as well cuz the little

170
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:43.780
express server in Node JS that's serving
up our JSON that is not running in HTTP2.

171
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.530
So what we can do now is run Lighthouse
and let's see where we're at.

172
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.060
We have to close devtools first just so
we can get like a nice, stable baseline.

173
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.290
Let's see how we look.

174
00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:01.188
I ran this this morning before
making any enhancements to the app,

175
00:13:01.188 --> 00:13:03.095
and we were at a 34.

176
00:13:03.095 --> 00:13:04.429
So let's see where we're at.

177
00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:07.900
We've forgotten to do
the little view port stuff.

178
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.200
And you can see that's how our app looks
on a mobile device, pretty terrible.

179
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.540
So we'll have to go back and do that.

180
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.890
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And we're at a 45,
so we're improving.

181
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:29.470
But it's also giving us some nice feedback
as to what we can do to make this better.

182
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.610
So first off, it's giving us
a meta tag that we should use.

183
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.364
Theme color,
we can put that in right away,

184
00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:39.450
&gt;&gt; Mike North: In our index.ejs.

185
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.034
And we'll use the same theme
color that is our manifest,

186
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:49.350
it's just sort of a different
representation for it.

187
00:13:55.599 --> 00:14:00.173
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And we don't have a view
port tag yet so I'm gonna go and

188
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:04.461
steal my recommended view
port tag from the notes.

189
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.604
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
we'll add those apple tags there, as well.

190
00:14:15.885 --> 00:14:17.140
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm just
gonna grab all three.

191
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.916
Two and

192
00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:25.324
three.

193
00:14:27.977 --> 00:14:33.310
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And we'll make FE
grocer there, and we can launch it.

194
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.150
Actually, we'll have to build it one more
time and then start the server again.

195
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.521
So developing with HTTP 2
right now is a bit of a pain.

196
00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:48.970
&gt;&gt; Mike North: But it is very common for
apps to be served with HTTP 2 these days.

197
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.923
If you use a CDN, in a particular,
if you use Cloudflare,

198
00:14:51.923 --> 00:14:54.289
they're trying to use
it wherever possible.

199
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.040
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,
now let's see where we're at.

200
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.740
Make sure it works, and it does,
one more Lighthouse run.

201
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.340
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, now this tower
app looks, view port's much better.

202
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:21.987
Much more mobile app aligned and

203
00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:29.380
we should beat 47 by a little bit.

204
00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:36.019
&gt;&gt; Mike North: See what we got,
73, getting much much better.

205
00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:40.952
All right, so if you tried to fire up IOS
simulator you ran into an issue where

206
00:15:40.952 --> 00:15:44.899
you saw it continually trying to load,
and load, and load.

207
00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:49.073
What this revealed was a little difference
in the way web sockets have been

208
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.920
implemented in that particular browser.

209
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.290
Now we are serving over HTTP2 so
it's a much simpler setup,

210
00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.630
we're not trying to refresh over and over,
this is a more production aligned thing

211
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.720
we're looking at here, but I just wanna
show you that it does in fact work.

212
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.580
This is a live version of the app.

213
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:15.120
Now let me just scale it down cuz it's
sort of telling a lie at this point.

214
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.029
Hardware, let's see, there we go.

215
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.329
&gt;&gt; Mike North: 75, so here's what we're
working with, a nice mobile looking app.

216
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:37.809
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And we can connect with
Safari and start working them there.

217
00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:43.730
So I'm going to stop there and
move on to the next topic.

218
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.230
But if you want to learn more about this,
the SCO course also on Frontend Masters,

219
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.620
we dive deep into mobile metadata and
structure data.

220
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.850
I can do this last bit.

221
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.490
The schema.org stuff,

222
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.130
that would have involved just
going into this grocery tile.

223
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.719
So that's gonna be grocery item.

224
00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:10.160
And we could have just basically
drop this in, we would have had to.

225
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.100
So you'll see that it'll
complain that there's this

226
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.149
JavaScript object it's trying to evaluate.

227
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.815
And you just have to just like
assign it to something up here.

228
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:32.370
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
then if we looked at the app, come on.

229
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.569
We go back to HTTP1 now.

230
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:43.444
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We can see,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You can inspect an element

231
00:17:43.444 --> 00:17:44.679
and see that the data's there.

232
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.390
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No,
we hit a problem, let's go there.

233
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.011
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We have to stringify it.

234
00:18:02.635 --> 00:18:05.909
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It doesn't like
just rendering objects in HTML.

235
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:10.807
So if we inspect element on this thing,
now we'll find that inside

236
00:18:10.807 --> 00:18:15.100
the grocery item there is,
hey, this little script tag.

237
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.997
And now we're starting to show that
nice rich data until you could basically

238
00:18:19.997 --> 00:18:24.449
get the HTML for this, perform a query,
grab all the product stuff.

239
00:18:24.449 --> 00:18:28.820
And anything that is trying to display
your link in a rich way can do so

240
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.440
based on machine readable
data that you've provided.
