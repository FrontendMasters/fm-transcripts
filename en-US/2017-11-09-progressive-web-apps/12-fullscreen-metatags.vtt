00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.473
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Additional metatags, and
these are Apple-specific, unfortunately.

2
00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:07.706
The features here grew before there was
a standard, so you'll start to see there's

3
00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:11.090
some stuff we have to do for Apple,
some stuff we have to do for Android.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.660
I will post in the chat and
add to the notes for

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.207
this class a master list of like all
of the different possible metatags,

6
00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:25.165
if you wanted to be comprehensive about it
and get the Windows 10 Bookmark Tile and

7
00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:32.380
the Blackberry image for
their Favorite Site section.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.960
There are hundreds of these things.

9
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.440
Here is a good starting point,
these three.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.980
The first one,
mobile-web-app-capable, it allows you

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.630
to when the app is bookmarked and
added to home screen, right?

12
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.580
When you launch this thing,
if it's a mobile-web-app-capable,

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.600
the app will launch without the address
bar or any of the other browser UI.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.586
So you won't have the back button,
you won't have Reader View or

15
00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:03.204
the bookmark stuff or anything like that.

16
00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:07.166
Think of it like a fullscreen iPhone.

17
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.900
You'll still get the battery bar and
the clock up at the top.

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.370
You can choose between white or
black status bar,

19
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.740
which is that little battery
bar with the clock at the top.

20
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.180
So that's the second meta tag.

21
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.230
And then home screen title,
this is important we have for SEO,

22
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.150
it's important to have a nice
descriptive title for each page.

23
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.700
You have a very limited number of
characters, I believe it's 16, for

24
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.410
the text that can be underneath
an Apple Home Screen icon.

25
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.360
So this is where you might want to
make sure you have something nice

26
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.680
rather than letting the OS truncate it.

27
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.110
It'ill basically take
the first 12 characters and

28
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.560
then add a couple of dots,
and that's what you get.

29
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.930
That is often not what you want.

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.940
So this is sort of
the Apple side of things.
