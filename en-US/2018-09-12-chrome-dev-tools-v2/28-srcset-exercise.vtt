00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We've kind of got this
exercize just using that exact same thing.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.200
So we've got this image
source set exercise here.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.040
And we can kind of see, this is a really
cool service called placeholder.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.620
The reason I like it is because
it actually when you call,

5
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.550
you can pass in any numbers to the URL,
which we'll see in a second.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.060
And it will just generate an image of
that size exactly, just dynamically.

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.230
And it'll actually write
the image size in here.

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.950
So we'll see how this works in a second.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.620
But you can see if I'm on this
tiny screen and I refresh,

10
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.340
I'm loading a 3200 pixel wide, 1200 pixel
tall image, which is a pretty big waste.

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.030
So in order to work on this one,

12
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.890
what we're gonna want to do
is go into our code editor.

13
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.094
And we're gonna wanna look for
a file called srcset.pug, and

14
00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:43.552
everything we really need to be able
to implement it should be here.

15
00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:45.483
So you can see how these
URLs are generated, right.

16
00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:48.320
It's just these two numbers that you
need to change, width and height.

17
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.733
So if I were to make this 100 and
make 100 and

18
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:56.244
then just go refresh the page,
you would see a 100 by 100.

19
00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.519
So this is the surface that does that for
you.

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.040
And so what we want here is we
want an image that has a couple,

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.530
maybe three different sizes to it.

22
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.830
So if it's on a really small screen,
we're great, we're serving a small image.

23
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.650
Medium medium, and large large.

24
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.190
So yeah,

25
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.490
we'll just take a few minutes, kind of
implement that together off the slides.

26
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.610
The other thing that I think will
be really interesting to check out.

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.490
Once you have the source sets working,
try to shrink and

28
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.670
reload the screen, and
see when it does do a a new fetch and

29
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.010
when it doesn't do a new fetch,
cuz I think it's pretty interesting.

30
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.370
So you should always be able to
always tell which image is loading,

31
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.220
cuz it will have it written here.

32
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.750
But it's kind of interesting to me when
it decides to and not to do a new fetch.

33
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.489
So we'll take a couple minutes and
do that, and

34
00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:37.844
then we'll go over it all together.
