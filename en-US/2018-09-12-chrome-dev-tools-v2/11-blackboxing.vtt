00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.880
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So yes,
we can step through JavaScript files.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.880
We can add break points, which we saw
we can do that via the debugger, or

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.840
you can just do it by
clicking the line number.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.860
Black-boxing scripts is really important.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.510
So once you get into real applications,
we all use frameworks or libraries, right?

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.240
And so what you'll often see is you're
trying to figure out how you got to this

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.720
error state, and you've got this call
stack that'll be 300 functions long.

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.820
And most of them are React internals,
Redux intern.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.200
You know the bug is not there, right,
the bug is in your application code.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.110
So what you can do if you ever have
file names here that you're like,

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.450
I'm not interested in that at all,
you can right-click on any file and

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.260
you can black-box the script.

13
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.060
And blackboxing is essentially that,
it's, this is not mine,

14
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.680
this is some third-party thing.

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.290
I don't need this right now,
so it'll black-box it.

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.933
That'll do it by the URL that you're
loading, right, by the app you're loading.

17
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:54.489
There's also an option if you go under the
three dots here, and you go into settings,

18
00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.923
and then Black-boxing,
you can add permanent black-boxes.

19
00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:01.776
So, you can be like I never wanna
debug JQuery.js, that's not my file,

20
00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:03.841
I don't want you ever to stop in there.

21
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:07.829
Because another thing that you'll
see the call stacks will be long.

22
00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.179
But also sometimes you'll do that DOM
break point that we did in the editing

23
00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.801
section, you'll be what's
changing the color of this.

24
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.623
But if you're using a library like React,

25
00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:18.416
it's always gonna be React that's
changing the color, right?

26
00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:20.337
You don't really wanna see the React code,
you wanna see your code, right?

27
00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:25.306
You wanna see where you call a set state,
you don't wanna see where

28
00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:29.770
React actually manipulates
the class list or whatever.

29
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.625
Yeah, Steve?
&gt;&gt; Steve: So let's say I have React that

30
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:38.107
calls jQuery and also have D3 that
calls jQuery, and I black-box React,

31
00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:42.247
will that automatically black-box Box D3?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It will not, so

32
00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:45.620
you'd have to black-box all of
the ones that you want black-boxed.

33
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.740
And the UI's actually really great
with those kind of examples.

34
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.777
Cuz what it'll start doing is it'll start,
it would show you D3 and

35
00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:57.020
then it would show you this little
mini thing that says we hid 20 scripts

36
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.913
because of your black-boxes.

37
00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:01.220
And then it would show you
whatever your other one was.

38
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.535
So as you add, kind of more and more, but

39
00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:08.270
you would have to do each of them because
it's all just script names to them.

40
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.920
But again, if that's common, going to
the settings in the global just makes life

41
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.010
a lot easier, where you're like, I work
with React and I work with D3 a lot.

42
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.340
I don't ever want you to show me those in
the call stacks or in the watch mode, and

43
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.570
everything gets a lot easier.

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.510
Any other questions on black boxing?

45
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.600
Yeah, and

46
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.320
it's also really safe, it'll always, even
after you've black-boxed there's always,

47
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.040
it'll show a black-boxed list here and
you can un-black box scripts.

48
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040
So it's not like you lose
access to things like that,

49
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280
it just tries to compress
the call stack for you.
