&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: You can
break on DOM changes.

2
00:00:01.252 --> 00:00:02.690
This is one of my favorite ones.

3
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.050
So again, a lot of times,

4
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
I hope around a lot at work, I'll work on
a bunch of different websites and apps.

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.750
And a lot of times,
I'll get a bug assigned to me, and

6
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.210
I can visually see the bug,
I know what's going wrong.

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.910
I have no idea what the code base is like,

8
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.110
I don't know where to start looking or
what file to be in, anything like that.

9
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.910
And so I think that it's probably pretty
common and it's really intimidating.

10
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.750
So one really cool thing that you can do,
when we get into the debugging section,

11
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.900
we'll talk about breakpoints.

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.000
But for now, what we can talk about is
if you can see something going wrong,

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.210
like something is becoming the wrong
color, or it's animating incorrectly, or

14
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.640
anything like that is happening, and
you don't know where it is in the code,

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.900
you can set what's
called a DOM breakpoint.

16
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.870
So what we can do here is we can go
to this li we have it selected here.

17
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.292
And let's say that it's changing
here the border from red to blue and

18
00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:54.660
it's supposed to be red to black,
or something like that, right?

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.023
I have no idea where that code is, right?

20
00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.773
What you can do is you can
right-click on that element, and

21
00:00:59.773 --> 00:01:01.153
you can do this break on here.

22
00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:02.683
So you get three choices.

23
00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:05.703
For all intents and purposes,

24
00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:10.941
break on means show me
the JavaScript that does what?

25
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:12.641
And so you can break on node removal.

26
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:13.920
So what's deleting this thing?

27
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.730
Why is it getting removed?

28
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.260
You can break on attribute modification,
which is some data attribute, a class,

29
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.500
an id, some property of this element
that's being changed and I wanna know why.

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.010
Or you can break on subtree modifications,
which means something inside this tree,

31
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.270
something nested inside this
is changing in some way.

32
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.680
And so if we go ahead and
we break on attribute modification,

33
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.820
cuz we can see the classes are changing,
it'll do a breakpoint.

34
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.034
And so what it's done here, I didn't click
anything, I know it was really fast,

35
00:01:43.034 --> 00:01:45.188
is it's waited for the change to happen.

36
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.780
And then it has moved us
over into the sources tab,

37
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.441
opened up the file that needed the change,
highlighted it, and then paused execution.

38
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.773
So you can see in the background,
this is no longer changing colors.

39
00:01:55.773 --> 00:01:56.708
So this is pretty powerful.

40
00:01:56.708 --> 00:02:01.217
So I can see exactly what caused this
red border to change to blue border, and

41
00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:04.300
here is where I could
change it to black border.

42
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.440
I know the example is a little bit
contrived, but this will always work if

43
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.425
you can see anything that's changing
your DOM structure in any way,

44
00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:11.865
you can set a breakpoint on that,

45
00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.081
and it'll take you right to the line
of JavaScript that's executing it.

46
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:18.985
So I'm gonna go down here,
I'm gonna deselect these breakpoints, and

47
00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:20.521
I'm gonna hit Play for now.

48
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:21.877
We'll get into the debugger a lot later.
