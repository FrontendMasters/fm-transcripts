&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The first
exercise will be over here, and

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.840
if you have the app spun up.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.640
If you don't have it spun up,

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.450
you can go to mastering DevTools, but
you won't be able to do some things.

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.150
So we'll get everybody set up on it.

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.490
We'll go to the editing example.

7
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.126
And it's just got instructions
like let's open up our Devtools,

8
00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:20.230
let's start getting comfortable,
play around with these things.

9
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.550
And I'll be around to help anybody
get set up on anything they want.
