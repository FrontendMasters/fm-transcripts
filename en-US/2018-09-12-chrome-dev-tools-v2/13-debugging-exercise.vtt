00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So with that,
we are onto our second exercise.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.940
So if we go back over to the exercises and
debugging, again the specifics are not

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.480
very important here, but
the concept is that I have this button and

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.950
it's supposed to fetch a bunch of Star
Wars pictures and put them in the site.

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.220
That's what we're going for here, a bunch
of cool Star Wars pictures showing up.

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.740
But they're not showing up and as,
a hint if we open up the DevTools and

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.820
we go to the Console, we see an error.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.510
That's a great place to start, an error
will show you what file things are in.

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.870
What we're going to work with here,
again, if your JavaScript,

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.530
if you're not that comfortable with it,
don't even worry about that.

11
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.870
But we can find the error, find the file
that it's in, start adding breakpoints,

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.240
start seeing if we can figure out
why it is that these aren't loading.

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.950
What might be wrong here?

14
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.890
And just like the other exercise,
we'll go over all of it together, so

15
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.960
don't worry about that.

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920
But cool, I'll think we'll pause here and
we'll give another 15 minute,

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.820
just let everybody poke around in there
and let me know if you have any questions.
