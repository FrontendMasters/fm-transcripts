00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:03.240
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.380
This is Mastering Chrome DevTools.

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.950
My name is Jon Kuperman.

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.730
I am a software engineer at Adobe.

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.760
I work on the Creative Cloud products,
which is a lot of the products, but

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.330
It is pretty awesome there.

7
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.897
We have LaCrosse.
I am @jkup on Twitter [INAUDIBLE]

8
00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:20.257
all the the things.

9
00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:22.245
I am usually really,
really responsive on that.

10
00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.163
If anybody, especially anybody that
takes the course has any questions or

11
00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:29.288
recommendations or
anything like that, I love feedback.

12
00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:30.665
I love questions.

13
00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:31.867
I love talking to people online.

14
00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:36.485
Feel free to hit me up there I
also have this github ama thing,

15
00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.420
which are kind of cool.

16
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.780
I think probably other people who
have done courses have them too.

17
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.970
It's just a public way if anybody,
just answering questions like,

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.680
how do you, how'd you learn about this?

19
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.430
Or what is your color scheme?

20
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.060
Or what is your, just anything like that.

21
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.560
I really like using the ama format for
that.

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.820
Cool, so kind of like expectations or
what we'll learn today.

23
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.780
And I guess before getting into what we'll
learn, kinda the format of this course is

24
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.800
gonna be doing a little bit
of learning from some slides.

25
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.440
And then I'll jump into the DevTools and

26
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.710
we'll do a little bit of
exploration together, and

27
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.850
then we'll jump into an exercise where
you'll do some exploration by yourself.

28
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.700
And then we'll go over
the exercise together.

29
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.250
If the exercise is,
if you find them difficult don't worry,

30
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.230
because we'll go over
every single bit of it.

31
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.700
If I'm them easy and you get done early,
it'd be a cool idea to start trying to

32
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600
apply those things to websites that you
work on, or you own, things like that.

33
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.940
I think the number one goal of this course
is it about a specific tip or trick, but

34
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.620
is to get comfortable poking
around in the Devtools.

35
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.330
You really can't do any harm in there.

36
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.040
So get comfortable learning
what each panel is for.

37
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.170
How to use it, run it through your site,
all that stuff.

38
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.980
But the specific things, some takeaways.

39
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.020
We'll be learning how to use
the DevTools as your IDE.

40
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.510
So actual authoring of code.

41
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.800
Instead of a text editor,
you could use your DevTools.

42
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.260
We'll be using them to
debug complex applications.

43
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.800
So things that are a lot of JavaScript,
a lot of function calls, things like that.

44
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.310
Analyzing network traffic we'll go
pretty deep on how things come across

45
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730
the network, how you can use dev tools
to find bottlenecks in your code.

46
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.470
Auditing websites so this is a little
bit more of a high level overview.

47
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.510
So we'll be able to take a website,
run it through some tooling, and

48
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.400
get all sorts of feedback on a lot more
human readable like too many images or

49
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.270
they're too big or
unused CSS a lot of stuff like that.

50
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.060
Monitor real user performance, so we'll
both learn how to check the website on

51
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.580
our computers and
see how our websites are doing.

52
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.450
But we'll also learn how to ship some code
to your real users that will feed back

53
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.390
information about how the website
loads and runs for them.

54
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.640
Profiling CPU usage, so all sorts of
stuff about JavaScript performance,

55
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.530
how it's running [INAUDIBLE] you know,
anything like that.

56
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.300
We will take a little dive into NODE DAS,
so

57
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.320
if anybody is using NODE on the back end.

58
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.609
It is very, very easy to use the depth
tools to analyze that performance as well

59
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.220
Finding and fixing memory leaks.

60
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.110
So the different causes of memory leaks.

61
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.250
How to see if you have a memory leak
on a page that you're working on.

62
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.290
And then how to dive in and
figure out what might be causing it.

63
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.910
And then the last thing is I try to
intersperse a lot of tips and tricks.

64
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.516
One thing that I love about the DevTools
is there's little gems everywhere.

65
00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:24.754
Which I think can be kind
of intimidating at first.

66
00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.337
There's all these options and settings and
experiments and stuff like that.

67
00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:32.534
But hopefully as we go through, anything
that comes to mind that I remember,

68
00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:34.990
I'll shout out little
keyboard shortcuts or

69
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.173
little cool things that you
might not know that you can do.
