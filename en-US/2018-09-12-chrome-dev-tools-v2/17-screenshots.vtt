WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.180
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The last
thing that I just wanna

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.770
kinda show is some cool
stuff with the DevTools UI.

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.564
So some of my favorite things that you
can do here is you can do screen shots,

4
00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:08.720
which is really neat.

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.010
So if we do refresh with this
capture screen shots enabled,

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.560
what we'll start seeing,
this is a funny gotcha too.

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.968
So like we think of the DevTools
as being like an overlay,

8
00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:26.098
we think we have our screen then
the DevTools kind of sits on top of it.

9
00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:27.343
But again in reality,

10
00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:30.887
why would Chrome render the stuff
behind it if you can't see it.

11
00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:34.347
So when you have the DevTools docked
to the side or the bottom and

12
00:00:34.347 --> 00:00:38.850
you do screenshots, you'll start getting
these kind of weird screenshots which

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.720
are like wait a minute, why is it
only that little sliver of the paint?

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.390
It's just because it's not
actually rendering this stuff.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.930
So when you do screenshots,

16
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.770
it's usually the best practice to
just pop the DevTools out here.

17
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.750
Unlock to a separate window and
then refresh again.

18
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.010
So now as we're refreshing,
what it's gonna show and this site's not

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.860
terribly exciting, but it's gonna
show every repaint that happens and

20
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.550
what it looked like at that state in time.

21
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.771
So you can kinda watch as the resources
come in, how the screen paints itself.

22
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.814
So for example,
if we go maybe the Frontend Masters,

23
00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:12.989
which is a real estate with
a lot of cool stuff going on and

24
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:17.609
we have the screenshots turned on, you
have to wait til it's all finished here.

25
00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.056
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's loading
the live stream player.

26
00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:25.420
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, sorry, I see me.

27
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.100
Yeah, if we go to this,

28
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.690
you'll start seeing this really
cool kind of story of how.

29
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.460
Let's see, let's just wait for these.

30
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.204
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe you do
frontendmasters.com/courses,

31
00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:39.710
because it's not loading up there.

32
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.447
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Perfect.

33
00:01:44.244 --> 00:01:46.879
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So what you'll start
seeing is how the web page actually

34
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:47.540
loads in.

35
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.450
This is often like too quickly for
us to see, but it's important.

36
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.892
So we can see the first thing that
happens is the document comes and

37
00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:55.185
the CSS must be there,
cuz it does this layout.

38
00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:57.455
All the widths and heights,
and things like that are good.

39
00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:01.185
We can also see some of
the HTML that's not dynamic.

40
00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:04.095
So this stuff is this type to
search is static whereas a lot of

41
00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:06.175
the information is dynamic.

42
00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:08.985
So then the next thing to load in is
all this text content gets there.

43
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.905
It's likely that the images that
go here have been triggered.

44
00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:14.260
They're being requested, but
they haven't come through yet.

45
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.390
So this next context comes in and
it's great.

46
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.024
We keep going and a logo pops in.

47
00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:19.517
We can see that logo comes in.

48
00:02:19.517 --> 00:02:23.252
Keep going again,
I'm not sure what repaint happened there.

49
00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:26.906
And now something happened here
like maybe a break-point got hit or

50
00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:30.767
something like that or maybe it's
something going on with the images.

51
00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:32.100
Yeah, so I see.

52
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.803
So these are like these boxed images,
but there is some transition or

53
00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:37.055
maybe JavaScript or
something like that is applying it.

54
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:40.202
So that as the logos come in,
they kind of slide in nicely behind.

55
00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:42.747
We can see the top logo,
then these other ones are fetching.

56
00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.263
Those are probably just coming in,

57
00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:47.456
in any order like we have these images
in the markup or something like that.

58
00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:50.932
Anyway, so you can see really and then
you can see these bottom two appear and

59
00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:52.735
then the site this kind of animates in.

60
00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:54.083
So those are the repaints.

61
00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:58.222
So yeah, one really cool thing about using
the screenshots is to kind of develop this

62
00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:01.220
empathy for
how your site loads on slower connections.

63
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.555
Another thing that's really important
as you kinda get into these

64
00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:08.390
microperformance improvements, it's
like we're gonna talk next about audits.

65
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.720
Those are macro, too many images,
they're too big.

66
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.690
These are micro ones.

67
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.130
You might wanna investigate
how your content loads.

68
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.076
Because for example, if you block all
the readable text until an image is done

69
00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:21.429
loading, you could be making
people sit there and wait forever.

70
00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:25.329
Whereas with Frontened Masters, it's
really cool that even on a really terrible

71
00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.280
connection, you're pretty much right away
able to get text and see what's clickable.

72
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.304
As the site loads, it instantly
even if that takes five minutes for

73
00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:36.328
those images to come in,
I can start scrolling through the list and

74
00:03:36.328 --> 00:03:38.339
clicking on any lessons
that I wanna learn.

75
00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.340
Those kind of things.

76
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.030
Yeah, Josh, you had a question?

77
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.890
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yeah, I was just wondering how

78
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.200
you triggered the playback
of the sequence.

79
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.700
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Absolutely.

80
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.140
So once the screenshots load in,
you can double-click on one to zoom it in.

81
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.221
So from network, made sure screenshots
are attached and then I did a refresh.

82
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:56.793
And once that refresh completes,

83
00:03:56.793 --> 00:04:00.587
these screenshots should populate across
here and then you double-click on it and

84
00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:03.316
then you can use the right and
left arrows to see each frame.

85
00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:04.022
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Josh: And

86
00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:08.445
also I'll say that the reason
why at 855 milliseconds,

87
00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:14.033
you're seeing any styles at all is
because we inline the critical CSS.

88
00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.325
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's really cool.

89
00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:16.700
&gt;&gt; Josh: Into the initial reclass.

90
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.505
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's great.

91
00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:22.183
&gt;&gt; Josh: So we bundle in the just HTML
plus, but the text should actually be

92
00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:26.610
readable right here as well and
that's a bit frustrating.

93
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.850
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: These happen in between
100 milliseconds, it's possible.

94
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.290
It's just that paint is taking that long.

95
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.770
100 milliseconds is pretty short.

96
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.180
But yeah, we could look deeper into it.

97
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.400
It'd be really cool, but it is cool.

98
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.250
That's a great point.

99
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.660
That's cool to know why
we are seeing this.

100
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.720
&gt;&gt; Josh: It's like you get
kinda the branding colors and

101
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.120
then you get kind of the basics?

102
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.170
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, and the shape too.

103
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.100
Because another thing for people,

104
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.570
I don't know if you've ever
been on a slow connection.

105
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.000
And as the websites loading,
it's moving on you.

106
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.980
Cuz CSS is coming in or
images are pushing down or whatever.

107
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.830
The fact that if carves out all the space,
it's going to need is really great too.

108
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.610
&gt;&gt; Josh: Past few years,
Blood Pact to a bundle the inline assets.

109
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.141
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's awesome.

110
00:04:58.141 --> 00:04:59.692
&gt;&gt; Josh: Like the critical and
then we have a package that loads-

111
00:04:59.692 --> 00:05:01.064
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Seeing the results of it

112
00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:02.310
here is really cool.

113
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.717
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you
export those image files?

114
00:05:04.717 --> 00:05:05.652
Can you save those off?

115
00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:08.446
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I'm not sure, so
you can export the network data.

116
00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:10.943
As far as image files, I'm not sure.

117
00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.540
I mean, you can probably,
you'd have to screenshot them.

118
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.413
I don't think they actually come
with any kind of export, but

119
00:05:17.413 --> 00:05:20.926
that is one of my favorite
things to kinda take a look at.

120
00:05:20.926 --> 00:05:25.121
All these views are deselectable, so
you can hide a few of them if you wanted.

121
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.160
That's what these buttons are here for
like controlling the view.

122
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.052
This one is controlling
that filter at the top.

123
00:05:32.052 --> 00:05:34.460
So this is another cool thing you can do,
so you can filter by type.

124
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.997
So you can be like I just
wanna see JavaScript files and

125
00:05:37.997 --> 00:05:39.499
then let me hide this.

126
00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.109
So here's the JavaScript files.

127
00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:44.349
And so what about CSS and
we don't have them.

128
00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.071
And then what about a combination,
you can hold shift-ctrl or cmd and

129
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.026
you can see that.

130
00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:53.380
You can also do really cool things
like this filter here is very smart.

131
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.266
So you can do things like the word
tracker and we can search it.

132
00:05:57.266 --> 00:06:01.800
You can also do larger than and
200 pixels or something like that.

133
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.890
200, 100, do we have the images?

134
00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:10.355
The images haven't come through.

135
00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:11.840
Anyway, you can do a bunch of cool things.

136
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.399
You can do a larger than and then you
can pass in some amount of pixels or

137
00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:15.251
something like that.

138
00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:19.601
And so you can start filtering your
results by that stuff, then you can

139
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:23.968
clear it any time and then a refresh
will always take it back off again.

140
00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:25.565
You can also test offline mode for

141
00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:29.675
anybody building progressive web apps that
have a service worker, so you can trigger

142
00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:33.744
offline and then you can refresh the site
again and then we'll see that it doesn't.

143
00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:36.402
But if you had a site that
had a service worker loaded,

144
00:06:36.402 --> 00:06:37.946
you would see it kick in there.

145
00:06:37.946 --> 00:06:42.170
Another thing to keep in mind is
you can enable and disable cache.

146
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.210
So if you're caching your files and
you wanna see what it's like for

147
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.525
a user to hit the screen for
the first time, disable it and

148
00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:52.510
then the last thing you can do with almost
all of these panels is preserve log.

149
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.460
So if we go back to thinking about
the console, for example, and

150
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.200
we console log something out,
but it happens.

151
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.720
I've seen this before where you have
push state to move around the app, so

152
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.340
it triggers a new page load.

153
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.704
And so you're like when I click on it, I
get an error and then the new page loads.

154
00:07:10.704 --> 00:07:12.750
But if the error is gone
before you can even see it.

155
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.180
I think that's happened to though,
a lot of us.

156
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.890
So you can click preserve log and
then click on the button.

157
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.850
And even though the page load happens,
it won't clear the console for you.

158
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.430
Same with network,
it wouldn't clear the network.

159
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.361
It would just keep adding assets to it.
