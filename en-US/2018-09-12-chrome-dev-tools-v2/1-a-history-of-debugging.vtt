00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Really quick kind of
a brief history I don't know if anybody is

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.780
an old-timey web developer like me but

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.640
back in the day when I started the only
tool that we had was view-source.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.867
So we still have view-source and
it looks something this,

5
00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.720
you click view-source and
you get all of your HTML.

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.510
There were kind of a lot of
problems with this which were,

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.820
you can't really do anything with it,
you can't really interact with it.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.700
If you do any client-side code
that changes your markup,

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.530
it's not well represented there but
the big one is when you needed to debug.

10
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.470
I don't know if anybody remembers
advanced debugging like this, right?

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.300
So you didn't have console log,
because you didn't have a console,

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.830
because you didn't have DEV tools.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.340
So the only thing that you had was in
your code, you could put an alert,

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.340
that was what you could do so you could
go alert, first name, alert, whatever.

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.460
But the problem was if it was any
non primitives it wasn't a number,

16
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.150
a string, or something like that
alert doesn't pretty print it

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
doesn't JSON string of fire or
anything like that.

18
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.890
So what you would get is these alert,
object window, or alert, object object, or

19
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.130
something like that and so you'd be like
drilling down into it, it was terrible.

20
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.350
And what was kind of a big issue then,
let me go to this next one,

21
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.540
is that we would see,
we would author HTML, right?

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.590
And this is still true to this day,
even if you're writing, using React,

23
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.500
using JSX or whatever it generates HTML.

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.598
HTML is what you send to the browser but

25
00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.360
the browser doesn't give the user HTML,
right?

26
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.991
We've all heard of this concept of the DOM
before, right, the Document Object Model

27
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:32.421
and it's because the browser
takes the HTML as instructions.

28
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:37.311
But it actually uses this really
complex object model for how things

29
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:42.564
are positioned and how you interact
with them and everything like that.

30
00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:47.240
So a big discrepancy here was that you
would just be able to see the view source

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.617
of your HTML but really there's so
much more going on.

32
00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:52.779
And then so years and years ago,

33
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.598
the software developer created this
thing called The Live DOM Viewer.

34
00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:01.581
And so if we go ahead and we take
a look at this, It's pretty minimal,

35
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:05.705
it's still online, which is really
awesome but basically what it is,

36
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.132
is what I'm talking about here, right?

37
00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:14.283
So you would write some HTML, you would
write body, and then you would write H1,

38
00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:19.901
Hello Frontend Masters H1, and
this is what you'd see in view-source,

39
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:23.765
but really the DOM creates all this stuff,
right.

40
00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:27.467
These are body has a text node,
it's an H1 with another text node, and

41
00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:31.044
it starts kind of giving us a better
understanding of what the browser

42
00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:34.100
is actually rendering and
how things are working.

43
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.160
A good example of this is if you've ever
grabbed a DOM node, made with jQuery or

44
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.860
maybe just with Vanilla JavaScript and
you wanna change it's text or

45
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.160
you want to change a class,
or something like that.

46
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.430
You need to know the DOM APIs, because you
need to know how to grab a class name, or

47
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.140
how to grab inner text, or
inner HTML, all these things, right.

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.658
Those wouldn't be present in the
view-source but, when you start diving in

49
00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:58.632
to the debugger and into the DOM,
you can see what's available,

50
00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:03.486
what you could use.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool, so

51
00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:08.850
then out of this DOM Viewer came Firebug,
which was the very first of its kind,

52
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.180
this kind of mind blowing
revolution in web development.

53
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.400
And so we had, it was an add-on
originally for Firefox and

54
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.097
you could install this add-on and
you got all these great things.

55
00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:23.935
And the kind of funny thing, the reason
that I include this picture of like it's

56
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:27.218
preview release is that really
almost nothing has changed to this.

57
00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.781
Those look really similar to what
we're gonna be dealing with in

58
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:30.690
the Chrome Dev Tools.

59
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.528
The design's gotten a little cleaner but
you can see these little images of,

60
00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:38.305
you can look at your scripts or you can
look at a console, an interactive repl,

61
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:40.496
you can look at the markup and
expand the DOM.

62
00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:44.660
So this thing came out, it's totally
incredible, sadly I think a year,

63
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.087
maybe two years ago it was finally sunset.

64
00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:50.138
What happened was I think it was
an add on and then Firefox removed

65
00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:53.247
it in lieu of their own Dev Tools
which they've been working on and

66
00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:56.718
It was still an add on and now I think
it's finally kind of lived its life.

67
00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:59.779
But it was really a game changer and
it was really kind of what started

68
00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:03.726
this concept of having these really great
debugging environment for web developers.

69
00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:10.089
Cool, and yeah, so these slides
are available I sent the link out I think,

70
00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.630
but let me just top forward really quick.

71
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.481
So if anybody doesn't have the slides,
you can go to,

72
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:21.550
it's a bit.ly link, so
bit.ly /devtools-slides.

73
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.480
I saw somebody asking about them and then
otherwise it's slides.com/jcoop/devtools,

74
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.754
that's where it'll redirect to, cool,

75
00:04:28.754 --> 00:04:32.429
so you don't have to write down all
these links and things like that.

76
00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:35.796
So the official documentation
lives at this link,

77
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:40.568
it is really high quality writing,
it is usually pretty slow to update as

78
00:04:40.568 --> 00:04:44.974
the Dev team seems to move faster
than the technical writing team.

79
00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:48.095
So oftentimes you'll go look
at an article on the docs and

80
00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:50.565
the Dev tools don't
look like that anymore,

81
00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:54.662
but the core information is the same,
so sometimes the docs are a little bit

82
00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:59.430
difficult to use, which is why this course
exists, but they are really well written.

83
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.419
We're also gonna be doing a sample app,
which is here at bitl.y/devtools-app,

84
00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.873
we'll get into that later,
I'll leave this link back up so

85
00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:13.042
we all have time to install it,
get it going, I'll help out with that.

86
00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:17.326
It requires Node.js being installed in
order to run the kinda server that serves

87
00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:21.741
it, we're not gonna write any Node.js,
but it does require it being installed.

88
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:26.468
If for whatever reason you can't or
really don't wanna install it, we can do

89
00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:31.429
most of the exercises on this site that
I made which is masteringdevtools.com.

90
00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:34.965
But I'd way rather just install node and
pull this GitHub repo so

91
00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:37.267
we can actually do everything together.

92
00:05:37.267 --> 00:05:39.853
Again we'll cover that when
we get to the first exercise.
