&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And so yeah, so I really
recommend playing around with all of these

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.550
little snapshots and the allocations,
comparing some snapshots.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.210
So for the next exercise, and the last
exercise, we have a memory leaks page.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.524
And so this page has four sub pages, and
one of them has a memory leak on it,

5
00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:16.230
and the other three do not.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.830
And so the exercise here is a, figure out
which one of these four pages has a memory

7
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.984
leak using the tools available.

8
00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.730
And then b, kinda start digging,
poking at it, use the tools,

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.280
see if you can figure out what's
causing that memory leak.

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.295
And if you're ambitious, you can try
to figure out what piece of code is

11
00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.460
responsible for
the causing of that memory leak.

12
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.789
Cool, so we'll take another ten, and
then we'll come back together and

13
00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.030
we'll do it all as a group.
