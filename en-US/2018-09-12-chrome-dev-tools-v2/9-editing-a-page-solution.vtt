00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That
was the first exercise.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.340
It's always the bumpiest, cuz you
have to install a bunch of stuff, and

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.940
set stuff up, so there's always problems.

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.460
I'm gonna go over it, kind of from
start to finish as much as I can, but

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.960
also, great time for Q and A.

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.960
So let me kinda just go over the whole
process from this editing page here.

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.020
So the first thing I would do,
I have Get, and

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.090
I have Node installed
in my computer already.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.277
So I'm gonna go to this,

10
00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:27.743
from mastering DevTools, I'm gonna
go to this source link and open it.

11
00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:31.632
And this is just like the GitHub Repo
where this project that we're all gonna

12
00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.560
work on, lives.

13
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.017
So there're like clone or
download button here, and

14
00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:37.972
I'm just gonna copy this to make
clipboard, this GitHub link.

15
00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:42.448
And then, I'm gonna open up my terminal,
which I've got here.

16
00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:46.268
And I'm just gonna do
a get clone of that repo.

17
00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:47.848
So it creates this new folder.

18
00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:50.270
I had some fake images in there.

19
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.356
So if we do an LS or whatever,
we can see this folder.

20
00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.185
So I'm gonna cd into that folder.

21
00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:59.950
And then, if we do an LS, we see all
My files, and just things like that.

22
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.780
So then, we'll do an mpm install, this is
just gonna install all the dependencies,

23
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.250
and mpm comes bundled with nodes,
so it should be good.

24
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670
So it installs all that stuff,
and then, I'll do an mpm start.

25
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.520
And then, that should give you this little
message, app listening on this link.

26
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.480
So click that link, and it opens up
local host 3000 with the sites on.

27
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.650
I'm gonna close
the Mastering DevTools page.

28
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.840
I'm gonna close the GetHub link.

29
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.790
And now, we should have the site running,
cover the exercises, and editing.

30
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.500
That's where we're at.

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.750
Basically, they're just a bunch of
different things here that we can

32
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.430
do through the DevTools.

33
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.080
Some of them, right,
can be persisted to disk.

34
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.190
I think most of the ones at the top can.

35
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.830
Some of the ones, like these dom ones we
mentioned, we can drag this into the list,

36
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.120
but we won't be able to persist it.

37
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.934
So the first thing I'll do,
is I'll open up the DevTools.

38
00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:55.610
Just kinda starting from scratch, so

39
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.150
I'll go into my Sources, Filesystem,
Add folder to workspace.

40
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.657
And then, I will go and find my,

41
00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:08.600
I think I've got like Front End Masters,
Mastering Chrome DevTools.

42
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.320
So I'll find my folder,
wherever you downloaded it,

43
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.900
wherever you're running it from,
and click Select on there.

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.341
This little warning will
come up at the top, saying,

45
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:16.873
do you wanna give it permission.

46
00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:17.852
I'll say allow.

47
00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:22.380
Now, I've got this folder in here, which
means if I go back to the element panel,

48
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.746
I should see these nice green
dots by all the style elements.

49
00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:29.989
So then, from there, I can kinda scroll
down a little bit, set the bodies

50
00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.070
background to EEE, so I click on the body,
I see there's no background color set.

51
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.660
So I can kinda click here
to create a new line.

52
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.040
New background, EEE, and that changes.

53
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.450
List items have no bullet points.

54
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.880
I'm not sure how familiar
everybody is with CSS and HTML,

55
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.220
so the specifics of these
exercises aren't that important.

56
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.620
What's important is just kind of diving
in, hands on all that stuff, so.

57
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.349
You can go and do something like I'll use
this, I'll click on one of these list

58
00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.169
items, or maybe the whole list, and
I'll do new style, like an inline style.

59
00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.420
I'll do like list style, none.

60
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.390
You could also, if we don't put it here.

61
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.360
They're supposed to be, so you can click
on any list item, and you can see that

62
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.430
they have kind of these selectors here,
you can do it here, as well.

63
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.620
So list-style not on these lists.

64
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.950
So I'll go ahead, and list-style, none.

65
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.360
So the bullet points go away,
H1's have a font size of 50.

66
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.980
So we'll go to these H1's, and
we'll see the font size is like 2em, so

67
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.760
I can change it to 50 pixels,
or something like that.

68
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.650
Find the scroll that's in there.

69
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.630
So this one I sort of cover
a little earlier from the styles,

70
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.530
you can head over to event listeners.

71
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.780
And you can see what all event
listeners are on this page.

72
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.890
I can see that there's one
scroll listener on the document.

73
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.080
And if I go ahead and I clicked it, takes
me into this editing.js page, which says,

74
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.130
you found me.

75
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.610
Convert the background
of the body into HSL.

76
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.460
So we go back into the styles tab here,

77
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.170
and we can see this
background that I set to EEE.

78
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.280
So I'll hold shift.

79
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.372
This one's a little finicky.

80
00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:09.035
You gotta click on the box itself, so
holding shift, I click on the box.

81
00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:09.958
It goes to RGB.

82
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.570
I click again, it goes to HSL.

83
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.155
If that's difficult or not working for
you, you can just also

84
00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:19.980
left-click on the box, which will
open up this nice pop over here.

85
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.100
And then, you can select from
these two arrows here, and

86
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.820
you can start switching through all
the color modes this way, as well.

87
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.400
Might be easier.

88
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.740
This one is confusing, I apologize for it.

89
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.180
So we'll just skip this
container 10 columns thing.

90
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.825
Figure out what color the link becomes
when hovered, so we could cheat.

91
00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:40.150
It's yellow, I see that.

92
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.886
Or we can go ahead and we could do
the selector, we can hover over the link,

93
00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:47.442
we could go to this HOV, and
we can trigger the hover state, and then,

94
00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:49.400
we can see, I was wrong, it's pink.

95
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.470
I have issues seeing colors,
but it is pink.

96
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.030
And then,
the last one was put me in the list, so

97
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.960
we can go down in the elements tab,
and we can find that list item.

98
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.811
And then, we can just hold to drag it, and

99
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:05.324
put it up here in the list,
maybe, below this one.

100
00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:07.409
And now, it's in the list.

101
00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.716
Yeah again, the specifics of list style or
whatever, not really important,

102
00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:14.405
just kinda wanted to get
everybody's feet wet.

103
00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:17.152
Get in there, open it up,
get the workspace working,

104
00:05:17.152 --> 00:05:20.690
cuz once you kinda go though that motion,
it becomes easier.

105
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.050
And then, just start messing
around with things, so yeah.

106
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.102
Any questions on that exercise, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that last one to

107
00:05:26.102 --> 00:05:28.614
put the element in the list,
supposed to be savable from

108
00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:31.413
DevTools, or not?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That one is not savable

109
00:05:31.413 --> 00:05:34.217
from DevTools.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you go over the one you

110
00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:36.382
skipped?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, this is just,

111
00:05:36.382 --> 00:05:37.878
honestly, my mistake.

112
00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:42.825
I had a column class that was there,
and I was up late working on it.

113
00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:45.232
I apologize,
I removed the column exercise.

114
00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:47.356
I meant to remove that,
so that just my mistake.

115
00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:52.990
Sorry about that confusion.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool,

116
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.940
this is a really good question,
another kinda caveat.

117
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.980
So Cody says, any way to add a new
selector to file system file

118
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.100
from styles tab, ie, not switching
the source, and manually writing it?

119
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.480
No, you're not able to do that, right?

120
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.710
So if you think about it,
it develops this mapping.

121
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.366
And then, yeah, and then,
you can edit anything that's there.

122
00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:16.496
Actually, let me double-check on that.

123
00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:17.222
It's like a pretty cool question.

124
00:06:17.222 --> 00:06:22.616
So if we were to add,
cuz I know what you can do, is,

125
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:27.520
let me see, so
we've got this stuff syncing.

126
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.984
So if we go to this, and we add a new
class, and we call it, yeah, nav.nav.

127
00:06:33.984 --> 00:06:39.604
And then, we were to do like color,
dark blue.

128
00:06:39.604 --> 00:06:45.921
Would that then,
if we were in our style.css?

129
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:47.160
It looks like it does not persist.

130
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.961
So that makes sense.

131
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.796
If we're actually, instead of editing
stuff that exists that's mapped.

132
00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:55.365
And actually, you can see here when I
add the class, it says it's adding it

133
00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:58.779
to the inspector style sheet,
as opposed to adding it to my style file.

134
00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.567
So does that make sense
as another copy out?

135
00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.223
If you have classes already,
you can edit them any which way.

136
00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:06.775
You can add attributes,
properties, change anything.

137
00:07:06.775 --> 00:07:12.480
But if you were like, I really wanna grab
this body, I need a class on, or whatever.

138
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.159
You wouldn't be able to add class from
the DevTools, that wouldn't persist.

139
00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:22.130
What you could easily do,
is you could give the body a selector.

140
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.090
So if we didn't have one,

141
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.330
we could use something like body,
now it has an empty selector.

142
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.706
Now, we kinda reload, and we can go ahead,
and just add things that we want there.

143
00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:32.952
Is that make sense?

144
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.770
Adding a new class from
a DevTools not persisting.

145
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.260
What happens if I open
a different project.

146
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.230
A local host 3000.

147
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.950
It's smart enough to know
it's a different project, and

148
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.070
it would require me adding a new folder.

149
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.560
So that's a great, great question, too.

150
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.570
So like once you have that workspace added
there, you'll notice that it stays, right,

151
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.510
so if I were to close the tab, and
go back to my local host 3000,

152
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.160
and open this up, and go to sources,
we still have this workspace there.

153
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.900
So then the question is like, let's say
I'm working on two different apps, so

154
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.530
I open one up, and I drag it to Workspace,
and everything's good, and I close my tab,

155
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.880
and then the next day I go and

156
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.090
I open the other one up,
is it gonna be conflicting like that?

157
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.590
Yeah, it will be smart enough.

158
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.840
Once it maps them, it won't just
start mapping over everything else.

159
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.380
Anyway, for dark theme for the DevTools,
so the DevTools, there is a dark theme.

160
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.470
It's in the Chrome Dev Store, and when
you find that there's instructions for

161
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.720
how to install it, I believe,
there's like a setting, yeah,

162
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.450
I believe there's a setting so,
wait, never mind.

163
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.480
It's built in now, great.

164
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.450
It used to be in the store.

165
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.580
So yeah, let's, from the DevTools,
you go here, the three dots,

166
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.780
you click on settings, and
you can go to dark theme, yep.
