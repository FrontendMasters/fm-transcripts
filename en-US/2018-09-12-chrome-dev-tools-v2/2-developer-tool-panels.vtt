00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So before we kinda
dive into any of the panels in specific,

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.916
I was gonna do just a kind of quick
walkthrough all of the panels so

3
00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:09.266
we can kind of see what
their purpose is and

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:14.001
be able to better anticipate the kind of
stuff that we're gonna be covering later.

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:19.190
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So if I open up a new tab

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.680
here and go to about:blank,
and then open up the DevTools.

7
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.444
Cool, we get a little something like this.

8
00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.420
So actually, let me,
instead of about:blank, let me go to,

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.230
this is what the sample app looks like.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.015
So before we get started with that,
I guess the ways to open the DevTools,

11
00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.102
you have a couple of different options.

12
00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.767
Probably, the easiest one is
to right-click anywhere, and

13
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.080
then just click Inspect on your screen.

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.959
You can also Cmd if you're on a Mac or
Ctrl if you're on Windows, and

15
00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:51.750
then you can do something
like Cmd+Option+i,

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.902
it would open up the DevTools
as like a shortcut there.

17
00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:59.135
But either way, once we get them open,
the basic idea for those not familiar

18
00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:03.660
with them is that you got kind of these
top level panels over here across the top.

19
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.996
And then as you click through each one, it
changes the content of what's down below.

20
00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:12.068
So another thing that's interesting,
a feature I'd been kinda wanting for

21
00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:15.900
years is that these are all drag and
droppable, and that those persist.

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.351
So you can drag to reorder.

23
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:20.248
So I do apologize if my order is
a little bit different than yours,

24
00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.710
cuz I don't remember what
the default order is.

25
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.220
But we're gonna go across this way,
kind of just do a very high level of what

26
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060
they're for, and then we'll start
diving deeper into each one.

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.970
So the first one is the Elements panel.

28
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.170
This is back to that Hixie DOM viewer
that we saw, basically the same thing.

29
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.021
So on the left hand side,

30
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:41.438
you have the DOM tree that Chrome
has parsed from your HTML.

31
00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:43.110
You have all these nodes here.

32
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.470
They're expandable.

33
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.660
There's some cool things like if I
minimize this a little bit, as you

34
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.160
hover over DOM nodes, it does its best
to highlight the node itself up there.

35
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.171
They're expandable by
clicking on the arrow.

36
00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:01.511
A little cool trick is that you can hold,
I believe, it's the Alt key,

37
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:07.576
well, Option on Mac, and if you click on
the caret, then it expands all of them.

38
00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:09.770
So you can expend your
entire tree back and forth.

39
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.253
If you just click on it,
it just expands that one.

40
00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:14.636
And then on the right
side are all the styles.

41
00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.999
And so what happens here is that you
click on a different DOM element and

42
00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.960
then the Styles panel updates to show
you what styles are being applied to it.

43
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.190
So this I find is usually like the most
common thing people have done with

44
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.810
DevTools so far.

45
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.577
So you would like find an element
then you go over to styles and

46
00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:31.543
you'd kinda see what's going on with it.

47
00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.006
They show a bunch of cool information,
like basically,

48
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:37.320
what you're seeing here is every
single style that's applied to it.

49
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.050
And the ones that have been kind
of trumped are crossed out, so

50
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.790
you can see which ones are rendering.

51
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.530
There's a bunch of other really cool tabs
over here, which we'll cover when we get

52
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.340
into the editing section, but the kind of
basics of this are your HTML and your CSS.

53
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.980
Then we have the console.

54
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.598
So this is interactive consoles, so
you can type things like 1+1, and

55
00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:57.944
it'll evaluate it.

56
00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:58.890
We can go a little bigger.

57
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.200
You can do any JavaScript expressions.

58
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.055
So you can do const foo = "foo".

59
00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:07.735
And then if you type foo,
it will, as a repo, it'll read and

60
00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:09.120
evaluate that for you.

61
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.700
You can also do longer things
like multi-line functions.

62
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.910
So you could do function bar, and
then instead of hitting Enter,

63
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.230
which would just evaluate it,
wow, that's new.

64
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.840
[LAUGH] So it used to just
evaluate it if you did that.

65
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.080
I guess, it's smart enough now to know
that you have an open-parenthesis.

66
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.010
So if you just hit Enter,
it drops you down there.

67
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.520
You can do a console.log["hi"];
something like that.

68
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.332
And then you can close it, hit Enter.

69
00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:33.363
And then if you type bar and
you call it, it will greet hi.

70
00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:35.789
So you got this kind of
interactive repo here.

71
00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.123
There's some really cool things that
we'll get into where the elements and

72
00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:41.169
the Console panel work
really well together.

73
00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.609
And by that, I mean that you can select
any element in the Elements panel and

74
00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.737
you can bring it into the Console
through some keyboard shortcuts.

75
00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:51.677
So just pretty cool if you wanna see
like what APIs are available on it.

76
00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:55.770
Then we've got our Sources tab,
make this a little bit bigger.

77
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.724
So basically, I kinda want you to think
about the Sources tab as your text editor.

78
00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:03.564
So like very similar to any other text
editor, you've got all the files that

79
00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:06.744
are coming down from the file
system over here on your left, and

80
00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:10.110
if you click on one, it opens it up
over here in this like tab thing.

81
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.144
So this is pretty similar if you use like
Sublime or VS Code or anything like that.

82
00:04:15.144 --> 00:04:18.520
The difference being you have this kind
of debugger over here on the right.

83
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.814
And so this is what we're gonna use for
setting breakpoints and

84
00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.690
then step through debugging.

85
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.220
It's got a bunch of really cool stuff that
we can do kind of beyond just console log.

86
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.860
Some more in-depth debugging over here.

87
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.180
But the left stuff is just
really nice text editor,

88
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.680
it's got color highlighting,
everything like that.

89
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.990
The next one, we have the Network panel.

90
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.340
So if I have the Network tab up and
I do a Refresh,

91
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.640
the Network panel basically shows
you what's called the waterfall.

92
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.560
And so the waterfall is like
every single HTTP request

93
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.980
that your website makes, right?

94
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.690
So if you think about it, you have
a website for the first time and you get

95
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.360
an HTML file and it has CSS, JavaScript's
links to other stuff, whatever.

96
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.232
All those get pulled in, and so this is
gonna show you every file that came down,

97
00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:08.550
its type, its size, how long it took,
a bunch of great information.

98
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.820
Yup, this one is kind of a new one.

99
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.140
It's a combination, so it used to
have like profiling and timeline.

100
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.210
Now, you have this Performance tab.

101
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.320
So if I kind of like click
the Record button on performance and

102
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.240
scroll around the page and then I click
Stop, you get a lot of information.

103
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.520
So we'll be covering this pretty in-depth,
but basically,

104
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.380
it does like everything
that your CPU is doing.

105
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.703
So like all the JavaScript that
gets parsed, what it's up to,

106
00:05:38.703 --> 00:05:44.591
where repaints happen, where JavaScript
bottlenecks could be anything like that.

107
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:48.991
This one's the Memory tab, so another
kind of like confusing area is that for

108
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:53.052
debugging memory leaks, you actually
end up using the Performance and

109
00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.355
the Memory tab a lot?

110
00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:56.076
So it's a little bit confusing but

111
00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.935
the performance is like your
kind of best place to start.

112
00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:02.763
We'll dive deeper into it but this Memory
tab allows you to do these profiles,

113
00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:06.651
these snapshots basically where you can
grab like a moment in time on the site and

114
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.770
it'll show you all the memory that's been
allocated to your site, what it's for,

115
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.825
why it got there, everything like that.

116
00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:16.952
So this is really great as we get
into the memory leak section.

117
00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:18.740
We've got this Application section.

118
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.020
This one also used to be called resources,
I believe.

119
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.810
So it kind of serves
two different purposes.

120
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.700
One, is that it shows all of
the kind browser storage you have.

121
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.696
So I'm not sure if any of you have
ever used like local storage before,

122
00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:34.834
if you set cookies or
if you set session stuff or index.

123
00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:38.214
These are all options that you have
when you're developing websites for like

124
00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:41.650
sticking something on the user's browser
so that you can read it again later.

125
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.205
So commonly, like if you log on to
a website, the website will set a cookie

126
00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:49.875
with your login information, so
when you come back, it can read that.

127
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.445
Similarly, if you have like preferences
that you set like, I like this theme or

128
00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:55.525
this whatever.

129
00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:57.795
Those are pretty common to
be stuck in local storage.

130
00:06:57.795 --> 00:07:02.811
So you can go to any website and you can
start clicking on them and see like what,

131
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:07.240
if any, information that website
is storing about you, all right?

132
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.890
The next one,
this one's pretty straightforward.

133
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.330
[LAUGH] This page is not secure.

134
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.390
And so the idea here is there's been this
really big push over the last couple of

135
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.960
years for HTTPS, so for using secure
socket layers everywhere, basically.

136
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.916
So some things you notice out of Google
are when you go to a secure site, so

137
00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:31.815
if I go to google.com,
I'll get this green lock here and

138
00:07:31.815 --> 00:07:34.597
the word secure across the top, right?

139
00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:37.991
You'll also notice that if I open
the DevTools on google.com and I go to

140
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:41.952
Security, I get a lot more information,
like the security certificate is valid,

141
00:07:41.952 --> 00:07:45.680
the connection is strong,
all these different things.

142
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.920
So the security comes in really
important for a couple of reasons.

143
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.050
One is all the security problems, right?

144
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.259
If you have a website and you're taking
any kind of sensitive information,

145
00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.534
login credentials, anything like that and
you're not doing it over HTTPS,

146
00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:02.317
then it can easily be sniffed and
read and stolen.

147
00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:05.342
But the other thing from
the product side is that Google and

148
00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:07.872
a lot of the other browsers and
search engines and

149
00:08:07.872 --> 00:08:11.781
things like that are really starting
to punish sites that aren't secure.

150
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:15.523
And so if you have a blog or something
like that that you're trying to advertise,

151
00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:19.170
and it is not over HTTPS, they're gonna
down-vote it in the search results.

152
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.555
And that I think we're gonna continue
to see a big trend towards that.

153
00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:26.392
So this panel doesn't really provide a lot
but it's always important to make sure

154
00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:29.411
that it's green so you know that
Google is happy with your site.

155
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:32.140
The reason that it's a little
bit complicated is if

156
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.138
you think about a website that itself
is over HTTPS, it serves itself, and

157
00:08:36.138 --> 00:08:39.790
then maybe you have like a MailChimp
link or something like that.

158
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.490
And that's over HTTP, right?

159
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.870
So now we get into a little bit of
a tricky area where the site itself has

160
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.990
a certificate, but there is a form on it
that reaches out to something insecure.

161
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.570
And so this will show you every single
request that your site does and

162
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.199
make sure that they're all green.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right,

163
00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:57.525
the next one is the Audits panel.

164
00:08:57.525 --> 00:09:01.378
So this has been recently replaced
with this tool called Lighthouse,

165
00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:04.466
which Google's been working on for
a really long time.

166
00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:05.806
It's a great tool.

167
00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:09.118
The Audits panel, I always think
about as like a very high level view.

168
00:09:09.118 --> 00:09:12.040
Something like the performance or
the memory or network,

169
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.716
those are like really low level.

170
00:09:13.716 --> 00:09:18.720
You're actually seeing your HTTP traffic
or you're seeing your JavaScript usage.

171
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.500
The audits is a lot more like it runs
your site through a suite of tests and

172
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.750
it gives you back really
actionable feedback, but

173
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.310
it'll give you back
things in plain English.

174
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.702
So it'll give you back things
like these images are too large.

175
00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:33.894
You have too much CSS
that's not even being used,

176
00:09:33.894 --> 00:09:36.730
or this site doesn't look good on mobile.

177
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:37.460
Things like that, right?

178
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.120
So it gives you this really
actionable feedback.

179
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.950
It's always where I like to start,
and at the end of the workshop,

180
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.380
we'll do some live audits
to people's sites.

181
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.019
And audit the audit step is always where
I start before diving into performance or

182
00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:49.473
network or anything like that.

183
00:09:49.473 --> 00:09:52.517
Cool, and yep, and there we go.

184
00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:53.512
So that's all of them.

185
00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:56.307
We've got a couple more buttons
here that I wanted to cover.

186
00:09:56.307 --> 00:10:00.637
So one thing, if we go back to my app,
one thing that's difficult sometimes is if

187
00:10:00.637 --> 00:10:04.714
you're in the Elements tab and you have
a really complicated app with a lot of

188
00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:09.138
markup, sometimes it can be difficult to
find the item that you're looking for.

189
00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:13.361
So one trick which I see a lot of
people do is when you right-click and

190
00:10:13.361 --> 00:10:17.880
click Inspect, the DevTools will
actually do its best to open focused on

191
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.417
whatever you're right-clicking on.

192
00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:23.711
Right, so you can kinda right-click and
boom, I have this focused.

193
00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:26.124
When you get into really small things,
it's a lot more difficult for

194
00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:28.635
the DevTools to know what it is that
you're trying to focus on, right?

195
00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:31.226
So if you've got like a little button
with a border with a background

196
00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:32.093
something like that.

197
00:10:32.093 --> 00:10:35.639
So this over here, you can use, you can
click it once then you'll go into this

198
00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:39.297
selection mode where you can move your
mouse around, and as you're moving your

199
00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:42.646
mouse around, you'll notice that
the DOM actually changes its focus.

200
00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:45.804
So you can kinda get it as fine grained
as you want, and then when you click,

201
00:10:45.804 --> 00:10:48.482
it pops you back into the Elements
tab with what you clicked on.

202
00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:52.003
The other one over here
is this Device toolbar.

203
00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:56.400
So I can click this, and
we go into this device emulation mode.

204
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.200
So it's pretty cool, so you can do,
I guess back to things that I see a lot.

205
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.910
I see people testing their mobile layouts
by kind of dragging the window around.

206
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.361
They try to get it to where they think it
is, but you can actually just go to this

207
00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:13.670
device simulation and
you can set it to responsive.

208
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.298
And then you can fully control,
what's 500 pixels wide,

209
00:11:17.298 --> 00:11:19.614
how does that look, things like that.

210
00:11:19.614 --> 00:11:20.740
You can zoom in and out.

211
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.450
This isn't controlling the websites.

212
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.310
It's controlling your perspective of it.

213
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.217
You can test what it's
like in offline mode or

214
00:11:27.217 --> 00:11:29.753
even in different mobile conditions.

215
00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:32.450
And you can even select specific phones.

216
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.040
So what does it look like on a pixel two?

217
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.580
What does it look like on
a pixel two turned sideways?

218
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.362
What does it look like on a pixel two on a
low end mobile device turned sideways and

219
00:11:40.362 --> 00:11:41.491
then I hit the Refresh so

220
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:44.389
you can see that it takes
a tremendous amount of time to load.

221
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:46.690
So this is really good for
a lot of different things.

222
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.630
It's good for testing your screen sizes.

223
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.693
It actually does send the mobile headers,
so if you have an app,

224
00:11:51.693 --> 00:11:55.157
it's pretty common with big companies
that when you hit their website,

225
00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:57.517
they'll detect what kind
of device you're on.

226
00:11:57.517 --> 00:12:00.870
And if you're on a mobile device, they'll
send you to a different experience,

227
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.650
whereas if you're on a desktop device,
they'll send you to one.

228
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.478
So if you want to test those things,
you can just set a mobile device,

229
00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:11.637
Refresh your site, and it should be
redirected to the mobile experience.

230
00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:16.397
It's also really good, this is like a big
thing that as we get into performance what

231
00:12:16.397 --> 00:12:20.140
I'll harp on a lot is that a lot of
us are very lucky as developers.

232
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.560
We have high-end machines, we have access
to really good high-speed Internet.

233
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.713
So we'll test our site, we'll be like,
it's really snappy to me, right?

234
00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:29.259
It looks really good.

235
00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.525
And then, we'll get out there and
we'll have all these problems,

236
00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:32.931
all these people having these problems.

237
00:12:32.931 --> 00:12:37.630
So I think the network simulation is so
good for developing that empathy.

238
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.401
I know a couple of big companies, they'll
do things like low-tier Tuesdays or

239
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:44.892
something like that, where the IT
department like crank down the network

240
00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:48.213
connectivity speeds in the office
on a day of the month, or whatever,

241
00:12:48.213 --> 00:12:50.520
to kind of force everyone
to have that empathy for

242
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.107
what it's like browsing the Internet
at 2G speed or something like that.

243
00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.650
But I think it's really important because,
again, I think there's a discrepancy.

244
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.930
Sometimes the site'll load really fast for
you.

245
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.600
Then we'll run an audit, and
the audit says it's really slow.

246
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.854
And it's like, well, what's going on here?

247
00:13:03.854 --> 00:13:04.554
And it's like, well,

248
00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:06.487
the audit is Is really trying to
think about the average use case.

249
00:13:06.487 --> 00:13:10.757
So like somebody on an average device with
an average Internet connection is having

250
00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.771
a very different experience than you.

251
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:15.412
Cool, and then the last thing
is over on the right side.

252
00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:18.388
We've kinda got all these settings, and
we'll get into a lot of these later.

253
00:13:18.388 --> 00:13:19.564
The important one for

254
00:13:19.564 --> 00:13:23.098
now is just this idea of like you
can control where the dock goes.

255
00:13:23.098 --> 00:13:26.429
So you click on the Settings,
you can control, dock it to the left,

256
00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:29.946
dock it to the right, dock it to
the bottom or pop it out into its own tab.

257
00:13:29.946 --> 00:13:32.405
Usually when I'm working on
something like a big site,

258
00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:35.647
looking at performance and stuff like
that, I pop it out into its own tab so

259
00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:38.180
I'm not constrained by it only
being part of the screen.

260
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.160
And then I think the last thing
I wanted to show you that's

261
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.580
kinda cool is what's
called the console drawer.

262
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:49.540
So on any tab except for the Console tab,
you can hit the Esc key, and the Esc key

263
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.490
will bring up a little drawer here with
the console and it looks just pretty nice.

264
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.760
So you can be looking at some kinda
element and then you can be like,

265
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.700
wait a minute, document.getElementById,
that element, you can do things like that.

266
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.926
So you can kind of be doing
both at the same time.

267
00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:07.240
And then you can go ahead and
close that by hitting Esc again.
