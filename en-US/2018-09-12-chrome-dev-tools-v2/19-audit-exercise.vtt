00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then,
Chrome has it's Audit Panel.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.170
So we looked through
the Lighthouse score already, and

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.150
we kind of did a little analysis
of the main page of the app.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.370
So then for an exercise, we've got
this auditing exercise over here.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.050
It's another app page that's slow to load.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.940
So just the exercise here is to open
it up locally or unmastering dev tools.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.965
Run an audit of it.

8
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.425
You can run any different ones that you
want, or all of them, like the SEO one,

9
00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:29.537
the accessibility one.

10
00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:32.346
And start getting a feel for
what's going on with this page.

11
00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:33.722
Both why is it so slow, but

12
00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:36.546
also what kinda stuff could
we be doing to improve it?

13
00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.970
So really, we'll take,
I don't know, ten minutes.

14
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.770
We'll run an audit here.

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.000
See kind of what performance ones that
would be the lowest hanging fruit that we

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.750
could get.

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.220
And then I'll run over it together.

18
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.050
And if you have extra time, you could
start running audits on your own sites.

19
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.385
And after this,
we'll cover it together and

20
00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.576
then we'll go over what the most common
things that you find with the audits are.
