00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:04.968
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The last
think is experiment, so

2
00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:10.120
there's always really cool stuff going on
in the DevTools that they're working on.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.360
So in order to get the experiments turned
on, you wanna go to About://flags.

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.885
And so these are all these
flags that you can turn on for

5
00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.046
Chrome that can do dangerous things or
sometimes awesome things.

6
00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:24.725
But the one we want is
developer tools experiments.

7
00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.467
You turn that on, and
you'll have to restart your browser.

8
00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.967
And as soon as your browser restarts,
you can then go to the dots and

9
00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:34.207
go to settings, and
then see this cool experiments tab.

10
00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:36.077
So there's like all these
things that they're working on.

11
00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.599
These change pretty often.

12
00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:41.562
Yeah, they might crash your computer or
whatever, but

13
00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:45.797
you get a really cool idea of like what's
coming next in DevTools which is nice.

14
00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:49.350
Custom UI themes, this is some
protocol monitors, really cool.

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.742
The super top secret tip is if
you then hit Shift seven times,

16
00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:59.390
you get this super
secret experiments here.

17
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.970
So Blackbox, JavaScript frames,
all this kind of cool stuff.

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.180
Terminal in drawer,
this is something they've been working on.

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.480
It's like a full file system
terminal that would be in your,

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.050
right in your DevTools console.

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.380
It should be pretty cool.

22
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.574
Yeah, you can play with all these.

23
00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:13.780
You can turn them on.

24
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.394
I've never had them crash or
anything like that.

25
00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:19.552
I think it's less stable than the quality
you're used to from Chrome stable,

26
00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:22.142
but it's still like really
high quality stuff.

27
00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:24.404
So yeah, the experiments are really fun.

28
00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:25.635
There's also Chrome Canary.

29
00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:28.947
I'm not sure how many people use it,
but Chrome also publishes the Canary,

30
00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:31.039
like a nightly build
version of their browser.

31
00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.110
So you can just download
Google Chrome Canary.

32
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.576
That'll also have some pretty
cutting edge DevTools stuff in it.

33
00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:39.725
Cool, where do we go from here?

34
00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:43.920
I made, back on the activities here,
I made a resources panel.

35
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.620
So if we go look at that, I just kinda put
all the links that you might want that I

36
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.400
linked through throughout the slides.

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.440
Where the slides are, a cool website
on page jank, the code repository,

38
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.100
the DevTools docs, some people to
follow that tweet a lot about DevTools.

39
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.170
All that kind of stuff,
and that wraps it up.

40
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.330
For anybody that's interested,

41
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.580
I always offer at the end of these
workshops that we could audit websites.

42
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.290
If anybody has any that are online and
they want audited,

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.970
we can go through that together.

44
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.930
But other than that, yeah.

45
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.030
Thank you all very much for coming out,
and let me know if you have any questions.
