00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Kinda just a chance to
get some hands-on experience with that.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.890
If we go over to Exercises
we have a Page Jank exercise

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.410
here with a beautiful
frontend master logo.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.320
Yeah, so the thing that we're gonna wanna
do here is we kinda have this concept.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.700
We've got these little M's.

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.430
They're pretty smooth.

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.320
They're kind of animating up and
down the page until they hit the end.

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.120
There was like this really cool
demo I saw on somebody's Chrome

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.970
team's talk once that had something
like this and I couldn't find it so

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.720
I recreated it for this workshop.

11
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.430
[LAUGH] But what we start
seeing is as we add more M's,

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280
they're supposed to be moving
at the same speed, right?

13
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.440
They should be really smooth still,
but they're not.

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.255
And the reason they're not is up for
you to find out.

15
00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:43.450
[LAUGH] So what we'll wanna do is add 50
of those M's or add them until it gets

16
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.920
really Janky, open up the performance tab,
click start, let it run for

17
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.490
a second, click stop, and then start
looking into like what is going on,

18
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.620
why are we having page jank,
how much page jank are we having.

19
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.261
See if you can kind of getting
an idea of what is going on that.

20
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:59.880
So yeah, we'll do a break for maybe 15?

21
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.310
And then we'll come back, and
we'll go over it all together.

22
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.675
I'm just trying to get a feel for

23
00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:07.264
how to know what's going on
with your runtime performance.
