&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I mentioned there's this
cool relationship between the elements and

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.220
the console.

3
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.660
And one of the things about that is you'll
often select something visually and

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.240
you want to play with it.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.430
You want to see what API's
are available on it, or whatever.

6
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.880
So open up the dev tools,

7
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.690
go to the Elements panel,
select any element that you want.

8
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.630
And then you can either go
to the console manually or

9
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.940
you can hit escape to open
up the console drawer.

10
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.490
Just for visibility I will
go to the console manually.

11
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.090
So with nav selected I go to the console,
I hit dollar zeros.

12
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.130
That's my currently selected item and
that brings up the nav in here.

13
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.500
And it goes a few numbers back,
I think maybe three.

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.600
So if I go back to elements I
select a new element wrapper.

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.178
I go back to console, dollar zero will
be wrapper, but dollar one is still nav.

16
00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:50.020
And so this is kind of a way that you can
just, the thing that you want to do is

17
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.420
bring something into the console and
call something on it, right?

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.270
Call add class on it, or get element
by ID, or something like that on it.

19
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.841
And so the way to kind of do that is click
on an element and then you can use that

20
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.243
custom dollar zero, dollar one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can wrap,

21
00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:08.208
if you've already jQuery injected,
you can just wrap it with another dollar

22
00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:08.956
sign.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

23
00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:12.131
another cool thing is, yeah,
dollar, dollar, dollar.

24
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:16.163
Another cool thing that actually reminds
me of is that the Dev Tools provide

25
00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:20.280
jQuery-like selectors on every page,
even if you don't have jQuery.

26
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390
I have this "class" equals "nav", and

27
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.760
then I can see that this provides me with
that normal dollar sign that I'm used to.

28
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.890
So I can do ".nav" and it actually gives
me the thing, which is pretty cool.

29
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.620
So, you can do jQuery, I guess jQuery is
sort of falling out of fashion sadly.

30
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.040
But if anybody really likes their jQuery
selectors you can use them in Dev Tools

31
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.590
on any page.

32
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.850
Even if it's not serving jQuery
you can still get those.

33
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.580
So, there's a couple of custom
little shortcuts that we'll learn.

34
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.685
These are just two of them so
you can do the jQuery style selectors and

35
00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.915
you can do the $0 to bring in element
from elements into the console.
