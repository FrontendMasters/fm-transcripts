00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.164
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So we talked a lot about
image performance when we did the audit.

2
00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:09.702
The images were too big and we talked
about things you can do, you can make

3
00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:14.171
them smaller like if they can only be
1,200 pixels at max, make it 1,200 pixels.

4
00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:16.131
You can remove the metadata,
you can compress them.

5
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:17.707
Those are all great things.

6
00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:21.761
But a lot of times with these apps that
we're building, they're pretty dynamic.

7
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.803
So we have a mobile layout,
maybe a middle sized layout and

8
00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:28.475
we have a large sized layout and
you kind of get into that same problem.

9
00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:31.337
So if we have a screen max
size of 1,280 pixels, so

10
00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:35.021
we do the smart thing and
we cut our image down to 1280 pixels wide.

11
00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:37.785
It's till a big waste of time,
if you're on a small screen.

12
00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:42.111
A small screen is still gonna load
that 1,280 pixel and then shrink it.

13
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:45.252
And so you kinda have a few choices
to make your images load faster.

14
00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:46.747
So if you start with a basic image.

15
00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:51.184
Img src, large.jpg or whatever.

16
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.392
There's an API called srcset for them.

17
00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:55.677
And so you can can use image srcset and

18
00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:59.681
what it will do is you pass it in
two parameters that are strings.

19
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:02.218
You pass in source set,
you give it an image name and

20
00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:04.660
you give it at what width
should that trigger.

21
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.528
Kind of thinking like media queries for

22
00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:10.732
those of you that have done with CSS or
if it's bigger than 800 pixels, do this.

23
00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:13.029
If it's smaller than and
that is a way you can do it,

24
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:14.745
you can do this with media inquiries.

25
00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.391
You can have a class on your
image with no source and

26
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:21.549
then you can have media inquiries that
can check the size and bring them in, but

27
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.452
there's am actual HTML API for it.

28
00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:26.572
And so this says,
what image to load at what width?

29
00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:30.112
So the large image had 800-width since
there are no other images specified

30
00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:30.654
to ran now.

31
00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:32.492
It's just gonna load the large image for
everything.

32
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:36.432
So this is equivalent
to this at this point.

33
00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:40.133
So we've got the srcset instead of src
now, but then you can start at a multiple.

34
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.883
So you can be like cool I have like
three versions of the same image.

35
00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:44.122
I want you to use the small one.

36
00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:47.803
If it is 300 width or below, I want you
to use the medium one if it is 800 or

37
00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:50.371
below and the large 1,
if it is 1,200 or below.

38
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.994
1,200 and above, sorry.

39
00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:55.944
Then you have these three images and
the browser does a really great job of

40
00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:59.830
just knowing immediately the screen
size you don't have to do a read for

41
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.130
that in fetching the appropriate image.

42
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.801
And then if you wanna do a fallback which
you should, because older browsers don't

43
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:09.432
support srcset, you should also leave a
source in there for just the default one.

44
00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:12.322
That's fine.
So image, the source is large.

45
00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:15.607
But if it supports srcset,
we do this really cool dynamic thing and

46
00:02:15.607 --> 00:02:18.786
only pull in the images that we're
actually wanting to pull in.
