00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.020
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool auditing,

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.950
kinda moving from that micro back out to
a macro level, auditing has come so far.

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.601
There's so

4
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:10.970
many great tools out there to just kinda
give a high level audit of your website.

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.990
We're gonna talk about a bunch of
the tools that are really helpful.

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.710
One thing to keep in mind is,

7
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.840
if the project you're working
on doesn't actually live online,

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.380
doesn't have a publicly accessible URL,
you're limited in what tools you can use.

9
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.250
So for example, we can start with,
I have some really cool stats.

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.611
There's a WordPress plugin
called W3 total cache, and

11
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:35.000
they kinda did some research years ago.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.800
Which I thought was really interesting but
talking about little improvements to speed

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.153
and how big of a difference
it can make for your brand.

14
00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:45.897
So google has reported, that like a half
a second speed decrease costs them

15
00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:48.926
twenty percent traffic
loss across the board.

16
00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:52.935
Yahoo had an article a while ago that
was like less than half a second speed

17
00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.444
decrease a 5-9% full traffic page loss.

18
00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:58.720
And by full page it means they were
hitting the page and before it finished

19
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.850
loading they just hit back or
closed the tabs, something like that.

20
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.891
Amazon sales they report
a one percent sales loss for

21
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.110
just a 100 millisecond decrease.

22
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.456
So I think like a lot of times,
it depends on your app and

23
00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:10.842
it depends on your priorities.

24
00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:14.727
But these like performances improvements
can really quickly translate money.

25
00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:18.202
I think people they are, if you have
a faster competitor, if there's faster

26
00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:21.675
sites out there like people are really
quick to leave to hit the back button and

27
00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:22.920
close the tab, try again.

28
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.214
Cool so with this page audits,
one of my favorite ones is this

29
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:33.908
one called webpagetest,
so it's webpagetest.org.

30
00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:38.701
It's this really cool site,
you can put in any URL that you want and

31
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:45.669
it'll give you this really
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: These really full audit,

32
00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:49.069
so it's gonna hit the site, it's gonna
run all these different tests on it,

33
00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.706
it's gonna give you back all these.

34
00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.136
The one thing I like about WebPage
is it gives you letter grades,

35
00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:55.260
like you're in school,
so you can just like.

36
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.690
Did you get an A, did you not get an A,

37
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.820
that kinda thing, it's a free service,
with that you get queued up.

38
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.860
So sometimes it takes awhile for the test
to start, but anyway it's a really great,

39
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.440
free resource.

40
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.500
Again, this one is only available if the
site that you wanna test is on a public

41
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.530
domain, not if you're just doing
local testing or something like that.

42
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.920
So WebPage performance,
you're totally right,

43
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.980
this is like one of the most
expensive things you can do,

44
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.710
is like broadcast a live stream,
and I keep hitting it.

45
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.888
So this is for FrontEnd Masters
right now with a live stream going,

46
00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:26.710
you can actually see that everything
across the board is almost entirely A's.

47
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.330
The time to first byte is the thing that's
kind of expensive, so it gives you all

48
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.250
this really cool stuff, like what the
first view looks like when it's loaded.

49
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.200
It shows you a breakdown of all the
different content requests that are done,

50
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.797
and what percentage they are.

51
00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:43.649
It just gives you this really good
top-level view of what you're app,

52
00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.160
how it loads, what the waterfall is like.

53
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.970
A lot of this stuff should look similar
to the network tab that we saw.

54
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.445
It is really similar stuff but I always
like the webpage test cuz it gives you

55
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:56.028
kinda the letter grades at the very top,
you can kinda see how you're doing,

56
00:02:56.028 --> 00:02:57.500
with things.

57
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.852
So yeah it's really great tool, it's free,
I think the only real cost to it

58
00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:04.850
is that you have to wait,
you wait your turn in line.

59
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.880
The next one that's really
cool is Lighthouse.

60
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.332
So Lighthouse is this amazing product by
a lot of the Google engineers that is now

61
00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:14.067
built in the Chrome Dev Tools,
which is so cool.

62
00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:17.869
It's a really similar thing to what we've
been looking at, it gives you this like

63
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.026
really great high level view of
like all these things there inside.

64
00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:25.294
So if we go to a side,
i'll just open my local thing back up, and

65
00:03:25.294 --> 00:03:31.192
i'll open up the Dev Tools again, and this
time i'm gonna go over to the audit's tab.

66
00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:34.806
And so from the audit tab we see
this light house logo, so for

67
00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:37.490
those of you that used that awhile ago.

68
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.890
There used to be on the audit set
there were three choices i think,

69
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.580
it was performance, best practices,
SEO or something like that.

70
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.598
It's been totally replaced by Lighthouse,
so you can click on them,

71
00:03:46.598 --> 00:03:49.474
perform an audit button and
you have all these different choices.

72
00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:53.246
The one thing I'll say is that selecting
all five of them takes a lot longer than

73
00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:56.003
selecting one of them, but
it is all great information.

74
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:59.651
If you're building a progressive Web App
it's important to check this otherwise you

75
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:03.110
probably gonna get a bad grade, if it's
not a progressive web App which is fine.

76
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.870
You can check accessibility, you can check
SEO you can check all this stuff let's

77
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.960
kinda start off with performance and
best practices one.

78
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.560
So I click run Audit and what we can see
in the mean time is it refreshes the page

79
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.120
back here and then it runs this audit and
starts loading all this stuff.

80
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.070
So it gathers all this information and
puts it together in this really nice

81
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.640
presentational format,
how your site's doing.

82
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.995
Let's not be too impressed because my site
is just some text on the thing [LAUGH],

83
00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:30.016
and I still didn't get close to
100 on this, but it's really cool.

84
00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:32.880
It kinda combines a lot of
the things we've been seeing, so

85
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.776
it shows you the screenshots so it shows
you at like 60 milliseconds it had it's

86
00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.029
first paint, it's first meaningful paint.

87
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.179
So you can see first meaningful paint
at 50 millisecond first interactive,

88
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.140
this is another thing.

89
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.320
Chrome is like, they really care
a lot about web performance, for

90
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.850
a lot of reasons.

91
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.400
They make a browser, they also
make a search engine, they do ads,

92
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.630
like all these reasons, so
they're really invested in it.

93
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.605
So, they've been coming up with these
models for viewing web performance and so

94
00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:58.534
kinda back in the day we would
look at like content loading.

95
00:04:58.534 --> 00:05:01.233
That was like what we would look like, how
long did it take for the content to load.

96
00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:04.170
But now they look at a few different
things where it's like when did

97
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.687
the meaningful paint happen, because
that's when your user can start reading

98
00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:11.174
things and seeing them, experiencing
your site instead of a loading screen.

99
00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:15.111
Then we look at interactive, right,
JavaScript is single-threaded, so

100
00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:19.180
if the thread is busy loading and doing
stuff like that, you won't be able to.

101
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.150
Have you ever seen a site
where you can't scroll yet or

102
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.100
you can't click on a button yet, right?

103
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.520
It's not interactive yet, so
they measure when the paint happens.

104
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.710
They also measure when users can actually
start interacting with the site,

105
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.550
and then they measure when it's
consistently interactive, sorry.

106
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.420
So if you have a little
period of interactivity and

107
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.520
then it goes back to being plugged up,
it'll go back and forth like this way.

108
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.170
So yeah, you get these, all these things,

109
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.250
you can drill down into them,
you can learn more about any one of them.

110
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.699
This is such a cool resource, I feel
like every website, chasing a hundred is

111
00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.094
not the goal here, the goal is just
like getting familiar with your web app.

112
00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:55.130
Is to run these tools to see
wear you could improve and

113
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.827
just start thinking about this is really
easy whereas this ones gonna be really.

114
00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:03.693
We're like a live streaming video app
we're probably gonna really struggle

115
00:06:03.693 --> 00:06:05.906
to get that time to
first byte really great.

116
00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:07.794
But maybe you could inline your CSS and

117
00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:10.925
do all these other cool things
like we've been talking about.

118
00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:13.219
You've got these opportunities, so

119
00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.021
it'll show you any files that are not
minified, or could be minified more and so

120
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.548
it's saying on this page I'm
loading Lodash and jQuery.

121
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:25.021
They are this size, and
they could be saved by this size, so

122
00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:26.698
these are big wins, right?

123
00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:29.473
Like if I minified the lodash.js library,

124
00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:33.180
I would get a really big win
out of that which is cool.

125
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.710
Same with compression, it's saying that
we've got all these things that are not

126
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.560
compressed and how much they would
be saved by GZIP compression.

127
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.800
Which we'll get into in a minute, the
kinda concept of compression and then it

128
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.280
shows you all your past audits too,
everything that you did really well on.

129
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.245
So yeah, this is a really great tool,
I love how down in the best practices you

130
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.872
see some other things like
It doesn't use HTTP2.

131
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:57.022
It includes JavaScript
libraries with vulnerabilities,

132
00:06:57.022 --> 00:07:00.280
I guess this version of JQuery
has a vulnerability count.

133
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.029
These are really cool things, and

134
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.959
this is where I think the dev tools can
add tremendous value to you as a worker.

135
00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.319
Especially at a bigger company,

136
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.381
where you can learn how to just kinda
run these tools and be like, hey did you

137
00:07:10.381 --> 00:07:13.800
know we're using a version of jQuery with
like these two vulnerabilities in it?

138
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.030
Make a ticket, and
we should probably try to update that.

139
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.210
Cool, and then for those that have apps
that you can add to the home screen,

140
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.000
if you don't set a short name in the
manifest file it'll use the whole title,

141
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.010
which would overflow.

142
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.577
So again, if you don't think you have
a website that people are gonna wanna save

143
00:07:30.577 --> 00:07:32.334
to the home screen, that's fine, but

144
00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:38.214
it is something to be conscious of.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool just a little bit,

145
00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:42.471
this is not a PWA workshop, although
that would be really fun too, but inside

146
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:46.817
Lighthouse there's a really comprehensive
progressive web app checklist.

147
00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:50.520
If you're interested in PWA's,
there's a lot of great resources online.

148
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.750
But if you're interested
in making your app a PWA,

149
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.700
you should run the Lighthouse on that.

150
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.973
And you'll see a really comprehensive list
of the things you would need to do to

151
00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:02.526
be a great progressive web app.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool, and

152
00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:04.135
they have this little checklist, too.

153
00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:06.445
If you have my slides there's
a progressive web app checklist, but

154
00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:09.985
basically it's like progressive web
apps are apps that work offline, and

155
00:08:09.985 --> 00:08:10.915
have an icon.

156
00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:14.205
Can be saved to the home screen,
all these kinda look good in mobile,

157
00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:16.405
all those kind of things.

158
00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:19.925
Cool, there's also this really cool
tool by Microsoft called Sonar Wall,

159
00:08:19.925 --> 00:08:21.285
it's a open source.

160
00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:27.880
It does a lot of the same things that
we've been kind of seeing, sonar wall.

161
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.230
So it does very similar
stuff to WebPagetester,

162
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.000
whatever but
one of the cool things about it is

163
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.400
it goes really in depth with some
of the networking stack stuff.

164
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.348
So again, free service, you get queued we
can sit here and wait for it to queue and

165
00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:43.039
then it gives you like a ton
of different information.

166
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.743
Again the goal is not to chase a hundred,
right, like every web site you can go to

167
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:49.530
google.com and
it's not gonna be all a hundreds.

168
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.979
Just some suggestions, things might be
applicable might not be applicable so

169
00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:54.612
we'll give this a minute let it run.

170
00:08:54.612 --> 00:08:55.699
And do it's thing and

171
00:08:55.699 --> 00:09:00.000
then we'll just do a little analysis of my
JonKuperman.com which is a static site.

172
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.798
It's such a cool service though and I just
learned about it like six months which is

173
00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:10.208
why I like,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay this one did finish,

174
00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:14.689
cool, so now that it's finished we
can take a little look through all

175
00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:17.680
the information that it gives you.

176
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.660
So again, it kinda gives you this
nice overview like a warning,

177
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.310
20 errors, how long it took to scan,

178
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:29.180
which is maybe more indicative of
itself than the website you're testing.

179
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.733
But it's cool, so it'll do accessibility
checks, interruptibility stuff, so it's

180
00:09:34.733 --> 00:09:39.857
like, here it gives this one error we can
expand that, the meta tag is not needed.

181
00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:44.297
So I've got this UA compatible thing
I guess that's not necessary and

182
00:09:44.297 --> 00:09:47.544
then it's really cool it
links to documentation.

183
00:09:47.544 --> 00:09:50.219
It's really thorough about all
the stuff they're testing,

184
00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:53.004
same things that we've been seeing right,
like http.

185
00:09:53.004 --> 00:09:56.554
These are really all roads to
the same path whatever tool,

186
00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.790
whatever UI works best for you.

187
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:05.307
So kind of again, this could be compressed
in some way, same with all of these.

188
00:10:05.307 --> 00:10:09.591
PWA, I don't have any touch icons
specified, so you couldn't save anything,

189
00:10:09.591 --> 00:10:11.300
security, we got some errors.

190
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.070
So content type did not specify so
these are like secure headers that they

191
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.070
recommend setting for every website
that I'm not setting on my website.

192
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:26.206
So these could be really important too,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Adding

193
00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:30.165
like no opener and
no refer to a lot of these,

194
00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:36.371
actually it would be interesting to
see why that is a security issue.

195
00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:39.997
Yeah it looks like it just wants these,
so you'll start seeing patterns and

196
00:10:39.997 --> 00:10:41.480
again we could look into this.

197
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.055
Like why do links need to have
these 'rel' values, I don't know.

198
00:10:45.055 --> 00:10:47.427
I'd be really interested in reading
the documentation finding out but

199
00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:49.295
then it's up to you whether
you implement those or not.

200
00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:54.198
So again we're just not chasing for
100 on the tools that

201
00:10:54.198 --> 00:10:59.210
we're using as much as to gain
better insight about our app.
