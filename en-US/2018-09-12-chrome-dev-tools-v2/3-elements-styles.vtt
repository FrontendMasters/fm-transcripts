00:00:02.143 --> 00:00:04.860
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
the first section is editing.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.065
So this is gonna be all sorts of stuff,
like you're working on your website,

3
00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:12.766
you're using the DevTools to author
code in some way shape or form.

4
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.860
Cool, so
I'm gonna go over to my lessons here.

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.858
So the DevTools can be
used as a full time IDE.

6
00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:22.440
I should put a little asterisk next
to that cuz it's not always possible.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.060
If you build a Create React app or

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.520
something like that,
it's not gonna be applicable.

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.831
But I have seen tremendous
improvements in using

10
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:32.370
the DevTools as an IDE in
just the last six months.

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.124
So I really think we're heading in
the direction where they'll be able to use

12
00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:37.406
this as an IDE for any app.

13
00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:39.218
I just wanna put that caveat out now, and

14
00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:42.107
we'll get into the specifics
why it's not always applicable.

15
00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:45.760
Cool, so now I'm gonna open up the
DevTools and just show a couple of things.

16
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.206
So it can do a lot of amazing things.

17
00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:50.544
It can edit your HTML and CSS.

18
00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:54.451
So if I go and I find Edit HTML and
CSS, I can see it here.

19
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:58.424
We can double-click to get into this
edit and we can change it to anything,

20
00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.645
right, like hello, and it'll change.

21
00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:04.047
Notice that if you refresh the page,
it'll go back to what it was again.

22
00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:06.090
So you're kinda editing locally right now.

23
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.520
You can also use it to edit the CSS.

24
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.030
So I can see like,
this is this black color,

25
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.860
I could change that to
anything that I want.

26
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.510
So we change it to red,
and you'll see it as red.

27
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.950
Again, a refresh sets it back.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: We can use it to save and

28
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.492
reuse a color palette.

29
00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:23.856
So this is a pretty cool.

30
00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:27.537
I think that this site,
since it only has one color on it,

31
00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:31.100
which is [LAUGH] the blue,
won't be a great example.

32
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.449
But let me pop over to,

33
00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:37.210
let's pop over to FrontendMasters.com,
which is this beautiful site here.

34
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.307
And if we go and
we find any color on FrontendMasters.com,

35
00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:45.403
like you can see the body is
set to this black, right?

36
00:01:45.403 --> 00:01:48.604
I don't want too much inception going on,
so I'll move that.

37
00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:52.389
One cool thing you can do is, so if you
click in the number, in the hex code,

38
00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.150
it'll take you into the edit mode,
right, where you can change things.

39
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.488
But if you click on the swatch,
it'll pop up this really cool color panel,

40
00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.786
which is very difficult to see.

41
00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:06.950
And so this color panel is cool,
right, it lets you, as a designer,

42
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.510
select what colors that
you're looking for.

43
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.360
But the thing that I wanted to bring
attention to here is that it also has

44
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.860
this little tab down here.

45
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.470
And so if you click that, so again, to get
here, you go to any site that has more

46
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.000
than a few colors, you click on
the little box with the color in it, and

47
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.320
then you click on the second set of arrows
down here, and it pops up this screen.

48
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.650
So what's really cool here,
I use this for a few different things.

49
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.600
One, it always saves
Google's Material Design color palette,

50
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.280
which is really cool.

51
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.690
So Google's Material Design is
their kinda design guidelines.

52
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.040
They have colors, they take and in
accessibility, all these different things.

53
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.220
So if I set the Material Design
color palette,

54
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.250
then we'll see all of these down here
have updated to these, really cool.

55
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.330
So I don't know how to design
nice looking websites.

56
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.970
So whenever I'm building a website,
I go into the DevTools and

57
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.330
I set it to Material Design, and
then I just stick to these colors.

58
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.907
It's really neat too, if you click on one,

59
00:02:57.907 --> 00:02:59.624
it shows you all the shades
that are available.

60
00:02:59.624 --> 00:03:02.685
So one thing that I would do,
right, is I would start a website,

61
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:05.028
make everything gray,
or black, or whatever.

62
00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:07.801
Then I'd open the DevTools and
I'd start kinda clicking around, and

63
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:10.292
I'd just set everything to these
Material Design colors, and

64
00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:11.810
I'd grab the hexes out of here.

65
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.843
But the thing that I think is really neat,
especially if you're working on the same

66
00:03:15.843 --> 00:03:18.781
production app every single day,
is if you go back to these,

67
00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:22.815
it actually is smart enough to go through
your website that you're currently on and

68
00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:26.800
pull out all of the shared colors and
make a custom color palette just for you.

69
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.380
And so this is on every website.

70
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.440
So then if you set it to page colors,

71
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.376
now down here all I have are the trademark
Frontend Masters colors.

72
00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:36.989
So I use this a lot so I don't have
to keep looking up hex codes or

73
00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.258
things like that, I just know that this
is the Frontend Masters orangey red,

74
00:03:40.258 --> 00:03:43.340
this is the blue, this is the light blue,
those kind of things.

75
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.440
So I usually have it set to the page color
format, just so I have quick access to all

76
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.453
those things.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Scroll items into view.

77
00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:59.805
So I've worked on a lot of
infinite scrolling apps before.

78
00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:03.892
So sometimes they get really difficult
to debug because you'll do something in

79
00:04:03.892 --> 00:04:07.252
the console, and you'll grab,
you have this element, right?

80
00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:11.519
So you have an element like Edit HTML and
CSS, and I wanna see it,

81
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.824
I wanna see where it is on the page.

82
00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:16.645
And so for the longest time,
all you get, if you can see.

83
00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:19.751
Unfortunately, I can't make it bigger,
but there's in the top-left corner,

84
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.282
there's this little black dialog,
like a tool tip with an arrow.

85
00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:24.635
And so
that's just information that says, hey,

86
00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.331
the thing that you have selected
down here, it lives up.

87
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:29.367
And so the thing that you had to do
is you'd scroll a little bit and

88
00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:30.058
you'd go back to it.

89
00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:31.005
Okay, it's still up.

90
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:33.370
You scroll a little bit, and
you go back to it, then you find it.

91
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.946
But one really cool thing on
these infinite scrolling apps,

92
00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:39.160
you can right-click on any element,
and you can click scroll into view.

93
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.496
And it'll actually move your browser's
focus to be focused on the element that

94
00:04:42.496 --> 00:04:48.594
you're looking for.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: You

95
00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:50.130
can use it to hide and show elements.

96
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.000
So you've got kinda two
different options here.

97
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.140
So if I click on hide and show elements,
you can use the H key inside of

98
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.700
the DevTools, and that'll make
the element go away, and reappear with H.

99
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.960
But you'll noticed that the rest of
the site doesn't collapse here, right,

100
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.030
and so this is the equivalent
to doing a visibility hidden, so

101
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.830
that it still carves out its space in the
DOM, you're just not seeing the elements.

102
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.790
So I use this when I'm designing
a lot to kinda try to hide something.

103
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.660
If you want to actually see what the
website would look like without the node,

104
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.840
you can click on that element,
just hit the Delete key.

105
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.470
And so we can see when I hit the Delete,
the site recollapses on top of that.

106
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.427
If you wanna undo a Delete,
you can do it with Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z.

107
00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:29.875
Yeah, Steve?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I saw that you

108
00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:33.130
put a special class in there
to make the element invisible.

109
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.408
If you have CSS that has
something like bang important-

110
00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:38.172
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Will it go over

111
00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.510
the class that you have?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the precedence?

112
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.270
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, that's a really

113
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.790
good question.

114
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.757
I do believe that if you have something
that has a visible, actually,

115
00:05:46.757 --> 00:05:47.840
let's try it out.

116
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.000
That's really cool, that's a cool idea.

117
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.556
So if you do a visibility,
visible, important.

118
00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.480
Okay, so now this is, and
now we try hiding it.

119
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.742
It does not hide.

120
00:06:00.742 --> 00:06:02.045
So that's really good, that's really good.

121
00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:04.691
Yeah, so
when you hit the H key to hide an element,

122
00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:07.596
we can see down here what's
kind of happened, right?

123
00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:11.320
Is that the DevTools have added
a class to the element, and

124
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.883
then they've added a rule to that class,
which is visibility hidden.

125
00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:18.446
And so Steve's question was really good,
it's like,

126
00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:21.841
what if you have a specific selector
on that that says, don't be hidden?

127
00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:23.871
So we added a more specific selector, and

128
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:27.650
we'll get in the CSS specificity in
a minute, and we said always be visible.

129
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.720
That does trump it, so yeah.

130
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.120
So you would not be able to hide that.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Trigger various states.

131
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.299
So I use this one at lot too.

132
00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:40.990
Another one, a lot of these have
come from things I've seen before.

133
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.983
So if you hover on a link like this, and

134
00:06:43.983 --> 00:06:48.581
I've got it pulled up here, and
I see that my color is red.

135
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:54.439
And then I hover on it, I can see that
the link changes from red to yellow,

136
00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.130
I'll make that a little bit bigger.

137
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.690
So it goes from red to yellow.

138
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.810
And so if I wanted to figure
out what yellow that is,

139
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.010
it gets really difficult, right?

140
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.460
Because by the time I get back over
to here, it's not hovered anymore,

141
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.570
it's not in its hover state.

142
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.996
And so a few things you could do,
you could look through the CSS and

143
00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:13.065
you could just try to figure out what it
is, or you can use these synthetic events.

144
00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:17.747
So with the element highlighted here,
you can click on this :hov, and

145
00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.411
then you can trigger any element state.

146
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:22.241
So you can say, well,
what does it look like when it's hovered?

147
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.777
Boom, and now you can see
the hover state is triggered, and

148
00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:27.030
I can actually get
the information out of DevTools.

149
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.766
So what does it look like
when it's been visited?

150
00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:30.800
The same thing, it turns green over here.

151
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.110
What does it look like
when it gets focused on?

152
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.580
It gets this blue ring around it.

153
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.863
So you can kinda use these
to set the states, and

154
00:07:36.863 --> 00:07:39.843
then take your time debugging or
doing whatever you'd like.
