&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: For this exercise, we're
just doing a mark and measure, right?

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.530
So we've got this mark and
measure js file.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.790
So let me open my dev tools.

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.310
Got mark-and-measure.js.

5
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.820
It really just waits for the window
to load, runs a random function.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.480
That function just hits that API that
we hit earlier, JSONs the results and

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.782
then console.logs all of them, right?

8
00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:21.630
[LAUGH] So if we look in the console,
we see these things.

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.650
So what we wanna know is how
long did this take to go?

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.910
And so I would encourage you
to do it two different ways.

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.290
One, put some date times in this file and

12
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.160
calculate them like we did in the slides
and then do a performance mark.

13
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.340
You should see the same calculation, but
also when you do it with performance mark,

14
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.630
check the performance tab, cuz you should
be able to see a really cool UI for that.

15
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.600
So yeah, we'll take a little break.

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.320
And then we'll come back, and
we'll do it all together.
