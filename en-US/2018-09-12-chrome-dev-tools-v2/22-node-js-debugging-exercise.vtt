&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And the exercise
here is we've got this page and

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.160
it takes a longer time than normal.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.597
We can kinda see up here
how long it takes to load,

4
00:00:07.597 --> 00:00:10.459
whereas all the rest of these
pages are instant, right?

5
00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.170
So there's something going on with
this one that's taking a long time.

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.428
So we'll wanna mount
the node debugger on it and

7
00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:17.582
figure out what it is that's taking so
long.
