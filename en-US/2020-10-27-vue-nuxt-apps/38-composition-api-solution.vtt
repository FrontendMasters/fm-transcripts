WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.820
So we have the index.view
that we went over before.

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.180
As you might assume,
we have a layout.view with an app menu.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.200
In our app menu, since we're not
doing anything in the app, there's no

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.140
kind of script stuff going on, it really
lays out the same way that it would for

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.180
a typical view app, an options API app,
so nothing new there.

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.810
We're pointing to tacofriends.

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.900
And we have tacofriends.view as our page.

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.015
So we have this main,
we have our tacofriends, and

9
00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:41.704
all of this is kind of options API,
or not options API, but

10
00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:45.750
the directives that you're
used to from before.

11
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.257
So we've got at click, alertunit.

12
00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:51.990
We've got v-for friend in friends,
and key is friend.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.270
Now if we go into the TypeScript section,
you can see we have that define component.

14
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.595
I'm showing you with reactive but
like I said, you could have used ref.

15
00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:07.418
Because I'm using reactive,
I'm going to also use two refs so

16
00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:13.615
that I can pass that in and say, state,
and not have to say state dot, state dot.

17
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:17.667
Here inside the state, for reactive,
we have list of friends and

18
00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:22.379
it's the Sarah likes all tacos,
Brian Holt, making fun of Brian Holt, And

19
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:24.386
Shirley, because I love them.

20
00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:28.070
Then we have this function
called alert unit.

21
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.890
And something you might
have gotten caught on.

22
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.200
I'm not sure if you're
familiar with TypeScript is,

23
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
that this e does need to
have a type of property.

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.440
So like, if you're familiar
working with TypeScript,

25
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.890
you will probably use the correct
designation here and say, string.

26
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.460
But I show with any here,
because just in case you're not

27
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.120
familiar with TypeScript and you don't
want to dive into all of TypeScript,

28
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.018
there is a really great TypeScript
course on front in masters.

29
00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:01.430
Then use any, for right now,
and in the future,

30
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.400
this will upgrade so that you don't
have to pass a type or use TypeScript.

31
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.480
So we're gonna alert e.target.textContent.

32
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.539
This is something that
hangs off of that target.

33
00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.070
There's a number of ways we
could have done this, right?

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.230
We could have actually stored an empty
string inside of reactive or refs, and

35
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.973
then had that click events pass through,
and hold that, and alerted that instead.

36
00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:32.184
So if that's what you did,
that's totally correct as well.

37
00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:33.320
We did that in the game.

38
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.790
We also did something like it in the app.

39
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.690
So I'm just showing you another way
of working here, but both are valid.

40
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.740
And here, of course,
this like special composition API thing

41
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.480
of needing to pass the reactive state.

42
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.300
So we're passing in
the state to ref state, and

43
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.290
then we're also passing in alert unit.

44
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.830
So any kind of functions
that we declare or

45
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.650
something like that will also
be passed in the return.

46
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.670
And again,
that return statement is very explicit.

47
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.400
It tells any person who comes along later.

48
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.405
That is exactly what we're returning here,
and that is what you can compose with.

49
00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:12.400
So there we have it.

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.756
We have our app with our,
Sarah likes all tacos, and

51
00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:20.130
then in home, we have our watch effect.
