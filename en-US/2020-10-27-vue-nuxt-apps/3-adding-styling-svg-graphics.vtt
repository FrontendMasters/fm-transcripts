1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.980
So I'm not going to use this hello world.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.452
So I'm going to get rid of this component.

3
00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:10.440
I'm also gonna get rid of things
that are inside this app.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.023
And I'm also gonna add a class of contain,
because I know that I'm gonna be

5
00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:20.000
using some CSS that allows me
to do some relative positioning,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.850
so that the other things
are positioned absolutely within them.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.300
I'm also gonna go over to my resources.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.377
So I'll go look at my game resources.

9
00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:34.250
And then I'll say, okay,
here's my main.CSS.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.950
I'm gonna grab all of
the main.CSS here and

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.640
dump it right into my
top level app component.

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.270
I'm doing that right now because
it's not that much styles actually.

13
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.880
It's a very small amount of styles.

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.250
But in the next thing that we're doing
with the food app, we're going to bring it

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.260
in as an asset and I'll show you how
to wire that up with knuckles config.

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.660
So I'm showing you both ways.

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.730
I'll be showing you both ways of a bunch
of different things through the day.

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.960
So we've got our body, we're bringing
this in, we need to bring in our font.

19
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.720
So if I go back to the browser, and
don't worry about that I just deleted

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.110
a component that it's looking for, but
that error will go away in just a second.

21
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.911
If we go to fonts.Google,

22
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:24.520
I'm gonna actually use a font called
recursive because we're programmers and

23
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.480
why shouldn't we use
something called recursive?

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.230
That's a great name.

25
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.100
That's the whole reason
[LAUGH] why I chose this was

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.110
basically just cuz I like the name.

27
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.941
So I'm gonna grab my link here, and
I'm gonna go back to my application.

28
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.950
And I'm gonna go into our index.HTML.

29
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.888
And I'm going to add this link into my

30
00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:51.020
index.HTML and
that will give me that recursive piece.

31
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.930
So if I go back into here, you can see I
have the font family recursive lined up.

32
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.100
And just to check things out,
I could also say,

33
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.220
hi there and see how that's loading.

34
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.340
So let's go back over here and
we can refresh.

35
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.300
And I didn't add in.

36
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.280
This is a good one so that you can see.

37
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.140
When we add in SCSS, we also don't
have the assets of the background.

38
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.680
When we add an SCSS to the SAS loader,
sometimes we have to run node.

39
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.290
So we have to run NPM or NPM I node,

40
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.750
SAS Loader.

41
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.616
Or in our case we're using yarn.

42
00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:51.833
So we would say yarn add node
sass sass loader, all right?

43
00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:56.496
Now if we wanna load
that background SVG in,

44
00:02:56.496 --> 00:03:04.820
we would dump it into this awesome
assets folder that we mentioned before.

45
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.630
And we're already making a relationship
with that inside of the app.view.

46
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.440
So let's go back to what we've got here.

47
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.900
So we've got the whole background loaded,
and we've got that kind of position,

48
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.490
the background size, position cover.

49
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.090
So it's kind of filling up the whole
screen and you can see that Hi there and

50
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.310
we can also see that our
font is now loading.

51
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.210
Awesome, okay, so
we're gonna bring over a few other assets.

52
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.960
I mentioned before that we have some
components and they're pieces of an SVG.

53
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.430
So I'm gonna bring these components
into the components folder, right here.

54
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.030
I'm also going to delete the hello world,
as I'm no longer using it.

55
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.140
Cool, we also have this base SVG, but
we'll come back to that in just a second.

56
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.320
We have our questions as well.

57
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.190
And all of these questions are the
questions that we're gonna kind of loop

58
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.070
through and
use as a kind of manifest file for

59
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.730
the whole game of all of that game state.

60
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.730
So right now I'm going to grab questions.

61
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.030
And I'm gonna go into the store
into the index js file.

62
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.625
And in state, I'm gonna load those
questions but this is an object, right?

63
00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:27.010
And it's not an array like in this file.

64
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.330
So, what we do is we say
questions with a colon and

65
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.130
now we're loading all of our questions.

66
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.310
Excellent, we can make sure that this is
loaded by coming back to this game state,

67
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.660
refreshing the page.

68
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.430
And then in our view area
we've got our route app,

69
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.480
which has, nothing going on yet.

70
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.840
We didn't store any data yet.

71
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.960
And then if we look in the view x tag,
I can load state and

72
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.280
you can see that questions array
with all of those objects.

73
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.608
So if you wanted to see the difference
between the components and the view x,

74
00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:06.014
you can go into that area and we can
see that everything's loading properly.
