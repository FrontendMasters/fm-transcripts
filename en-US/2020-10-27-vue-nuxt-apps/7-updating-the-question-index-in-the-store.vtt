WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
The next thing that we wanna do,
is we wanna send that to the store, right?

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.190
When we go send it to the store,
we're gonna do a few things with it.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.540
We're gonna take that character and
we're gonna say,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.437
is the character is the one that
we're passing the one that we chose?

5
00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:15.965
Does it match?

6
00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.485
Because if it does match
your score is better.

7
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.373
But if it doesn't match
the score is worse.

8
00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:24.405
So we wanna make sure that we're
updating the score based on whether or

9
00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:25.895
not you got the character or not.

10
00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:31.250
The other thing that we're
gonna do is we're gonna say,

11
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.550
go through the index like every time you
select something, go to the next question,

12
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.710
right, because we don't wanna stay
on this question once it's selected.

13
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.490
Once it's selected,
we wanna go to the next question.

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.930
So we're gonna update that question index.

15
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.960
So we'll start there and we're gonna
add a little bit more logic to.

16
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:55.570
So we've got, update UI state,
pick character.

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.910
We're in index.js.

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.700
Sorry.

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.600
We've got our pick question.

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.340
And what we wanna do is we want to

21
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.900
do like we did here where we're
committing something to the store.

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.530
And in that store,
we're gonna say like pick question.

23
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.060
Let's just make a pick question mutation
in the store that kinda matches.

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.540
So pick question.

25
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.985
And we're gonna pass in the states and
we're gonna pass in the character.

26
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:29.008
So when once we have this,
we'll be able to do some things with it,

27
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:30.780
but first let's wire it up.

28
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.872
So we've got This.store.commits,

29
00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:45.624
Pick question and
we're also gonna pass in character,

30
00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:48.340
which is what we're gathering here.

31
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.130
Now inside of this index, we've got,

32
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.430
let me make sure that I have my commas and
things.

33
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.660
We're actually not gonna
use actions in modules.

34
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.280
In this one we will use actions
in the next piece of this course.

35
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.860
So, once we move over to that,

36
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.900
then you'll see like how actions
can be used to commit a mutation.

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.840
But for now,

38
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.680
we're just gonna use mutations in this one
because everything happens automatically.

39
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.910
We don't need anything
kind of async functions.

40
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.230
So what we're gonna say is,

41
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.120
we're gonna check if the character
is the right character.

42
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.928
So we're gonna say,
is the character the State.character?

43
00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:34.180
[LAUGH] I'm gonna use a ternary operator.

44
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.690
So you can think of it like, is it?

45
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.900
If so, then we're gonna say, state.score.

46
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.390
And we'll give it like, I don't know,
10 or something like that.

47
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.185
And then otherwise we'll say state.score.

48
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.580
And we're going to decrement it by 10.

49
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.180
So we're giving them a better or
worse score depending on how that's going.

50
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.560
The next thing we wanna do is we wanna
say if we have more questions to go,

51
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.660
if the if the question index isn't at
the end yet, increase the question index.

52
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.610
Otherwise we're gonna figure
out if we won or loss.

53
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.293
So we're gonna say like if the state

54
00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:27.598
of the question index is less than

55
00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:33.680
state questions.length minus one.

56
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.400
So if we still have more questions to go,
if we haven't reached the end of the index

57
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.284
there, then we're gonna say
state.question index ++.

58
00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:51.640
So we're gonna say yeah,
if you have more to go, let's keep going.

59
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.620
So let's just see that in action
before we do anything else.

60
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.530
Let's go back over here.

61
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.720
We'll refresh again, we've got a mechanic.

62
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.950
And right now, you might catch something.

63
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.360
It's always gonna be an order over here,
right?

64
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.290
We've always got the baker,
then the mechanic, then the artist.

65
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.490
So I can even check how this score
is working very quickly with that.

66
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.130
We're gonna use it to our advantage
at first and then we're gonna fix it.

67
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.770
So right now we've got
the character chosen.

68
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.300
So if I choose Wolfgang Puck,
you can see that that UI state is updated.

69
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.900
The question indexed and get better.

70
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.780
Let's see what what we need to do here.

71
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.885
State.question index ++,
if state.question index

72
00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:51.129
is less than state.question index.length,
let's just refresh and go back.

73
00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:58.070
So we've got our baker.

74
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.140
We're picking a character.

75
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.750
We're loading that UI state.

76
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.730
And I'm passing that in.

77
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.890
Let's also make sure that I'm actually
calling what I think I'm calling.

78
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.402
If I go here, it's not,
I think it's not actually calling this.

79
00:05:18.972 --> 00:05:22.140
Go back over to VS code.

80
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.720
Cool.

81
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.420
We've got pick question state character.

82
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.570
And then we've got in our app,
pick question.

83
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.160
Pick question and
we're passing in character.

84
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.988
So let's console log,

85
00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:45.411
Character to make sure that we
are selecting that correctly.

86
00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.290
We've got mechanic.

87
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.160
We're loading the states, cool.

88
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.860
We picked the character and are we console
logging we are console logging baker.

89
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.630
Okay.

90
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.340
So we're console logging baker.

91
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.610
Let's see in this,
kinda shows debugging too.

92
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.020
We're not updating the question index.

93
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.010
So we need to make sure that we
are updating the question index correctly.

94
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.660
So in this pic question,
we have this console log and

95
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.750
we say character is state,we check if
the state.character is the character,

96
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.370
and we update the score, and we're
also gonna advance the question index.

97
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.750
So let's take a look, If I refresh
this and I give myself the baker,

98
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.560
we can see now that question
indexes updating it's saying,

99
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.570
okay, are we,
have we already answered that?

100
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.590
Great.

101
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.700
And if I keep selecting the wrong one, so

102
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.380
I'm gonna select artist,
which is the lowest one.

103
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.480
And if I keep selecting the wrong one,
what happens to the score?

104
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.600
If I go into view,
then I can see in that view x score.

105
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.800
We now have a score of negative 30.

106
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.660
Right?
We're like lowering the score because I

107
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.740
keep picking the wrong one which is good.
