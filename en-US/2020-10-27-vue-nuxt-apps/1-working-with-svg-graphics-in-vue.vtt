1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.380
Our first step is to make a game.

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.410
This is going to be really fun.

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.890
All right, so
if we look at this alien zombies game,

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.190
that's at alien zombies
dot netlify dot app.

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.760
You're an alien zombie in
order to survive on Earth.

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.500
You have to pretend to be a human
on this planet you took over

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.610
the body of a nearby human.

8
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.700
But the trouble is their
best friend showed up.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.670
So they look a little suspicious.

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.380
You have to answer the right questions to
make sure your identity is kept a secret.

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.520
So you have to pick which human
you're going to pretend to be.

12
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.060
So I could say like Baker.

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.320
And then, you say what's your dog's name?

14
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.390
Well, my Baker, so probably Wolfgang Puck,
what's your favorite hobby?

15
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.730
Extreme ironing?

16
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.160
Maybe What's your favorite color?

17
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.810
Transparence is cereal soup.

18
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.520
Yes, I'm Jake, Jason link stuff in case
you're wondering Jason link store food

19
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.160
does front end masters courses here
things everything is super sandwich and

20
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.590
it's not what you can't be cereal.

21
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.150
Okay, so far we're doing good.

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.090
What's the most imaginative
insult you can come up with?

23
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.940
You're a substitute teacher
with no lesson plan.

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.260
Your faces have melted welly that
I looked up Scottish insults.

25
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.920
You eat buttons off the remote.

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.850
Okay, you eat buttons off the remote.

27
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.180
Alright, if peanut butter
wasn't called peanut butter,

28
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.040
what would it be called
brown paste legume.

29
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.710
I'm really proud of legume.

30
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.849
Get it glue legume Okay, anyway,

31
00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:38.960
groundnuts moose will
say groundnuts moose.

32
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.120
I lost.

33
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.010
All right.

34
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.290
Okay, so we've got this like wonky face.

35
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.080
So you can see that
through this application.

36
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.580
I, you know,
I'm kind of like figuring out who I am and

37
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.740
then I'm tracking through these questions,
and then I'm figuring out if I won or

38
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.120
lost and We can play again at the end, and
there's like a butterfly in the studio.

39
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.610
That's so nice.

40
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.440
Cool.

41
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.110
So in the repo, in that GitHub repo that
we mentioned earlier, building web apps

42
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.440
with view, the game resources directory
is going to be the starter for the game.

43
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.830
The resources and all the material.

44
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.230
But before we dive in, even to creating
the app or looking at the resources,

45
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.660
we're gonna look really quickly at
how the graphics were built and

46
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.490
feel free to move forward if that kind
of thing doesn't interest you, but

47
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.800
I get a lot of questions sometimes on how
to even put together something like that.

48
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.000
Truthfully, I bought the background,

49
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.370
I bought those characters on Shutterstock
or something, I go into illustrator.

50
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.670
And I've the background is loaded
separately as a separate SVG as

51
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.870
you're gonna see.

52
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.970
And then I have this SVG,

53
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.170
where I have a bunch of these characters
that I've placed on top of one another.

54
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.270
Then I make sure that all of
my layers are named well.

55
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.420
I've got a mechanic, that's a group
that height has all the mechanic

56
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.570
that has an artist that has a zombie
We're gonna have a part of this course,

57
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.310
where the zombie gets
revealed if you start losing,

58
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.540
we have a clip group
that shows those things.

59
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.940
And here are the clip paths that show and
hide them.

60
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.290
We have a scoreboard with a needle,
good and bad and the rainbow.

61
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.960
So basically I've put all
of these things in, and

62
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.370
I've named them
appropriately Alien Bubble.

63
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.320
Friend bubble.

64
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.490
And the reason why that's important
is because if I export this and

65
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.790
say, export as, and I say, like

66
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.070
SVG I can say show code here.

67
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.350
And it will show me all this code and all
of these IDs that I used for things like

68
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.320
what did I say friend bubble are things
that actually exist in the code.

69
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.890
So all of these pieces become
HTML elements with IDs and

70
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.430
classes, just like you'd use
in a regular application.

71
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.340
And SVG is really good for this because
everything stays really stable.

72
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.900
I don't have to Worry about
positioning things anywhere because

73
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.080
it's working with a coordinate system and
it just keeps it steady in that thing.

74
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.590
So I don't have to specify
all of those little pieces.

75
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.360
I can just add, IDs to things cool.

76
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.950
In the resources directory, if we open up
VS code, we'll see a few different things.

77
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.530
One of them I actually gave you
the original SVG for the alien

78
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.320
zombie original source so that if you
wanted to load it into illustrator or

79
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.810
another graphics editor, you could play
with it and see it before I optimised it.

80
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.880
In the interest of time.

81
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.030
What I've done is I've taken all
those groups, those like GID,

82
00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.445
alien artist Baker friend, and
I've turned them into view components.

83
00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:07.190
And all this is I'm pulling that group
out of that big thing you saw, you know

84
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.200
I was referencing that by the ID and I'm
just dumping it directly in the template.

85
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.190
I just have, all I have is
the template with that group.

86
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.280
And I don't have scripts or,
you know, styles or anything.

87
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.050
You don't need those actually,
they're optional if you're not using them.

88
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.380
So I did that for artists, for Baker for
friend, and so on and so forth and

89
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.850
for the score as well.

90
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.060
And you can see that that rainbow and
the needle and

91
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.100
things like that are actually you know,
bad Good needle,

92
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.810
all of those things that we had
in Illustrator are in this file.

93
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.270
So now that they're components, I can load
them into a thing that I called base SVG,

94
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.600
which is the, you know,
the base of that whole thing and

95
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.910
I can actually plop those pieces in, but
now I can plop them in as components and

96
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.980
you remember the Friend bubble was
what they were saying an alien bubble.

97
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.180
I've got some text, you can work with
text and SVG, and it loads the same.

98
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.600
You can style it with fonts and
things like that.

99
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.290
So I have a background that you saw
here as well that's more static.

100
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.650
That's not part of that one, big SVG.

101
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.740
So now I'm placing all of these
things inside of this SVG.

102
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.920
I also have a mean dot SCSS file that
I'm gonna use for all the styling.

103
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.700
We're not gonna dive too far into
styling today we're really going to just

104
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.330
work with the view applications
the way that they are.

105
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.350
And what we're gonna do is add
like a global style sheet so

106
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.960
that we can get going really quickly and
and use that but there again,

107
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.500
there are other courses like Jen Kramer
teaches a wonderful course on CSS if

108
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.500
you're interested to know more, we're
going to write a little bit of CSS, but

109
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.360
that's not the main focus of the course.

110
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.140
So we also have things
like your aliens zombie,

111
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.731
you know, intro text,
those questions we asked.

112
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:03.971
I've got in,
you know an array of objects here.

113
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:08.173
So we're going to learn how to piece
all of these pieces together into

114
00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:09.342
the application.
