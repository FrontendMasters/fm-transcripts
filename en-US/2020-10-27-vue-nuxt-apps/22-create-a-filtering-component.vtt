1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.860
Cool, we'll come back to this piece.

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.190
We're going to now filter the grid
with a reusable component and

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.700
use computed properties.

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.970
So how are we gonna filter that grid?

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.950
We have that grid of information
that we're working with here, and

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.950
what we want is on the restaurants page,
we wanna be able to filter for

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.440
dim sum or pizza or
tacos based on our mood.

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.610
So let's go back over to
the file in the restaurants file,

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.780
and you might have noticed that
the restaurants was over up in the side.

10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.040
I did make a style that will allow
the restaurants to lay out okay and

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.650
also have like a select value here.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.046
So I'm going to go over here and

13
00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:51.137
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create
a div that is like restaurants heading.

14
00:00:57.416 --> 00:00:59.642
Not restaurants heading,
restaurant heading.

15
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.360
I'm gonna place restaurants
inside of that.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.010
And that's also where we're
going to add a select.

17
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.550
So I'm going to create
a thing called AppSelect.vue.

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.960
And we've add it to the components,
Create our component here.

19
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.700
And when we're working with Select,
we wanna

20
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.060
make sure that we're working with
something that is good for blind people.

21
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.641
The other thing that we're gonna do is
we're gonna use a computed property to be

22
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.273
able to filter through that
information really quickly.

23
00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:42.240
If you watched the other course, you saw
how computer properties can be really

24
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.560
powerful for filtering lots of
information super efficiently.

25
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.760
Because it's cached and doesn't update
unless a dependency has changed.

26
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.050
So that makes it a really good
candidate for filtering this grid.

27
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.650
So I'm going to create this AppSelect
component but I named it AppSelect and

28
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.830
not something more specific.

29
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.390
Because, what I wanna do is I wanna
make a Select that I can reuse for

30
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.070
other parts of the app in case I'm gonna
do something else with that AppSelect.

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.530
So if you are curious on how
to make accessible markup,

32
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.430
web aim is a really good resource.

33
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.172
So they show you how to do all
of these kind of form controls.

34
00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:24.490
So it's text inputs, text areas,
checkboxes, radio buttons.

35
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.790
So if you're the kind of person who's like
I care about the blind, but I don't know

36
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.420
how to make everything appropriately, you
can copy paste the markup from here and

37
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.220
then use Vue to kind of add to those and
bind to those,

38
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580
which is what I'm doing, basically.

39
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.090
So, I'm taking this label and
my select, and

40
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.180
now I know that I'm going to
be creating accessible markup.

41
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.160
So, in this div, I'm going to paste
what I brought in and instead of

42
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.520
hard coding values in data, what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna add in some props.

43
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.633
So I'm gonna say, v-props and

44
00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:08.060
I'm going to say Select and
the type is gonna be string.

45
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.800
And I'm just gonna, the Select
the default is gonna be cuisine,

46
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.610
because I'm probably gonna use this
all over my application this way.

47
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.720
But in case I'm gonna use it for something
else, like let's say I'm gonna use it for

48
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.960
a feedback form from customer or

49
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.610
something like that, I can, I don't
have to use the default necessarily.

50
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.088
So I can say, which is your favorite,
instead of thing I could say,

51
00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:38.146
Cuisine, actually maybe I want to rewrite
that because maybe you're in the mood for

52
00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:41.983
dim sum, but it's not your favorite, tacos
are your favorite because they have to be.

53
00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:46.654
[LAUGH] We're gonna say,

54
00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:51.551
what cuisine do you want?

55
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:56.846
We're also gonna make sure that
the label is hooked up to that Select so

56
00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:58.710
that it's unique.

57
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.030
So as we have the Select,
the label has to work with the ID.

58
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.850
These have to be associated.

59
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.340
And again, I'm putting that bind there.

60
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.980
This colon is v-bind.

61
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.860
I'm putting that shortcut
of the bind there,

62
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.460
because I want it to actually evaluate.

63
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.750
I want it to actually use that prop.

64
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.780
If I did not do that,

65
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.200
it would just evaluate as Select
just hard coded that string Select.

66
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.850
So we have this Select
with the name of thing.

67
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.220
And then we have a bunch of options.

68
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.940
In option,
we want to at first show a default option.

69
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.370
And then we wanna show
a bunch of other options.

70
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.760
So I'm gonna have no value on this.

71
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:50.532
And I'm gonna say,
Please select a whatever it is,

72
00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:54.460
I said cuisine here instead of Select.

73
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.590
Did you say that in the chat?

74
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.104
Let's see.
I think people said it in the chat.

75
00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:01.575
Yeah, okay.

76
00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:05.750
[LAUGH] So here, we have the Select.

77
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.724
Please select the Select I probably
could have named that better, all right?

78
00:05:08.724 --> 00:05:12.389
[LAUGH] We've got this option value.

79
00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.669
And the nice thing about using Vue is I
can loop through a bunch of different,

80
00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.410
options that we come in.

81
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:27.454
So, I'm actually going to say
Select options as a prop 2 and

82
00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:32.363
that one will be, the type is array.

83
00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.993
And when we use arrays and props,

84
00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:42.510
we have to make sure that we use
a function and we're returning that array.

85
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.680
So we can't just pop the array and
we actually have to return a function.

86
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.063
So we have tacos, Pizza,

87
00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:58.930
And dim sum, cool.

88
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.290
Now we can loop through our options so

89
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.914
we can say v for option in

90
00:06:07.914 --> 00:06:13.220
Select options.

91
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.960
And I actually like this about VS Code
it errors until you provide a key.

92
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.742
So it will kind of remind you,
hey, I think you need a key there.

93
00:06:22.742 --> 00:06:26.426
[LAUGH] And
I think that's a feature of the tour,

94
00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:30.204
which is an extension that
I mentioned before but

95
00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:34.272
if you install my snippets
it comes as a dependency.

96
00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:36.780
We also need to make the value option.

97
00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.681
And this has to say option,

98
00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:57.060
Cool, I think we're doing pretty good so
far, all right?

99
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.230
The next thing that we wanna do is we
wanna actually put it on the page so

100
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.760
we can see if it's gonna be there.

101
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.820
So, [LAUGH] we will probably wanna
add that v-import of AppSelect.

102
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:21.336
And, great, let's add our App,
Select here.

103
00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:25.310
Let's go check out what we have right now.

104
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.790
We've got our Nuxt food app.

105
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.230
And now you can see it's properly, [LAUGH]
laid out instead of in a goofy corner.

106
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.530
And we've got what cuisine and
we have tacos, pizza and dim sum.

107
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.490
Right now though it's not really doing
much it's just presentational because

108
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.770
we're not actually gathering
the data anywhere.

109
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:54.070
What we wanna do is we wanna emit from the
child to the parent, what the value is.

110
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.960
Now why would we use a store for
this or something.

111
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.800
Well, typically when we're dealing with
the application state of the whole thing,

112
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.810
we wanna put that in the store
because we wanna think like, okay,

113
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.670
what do all the components
need to know about, right?

114
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.120
Everybody needs to know
about the food data.

115
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.720
Everybody needs to know about a cart or
something.

116
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.190
But in this case because we wanna keep
this component really succinct and

117
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.225
reusable for multiple places,

118
00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:26.260
we probably just want to be emitting
from the child and allow the parent

119
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.840
to gather that information in the parent
is the thing that is really smart here.

120
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.540
The parent is the thing
that holds the information.

121
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:40.850
So if we go back over to our Select,
I'm going to use my snippet for

122
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.830
child components, so v-emits child.

123
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.730
And this is actually fairly typical, well,
this is the way that we need it actually.

124
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.580
Because that's a fairly typical
emit that when something changes,

125
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.280
we want to emit the event.target.value.

126
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.460
In our case,
the event.target.value would be here.

127
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.990
So we can save this.

128
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.541
So we've got this event.target.value,

129
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.864
the name name is also Select.

130
00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:19.200
And now on the parent,

131
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.155
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go back over to restaurants.Vue.

132
00:09:25.345 --> 00:09:30.340
And we're going to say, we're gonna first,
we're gonna make sure that we're

133
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.610
actually like collecting that
information somewhere, right?

134
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.430
We need a place to put it.

135
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.362
So we're gonna say Data, return,

136
00:09:42.212 --> 00:09:45.170
Selected restaurant,
maybe that's a good one.

137
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:51.820
Yeah selected, rest and empty string.

138
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.880
And then on that AppSelect,
we're gonna bit do v-emit parent.

139
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.890
And food is obviously not what we need.

140
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.700
We need that selected restaurant.

141
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.315
And then just to make sure it's working,

142
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:09.023
I'm gonna do that pre
tag that I showed you.

143
00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:12.218
I think I used it in the last course but
I haven't used it here.

144
00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:15.740
So let's use a pre tag for
a little debugging.

145
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.920
I'm gonna output data
in mustache templates.

146
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.580
So save that.

147
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.620
And what this is gonna do is it's
gonna allow me to see immediately

148
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.050
if something is I want, I could look
at the kind of dev tool things.

149
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:40.150
But in this case I can just see, selected
restaurant is nothing and now it's pizza.

150
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.824
And now it's dim sum, excellent.
