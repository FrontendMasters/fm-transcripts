WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.643
The next thing that we're gonna
do is we're going to deploy and

2
00:00:03.643 --> 00:00:05.591
set up some environment variables.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.594
So we're gonna deploy.

4
00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:15.240
What we're gonna use for nuxt generate,
what we're is called nuxt generate.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.833
And as I mentioned before, this is new,
it newly sets up dynamic routing for you.

6
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.470
In order to deploy it,
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to,

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.460
am I in the right place,
I need to make a new tab.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.710
And I'm in next food app.

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.688
I'm gonna use that tool I mentioned in the
beginning of the class that's called hub

10
00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:38.660
to create GitHub repos on my command line.

11
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.447
So I can say hub,
create if I wanted it to be public,

12
00:00:42.447 --> 00:00:47.490
I could say just hub create and
it will use the name of the directory.

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.328
But in this case I'm
gonna make it private.

14
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:50.633
I'm gonna say dash p.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.330
And it will do its magic,
it's updating origin.

16
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.231
If you're not using nuxt, you would
have had to run git init first, but

17
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:06.855
nuxt will assume that eventually you
want to create a git repository.

18
00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:10.218
So will already install that,
it will already do that for you,

19
00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.150
which is pretty cool.

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.521
So I'm gonna do my normal
git add a git commit,

21
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:25.684
dash m, initial, commit.

22
00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:31.649
And then git push, dash u, origin master.

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.777
So now it's compressing,
getting everything done.

24
00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:41.526
It's gonna push it up, Awesome.

25
00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.070
So now I can go to gives
me a little link here.

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.272
Now I can go to nuxt food app and
I've got a private repo.

27
00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:55.501
Yay, and now I'm gonna log into Netlify,
I login here.

28
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.995
And I'm gonna say new site from Git,
GitHub.

29
00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:10.460
I'm gonna make a relationship
you could do Git lab as well.

30
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.354
Authorised Okay,

31
00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:20.185
usually this closes but
let's try it again.

32
00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:23.941
Cool.

33
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.453
And I think I called it nuxt food app.

34
00:02:27.453 --> 00:02:29.436
What did I, is that what I called it?

35
00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:32.320
What do I call it?

36
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.115
Nuxt food app.

37
00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:33.649
Okay.

38
00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:42.260
And it's thinking, there it is.

39
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.094
I grab that.

40
00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:47.644
We're gonna go from the master branch,
And again,

41
00:02:47.644 --> 00:02:52.566
if you're ever confused as to what your
build command is you can go over to

42
00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:56.060
your README file or
your README at the base.

43
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.111
And it says,
install dependencies yarn dough and

44
00:03:00.111 --> 00:03:03.301
then serve with hot reload at yarn Dev.

45
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:06.900
And then we've got these yarn build
yarn start and yarn generate is for

46
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.310
a static project,
that's what we're gonna do.

47
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.963
So I go over, back over to here,
my build command is yarn generate.

48
00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:20.740
My public directory is dist, and
we're gonna deploy the site.

49
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.825
Now this first deploy,
don't worry about it.

50
00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:25.765
We're not going to,
it's going to be okay, but

51
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:28.720
it doesn't have
the environment variable yet.

52
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.131
Remember, we didn't,
we're not pushing up that dotenv.

53
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:37.273
So what we need to do is we need to go
into the settings and we need to go to

54
00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:43.075
build and deploy and then we go down to
where the environment variables live.

55
00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:48.794
And I need to go back
over to my env file and

56
00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:55.197
grab that key, and
I need to name it the same.

57
00:03:55.197 --> 00:03:58.838
I need to name it, AWS API key.

58
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.535
So edit variables.

59
00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.475
I'm going to paste this in here.

60
00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:12.708
I'm using a Chrome extension
I built called phi masker.

61
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:18.416
It just masks in case I'm working with
sensitive information in front of people.

62
00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:23.006
AWS, API, key,

63
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:26.690
save, okay.

64
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.707
Now I'm gonna go over here and
this is gonna fail at first, don't worry.

65
00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:36.739
What we're gonna do is we're
going to go to the deploys,

66
00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:40.520
and I'm going to say retry deploy.

67
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.083
So it's gonna start up, and

68
00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.947
we'll come back to this in
a second to see how it did.

69
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.909
Cool.

70
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.452
All right, let's look at what's next.

71
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.730
And we can also change the name
inside of Netlify as well.

72
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.904
So actually maybe we
should change the name.

73
00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.004
Let's do that.

74
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:13.323
We go over to Site Settings and it gives
you this wonderful Carson something or

75
00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:17.390
other and I'm just gonna call it food app.

76
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:24.955
Nuxt food app, frontend masters because
I already did nuxt food app before.

77
00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:30.671
So we're gonna save that and
we're working on the building, cool.
