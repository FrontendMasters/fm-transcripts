WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.210
We also wanna send that to the store,
right?

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.480
We wanna make sure that
the store knows that globally,

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.630
we've selected mechanic as our character.

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.190
So let's go back, we're gonna say,

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.115
in the app.view, we're gonna add a button.

6
00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:21.515
And it's not gonna be as part of
that v4 link loop that we have here,

7
00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:23.175
because we're just making one button.

8
00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.945
So we wanna say button@click,

9
00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:31.420
and we'll call this pick character.

10
00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:43.880
And then we'll say pick your character,
cool.

11
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.877
We don't have a method called
pick character yet, so

12
00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:48.640
we should make one of those.

13
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.066
So we go back down below and
I'm gonna say methods, pick character.

14
00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:02.305
And at first, I'm just gonna console
log what we've got going on here, so

15
00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:04.690
I'm gonna say, console.log.

16
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.506
This .character input.

17
00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:08.293
Remember, we have to say,

18
00:01:08.293 --> 00:01:12.666
this dot when we're accessing
something from methods from data.

19
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:17.112
So anytime we're gonna use even
like the computed properties or

20
00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:21.990
anything we're bringing to the store,
we're saying this dot here.

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.550
So if we go back and refresh, we've
got mechanic again, I'm going to say,

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.412
pick your character, and if we go
into the app, you can see that, that

23
00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:37.080
character is mechanic and in our console,
we're now logging mechanic, excellent.

24
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.380
So what we wanna do is,
we wanna send that stuff to the store.

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.030
We actually wanna do two
things in the store.

26
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.456
I did this twice, so that's four,
but two things in the store.

27
00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.117
What we wanna do in the store is,

28
00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:52.450
we wanna be able to update
the character as we mentioned before.

29
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.110
But we also wanna update the UI
state because as soon as they

30
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.392
select their character,
it's no longer the start of the game.

31
00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:03.910
We wanna put them into the ability to
pick the questions and things like that.

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.286
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna go into the store, and

33
00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:10.470
we're gonna make some mutations.

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.430
Mutations, again, remember,
are synchronous and

35
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.410
they're the only way to
update the state currently.

36
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.184
So right now, what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna make a mutation, and

37
00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.890
that's gonna be called pick character.

38
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.780
In there, I'm gonna pass in the state and
the character, and

39
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.160
I'm going to say, state.character equals
the character that we've chosen, right?

40
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.208
So we're gonna go state.character
equals character.

41
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:46.630
Cool, that's one mutation.

42
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.648
The other one is going to
be updating the UI state.

43
00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:54.310
So we're gonna say, update UI state,

44
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.840
we again, pass in the states and
the UI state.

45
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.118
And I'm going to say state.ui
state equals UI state.

46
00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.841
So from here, what we wanna do is,
we wanna call those mutations and

47
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.630
that's called committing.

48
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.420
So we wanna commit these
two mutations inside

49
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.100
of the method from this piece of the app.

50
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.855
So what we wanna do is, we wanna say,

51
00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:29.744
this .dollar signs store .commit.

52
00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.530
And we say, what did I call it?

53
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.170
Pick character I think, pick character.

54
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.270
And we're gonna pass

55
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.560
in this .character input,
thank you vs code.

56
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.920
So we're passing in whatever
they selected there.

57
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.857
We also are now gonna send a new UI state
to the store, this .store, .commit.

58
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.170
And we're gonna say update UI state.

59
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.180
And we're not gonna pass in something
that's from the template or

60
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.670
something that we're storing,
we're actually gonna pass in a string.

61
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.990
And we're gonna call it character chosen.

62
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.220
So now the UI state will know
it's gonna be in view x, but

63
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.210
this will know that that's
the UI state that we're in.

64
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.670
And any other component that we had for
this whole game would also be able to kind

65
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.720
of grab that and say, okay, that's the UI
state that we're dealing with right now.

66
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.098
So if we go back here, and

67
00:04:34.098 --> 00:04:38.570
we have our button now,
we can pick our character.

68
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.970
If I pick mechanic and I pick my
character, I can go back into View, I can

69
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.390
see that the character input is mechanic,
but the character is mechanic too.

70
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.840
And you can check that in the store,
we have

71
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.270
our character chosen is our UI state,
and the character is mechanic.

72
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.425
Here's where things get really fun,
we can now add in the component

73
00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:08.950
of the character based
on which one we chose.

74
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.210
So we can go in here, and
we can say all right, the character name.

75
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:22.210
Instead of saying character name,
let's now say character, awesome.

76
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.591
And then we also wanna add in some folks,
so

77
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:33.299
let's add in a friend,
let's add in our score but bubble thing.

78
00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:41.096
And we're gonna say component is
character because that component,

79
00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:47.306
we're really grabbing whichever
name came through for

80
00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:52.737
us, the artists,
the baker the mechanic here.

81
00:05:52.737 --> 00:05:57.100
But we didn't import those components yet,
they're still chillin over here, and

82
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.030
this ything does not
know anything about that.

83
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.530
So what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna say, V import artist.

84
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.782
From the components, and
then I'm also going to say,

85
00:06:11.782 --> 00:06:17.050
artists here, and
we have to import a few of these.

86
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.590
Usually, you don't import so many at once,
but we're gonna import a bunch of people,

87
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.450
and make sure that they're
all available to us.

88
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.480
So we have, I think six of them, and
then we've got six of these components.

89
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.940
And I can use the Option key to
select multiple at the same time.

90
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.050
So I can say you're a baker, and I'm kinda
going by what's in the sidebar here.

91
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.360
Your friend, Oops, not a friend.

92
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.101
Then we go and grab this one, and

93
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:05.972
we say mechanic, and
then we've got our score.

94
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:13.170
And we've got our zombie.

95
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.180
We're not gonna use the zombie quite yet,
but I'm loading it for

96
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.150
you because you are going
to be using it at the end.

97
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.930
And I accidentally brought
in artists choice, cool.

98
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.671
&gt;&gt; Baker got deleted from the components.

99
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:32.626
&gt;&gt; It did?

100
00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:40.170
Thank you so much, I would have blown up,
appreciate it, cool.

101
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.985
So now,
what we should see are our mechanic,

102
00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:48.040
and our little doodle here.

103
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.380
So this is our friend,
and this is our mechanic.

104
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.802
And if I go to the start again and
I select Baker instead, there's our Baker.

105
00:07:55.802 --> 00:08:00.121
And if I go to the beginning again, and
I select artist, there's our artist,

106
00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:00.914
pretty cool.

107
00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:04.823
So now, we're loading in different
characters conditionally,

108
00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:08.675
hence they're all of these
different components, excellent.

109
00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:12.178
The next thing that we wanna do is,
we wanna be able, we brought in

110
00:08:12.178 --> 00:08:16.351
the questions, but what we wanna say is,
we wanna give her a question index.

111
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:20.741
Because what we wanna do is, we wanna say,
all right, you're answering questions,

112
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:24.470
and every time you answer one,
the question index is gonna move forward,

113
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.714
it's gonna go to the next one and
the next one
