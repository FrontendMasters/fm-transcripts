1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.363
So the next thing that we wanna do is
we wanna create a nice masthead for

2
00:00:04.363 --> 00:00:08.970
that index page, we wanna say have
that beautiful header image come in.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.181
And so, we're going to go back and
we're gonna create a hero,

4
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:18.107
I actually made this hero generator
because, I think I've made hundreds

5
00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:23.126
of heroes before and every single time
I'd be, wait, what did I do again?

6
00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.351
And so I made this hero generator so

7
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:30.110
that you can kind of play with some
defaults and some button radiuses, and

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.049
you can play with the Gradient Overlay and
things like that.

9
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.210
And so we have some code output
here that I have ready for

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.150
you when you play with that code.

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.184
So, it's forkable and stuff on GitHub,
so if we go back to our application,

12
00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:50.840
and we create a thing
called app header.view, and

13
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.407
I'm gonna put this in
the components directory.

14
00:00:55.407 --> 00:01:00.009
And I'm gonna say, the vbase,
I'm gonna paste the code that was copy

15
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.539
pastable below because it
has some HTML and some CSS.

16
00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.650
I'm gonna grab the HTML, and
I'm going to place it here,

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.258
so we have a masthead, and
then I'm gonna grab all of this CSS,

18
00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:20.514
and I'm going to place it inside my CSS.

19
00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:25.612
Let me get rid of this stuff,
note that because we're in side one of

20
00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:31.910
the components inside the application,
we now are using scoped that scoped tag.

21
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.806
Cool, there's a couple things I wanna do
here, I already made a button style that's

22
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:40.821
for the entire application, so
I don't need the button styles here.

23
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:42.686
The next thing that I wanna do is,

24
00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:46.897
I want to make sure that this URL is
pointing to an actual image that we have.

25
00:01:46.897 --> 00:01:50.621
So to point to our assets file,

26
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:55.921
I'm going to do that ~
like you saw before,

27
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.664
assets, and then header image.jpg.

28
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:05.356
And now I'm gonna bring that
header on to the index page

29
00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:10.354
because right now it's not
actually anywhere, right and

30
00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:14.240
we're gonna say vimport export appheader,

31
00:02:16.772 --> 00:02:21.097
And then I have the Appheader.

32
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:29.013
And now let's take a look at what we've
got, I might have to restart the server.

33
00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:33.631
Go back to the homepage, and
there we go, we've got this big, bright,

34
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.961
beautiful image, that's an alliteration,
and we've got this hero generator.

35
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.154
So, you can already start to see how we
might need to change this a little bit.

36
00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:46.580
First of all, this white text,
even with the shadow right over this,

37
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.169
it's not that legible.

38
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.703
So let's put it in the corner where
there's a lot of dark news happening.

39
00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:56.214
Also, I wanna have a lot more
information below the fold here but,

40
00:02:56.214 --> 00:03:00.162
if I have the hero covering
this entire space, it's not so

41
00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:03.079
clear to people that they can scroll down.

42
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.650
So I'm gonna make it not
cover the full height.

43
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.100
The other thing is this is enormous font,
so

44
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.960
maybe we should make the font
a little bit smaller.

45
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.968
So we're gonna come back into
the Appheader, and we're gonna remove all

46
00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:22.162
of the things that make it centered,
which are all of these flexbox things.

47
00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:26.418
And I even commented if you don't want it
to take up the full screen reduce this

48
00:03:26.418 --> 00:03:28.726
number, so I'm gonna reduce it to 80.

49
00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:35.917
And then in the h1 I mentioned
it was really, really big,

50
00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:40.009
let's change this to
8vmin instead of 11 vmin.

51
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.600
And I'm also gonna give it a little bit of
padding because right now it's going to

52
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.300
just jet up against the page.

53
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.058
So let's go back and look at it, and
that's a little bit better, right?

54
00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:53.518
Although it still says the hero generator
and when a hero comes along, so

55
00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:55.740
we probably wanna change
some of that markup.

56
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.627
So we're gonna say Next Food App, and

57
00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:07.513
then beneath it,
we're gonna say See Restaurants.

58
00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:16.052
Cool, And we go back,

59
00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:21.280
and now we've got Nuxt Food App and
See restaurants, doing pretty good so far.
