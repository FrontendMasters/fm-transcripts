WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.879
So we also have a resources folder for
this exercise as well, we have some static

2
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.193
images of food, we have a header image
that's gonna be our cover image.

3
00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:15.762
We have the main.scss,
that's the base css like we had before,

4
00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:20.845
we have our an empty cart icon that
you're gonna use during an exercise.

5
00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:26.564
We have a foodlogo, so we have a logo for
application and it's an svg file.

6
00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:31.373
And we have a thing called env,
it's not called dotenv it will be

7
00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:36.093
called dotenv in our application,
but it's not right now, so

8
00:00:36.093 --> 00:00:40.922
that it doesn't get ignored in GitHub so
that you can access it.

9
00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:46.161
Here is the font that we're gonna
be working with, so after this,

10
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:50.384
what we said was we were
gonna work through this list.

11
00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.632
The first thing that we're gonna do is
we're gonna set up our nuxt config.

12
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.839
And in that nuxt config,
we're going to first set up our fonts and

13
00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.301
some of the assets that we're using.

14
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.933
So I'm gonna grab this font.

15
00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:13.280
And inside of our nuxt config again I'm
gonna use a snippet, so I'm gonna use and

16
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.437
font and that will give me a default for
how we set up fonts in next.

17
00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:24.249
So, link rel, stylesheet and then it has
I'm pasting in what we're gonna use,

18
00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:29.734
we're gonna use Mulish at font weight
300 and Poppins at weight 600.

19
00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:32.046
Then in order to use that in our files,

20
00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:36.401
I'm gonna adjust change some of
the defaults that are in default view.

21
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:40.121
I'm gonna say Mulisch and

22
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:45.194
I'm gonna say font weight 300,

23
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:49.431
and then I'm gonna go below.

24
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:52.381
I'm gonna take out all
these button styles because

25
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.612
we already have a global button
style that will load in.

26
00:01:55.612 --> 00:02:00.429
And I'm gonna also add in h1,
h2 h3, h4 and

27
00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.073
those will all have the font weight
of Poppins that we just added.

28
00:02:07.073 --> 00:02:09.040
So we're gonna say Poppins.

29
00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:17.559
And we have 600 here,
was what we were using and

30
00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.762
then inside pages, index.vuw.

31
00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:23.917
I'm gonna dump this out for
the time being.

32
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:28.193
And say main class container and

33
00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:33.103
I'm gonna remove these styles
because we're not gonna need them.

34
00:02:33.103 --> 00:02:39.905
In order to use the styles that we do
need, I'm gonna bring in our main dot css.

35
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:44.021
But not before I just put in
a little like Hi from home page so

36
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:48.400
that we know that we're on
the homepage when we visited next.

37
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.294
So I'm gonna go over to my
food app resources, and

38
00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:58.432
I'm gonna grab my main.css, and
I'm gonna load it into the assets section.

39
00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:01.372
That's where I'm going to use it from,
while I'm at it,

40
00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:04.852
I'm also gonna grab the header image and
add it to the asset section.

41
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:10.192
Now, in order for that to be registered
properly, we go back into the next config.

42
00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:16.803
So we're go into the next config,
we say assets main.scss,

43
00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:23.682
so whatever we've got the tilda
to say go to the base directory.

44
00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:27.942
Then we say assets/main.scss,
however, it's named,

45
00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:30.847
then the next thing that we need to do is.

46
00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:34.175
I'm gonna bring these photo images over,

47
00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:38.532
and I'm gonna put them in
the static folder right here.

48
00:03:38.532 --> 00:03:41.322
It's really nice VS code
allows you to drag and drop,

49
00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:44.671
now they didn't used to do that,
that was that's really cool.

50
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:51.493
So that's available to us, and
I'm also going to bring over my food data.

51
00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:56.395
I'm gonna bring it statically at first and
then we're gonna bring it in from an API.

52
00:03:56.395 --> 00:04:00.385
Now, I mentioned that we don't actually
have to change the next config

53
00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:02.192
in order to register the store.

54
00:04:02.192 --> 00:04:06.159
Just like we registered the, in next
config we're registering a lot of other

55
00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.261
things like plugins and assets, but
we don't have to do that inside the store.

56
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:13.570
I'm gonna make an index.js file, and

57
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.592
I'm gonna go into the store and
save this file.

58
00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:21.794
And remember from the other course you
might remember that I said in my snippets.

59
00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.573
There are two different
types of stores like store

60
00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:27.362
boiler plates that things
are accustomed to use.

61
00:04:27.362 --> 00:04:33.333
Eli is gonna be accustomed to the V
store which is kind of classic view x.

62
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:37.446
Whereas next will assume this
other type of format, and

63
00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:39.994
that's v store two in my snippet.

64
00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:44.499
So this boilerplate that
it spits out is the kind of

65
00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:48.052
default store that next is expecting.

66
00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:50.124
I'm going to comment these out for

67
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:53.062
now because we're not
gonna use them quite yet.

68
00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:57.905
And I'm gonna put my food
data inside that state, so

69
00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:02.871
now I have access to this
food data in my application.

70
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:07.603
One thing you will note that vuw Seelye,
we just needed to refresh the page.

71
00:05:07.603 --> 00:05:10.445
Sometimes when we,
kind of create something and

72
00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:14.690
nuxt config has figure things out like
it has to sniff out something new.

73
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.572
What we'll have to do is,
turn the server on and off again,

74
00:05:18.572 --> 00:05:21.922
because it's going to need to understand,
okay?

75
00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:25.211
Wait, I gotta find that file and
register it, I need to,

76
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:28.242
it's compiling everything
on the server instead.

77
00:05:28.242 --> 00:05:33.063
So, now we have restarted
the server all of those nuxt

78
00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:36.934
config options have now been registered.

79
00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:42.291
And you can see that we have this
new font, we say Hi from homepage.

80
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:49.344
And if we look in view, we should be able
to see all of that food data coming in.
