1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.980
Alright, so let's create an SVG icon
with like sort of conditional layout.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.430
And what I mean by that is, we're not
actually going to use V else here would,

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.530
but we totally can.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.280
We saw that in the game
part of the course too.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.470
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
use a regular media query just in

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.410
CSS to hide and
show some things in our logo.

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.440
So I'm gonna go back
to the game resources.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.420
Let's go to the terminal and
I think one of these is game resources.

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.980
Game resources code, in our game
resources, we have a food logo.

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.800
And this is an SVG that I've optimized.

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.620
And I also have those well named IDs and

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.450
circles and things like that, again,
SVG OMG is a great place to do that.

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.595
I also have an SVG course if you're
interested in learning more.

14
00:00:53.595 --> 00:01:00.430
So if we go back to our app, and in here,

15
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.610
what we wanna do is we wanna create
a thing called app logo.view.

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.050
And we put it in our components.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.040
And we're gonna say the base,
I can actually drop the div.

18
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.360
Because I have, I'm returning this SVG,
which is also an HTML element.

19
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.820
I don't need these.

20
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.040
But what I do need I have a view box on
here and it will scale in any direction,

21
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.070
which is awesome.

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.614
But really for our purposes for this logo,

23
00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:34.346
we really just wanna say width is 40 and
height is 40.

24
00:01:38.493 --> 00:01:43.592
And remember, in the last part of
the course I said like def says like

25
00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:49.690
the staging area for SVG, I would actually
rather use my scoped styles for this.

26
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.580
So I'm gonna pull these out of def's,
I can put them inside of my scoped styles.

27
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.524
The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna make it semantic and good for

28
00:02:00.524 --> 00:02:01.551
screen readers.

29
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:06.853
So I'm gonna say area labeled by, and

30
00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:12.330
I'm gonna say whatever ID name I want.

31
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.070
So, I'm gonna call this logo and
it has to be unique.

32
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.650
And beneath it, and
it has to be the first thing beneath here.

33
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.640
I'm gonna say title id is logo and
the title.

34
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.509
And inside here I'll say logo showing

35
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:37.493
plate and fork and knife.

36
00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:44.780
Cool, the last thing I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna also say role is presentation.

37
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.170
Because you can actually have the screen
reader read out all of these little bits,

38
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.760
but the screen reader,
it's not helpful to blind people for

39
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.950
the screen reader to read
out all of these bits.

40
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.280
So by saying role image or role
presentation, what I'm doing here is I'm

41
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.620
saying, why don't you skip all of that and
just focus on the title?

42
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.790
Cool, so, in this, what it's gonna give
me is a black logo at first because SVG

43
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
is when they don't have a fill associated
with them will default to black.

44
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.780
And we also have a stroke of black here.

45
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.420
So I want to make sure that I'm passing in
a white one cuz we have a dark background.

46
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.500
I'm also gonna say so for
the whole SVG to fill of white.

47
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.260
Let's go back to our app.

48
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.870
We didn't add it to the app yet.

49
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.550
So we need to add it to the app.

50
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.500
We have our app logo.

51
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.700
And instead of saying home,
we wanna add that app logo.

52
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.540
So I'm gonna say V Import Export app logo.

53
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.070
We go in here, we say app logo.

54
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.280
Cool, and now we should be able to
see it if we refresh the page, cool.

55
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.820
We have our empty cart, but you can see
this nice little logo in the corner here,

56
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.020
and it makes our nav
a little bit bigger too.

57
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
So what I wanna do is I wanna just show
the plates in the fork into the knife, and

58
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.790
all that detail on desktop.

59
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.060
But when it's on mobile, I wanted actually
all the plate pieces to be gone and

60
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.490
those are expressed with little circles.

61
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:26.542
So if we go back to the app logo,
These circles are what I want to remove.

62
00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:30.511
So what I can do is I can say,

63
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:36.400
at media screen and max width 600 px.

64
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:46.160
And we're gonna say circles, Display none.

65
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.600
And the reason I'm showing this
to you is because I think that

66
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.115
SVG is really flexible.

67
00:04:51.115 --> 00:04:53.460
And building apps this
way is really flexible.

68
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.250
I could have also made a data property,
where I use the window width, and

69
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.580
then I use Vf to check things and stuff.

70
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.800
But I can also use a media query and
say like, hey, if it's 600.

71
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.100
Maybe I made the max
width at media screen and

72
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.080
max width is 600 px circles, display none.

73
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.050
I might have the resolution up
too high to be able to see this.

74
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.825
But when you are working with
a smaller screen, let's see if I can.

75
00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:34.920
No, I would need a different resolution
for my screen for you to be, there you go.

76
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.420
Once I make it a 100%, you can see
that the circles are actually removed.

77
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.840
So if I go bigger or
i go smaller then you can see tada.

78
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.783
We have a slightly different
logo with less detail on mobile,

79
00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:57.029
and then on desktop we can show that,
cool.
