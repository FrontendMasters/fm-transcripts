WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.440
We want to start making that grid

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.382
of information of all of
the food right below it, right?

3
00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:09.090
We wanna have access to all of that stuff.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.510
And right now it's just
in that view store.

5
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.570
Remember when we looked at the oops.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.993
When we looked at the dev tools before,

7
00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:26.601
we had, There's food data.

8
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.924
Inside the food data, we have an array.

9
00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:33.750
So the array has three
things inside of it.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.880
It's got an object with delivery time,
free delivery.

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.660
So the first level of this is
just stuff about the restaurant.

12
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.760
Taco about eating tacos and
we have an ID for that restaurant.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.857
But inside of that, we have a menu and in
that menu we have a few different things.

14
00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:55.234
We have tortilla, we have a taco,
of course we have taco.

15
00:00:55.234 --> 00:01:01.720
We have quesadilla and we have burrito and
each one of these have their own ID too.

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.552
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
loop through all of that information.

17
00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:10.890
And first we're gonna make sure we're
going through all of the restaurants.

18
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.680
And then we're gonna make sure we're going
through all of the menu items as well.

19
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.385
So let's go back to our app.

20
00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:24.382
I'm gonna make a new
component that I'm gonna call

21
00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:30.720
AppRestaurantInfo.view and
put that in components.

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.830
I say vBase.

23
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.431
You might have guessed what
our first step is here.

24
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:39.053
Let's go back to our to do list.

25
00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:42.730
We've now created our masthead and
our index page.

26
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.253
So now we're gonna create
a grid from the store data.

27
00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:54.360
So okay, so
we create an app.restaurantinfo.viewpage.

28
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.082
You might have guessed
the first step here.

29
00:01:56.082 --> 00:02:01.897
The first step here is to use map state,
so go grab food data.

30
00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.618
So that we have access to all of
the food data that we're using, right.

31
00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:12.754
And I'm gonna put this in a section
instead of a div, and I'm gonna

32
00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:19.209
give it a class of restaurant info because
I'm gonna use that to kind of style it up.

33
00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.751
And again I've made a lot of
these styles for us today.

34
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.114
I've made a lot of these styles for
us today but

35
00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:29.195
you could see how you might plug in
to classes and things like that.

36
00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:33.655
So the first thing that we're gonna do
is make a div that we can v-for through.

37
00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:38.830
So we're gonna say div v-for,
we're gonna say store in food data.

38
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.668
And then the next thing we do is the key
and remember that each store had an ID.

39
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:49.600
So we're gonna use that
unique ID to be our key and

40
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.330
unique IDs are the best
thing that you can use for

41
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.810
keys because we're really trying
to make sure that they're unique.

42
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.280
So the next thing that we wanna do is we
want to put output the name of the store.

43
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.780
So we've got store.name here.

44
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.383
Then we've got store.deliveryTime.

45
00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:14.208
Oops.

46
00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.740
And I probably need to tell
them that that's fine.

47
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.623
It is right deliveryTime here.

48
00:03:21.623 --> 00:03:25.865
Make that look more
human than JavaScripty.

49
00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:31.247
We've got another one that
is gonna be the ratings.

50
00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:35.473
So store.rating.

51
00:03:35.473 --> 00:03:36.900
So we've got reading.

52
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.360
And then the next thing that we have is
a free delivery we got like a little label

53
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.410
if it has a free delivery it has
this like free delivery label.

54
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.874
So instead of outputting that what we're
gonna do is we're gonna use a PVF.

55
00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:55.707
So we're gonna say p v-if

56
00:03:55.707 --> 00:04:00.542
Store.freeDelivery and

57
00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:04.502
then class is label.

58
00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:09.580
Inside there we're gonna put
a spam tag and say, free delivery.

59
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.500
All right, we just did some stuff so
let's go check out where we're at.

60
00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:19.612
We didn't put it on the page,
I feel like that's gonna be a theme today.

61
00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:22.800
Let's go add this to the index j.s.

62
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.660
So I'm gonna say vimport export,

63
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.850
app Restaurant info.

64
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.808
And then we can remove this and
we see app@restaurant info,

65
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.998
we're gonna add this beneath the header,
app.

66
00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:43.675
Restaurant info.

67
00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:47.130
Now let's go back.

68
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.020
Cool.

69
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.770
What we have outputted now
is stuff from the store.

70
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.720
We're saying talk about eating tacos, or
real pizza work and all that in dimsum.

71
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.858
And we have information that's
particular to this restaurant.

72
00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:06.360
Now we're gonna make a new div and
kind of loop through all of the items so

73
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.720
that we can output those in a row as well.

74
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.020
So we'll go back to our VS code and
we'll go back to restaurant info.

75
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.170
And what we're gonna say now, I'm gonna
make a little bit of a break here.

76
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.090
And I'm gonna say div class row,

77
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.710
which is what we need for it to layout and

78
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.610
align that with some
CSS I wrote before and

79
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.901
then we're gonna say,
div v-for menuitem in store.menu.

80
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:46.746
Because I wanna be explicit that that's
now what I'm looping through right is

81
00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.090
the menu item before I
was looping in the store.

82
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.350
So that's why I didn't use item in
store because I wanna be really

83
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.660
explicit to the person coming after me.

84
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.120
That that's what I'm doing.

85
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.468
So I say key menuItem.id.

86
00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:03.883
Remember we had unique IDs for
each one of these.

87
00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:07.045
I'm gonna put these on the next row.

88
00:06:07.045 --> 00:06:07.970
Stop cancel.

89
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.200
And then this here,

90
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.380
I also want a class of items.

91
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.490
And then we also want to add
a bounce style of a background.

92
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.374
So I'm gonna write it
without the template literal

93
00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:32.800
first cuz that's just how my brain works.

94
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.360
But you don't have to write it that way.

95
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.822
So, background URL and

96
00:06:37.822 --> 00:06:43.706
then it will be like menu Item.image and

97
00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:50.650
then it will be like
no-repeat center center.

98
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.546
Now I'm gonna put it in back clicks, and

99
00:06:54.546 --> 00:07:00.515
I'm going to make this passed
through the template literal.

100
00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:02.460
I think that should be right.

101
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.183
Let's go look.

102
00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:05.190
Yay.

103
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.960
Okay, now we've got images on here.

104
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.860
And then the next thing that we wanna
do is we wanna make a little card

105
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.410
beneath it with all of
the other information here.

106
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.940
So the next thing that we wanna do is we
wanna go into this div cuz we're looping

107
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.540
through inside of this div, and we're
gonna say div.Iteminfo, that's the card.

108
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.760
And then we're gonna put inside one div,

109
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.900
this piece that has information
about the thing on one side.

110
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.678
So we're gonna say menuItem.item, and

111
00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:44.520
then we've got the price
which will be a P.

112
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.151
So we'll do menuItem.price,

113
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:56.810
tand then we're also gonna have
a button next to it and this item info

114
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:02.870
knows that this is going to be display
flex with things pushed to either side.

115
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.720
I'm going to say button class ghost.

116
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.880
And we're gonna say view item.

117
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.310
We're not gonna link those quite yet.

118
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.820
We will in the next section.

119
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.010
So let's check it out.

120
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.150
Did it work?

121
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.760
Yay.

122
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.290
We've got tacos, we've got quesadilla,
we've got burritos, we've got pizzas.

123
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.813
We've got dim sum I'm getting hungry.

124
00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:30.060
[LAUGH] You might notice something
that needs a little fixing.

125
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.591
It is this piece, right?

126
00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:34.912
We've got a taco for 3.45.

127
00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:37.257
And that looks okay, but
there's no dollar sign and

128
00:08:37.257 --> 00:08:39.810
the quesadilla is just like seven.

129
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.181
I'm just seven.

130
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:48.742
So we probably want to put like the same
kind of toFixed2-ing on each one of these.

131
00:08:48.742 --> 00:08:52.647
Like I mentioned in the last course, I'm
not actually gonna use a computed property

132
00:08:52.647 --> 00:08:54.685
for this,
because I want it to be flexible.

133
00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:59.331
I wanna be able to pipe in
menuItem.price to each one of them.

134
00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:03.038
So I'm gonna say methods,

135
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.818
Price formatting and

136
00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:13.030
I'm gonna pass in item.

137
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:20.580
I'm gonna return a $ plus item.toFixed2.

138
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:28.580
And what that will do is make sure that
there's two number spaces after a decimal.

139
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.870
And I'm gonna make sure
that this is called here.

140
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:38.480
So price formatting,
pass in menuItem.Price.

141
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:46.310
So if we go back now we can see our
beautiful $7 is not just like seven won't.

142
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:51.290
We have these nicely formatted dollar
signs in all of our view items.
