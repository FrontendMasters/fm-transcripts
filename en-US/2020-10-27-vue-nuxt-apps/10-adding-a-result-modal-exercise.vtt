00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.470
The last thing we wanna do is let
the user know about a final result.

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.622
So I'm gonna go into VS code and

3
00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:13.732
I'm gonna give you in
the components gamestate.

4
00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:19.710
Go back into source components.

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
In here,
we're gonna say gamestatefinish.vu.

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.690
I'm gonna save this.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.560
I'm gonna say V base.

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.650
And this div is gonna have a class of
modal we saw that we use that class of

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.060
modal for the first one.

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.800
We're gonna use it for the second one.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.340
This is gonna be your exercise.

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.720
You already know if it won or lost.

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.220
Right now, in that app dot view,

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.060
if I collapse these we have VF UI
state is start in a V else.

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.160
But we have one more condition, don't we?

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.310
We have if the UI state is start
if the character is chosen, and

17
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.044
if the UI state has finished.

18
00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:02.666
.And we have another UI
state that's inside of here.

19
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:09.780
We wanna show them slightly different
things based on whether they won or lost.

20
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.640
In our game sources repo, If we go look
at that, let's go in the game resources.

21
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.370
You have a, if we go look into the game
resources, that is the food app resources.

22
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.670
That is not the game resources.

23
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.218
If we go into the game resources,
you have a little goofy

24
00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:35.150
face dot SVG, and it looks like this.

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.950
It is a little ridiculous.

26
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.050
What you wanna do is you wanna show it.

27
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.510
If you're winning,
then it's showing a smile and

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.770
if you lost it rotates the whole thing and
shows the smile upside down.

29
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.010
Or alternately, if you want to
practice working with SVG DME,

30
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.920
you could turn the just the smile and
the frown upside down.

31
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.480
But you wanna report to them
if they won or lost and

32
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.940
you want them to be able
to restart the game.

33
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.200
So you want them to be able to
set that UI state back to start.

34
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580
So if we have the alien
zombie netlify app and

35
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.490
you want to see what that end state
could look like, I'm gonna go to baker.

36
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.470
I'm gonna pick a bunch of random stuff.

37
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.340
You can't be serial.

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.770
What's the most imaginative insult I like
you eat buttons off the remote Lagoon,

39
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.540
which I'm still proud of,
and it says I won.

40
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.680
So this is what the modal
should look like you won.

41
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.890
Let's play again.

42
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.220
And when I select this button,
it starts me from the beginning

43
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.150
with a score of zero again, so
I'm able to start that over again.

44
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.650
Okay.

45
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.210
So, exercise in the repo,
go to game problem.

46
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.375
So you want to reset the game at the end.

47
00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:51.490
I gave you the final result modal.

48
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.290
Let people know if they won or
if they lost, put in the face.

49
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.140
Make it do things if you won or lost.

50
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.480
Put in a restart button and
put the conditional logic into the app

51
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.760
that shows the right
thing at the right time.

52
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.380
I know that sounds like a lot, but
really, you're adding a directive or two.

53
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.220
It's not it's not going to be too bad.

54
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.790
I promise.
