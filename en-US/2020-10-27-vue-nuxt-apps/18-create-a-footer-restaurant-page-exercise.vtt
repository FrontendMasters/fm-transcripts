00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.674
Alright, we have our first exercise.

2
00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:07.060
In this exercise first what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna delete this about page.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.750
We're not actually going
to use this about page.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.510
I'm going to delete this about page,
move to trash.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.640
I'm gonna go to the menu and I'm gonna
remove this about page link here.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.300
What I want you to do is I want you
to add a new page called restaurants.

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.860
In that restaurants page,
I want you to add that app restaurant

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.520
info grid and maybe put like an h1 that
says restaurants or something at the top.

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.860
So you're going to create the restaurants
page, you're going to add that in,

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
you're going to make sure
it's appended to the menu.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.020
And the other thing you're going to
do is you're going to make a footer.

12
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.510
And you're going to make
the footer persist on every page.

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.571
If we go back to our next food app,
oops next food app.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.090
You can take a look at what
our footer looks like here.

15
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.880
If you use the tag footer it will
automatically make it black for you.

16
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.660
It'll automatically put that style in and
you can put whatever you like in there.

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.070
I just said copyright
information goes here.

18
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.580
So create a footer.

19
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.240
The sticky will work if
you use a footer tag and

20
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.000
if it's done outside of the content class.

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.010
So if you go back to your layouts,
default dot view, we have this content.

22
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.320
If it's done outside of the content,
it will be sticky.

23
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.590
Create the page named restaurants and add
it to the navigation menu with the link,

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.020
add the app restaurant info component.

25
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.070
And you can look at the final result to
see what you need to create the page.

26
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.530
So the starter for
the problem is food app problem one, and

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.880
then we're going to go over
the solution in ten minutes.
