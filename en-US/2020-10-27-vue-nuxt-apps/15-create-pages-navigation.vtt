1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.630
So we set up our next config.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.860
Now we're gonna create some pages and

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.100
what we're gonna do well,
you already saw us create one page, right?

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.110
You we already, so
far created our index page.

5
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.440
If we wanted to make an about page,
we would make,

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.810
we would call it about.view, we would
make sure it's in the pages directory.

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.822
We would say V base and
I could say hy from

8
00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:33.190
about page.

9
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.960
Save that off, and then I go back.

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.010
And now if I go to localhost 3000
I'm at that index page right here.

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.440
And if I wanted to say, about.

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.400
Now I'm at the about page.

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.860
So, you can actually see
that this is routing.

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.080
We want to make a navigation though,
right?

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.860
We don't want to manually say,
about or the index page.

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.650
But this is pretty cool.

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.270
We didn't have to create a router or
anything, just simply.

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.078
By putting a new page, the new view file
inside pages, we made a brand new page.

19
00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.900
[LAUGH] It's awesome, okay?

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.140
So now, what we wanna do is
we wanna make navigation.

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.510
So I'm gonna close out our things that
we're not working with right now.

22
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.550
And our config, okay?

23
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.740
And we're not gonna need that, all right?

24
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.588
So now, I'm gonna say app.

25
00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:29.430
Menu.view.

26
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.700
And we're gonna go into the next food app.

27
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.020
We're gonna say components.

28
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.690
Here, we're gonna say the base again.

29
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.350
I'm gonna change this to nap.

30
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.650
Have, because that's kind of typical.

31
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.300
And then, I'm gonna say ul, li, and

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.010
nuxt has a special type of link for
when it's routing.

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.600
So you're not gonna use an a tag, where
you're gonna say is I have a snippet for

34
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.400
it, V next L is going to
say nuxt link to page.

35
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.090
So in this case, it's the homepage.

36
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.820
So it's just going to go that
backslash and I'm going to say home.

37
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.220
But I also have to say exact

38
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.940
because it needs to know there's
a lot of things that match this.

39
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.490
I think in newer versions of nuxt
it's not gonna need that anymore.

40
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.190
But for now, we'll just leave it.

41
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.540
And so you might be working with
a version that doesn't need that anymore,

42
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.600
cuz they said that they
were going to work on that.

43
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.880
So, in V nuxt l, we say about; And
then I'm gonna say about here.

44
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.070
And then we can come back refresh.

45
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.470
The server might need to,
we didn't actually add it to anything.

46
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.150
We need to go into the default page.

47
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.210
Remember I mentioned that in that default
page, that's where we can have headers and

48
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.840
footers and things persist.

49
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.960
So I don't have to add it to
the bout in the Index page

50
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.890
every time if I have something
that's repeated like that.

51
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.860
So I'm going to add in a script tag.

52
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.970
And I'm gonna say,
the Import Export and say app menu.

53
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.535
And then above this nuxt tag,
I'm going to say AppMenu.

54
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.370
I'm also going to put this
in a class of content.

55
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.200
And I'm going to put this in a div and
I'll explain why in a bit here.

56
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.510
Well, I'll just say its
first sticky footer.

57
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.510
Like I'm going to add this content and
you're in an exercise you're going to add

58
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.900
a footer below this and
then it will be sticky.

59
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.010
So if I added in that app menu,

60
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.800
if I go back now I can see that I have
a menu, and it persists on each page.

61
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.730
I don't have to add it
to the about page but

62
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.590
I can go on route from about to home and
back again.

63
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.850
Cool, so if we go back to our
to-do-list now we've created pages and

64
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.310
we've created a menu and we've
explained a bit what next layouts do.

65
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.540
So again,
they're all single file components.

66
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.400
We use default.view and
you can persist headers.

67
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.210
I did an example where I use those
persisted have headers to create

68
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.980
these kind of native
like animations between

69
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.420
pages because I'm able to persist
that state across different pages.

70
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.040
So if you're interested in
that I linked up the course or

71
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.020
they linked up the article in the demo.

72
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.280
If you want to learn how to do that.

73
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.680
You can also create new ones
we're using the default.

74
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.100
But let's say you had a layout of a blog.

75
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.190
You could totally let add in a different
layout style a little bit differently.

76
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.629
Maybe you have an aside that
persists on every blog page.

77
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.759
And you have many blog pages,
you can make that really easily.

78
00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.809
And then inside the export defaults of
that page, you would say layout is blog.

79
00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.749
So if you need more information
about that, that's where that lives.
