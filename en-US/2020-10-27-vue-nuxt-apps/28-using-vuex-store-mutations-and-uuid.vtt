WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.619
Now the next thing that we're gonna do,
is take the add to cart and

2
00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:08.842
we're gonna create a cart page and
use Vuex store mutations.

3
00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:14.423
Okay, so let's create a cart page and
use Vuex store mutations

4
00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:20.021
to add to a cart that we're
actually holding inside that cart.

5
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:27.691
So, as you might guess, what we're
gonna do is say this.store.commits.

6
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.004
And we're just still gonna
call this add to cart,

7
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.228
cuz that makes it a little
bit easy to remember.

8
00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:35.419
And I'm gonna go into my store index,

9
00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:40.213
the first thing I need to do
is give myself a cart, right?

10
00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:44.278
My cart is gonna be represented by,
just like the food data,

11
00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.360
it's gonna be an empty array.

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.610
And I'm gonna go into my mutations, and

13
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.924
I'm gonna add that,
add to cart and name it the same.

14
00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:57.011
Just like before we're going
to pass in the state and

15
00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:00.673
then I'm gonna pass in that
formOutput that I was gathering.

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.171
So, with that formOutput, I'm gonna say,

17
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.953
state.cart.push formOutput.

18
00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:19.832
Cool.

19
00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:26.607
So in here, what we're doing is we're
pushing things onto the store formOutput.

20
00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:29.580
So we wanna make sure that
we're actually doing that.

21
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.700
So let's go back to our localhost,
refresh and

22
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.820
we're gonna go look at Vue,
in the Vue tab, and

23
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.032
we're gonna do some options ,and add-ons
and add to the cart, order submitted.

24
00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:51.240
Now we look at Vuex, we load here,
and then the cart has an array in it.

25
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.512
So, let's make a cart page and
let's also make use of UUID.

26
00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:01.133
Making use of UUID requires
that we actually install it.

27
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:09.470
So what we're going to do here
is we're in the Nuxt food app,

28
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.312
we're gonna say yarn add UUID If

29
00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:20.415
we go back to the slides while we do this,

30
00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:25.880
UUID is a way to create
unique IDs in an application.

31
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.157
It's really useful, so you might
have seen those like long honking

32
00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:36.171
[LAUGH] IDs that we used for
some of the pages and things like that.

33
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:39.790
We often need to tell Vue or
Nuxt exactly what element or

34
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.843
page etcetera is using which.

35
00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:45.801
And we often use v-for keys for
virtual DOM diffing.

36
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:50.486
So we can use it for keys,
we can use it for dynamic pages,

37
00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:54.095
in this case what we're
gonna need to do is,

38
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:58.602
we're going to be passing
the formOutput to the cart.

39
00:02:58.602 --> 00:03:01.774
We're gonna be pushing that
FormData into the cart, but

40
00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:03.437
we also wanna add a unique ID.

41
00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:08.138
And the reason why we wanna do that is,
let's say you ordered a taco that's

42
00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:12.987
carne asada, and then your son or
daughter or brother or sister or somebody,

43
00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:16.418
comes along and
they also order one with carne asada but

44
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:19.880
one of you got pico de gallo,
and the other one did not.

45
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.601
And so we want a way to differentiate
between those two different items

46
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:27.241
with an ID, then we can loop through and

47
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:31.892
we're not using something like the name
of the item in order to do so.

48
00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:35.513
So far what we have is a unique ID for
that item, but

49
00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:41.481
there are different types of units we can
add to have different amounts of counts.

50
00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:44.707
We can have different types of add-ons and

51
00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:49.641
an option, so we wanna make sure
that each one of those is unique.

52
00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:54.594
So I'm gonna copy this, so
you can check out that package with UUID.

53
00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:57.060
And here's how we import it.

54
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.156
So if we go back to the cart,
and we import it here.

55
00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:07.935
So we're gonna import it at the top of
the page, and the way that we're gonna

56
00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:12.132
use it is, we're going to say add to cart,
state and form output.

57
00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:16.964
And then we're gonna say,

58
00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:21.864
formOutput.id=UUID.

59
00:04:21.864 --> 00:04:26.352
One thing [LAUGH] I think I might have
forgotten to do, that's very important,

60
00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:29.076
is to actually pass this
[LAUGH] information in.

61
00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:34.625
We probably want to also let
it know about that formOutput.

62
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.727
So okay, when we commit to the store,
we're passing in the formOutput.

63
00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:44.522
I'm gonna save this, so let's try it out.

64
00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:51.490
If we go back to Chrome, and we go to,
I have too many things open.

65
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.651
So let's go here,
we're going to refresh this.

66
00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:00.660
I'm going to say okay,

67
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.631
let's add four of these, add to cart.

68
00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:10.940
I did not save, so
[LAUGH] let's try this again.

69
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.261
We're gonna go back to localhost.

70
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:23.653
Okay, so we've got our localhost,
soup dumplings, let's add something here.

71
00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:42.482
This is .store.commit, add to cart,

72
00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:48.633
I'm passing formOutput as a string,
not as formOutput.

73
00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:53.782
That was silly, so we definitely want
to not pass formOutput as a string,

74
00:05:53.782 --> 00:05:56.840
we wanna pass it as this object here.

75
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.451
So let's [LAUGH] try this again.

76
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:06.710
Here we go, we're gonna add in the items,
mango pudding, add to cart.

77
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.218
And if we go into Vue,
then we can see in Vuex,

78
00:06:11.218 --> 00:06:15.491
that we now have in that cart,
an object and

79
00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:22.773
it has all of the add-ons that we added,
and all of this, awesome cool.

80
00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:26.277
So let's also make a cart page
while we're doing this, so

81
00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:31.152
we're gonna create new, your masters at
this now, you know exactly what to do.

82
00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:35.951
You go into pages, you say cart.vue, and

83
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:41.561
we say save, and
we're gonna create a cart here.

84
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:46.103
For all of them, we've been saying,
mean class=container.

85
00:06:46.103 --> 00:06:51.593
And then I'm also gonna call it cart,
h2 is cart.

86
00:06:51.593 --> 00:06:54.120
And I'm also gonna add it to the menu,
right?

87
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.885
So we're gonna go into the app menu,
and below the ul,

88
00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:03.660
I'm gonna say v next l And

89
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.227
then cart, we're gonna capitalize this.

90
00:07:09.227 --> 00:07:14.158
And let's come back to our app,
we have home and restaurants,

91
00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:16.122
and all of these things.

92
00:07:16.122 --> 00:07:22.172
So we go back to the food app,
soup dumplings, I want soup dumplings.

93
00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:27.132
We have our order submitted if we want
to,we can go to the cart page which has

94
00:07:27.132 --> 00:07:28.802
nothing in it right now.

95
00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:33.065
And at this point, we look at Vuex,
we load the state, and

96
00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:36.463
we have that object inside of the cart,
cool.

97
00:07:36.463 --> 00:07:38.113
Let's go back to the CodePen.

98
00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:43.144
So, we created a cart page and
used Vuex store mutations,

99
00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:48.700
and we made use of UUID to gather
a unique ID for each one of those.
