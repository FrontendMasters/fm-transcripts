00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's talk about this final solution.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.716
And then, I'm just gonna show
you how you could validate.

3
00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:10.070
That we're not gonna do all of the kind
of live coding bits, but I'm gonna

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.210
walk you through in review what validation
would look like in an app like this.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.850
So, here and
then at the very end of the course,

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.399
we're gonna go into the composition API,
and

7
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.406
do a really small example of how you can
currently use composition API in next.

8
00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:31.403
So, right now, if we look at the solution,

9
00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:36.263
basically what we're gonna have in
here is I mentioned using a getter so

10
00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:41.650
we're gonna use a getter if you didn't
call it cart count, that's fine.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.910
I called mine cart count.

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.485
And it's very similar to that
total price cart count, right,

13
00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:52.510
we're using a reduce we need to
return 0 if we don't have anything.

14
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.486
And then we're gonna take all
of the state of the cart,

15
00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:01.450
we're gonna go through all of
the counts for all of the indexes.

16
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.920
And we're gonna create one number
out of all of those numbers.

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.250
And that is the thing that we've
got inside the cart count.

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.370
And, the area that we're using it
is gonna be inside our components,

19
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.910
and organist go into app menu.

20
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.300
In app menu, remember I mentioned if
you put it down div class of small num,

21
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.970
I got your back.

22
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.910
So above this next link we have
a div class of small num, and

23
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.130
we're saying v if the cart count is
greater than 0, so in other words,

24
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.188
if the cart count is 0, don't put
a little 0, that's kinda awkward.

25
00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:39.580
[LAUGH] But do bring in the cart count and

26
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.270
of course we have to bring
that in from view x.

27
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.330
So, you could have either done that
with computed saying like cart count

28
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.610
this return this
.store.getters.cart count.

29
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.960
Or you could say, map getters and
grab the cart count.

30
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.340
Either one is totally fine.

31
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.100
So then,
if we go to our local server, if we

32
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.060
add in a bunch of stuff, 5, then we got
to 5 up in that corner there, right?

33
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.420
Now if I refresh, and I go to the cart,

34
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.990
or what we have is this final state.

35
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.870
So, inside the cart,

36
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.046
so the next thing that we wanna
do is we wanna go into the cart,

37
00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:32.170
and we wanna say,
section v if cart.length.

38
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.440
So if the cart has some
length show this cart, and

39
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.720
otherwise, we wanna show
this AppEmptyCart.view.

40
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.130
So, I also put a conditional on this
to see if the cart had no length.

41
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.420
Don't ever show it because it's always
gonna be an app empty cart state.

42
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.520
So, in the AppEmptyCart.view,

43
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.650
what we've got is this section,
and then we've got this SVG.

44
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.630
Remember I said that I wanted us to
do an aria labeled by hungry role

45
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.050
presentation hungry man.

46
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.240
So what we've got is an associative
aria labeled by hungry and hungry.

47
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.720
We have a role presentation and
that's gonna skip over these paths so

48
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.246
that we're not reading
them out to blind people.

49
00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:23.013
We're gonna say your cart is empty.

50
00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:26.211
And, we're saying next
exact to fill it up and

51
00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:29.499
that exact too is gonna
go back to the homepage.
