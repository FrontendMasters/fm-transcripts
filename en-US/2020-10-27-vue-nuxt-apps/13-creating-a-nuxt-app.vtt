1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
We're gonna build this food App Store.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:07.719
So if we gotta Nuxt Food App.netlify.app,
we've got this food app and

3
00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.489
we can see these kind of like a few
restaurants all that and Dim Sum.

4
00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.427
A Real pizza work, Toca bout Eating Tacos.

5
00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:21.027
And if we go to one of these,
we can see that product details.

6
00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:25.631
We're creating or
dynamically creating a page from API data.

7
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:30.833
And so I can pick a bunch of different
options and some other Add Ons and

8
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:35.240
I can add to my price here and
I'm gonna add that to my cart.

9
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.824
And then I'm gonna go to my cart.

10
00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:40.634
And you can see in the cart
page I have my Quesadila and

11
00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:45.491
what type of Quesadila it is my
Add Ons my amount and my total price.

12
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:51.285
So we're gonna work with an app and
create all of these different pages and

13
00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:54.569
bring information in from an API to do so.

14
00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.140
So in order to install this, what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say yarn create

15
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.813
nuxt-app and we're gonna name the project.

16
00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:06.111
So here Inside my folder here I'm

17
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:11.022
gonna say yarn create nuxt-app, and

18
00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:17.015
then I'm gonna give it
a name of Nuxt Food App.

19
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:20.771
And as it's installing, it's going
to install a bunch of dependencies.

20
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:24.169
And then it's also gonna ask me a few
questions just like the VCLI did.

21
00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:28.641
So I've got my project name is fine
JavaScript or TypeScript yarn, and

22
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:33.032
I can add a UI framework and I can add
axios and I can add linting tools and

23
00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:36.709
testing tools,
we're not gonna go through all of these.

24
00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.597
Today we're gonna use the universal
I'm gonna do static so

25
00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:43.714
that I can show you that
static rendering mode.

26
00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:47.407
And then I'm just kind of going
through all of the defaults here.

27
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:52.085
We can see that there's so many
different options available to you and

28
00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:56.601
it's going to automatically install
these when it first loads up,

29
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.141
you're gonna see a kind of standard
thing for the directory setup.

30
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:04.891
You might notice that one
difference between VCLI and

31
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:09.815
Nuxt was it didn't ask ask us about
the storage and ask us about view x.

32
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:13.631
And part of the reason why it didn't ask
us about view x, is it because it comes

33
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:17.589
default with next and I'll show you these
directories as soon as this is set up.

34
00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.257
Okay, cool.

35
00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:23.015
We can say, cd nuxt food app and
I can say, yarn dev, and

36
00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:27.391
I'm gonna open up a new tab two and
open up the code.

37
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:32.704
So here's what we're working with here.

38
00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:36.058
Here is our default Nuxt app.

39
00:02:36.058 --> 00:02:39.576
As I mentioned,
we have a store directory right away.

40
00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:43.257
There's nothing in this In this store
directory, but they make sure that they

41
00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:47.069
have read me's and every single directory
that tell you all about these things.

42
00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.764
So, like it says here, creating a file in
this directory automatically activates

43
00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:53.450
the option in the framework.

44
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.217
So you don't have to install view x or
anything like that.

45
00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:01.614
All you have to do is create
an index in your store or

46
00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:07.899
whatever you wanna make in your store and
it won't that you want that and

47
00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.850
need that and it has these
kind of nice things like that.

48
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.316
This .nuxt folder is a folder that
nuxt uses to understand itself.

49
00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:23.380
This is you can see like what hasn't been
getting ignored, this is getting ignored.

50
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.623
It's not going to be pushed up,
but it will be something

51
00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:32.607
that nuxt uses to work note locally
just like those node modules.

52
00:03:32.607 --> 00:03:34.215
If we look at our assets directory,

53
00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:36.960
that's where we're gonna have
our global assets, right?

54
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.571
Just like the UCLA.

55
00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:42.481
So today we're gonna move our mean.STS,

56
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:47.267
I showed you how to bring
all of your files from your?

57
00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:53.007
Your main.CSS into your app for the last
one if you just have a few styles,

58
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.892
but in this case we have more styles.

59
00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:58.424
So I'm gonna create a global assets so

60
00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:01.676
I'm gonna show you both
ways of working with it.

61
00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:03.213
We have our components.

62
00:04:03.213 --> 00:04:06.879
And just like the view CLI,
it gives us a default component.

63
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.173
In this case, it's log.view.

64
00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:13.825
So we've got the like, template area,
the style area here, and

65
00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.116
that's gonna give us our logo.

66
00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:18.226
If you wanna see what that looks like.

67
00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:21.608
We can go see,
this is the logo that's rendered there.

68
00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:24.331
That's that component.

69
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.850
If we go back to our,
VS code, we have a thing

70
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.873
called the layouts and
we have a default layout.

71
00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:38.225
I mentioned this in the last course
that everything in Nuxt is gonna be

72
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:40.637
routed through this Nuxt component.

73
00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:45.200
But this layouts default
is really nice because what

74
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.965
it allows us to do is it allows
us to not have to bring in,

75
00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:53.505
an navigation or a footer on every page.

76
00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:58.495
We can put it in this layouts default,
and then it will persist on every page.

77
00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:03.252
And that's really nice because we
can also create different types of

78
00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:07.762
layouts as we work middle ware is,
you're gonna see in a second,

79
00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:13.240
we're gonna make pages by simply putting
a view file in a pages directory.

80
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.560
But let's say, if you're making something
with UCLA, you would add something like

81
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.161
view router and you would explicitly
talk about each one of the routes.

82
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:22.756
Which you don't have to do here.

83
00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:27.352
But if you wanted to capture some
sort of hooks between those routes,

84
00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:31.488
you no longer have access to that,
view router file anymore.

85
00:05:31.488 --> 00:05:34.308
So in middle ware,
you have access to those routes, and

86
00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:36.350
that's where you can apply some logic.

87
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.622
So middle ware is a great
place to do things like auth.

88
00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:43.604
Middle ware is a great place to do things
like tell the store about the route

89
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:45.479
changing or something like that.

90
00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.780
That would be done in middleware.

91
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.363
And I mentioned this about the pages
directory, we have an index page.

92
00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:56.928
And we have this kind
of defaults container.

93
00:05:56.928 --> 00:06:02.071
You see this logo being brought in,
just like we did with the view CLI and

94
00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:07.216
we are able to have this kind of defaults,
but what's really nice about

95
00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:12.216
it Is that we have, a base index file and
all of a sudden we have a page.

96
00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:16.163
If I created another page,
I would have a brand new page.

97
00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:19.890
And you also might notice that in every
single directory they have README files

98
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.709
just in case you get lost or confused.

99
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.205
For the plugins directory, we're gonna
use this to call things on the server on

100
00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.381
the client that we need to happen for
the whole application.

101
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:34.622
So if you're used to working with vcli
This is a little like mounting it in

102
00:06:34.622 --> 00:06:35.952
the main.js folder.

103
00:06:35.952 --> 00:06:40.359
So like bringing in
the composition API globally would

104
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.957
happen in this plugins folder.

105
00:06:42.957 --> 00:06:45.838
Static is what you might
think it might be.

106
00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:48.347
It's kind of like the public
folder from vcli.

107
00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:52.813
Static is any kind of static files,
and we went over store.

108
00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:58.615
And here is kinda the brains of
the operation is our next config.

109
00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:01.465
I mentioned that we have
this target static,

110
00:07:01.465 --> 00:07:05.296
that's the thing that's gonna
tell it to be a jam stack app.

111
00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:09.144
It's going to minify concatenate and
build all of the pages,

112
00:07:09.144 --> 00:07:12.407
including dynamic routes
before we even push it up.

113
00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:15.290
So that's really, really cool.

114
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.162
Here also in that Nuxt config,
we have a thing called the head.

115
00:07:20.162 --> 00:07:25.932
In the head, you see all the things that
would normally go in the head of public,

116
00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:29.206
like in the public
directory index dot HTML,

117
00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:34.317
you would have the meta title,
you'd have the title, the meta tags.

118
00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:36.633
Links to fonts, things like that.

119
00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:40.077
But here,
instead of it being these those tags,

120
00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:45.633
we see that it's rendered in a way that's
a little bit similar to JSON format.

121
00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:50.099
And the reason why that is,
is because it builds all of those things.

122
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:55.420
So you're basically telling it to build
that rather than having it built already

123
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.897
for you, then we have things like the CSS,
we have to register things like the CSS,

124
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.516
global CSS, plugins,
build modules, and so forth.

125
00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:06.258
So we mentioned this Nuxt.config.

126
00:08:06.258 --> 00:08:07.783
This is a really important file.

127
00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:12.345
This is the file that lets us
know what everything is and does,

128
00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:16.318
we can, say that we want spa or
universal rendering.

129
00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:19.256
We can do target static or server.

130
00:08:19.256 --> 00:08:23.459
We can say in the head we
want metadata links fonts.

131
00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:28.269
In the CSS, we can say we want some
global CSS, which we'll do in a minute.

132
00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.676
We have plugins which we'll use today for

133
00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:36.357
adding scripts to our to,
globally to our application.

134
00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:41.581
And if you want more information,
that's where the configuration is.

135
00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:42.824
So I prepared this.

136
00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:44.761
We're doing a lot for this application.

137
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:48.166
So I prepared this to do list for
our next app.

138
00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:51.158
And if you want it to
go into the code pen,

139
00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:55.030
it actually is using a view
single file component and

140
00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:01.017
to get really dorky what I did was I'm
actually storing things in local storage.

141
00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:04.944
So I'm gonna use this and
I'm gonna go through and

142
00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.478
check things as we go over them.

143
00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:10.994
But you can follow along and
use this as your own to do and

144
00:09:10.994 --> 00:09:13.837
it will retain the state
have what you want.

145
00:09:13.837 --> 00:09:17.870
So like if I brought this over into
another pen into another window,

146
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.922
you can see it will persist that
state just for you in local storage.

147
00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:26.893
So that's kind of like a nerdy
little to do list that we're doing.

148
00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:29.473
We're gonna set up our Nuxt config first.

149
00:09:29.473 --> 00:09:33.890
And then we're gonna go into some of the,
files and create pages together.
