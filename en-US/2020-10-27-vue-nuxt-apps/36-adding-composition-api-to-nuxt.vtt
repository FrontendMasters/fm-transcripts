WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.210
What we're building now with Vue2, and
keep in mind that this course is made at

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.850
a particular point in time when U3 is just
coming out and Nuxt is just supporting it.

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.440
So, these things might move
around in the future and

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.990
in fact, I think in the future,
you won't have to do any of this stuff.

5
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.620
But if you are working with it right now,

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.578
here's what we would do to
make this setup work in Nuxt.

7
00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:33.120
So I'm gonna go over to my terminal and
I'm going to close this out.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.728
I'm gonna close this out and

9
00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:42.913
I'm gonna go up one directory,

10
00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:50.787
and I'm gonna say go into
the compapi-start and

11
00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:56.754
we're gonna say yarn dev up, yarn.

12
00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.740
And, we have our localhost
here that's building.

13
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.110
So what we have is this Count that we
can increase and we have our Homepage.

14
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.836
Let's look at what we have
inside that homepage.

15
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.790
So some major differences
that we have coming in.

16
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.819
We have to bring in TypeScript in
order to use it with Nuxt currently,

17
00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.215
so I have a tsconfig.json so that I
can work with TypeScript within Nuxt.

18
00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:38.704
The next thing that we need to make
sure of is that we have a plugin,

19
00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:41.660
where we bring in the composition-api.

20
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.970
Again, this is not something that you
probably have to do in the far future, but

21
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.037
for now, we're going to create
a plugin that imports Vue from vue,

22
00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.420
imports VueCompositionApi.

23
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.510
And it's so standard that we might
need to do this that is actually

24
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.740
my default V plugin for
my VS code snippets,

25
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.330
if you write V plugin, that's what
it's gonna assume you want right now.

26
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.960
We also have to install it.

27
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.910
So we have to install
@vue/composition-api.

28
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.020
So we we're installing
@vue/composition-api.

29
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.210
And then we're bringing it
in through this plugin,

30
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.680
which we will then
register in nuxt.config.

31
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.922
So if we go into nuxt.config,

32
00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:36.016
remember before we installed that
plugin by saying plugins/tilda,

33
00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:40.610
plugins/composition-api, we're
gonna do the same here.

34
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.680
We also want to bring in the build
module of @nuxt/typescript-build, so

35
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.984
that we can make sure to work
with Nuxt in TypeScript.

36
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.910
Now if we go into our page,
this count is just the same,

37
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.690
like as I mentioned before,
in templates it's very similar.

38
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.330
So this surface API for directives, and

39
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.375
the templates have not
changed in composition-api.

40
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.200
Here what I wanna do is I wanna
actually defineComponent.

41
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.250
I need to say script lang equals ts.

42
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.470
I just need to say import defineComponent,
ref and watchEffect.

43
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.490
So anything that I'm using,
I'm gonna bring in and

44
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.880
I'm gonna say export
default defineComponent.

45
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.750
Here I will pass in setup, and there I
will say like const count = ref is 0.

46
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.390
You can also use reactive
as we used before.

47
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.025
If I wanted to addToCount I say
count.value, if I was using reactive it

48
00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:47.135
would be state dot whatever the thing
is that you decided, so state.count.

49
00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:50.825
We also have a thing called
watchEffect which is similar to watch.

50
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:56.350
So, in this,
we have access to any watched properties.

51
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.600
The only difference between watchEffects
and watchers are not the only difference,

52
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.200
few differences between watchEffects and
watchers from the options API is,

53
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.670
you'll note that I don't have to
declare what thing I'm watching.

54
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.270
I'm actually just watching everything, so
I can access those values willy nilly.

55
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.350
That's not a technical term, but
I can access whatever I want,

56
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.865
that's either setup in refs, or
reactive, or props, or what have you.

57
00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:29.567
And I don't have to say like in watch for
the options API,

58
00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:32.080
I would have had to say count.

59
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.465
Here I'm not saying that I'm
saying console.log(count.value).

60
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.070
And remember, we've got to return.

61
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.520
So we've got to return the count.

62
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.250
And we've got to return any
function we want executed.

63
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.780
We don't have return our watcher because

64
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.900
our watcher is part of
the reactivity system.

65
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.580
So if I look here in Vue, so
we've got our console.log,

66
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.275
this was the other change
between watch and watchEffect.

67
00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:05.950
WatchEffect runs immediately,

68
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.082
whereas watchers,
once you change it, it's invoked.

69
00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:14.030
For watchEffect, you can see
that zero happening right away.

70
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.900
That zero is happening right away because,
as soon as it's instantiated,

71
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.990
that watchEffect is gonna run and anything
inside of it is gonna run as well.

72
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.710
So now,
from here I can Increase the Count.

73
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.930
And you can see that property change.
