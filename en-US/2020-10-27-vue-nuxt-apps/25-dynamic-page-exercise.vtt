00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.670
So here, we created a dynamic page.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.292
Your next exercise, Is, and

3
00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:12.640
I talked a little bit
about dynamic pages here.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.930
Just like we create things dynamically
with directives, computed, watchers,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.690
we can create dynamic pages in our app.

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.620
And our next exercise is we've made
dynamic routes based on ids and

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.930
brought in the computer property.

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.660
It has all the data for them.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.770
It's now your job to add and style
the item to give them user information.

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.316
So you can look at this
final result Here and

11
00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:45.870
kind of see what sections and
things are laid out in the page, right?

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.510
But you can't actually see it because it's
prod, you can't see all of the components

13
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.280
or anything, but you can kinda see where I
used what kinda styling tags and things,

14
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.060
details, options, things like that,
add to cart and things like that.

15
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.440
Don't worry about the Adding to cart
functionality yet, but I do want you to

16
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.805
see if you can gather some data in so
that we can put it to the cart.

17
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.880
So start to think about like if you have

18
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.640
three in the count that this number
gives you a combined price and

19
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.990
things like that so
that we can add that to the cart.

20
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.395
So I have a few hints here,

21
00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:34.135
that's you can look at
the styles there and you're on

22
00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:37.885
the hook to building the grid part of this
because I want you to get used to that.

23
00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:41.003
So I did make you a CSS Grid Generator.

24
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:47.052
So you can use the CSS Grid Generator
to create grids and columns.

25
00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:52.117
You can even make special things like that
and then I say please get some code and

26
00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:55.592
you can copy to clipboard
shows you all of that stuff.

27
00:01:55.592 --> 00:02:00.426
So I tried to make it a little easier for
you where you can generate that stuff and

28
00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:02.412
don't forget accessibility.

29
00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:06.110
When we're working with the form,
use some accessibility bits.

30
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.230
Okay, so in this next section,
you're going to fill out that

31
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.880
ID page with the information given to you
from all of those pieces that we have.

32
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.461
We have all of the pieces
that you need to get started.
