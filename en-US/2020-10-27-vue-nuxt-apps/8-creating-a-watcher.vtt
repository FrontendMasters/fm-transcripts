1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.480
We have to do a few things here.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.040
One is we want that needle to give
some visual indication of whether or

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.320
not we are actually advancing
the way that we want to or not.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.540
And we'll also check the needle to
see if it's kind of going off or

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.580
if it's rotating the right way.

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.610
We're gonna use a watcher for this.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.460
We're also gonna use a library called
GSAP, which I use quite frequently, and

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.550
you could do this with transforms,
with CSS transforms.

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.360
But what I found is transformation origin,
which we'll use in this,

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.460
is not really super consistent across
browsers, and GreenSock stabilizes that.

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.180
Because we're using a transform, I'm gonna
actually load GSAP to make sure that we

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.560
have a consistent way of transforming that
across every browser and every device.

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.310
I might also, if you wanted to
take it a step further, you could

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.470
feasibly fork this and then add animations
in places and things like that too.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.340
So that's pretty fun.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.073
So okay, we're gonna go back
to our terminal in this tab,

17
00:01:06.073 --> 00:01:09.470
I'm going to say, yarn add gsap.

18
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.392
Cool, now let's go back over and
we're gonna go to our

19
00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:18.900
VS code tab and
we're gonna go over to this score.

20
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.970
In this score, I mentioned we have
the rainbow and the bad and the good and

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.610
the needle.

22
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.030
The first thing we need
to do is import gsap.

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.240
And I actually use it so
much that I just have a snippet for it.

24
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.280
And then I'm also going
to say vmapstate and I'm

25
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.870
gonna grab the score, because we're gonna
make sure that we're watching the score.

26
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.910
And one thing about the watch,

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.920
you don't have to just watch a data
property that's in the component.

28
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.160
You can watch things that
are computed values from stores.

29
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.730
You can watch any kind of dependency here,

30
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.830
anything that's brought
into that component.

31
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.950
And since we're bringing in score,
we can watch score.

32
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.160
So we're gonna say watch.

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.490
Whoops, helps us to spell it right.

34
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.650
And then we've got the score.

35
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.595
And here we're going to, so

36
00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:14.119
we're gonna update the score
based on any time it changes.

37
00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:18.407
And we wanna pass in newValue, we're gonna
pass in newValue and oldValue just so

38
00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:21.621
that you can see that you can
have both of those, but really,

39
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:22.990
all we need is newValue.

40
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.360
So that's kind of unnecessary.

41
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.220
So we were gonna say gsap.to, and

42
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.688
it allows me to grab
something out of the DOM.

43
00:02:31.688 --> 00:02:34.208
So I'm gonna say we're
gonna go grab needle.

44
00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:41.075
And I'm gonna pass in an object, and
in that object, I can set a duration.

45
00:02:41.075 --> 00:02:45.660
And the nice thing about GSAP's API
is it's really consistent.

46
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.730
Once you learn the surface layer
of the API, it's very repetitive.

47
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.586
At first, I'm gonna just say 0.3,
because typically,

48
00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:58.913
if we're not moving something
that much in the DOM,

49
00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:04.001
anywhere from 0.2 seconds to 0.3 seconds
tends to be a very good default.

50
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.764
When you start to move it across
the screen or do some other kind of

51
00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:12.449
interaction, that's when we're gonna
start to work with bigger durations.

52
00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.661
But you can kind of
guesstimate that the duration

53
00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:20.060
of 0.3 is gonna be in the right range and
then adjust from there.

54
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.300
So duration is gonna be 0.3.

55
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.840
I'm gonna say that
the rotation is newValue.

56
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.107
Because really,
what we're starting off with is zero.

57
00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:35.310
Any time we do a transform,

58
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.920
we're starting at zero and then we move
it up and down and left and right.

59
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.590
And I don't have to pass
in pixels to GreenSock.

60
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.170
It will know to append that.

61
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.310
So I can just pass in newValue.

62
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.200
And then I'm also going
to say transformOrigin,

63
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.745
which I mentioned is the thing that we,

64
00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:57.410
that helps again to spell it right,
the thing that we really want here.

65
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.450
And then the way that transform
origin works is it doesn't,

66
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.737
you'd think that every default
is like the center of something.

67
00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:06.719
So if you rotate it,
it's rotates from the center, but

68
00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.528
the default is actually 0%,
0%, the top left.

69
00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:13.278
What we wanna do, and you can think of
everything in the browser as a box,

70
00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:16.930
what we wanna do is go into the middle,
into the bottom right,

71
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.270
because that needle has to rotate
on the axis of the bottom.

72
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.266
So it's gotta go 50%, 100%.

73
00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:29.133
So I'm gonna say 50%, 100% for now,
and we'll kinda see how that goes

74
00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:33.806
because maybe that's not exactly
the right value, but let's try it out.

75
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:39.563
So now if we refresh, we go back to,
let's pick artist and

76
00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:43.957
then do baker because then we can
kind of see if it's working or not.

77
00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:46.082
It's rotating incorrectly.

78
00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:51.290
So let's go back to the here.

79
00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:56.180
We've got,
we wanna say transformOrigin and

80
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.590
spell it correctly,
cuz now it's rotating from the top left,

81
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.090
right, because I didn't set anything
because I spelled it wrong.

82
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.510
It's using the top left.

83
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.200
So let's go back here.

84
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.420
We refresh, we're gonna pick artist,
and then I'm gonna select baker.

85
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.570
And now you can see that needle turning.

86
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.000
But if I keep going, first of all, what we
might notice is we're almost at the end of

87
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.950
the question index and we haven't
gotten all the way to poor, right?

88
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.480
We keep going all the way over, but it
hasn't reached all the way down to poor.

89
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.910
So that's one adjustment we need to make.

90
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.760
We also need to make it,
it's not quite at 100, I think.

91
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.476
It's gonna go a little bit above.

92
00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:41.546
So let's go back to two places.

93
00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:46.931
One is the store, we're gonna increase
this rotation by a little bit,

94
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:51.972
13 instead of, 15 might be too much,
let's try it with 13.

95
00:05:51.972 --> 00:05:56.184
And then one other thing,
if we go into score,

96
00:05:56.184 --> 00:06:00.301
I'm gonna make this 80 instead of 100.

97
00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:01.680
Let's see where that is.

98
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.190
So we've got the baker.

99
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.880
Now we're gonna pick the wrong one,
pick the wrong one.

100
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.340
It's better, but

101
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.840
it's not quite, we could probably
adjust it down a little bit from here.

102
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.550
But you can see the amount
that we're changing it,

103
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.620
by that 13, it's generally
where we want it to be, right?

104
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.890
We got to that poor state from there.

105
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.060
So let's do 87 or something.

106
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.140
Try one more time.

107
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.251
We've got baker, and
then we select artist, artist.

108
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:42.370
That looks pretty stable now, right?

109
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.870
Pretty good.
