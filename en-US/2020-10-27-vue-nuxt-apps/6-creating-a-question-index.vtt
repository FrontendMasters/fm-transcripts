WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.030
All right, we did a lot so far.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.870
So we have this kind of functioning UI

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.980
state that tells us whether it's starting,
we can pick a character.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.740
And then as we pick a character,

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.140
we're conditionally loading just
a piece of this SVG, right?

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.080
Just a group that this component of Baker,
and

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.050
we know because we're using SVG that
everything stays really stable.

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.597
We don't have to like keep on messing
around with CSS positioning and

9
00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:30.584
things like that.

10
00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:34.250
Which is the reason why there's just
not a lot of CSS for this project.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.470
It's mostly using SVG's
coordinate system to place these

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.720
components in different areas.

13
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.810
And you can see that we're also
saying that we have a baker.

14
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.035
But next, we wanna be able to
ask the person questions right?

15
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:53.730
We'd have that list of questions that
were ridiculous and we want the friend,

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.973
the friend is skeptical that
this is really their friend.

17
00:00:57.973 --> 00:01:02.506
And so they're gonna be asking a bunch of
questions and there's gonna be a bunch of

18
00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:06.660
selections for answers, and you have
to kind of decide which one you want.

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.059
So, the next step here is we're going
to start to ask those questions.

20
00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:17.860
And what I mentioned before,
we're gonna use a question index for that.

21
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.150
So if I open up the state,
I'm going to set the question index

22
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.690
at 0 and
then I'm also gonna give us a score.

23
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.190
Because what we wanna be able to do
is score them based off of whether or

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.080
not they picked the right one.

25
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.160
If they said that they're a baker and

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.740
they gave the baker answer,
then they get a higher score.

27
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.838
And if they said the oddest answer,
they get a lower score.

28
00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:50.130
So cool,
let's go back into our app dot view

29
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.810
and we've got some bubbles for
our friends.

30
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.513
We've got a section that's conditionally
loaded now, and not within the SVG.

31
00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:07.430
But rather on top of the SVG in kind of
HTML land that's positioned absolutely.

32
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.774
We're gonna do a friend talk,

33
00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:19.878
not friend and a zombie talk.

34
00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:26.684
Cool, now in that friend talk,

35
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:32.528
we have access to UI state questions
character choices character.

36
00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:40.030
What we don't have is that question index,
that we just mentioned previously.

37
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.459
So, let's bring in the question index and
what we're gonna say here, and

38
00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.867
we want it to be like a little bit bigger.

39
00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:51.774
We want like an h3 maybe and
in this h3, what we're going

40
00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:56.494
to output is we're gonna go
grab that questions array.

41
00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:02.723
And we're gonna use
square bracket notation

42
00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:06.613
to gather the questions in their array.

43
00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:09.630
We have a bunch of objects, right?

44
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.450
We're gonna gather the zeroeth
degree of the question so

45
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.370
that the first item in that array.

46
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.470
And then we also wanna say dot question,

47
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.190
because if you look back at the store,
we have that questions array.

48
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.790
We're getting this index, and then
we're gonna grab dot question as well.

49
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.761
So I go back into here, and
let's go look at what we've got,

50
00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:39.815
if I say I'm a mechanic.

51
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:44.480
You can see the friend is like curious and
so he's asking what's your dog's name?

52
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.260
Now the next thing we wanna do is we wanna
make sure that we have some buttons and

53
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.380
things so
that we can answer these questions.

54
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.038
So in zombie talk, what we're gonna do
is we're going to say like p v for,

55
00:03:56.038 --> 00:03:57.400
like we did earlier.

56
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.272
So we're gonna use a p to loop
through some options here and

57
00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:06.560
we're gonna say character
in character choices.

58
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.920
And the key that's unique will be
character cuz we only have one

59
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.010
of each character.

60
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.940
Then inside of here,

61
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.920
we're gonna make a button and
I'm not gonna make the click event yet.

62
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.030
We'll do the click event in just a second
but what we wanna output for now.

63
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.341
As we wanna say questions, and
then we wanna say, question index.

64
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:33.754
And then we wanna say character
because the character

65
00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:39.320
was actually,
a part of that object, right?

66
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.850
It was a property on that object,
we had baker, mechanic, artists.

67
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.950
So we wanna loop through and we wanna use
that question to output it to the page.

68
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.720
So we've got questions, question index and
character, let's see how we're doing.

69
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.740
There we go, we have a button for
each one of these.

70
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.690
And now we wanna make that click event,
right?

71
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.340
Because we wanna make sure that
we're able to pick our characters.

72
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.720
So I'm gonna say at click
equals pick character and

73
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.600
I'm gonna pass in whatever
character we have going right now.

74
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.770
We also have to make sure so

75
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.930
that it doesn't air that we have an
associative pick character to even test.

76
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.660
So in methods, sorry, not pick character,

77
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.540
like maybe we shouldn't name it something
else cuz we already did pick character.

78
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.990
We'll do pick question here.

79
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.630
Cool, that's better,
we don't need two of these.

80
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.300
We've got pickQuestion and
we're gonna pass in the character.

81
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.320
And right now, let's just console
log to make sure that, that works.

82
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.780
Cool, so let's go back,
we're gonna refresh.

83
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.850
We say artist, pick the character and

84
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.920
I'm going to pick something here,
I'll pick woofgang puck.

85
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.829
And what it was was baker, and
the reason I know that is well,

86
00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:10.643
first it's woofgang puck.

87
00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:15.402
And that's obviously a baker,
where like Salvador Doggy is

88
00:06:15.402 --> 00:06:19.424
probably obviously an artist,
if you like punts.

89
00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:24.622
And then if you go into these questions,
we've got baker, mechanic, artist.

90
00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:29.075
So we know that we've got woofgang puck
and that is the one that we selected,

91
00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:30.550
so working as expected.
