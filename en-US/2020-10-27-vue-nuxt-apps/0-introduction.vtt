WEBVTT

00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:02.836
Hey everybody,
I'm really excited to be here today.

2
00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.907
This is a continuation of
our Vue learning journey.

3
00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:09.293
Today we're gonna be building
web apps with Vue and Nuxt and

4
00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:11.333
I'm so excited about this course.

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.320
I love working with Frontend Masters and
really thank them for

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.683
allowing me to do this
course on their platform.

7
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.306
We're gonna be doing
a ton of live code today.

8
00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.144
We're gonna be building
all sorts of cool stuff.

9
00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.746
So I'm super excited to be here.

10
00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:30.213
This is me as Optimus Prime because
we're gonna optimize some of our code.

11
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.925
That's a terrible joke [LAUGH].

12
00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:36.238
If you need to get ahold of me,
this is my Twitter handle.

13
00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:40.121
I am VP of Developer Experience
Engineering at Netlify, and

14
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.185
I also work on the Vue core team.

15
00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:46.974
Lately I've been focusing a lot on
the documentation as we have just

16
00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:49.837
come out with this major Vue 3 release.

17
00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:52.436
Cool, so welcome.

18
00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:54.757
Some of the prerequisites for this course.

19
00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:58.696
Either you should have watched the intro
to Vue workshop because we're gonna be

20
00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:01.596
assumptive that you have some
of that knowledge already.

21
00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:07.420
Or, going through the Vue documentation or
any kind of foundational Vue knowledge.

22
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.521
So we're not gonna start
from the very beginning.

23
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:14.073
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take
the knowledge that we've already built and

24
00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.290
start to build web applications and
see what that's like.

25
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.419
We're also gonna be
using modern JavaScript.

26
00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:22.450
So if you need a brush up on any of that,

27
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.718
then there's other courses on this
platform that are really awesome for that.

28
00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:31.028
Cool, so what we're gonna learn today,
tons of stuff actually.

29
00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:35.036
We're gonna learn how to set
up applications with Vue-cli.

30
00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:37.419
We're gonna set up applications
with Nuxt as well.

31
00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:41.253
And we're gonna kind of see
the differences between those two.

32
00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:43.945
We're gonna do different
types of configuration and

33
00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:45.749
we're also gonna deploy our apps.

34
00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.608
We're gonna deploy our apps
using this Nuxt static mode and

35
00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.858
it creates dynamic routes for us.

36
00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:55.004
So that's gonna be
really exciting to show.

37
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.771
We're also gonna be working
a lot with a Vuex store and

38
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.288
see how we can do centralized state
management for an application.

39
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.675
We're gonna use directives effectively,
we're gonna use directives for

40
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:06.918
all sorts of things.

41
00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.620
We're gonna use directives for

42
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.039
the things that you might have seen in the
last course like V4, v if conditionals.

43
00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:18.489
But we're also gonna use it for some
things like emit and to bind to props.

44
00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.777
We're gonna create dynamic
pages from API data.

45
00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:25.602
So just the way that you might
in a bigger application.

46
00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:30.295
We're gonna make a food application
where we bring in an API from AWS.

47
00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:34.904
And we work with that API to
generate dynamic pages and data.

48
00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:38.126
We're gonna create reusable components.

49
00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:42.199
We're gonna make components
that can be encapsulated and

50
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.952
be reused throughout an application.

51
00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:49.948
And we're gonna use Composition API in
Nuxt at the end of the day, so I'm gonna

52
00:02:49.948 --> 00:02:54.582
show you what it takes to work with
Composition and API in Nuxt right now.

53
00:02:54.582 --> 00:03:00.541
As we're kind of getting Nuxt settled
into this new Composition API world.

54
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:06.554
And some of the gotchas that you should
be aware of as you're working with that.

55
00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:10.212
So here are the projects that we're
gonna be building through the day.

56
00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:14.898
For the warm up, and by warm up, I mean
like for the first hour or so maybe more,

57
00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:19.177
we're gonna build a game and
this game is going to be very, very silly.

58
00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:23.879
But the thing about games that I
really like is that you really able to

59
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.612
focus on state management in the game.

60
00:03:26.612 --> 00:03:29.703
There's a ton of state that
you're focusing on when you

61
00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:34.328
track what people's scores are and where
they are in the game and things like that.

62
00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:39.587
So it's actually a really good use
case for building an application.

63
00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:41.844
Then we're gonna do
a more common use case,

64
00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:44.475
we're gonna create a food
ordering application.

65
00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:51.334
So like Eat 24 or Doordash, or
one of those kind of thing.

66
00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:54.961
But it's our own, and
it will also have bad puns.

67
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:57.504
We're going to create
dynamic pages from API data.

68
00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.263
We're gonna use slots where
you're gonna use cart logic.

69
00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:02.755
We're even gonna cover
validation at the very end.

70
00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:05.320
And then the last thing we'll do,

71
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.906
is we'll go over Composition API in
Nuxt and show you how to get all sorted.

72
00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:15.002
So the first thing that we're going over
is that warm up that will be done with

73
00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:15.647
Vue-cli.

74
00:04:15.647 --> 00:04:18.628
The second thing that we're
gonna go over is gonna use Nuxt.

75
00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:21.892
And the last thing we'll use Nuxt as well.

76
00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:25.647
So, if you are curious where
to find all of the resources,

77
00:04:25.647 --> 00:04:27.957
here is a link to all the resources.

78
00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:32.673
It's SGitHub, adras,
building-web-apps-with-vue.

79
00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:37.157
In this repo, you will find a bunch
of problems and solutions and

80
00:04:37.157 --> 00:04:38.995
problems and solutions.

81
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:43.050
We will also see a bunch of
resources that we're gonna use.

82
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.456
So as we come up here,

83
00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:49.094
I'm gonna go through all of the tools
that I'm using for all of these.

84
00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:53.176
It has all of the slides,
they all have the same password of Vue.

85
00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:55.994
And then we have all of these
directories listings so

86
00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:58.888
that you can see how we're
building everything out.

87
00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:02.563
For the game application,
we have the game resources directory,

88
00:05:02.563 --> 00:05:06.251
which as you might assume,
has all of the resources for this game.

89
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.254
Then we have the game problem and

90
00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:13.383
solution because I'm gonna give you an
exercise so that you get used to building.

91
00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:16.098
For the food application,
we have a number of resources and

92
00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:18.665
we're gonna spend more time
on that food application.

93
00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:23.067
So we have a number of exercises
through the day, problem and solution,

94
00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:25.894
problem, solution, problem and solution.

95
00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:30.875
And then for the Composition API,
we have the start and the solution for

96
00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:32.127
you to check out.

97
00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:37.061
We're not gonna cover how to
build an API in this course.

98
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:42.827
But I did write a gigantic guide that
shows you how to set up an API with AWS,

99
00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:45.067
and Lambda, and Dynamo dB.

100
00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:49.964
So if you're curious about that piece,
I've given you some resources for

101
00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:52.617
you to continue your journey learning.

102
00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:57.342
In terms of tools, I'm gonna be using
VS code through most of this course.

103
00:05:57.342 --> 00:06:00.832
My terminal is hyper and
I use this thing called hyper power,

104
00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:05.298
which sprays particles everywhere, and
I have some bash aliases that I can.

105
00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:09.609
I wrote an article about how I set
them up, I can link them up here.

106
00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:12.941
There are also Vue chrome devtools.

107
00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:16.360
You'll see those pop up as I'm using Vue.

108
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.240
There's going to be a little
v that will be highlighted as

109
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.403
I'm using the Vue chrome devtools.

110
00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:27.393
Right now there's a version
of the chrome devtools,

111
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:29.528
that's a number three beta release.

112
00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:34.035
We're not gonna use that in this course,
because it doesn't connect to Nuxt yet.

113
00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:36.921
So we're gonna use the older
version of the chrome devtools.

114
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:42.231
But if you watched the other course, it
has a link to the Vue 3 chrome devtools.

115
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.458
If you're watching this a little
bit further in the future,

116
00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:46.734
they will merge right?

117
00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:51.355
And we will come back to that stable
release of Vue chrome devtools.

118
00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:59.357
I'm going to be using some snippets that
I've built called Vue VS code snippets.

119
00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:03.645
I mean, I made these but I really enjoy
working with them because they help me

120
00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:06.125
spit out boilerplate code really quickly.

121
00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.953
And you can see when
I'm working with this,

122
00:07:08.953 --> 00:07:12.169
how fast I'm able to work
with this application.

123
00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.808
I did add in some Vue 3 and
Composition API snippets.

124
00:07:16.808 --> 00:07:18.602
So I now have support for that.

125
00:07:18.602 --> 00:07:22.485
We have TypeScript support as well and
SASS and LESS.

126
00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:26.502
And you can see there's kind of
documentation for all of these snippets.

127
00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:30.422
There's template, script,
and all of these snippets.

128
00:07:30.422 --> 00:07:34.148
Vue Composition API, Vuex, Vue Router.

129
00:07:34.148 --> 00:07:36.764
Vue Config, Nuxt Config.

130
00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:41.180
But also VSCode, if you start to type,
VSCode will give you some hints, and

131
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.669
you can see that as we're working with it.

132
00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:46.679
It's not required that you use these, but

133
00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:51.450
just if you're curious how I'm working so
quickly with that code.

134
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.728
My VS code theme is NightOwl.

135
00:07:53.728 --> 00:07:57.522
That's another thing that I
built was this VS Code theme.

136
00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:00.018
So you'll see my syntax
highlighting does that.

137
00:08:00.018 --> 00:08:01.798
I also use font ligatures.

138
00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:07.824
So you'll see, instead of three lines for
an equals, you'll see three lines.

139
00:08:07.824 --> 00:08:11.854
And I'll show you that as soon as
I get working inside the code.

140
00:08:11.854 --> 00:08:15.801
I mentioned the hyper and
hyperpower for the particles.

141
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:23.810
I'm using a command line tool called hub
to create repos from my command line.

142
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.913
So you'll see me do that a couple
of times during this course.

143
00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:31.589
I'll create a private repo
from the command line and

144
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.253
then it will exist on GitHub.

145
00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:38.383
Here is the article for
all of my bash aliases I mentioned before.

146
00:08:38.383 --> 00:08:42.912
And I'm using a thing called snippets
lab to gather snippets that I reuse for

147
00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:44.622
multiple projects as well.

148
00:08:44.622 --> 00:08:46.718
And I'll explain that when we dive in.
