00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:05.772
So, our problem was to create the footer
and create the restaurants page and

2
00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.720
kind of link everything up, right,put
the restaurants page in the nav, and

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.610
then also add that grid
to the restaurants page.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.035
So if we go to where we're at now,
we've got home and restaurants.

5
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.919
We've got a page for restaurants,
right now the restaurants looks goofy.

6
00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.970
Don't worry,
we're gonna fix that in just a minute.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.600
We also have a sticky footer.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.930
And that sticky footer is on each page.

9
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.850
And even if we had not so
much information, it would stay down.

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.100
It used to take a lot
of styles to do that.

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.860
But now with Flexbox it's not so hard.

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.303
Okay, so let's check out what we
did in order to make that work.

13
00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:52.438
What we did was,
we added in a new li with that next link.

14
00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:56.216
And this one doesn't have an exact,
it just says, to restaurants and

15
00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.380
then goes to restaurants.

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.910
We added a restaurants page,
I should mention also, I'm using

17
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.870
mean class container for every single
page just to keep my styles in order.

18
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.349
And I'm also gonna add
the name of the page,

19
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:14.560
as one of the pieces of the styling here.

20
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.776
So, we've got that at restaurants,

21
00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:23.715
we've got our restaurant info, and
then we also have our app footer.

22
00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:28.356
And our footer I mentioned before if
we make sure that it says footer and

23
00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:34.410
uses the footer tag, it will display
the correct information the correct way.

24
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.270
So we added the footer.

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.230
And in order to actually display
the footer, what we did was we went into

26
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.490
that defaults file and we put the footer
at the bottom outside of the content.

27
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.860
So we imported the footer and add it here.

28
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.390
And then we added it up here as well.

29
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.290
And now it will persist on every single
page because that default.view is

30
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.580
really powerful.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.560
So, now we can be able to show this grid,
we're using this grid as

32
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.555
a reusable component between the home and
the restaurants page.

33
00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:08.026
So let's make sure to check that off.
