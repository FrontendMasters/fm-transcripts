00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.296
We have our final exercise,
our composition API problem one.

2
00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:10.247
Create a page similar to the index page.

3
00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:15.302
So take that comp API, compapi-start,
create a page with a list.

4
00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:18.929
And show it in the page and
add that page to the menu.

5
00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:26.520
Also create a method to show a display and
the clicked list item in an alert.

6
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.600
And I'll show you what I mean by that,
because that sounds like a lot.

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.140
So I've deployed this
composition API demo.

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.027
I have this increased count
here just like we had before.

9
00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.969
And then I have our taco friends page.

10
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.604
So in our taco friend's page,
we have Sarah likes all the tacos,

11
00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:49.770
Brian Holt likes whiskey more than tacos.

12
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.800
Brian, Shirley Wu likes tacos
as much as Wonder Woman.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.540
So you wanna click on one of these friends
and have it execute something like this.

14
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.350
Brian Holt likes whiskey more than tacos.

15
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.520
So you wanna make a list.

16
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.598
You can use ref, or
you can use reactive, it's up to you.

17
00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:11.809
But you wanna execute a function
where if you click something,

18
00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:14.682
it's actually alerting that to the page.
