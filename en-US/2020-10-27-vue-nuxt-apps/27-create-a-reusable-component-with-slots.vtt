WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.343 --> 00:00:06.759
So we put the content
into the dynamic page.

2
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.708
I hope you had a little bit of
fun putting this on the page,

3
00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.925
because you can actually make
the page look however you want.

4
00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:18.632
Once you have that object, you could
really create multiple kinds of layouts.

5
00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:21.306
You could put things all over the place.

6
00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:26.169
We're creating a Nuxt food app this way,
but you could see if you wanted to

7
00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.443
create a new app of your own, you can make
any design or layout that you so chose.

8
00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:34.826
And you could even put it in
that layouts area, right?

9
00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:39.232
We could make a completely different
layout for that dynamic page.

10
00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:43.934
The next thing that we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a Toast component

11
00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:44.765
with a slot.

12
00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:49.168
We're gonna create a really simple,
simple toast component.

13
00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:55.186
And the reason we're gonna do that is
if we look back at our Nuxt food app,

14
00:00:55.186 --> 00:01:02.308
like if I refresh here, let's go back to
Restaurants, let's go to Soup Dumplings.

15
00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:09.712
If I add something to the cart, I want
to know that something happened, right?

16
00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.408
I'm going to get like a little
number here, but I also want to

17
00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:17.922
know somewhere on the page like that
I actually added something to a cart.

18
00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:21.756
So the next thing that we're gonna do is
we're gonna create this toast component,

19
00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:25.397
but we're gonna create it in such a way
that we can reuse it over and over again.

20
00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:29.511
And we talked a bit about slots,
and slots are really great for

21
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.663
reusable components or logic.

22
00:01:31.663 --> 00:01:34.230
They're really good for
plopping in a bit of content.

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.615
So, a toast is a good example
of something like this,

24
00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.716
a modal is a good example
of something like this.

25
00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:44.170
It's good for adding content quickly
to a similar component or unit.

26
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.675
I might wanna style them all the same, but

27
00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:49.762
just add different types
of content to that thing.

28
00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:54.935
So, it can be used for
composition of multiple things.

29
00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:58.642
Name slots exist for
more complex information.

30
00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:01.616
In my previous course It
talks about name slots, and

31
00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:06.154
I used a couple of different examples,
like I made a taco blog with taco if some.

32
00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:08.757
If you want further details,
you can go back to that course,

33
00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:12.345
we're not going to use named slots today,
we're just going to use a default slot.

34
00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:16.028
But if you wanted to just check
out some of that other material,

35
00:02:16.028 --> 00:02:18.401
you can check it out in the other course.

36
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:26.356
So, let's go back, and we're gonna
make a new component called AppToast.

37
00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:30.205
And we're gonna make sure that
it's not in this directory but

38
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:32.583
rather in the components directory.

39
00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:38.323
Here we're gonna save the base, and
you're like a V base expert now.

40
00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:41.793
We're going to say div class toast.

41
00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:46.519
In real applications we'd
probably style all of the toast

42
00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.902
component inside this scoped area here.

43
00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.146
But for the purposes of demonstration,

44
00:02:52.146 --> 00:02:55.122
I've loaded all of the styles
already in main.css.

45
00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:57.966
So here,
this is a very simple component, right?

46
00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:05.328
We're going to just put slot,
and then, not scott, slot.

47
00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:09.143
And so we're going to pass in
a little bit of information there.

48
00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:14.476
We're going to go back to our ID,
our underscore ID page.

49
00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:18.182
I'm going to collapse some
of these sections, but

50
00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:22.411
I'm going to open this section
with all of these details.

51
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:27.085
Because inside this section,
which was kind of laid out at the top,

52
00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.227
I want to add in that AppToast.

53
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.086
And I'm going to parse something
into this AppToast, so

54
00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:36.931
I'm gonna leave it empty for now.

55
00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:40.030
I also have to import.

56
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.651
You can start to see why these
snippets are kind of helpful,

57
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:45.835
like I'm doing that a lot, right?

58
00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:49.771
I'm adding in this component over and
over and over again, and

59
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.973
I'm saying like, okay,
the name, name, name.

60
00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:57.527
So that's kind of repetitive and
those pieces can be helpful for that.

61
00:03:58.597 --> 00:04:04.487
No, go back here,here,

62
00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:09.585
here, here, toast.

63
00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:14.320
Now we're adding in the toast, and
so I've got my app toast component,

64
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.671
and then I'm also going to
say something in there.

65
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:20.747
Like I want to let the user
know that order was submitted.

66
00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:26.015
So I'm going to say order submitted,
and then wind break and

67
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:31.604
then say we want probably want to
give them someplace else to go.

68
00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:36.951
So like check out more restaurants,

69
00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:41.607
and then I'm gonna say vnuxtl,

70
00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:46.444
so that gives me that link thing.

71
00:04:46.444 --> 00:04:55.289
I'm gonna throw restaurants in here,
and here.

72
00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.246
So right now, if we go to the page, it
will just be chillin on the page, which we

73
00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:05.525
don't want it always chillin on the page
even if we haven't submitted something.

74
00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:09.125
So what we want to do is we didn't
want to do a nice V if, but

75
00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:12.059
we also have to give it
something to V if off of.

76
00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:17.049
So here, we're gonna say,
if cart submitted,

77
00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:20.942
and we want to give it a false at first,

78
00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:25.463
we wanna say it's not submitted right now.

79
00:05:25.463 --> 00:05:29.752
And we're going to say, for

80
00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:35.307
this toast, v-if cart submitted.

81
00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:38.728
So now it should not be there at first.

82
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:43.722
And what we want to do is once we click
that button, then it says the toast,

83
00:05:43.722 --> 00:05:45.991
right then it gives us the toast.

84
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:47.322
So where is our button?

85
00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:49.530
Our button is right here.

86
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.060
This button is gonna get an at
click handler of AddToCart

87
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.602
because that's really what
primarily it's gonna do.

88
00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:04.099
So we're gonna make sure that
we're able to add to the cart.

89
00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.715
I'm gonna collapse this computed for
a moment.

90
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:15.295
And say the method, and

91
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:20.727
we're gonna say AddToCart.

92
00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:24.507
The first thing that we're gonna
do when we're adding to that cart,

93
00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:27.388
is we're gonna say cart submitted is true,
right?

94
00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:33.028
So we're gonna say this
.cart submitted equals true,

95
00:06:33.028 --> 00:06:37.829
not minus true equals true, equals true.

96
00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:43.905
And so we're able to kind of put,
say all right, if we click that button and

97
00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:49.706
we know that it's submitting to the cart,
then we're all good there.

98
00:06:49.706 --> 00:06:53.752
But we also want to gather
a lot of the stuff that we

99
00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:58.208
are gonna add to the cart and
put that inside of there.

100
00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:04.308
Now, right now I have like a way that I
named some of these things like count.

101
00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:08.423
And then there is also
like combined price,

102
00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:12.771
and we also wanna current
item to get the item.

103
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:17.937
So, we could feasibly destructure and
add a bunch of things at once, but

104
00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:23.358
since the form output that we're currently
trying to gather is all just like

105
00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:29.398
the naming is a little bit different, it
doesn't totally make it super efficient.

106
00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:36.782
Because I want to say like item
is this .currentItem .item,

107
00:07:36.782 --> 00:07:42.749
but count is this .count,
and so on and so forth.

108
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:49.076
So I'm just gonna write
these as like options is,

109
00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:53.908
oops, items is this.item options.

110
00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:59.152
And addOns is this.itemaddOns,

111
00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:04.395
thank you VS code, combinedPrice

112
00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:09.289
equals this.combinedPrice.

113
00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:13.554
Now, you might have guessed what we're
going to do next, what we're going to do

114
00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:17.900
next is actually add this to a cart, but
we want the store to hold the cart, right?

115
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.108
So, basically what we want this
method of add to cart to do

116
00:08:23.108 --> 00:08:28.976
is to not just say this
.cartSubmitted true, which now works.

117
00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.729
So let's go check that out.

118
00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:33.045
Let's go over here.

119
00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:36.497
We'll refresh the page,
I will say Add to cart, and

120
00:08:36.497 --> 00:08:38.939
now you see that order is submitted.

121
00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:42.715
So the next thing that we want
to do is add to that cart, but

122
00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:45.257
first let's go back to our to do list.

123
00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:48.877
So we wanted to create a reusable
toast component with a slot, so

124
00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:50.090
that's what we did.
