WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.100
So we have that app select working.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.770
We have it reporting to our parent, but
we don't have it filtering quite yet.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.610
So that's the next step here.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.892
So I'm gonna go back, And
we're gonna make a computed property.

5
00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:21.540
And we're gonna call that
filtered restaurants.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.358
So we're gonna say, filteredRestaurants().

7
00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:32.014
But we don't have the food data
brought in from the store yet,

8
00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:36.073
we need to have actually bring the food
data in order to, cuz right now,

9
00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:38.960
this app restaurant
info is pretty brittle.

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.900
It's bringing in the food
data from restaurants.

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.380
But let's say there's another page that
has different kinda restaurants, or

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.460
like you have a different zip code
that has different information, or

13
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.230
you wanna check multiple things.

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.970
Right now,
it's like hard coded to just that one bit.

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.380
And I'm not able to filter through it,
or use it for different things.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.800
So we're gonna change that,
we're gonna bring the data in as a prop.

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.440
And instead, control it from the parent,
we sort of how we did with the app,

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.680
select, so we're gonna say, the map state.

19
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.713
And I'm going to bring this

20
00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:19.736
property into the computed area,

21
00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:24.417
and we're gonna say fooddata,

22
00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.120
And then, the filtered restaurants.

23
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.119
What we're gonna do, is we're gonna say if

24
00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.445
(this.selectedRestaurant), so

25
00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:44.255
if there's something there,
then what we wanna do

26
00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:50.082
is we wanna return
this.fooddata.filter(el.

27
00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:54.236
And inside that el, we want to make sure
that we're not matching exactly like,

28
00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:58.142
we did that a little bit in the last
course where we made sure that we weren't

29
00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:02.762
matching exactly for capitalization, it
could be uppercase, it could be lowercase.

30
00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:07.230
We wanna make sure that it's
not checking the exact thing,

31
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.550
and then, it can be either one.

32
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.400
So el.name.toLowerCase.

33
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.032
There's a couple different
ways of doing this.

34
00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:19.235
In the last one, I used a regex, and
this one, I'm just making it lowercase,

35
00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:22.120
which is fine,
cuz we're just really using it here.

36
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.183
So we're gonna return name.includes,

37
00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:33.070
And then, (this.selectedRestaurant).

38
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.855
Otherwise, we're just gonna
return this.fooddata.

39
00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:45.130
All right, let's see what we got here.

40
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.155
We're not using it yet.

41
00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:51.029
[LAUGH] So what we need to do,
well, actually, I mean,

42
00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:56.320
let's use the filtered data,
filtered restaurants.

43
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.970
So in their app restaurant info,
we are going to go in here,

44
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.030
and so far, we're just using food data.

45
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.870
And I mentioned yesterday, or I mentioned
two days ago in the other course,

46
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.590
that in terms of this, the way that
we build this, because it's not

47
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.220
item in items, and it's not static that,
I can name this anything, and

48
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.470
I don't have to update store,
and menu items, and everything.

49
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.057
So I can just update that
one piece of information.

50
00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:31.131
I no longer need this map state,
I no longer need this food data,

51
00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:34.954
but I do need a prop, and in that prop, so

52
00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:40.710
what I need in props,
is I need something like a data source.

53
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.928
And then, whoops, data source,
and the type will either be

54
00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:53.560
array or object.

55
00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:03.010
And we won't have a default, and
this, did I met messed up somehow,

56
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.920
let me see, let's back.

57
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.030
Okay, I'm not sure what I did,
but it's back.

58
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.544
And then, here, instead of the food data,
we can say data source.

59
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:20.080
So let's try this.

60
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.230
We're gonna go in here, and
we're gonna say, data source,

61
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.630
because that's the prop
that we're passing in.

62
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.910
And we're gonna say, filtered restaurants.

63
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.650
So let's take a look.

64
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.660
If we come back here, and
we select a cuisine, or real pizza work,

65
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.780
all that and dimsum,
talk about eating tacos.

66
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.740
So now, we're able to filter the grid.

67
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.520
That's amazing.

68
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.330
You might have seen a catch, I didn't
do the same thing for the homepage.

69
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.960
Right now, on the homepage,
everything's probably broken,

70
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.920
because we're not passing anything
into that data source that we need to.

71
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.470
So let's go back to the homepage,
and make sure that we fix that.

72
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.740
So in the homepage,
we've just got app restaurant info, and

73
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.800
we're not passing in the food data.

74
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.000
So we need to say, the map state,
and we're going to

75
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.678
come here, and we should say,

76
00:05:20.678 --> 00:05:25.710
food data, cool.

77
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.240
Actually, I usually do components first,
and then, computed ordering.

78
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.690
And so, now,
we should be able to come back up.

79
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.740
I think I didn't save something.

80
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.890
Come back here.

81
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.900
I didn't pass it in.

82
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.109
That's goofy.

83
00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.250
So that's what it looks
like when it's broken.

84
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.200
So we've got the data source, and

85
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.207
we're gonna pass in the food data.

86
00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:57.970
Let's save that, and then, go back over.

87
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.580
And now, it's, we have all of this.

88
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.680
We have our restaurants.

89
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.990
This is now filtering correctly.

90
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.160
So it's actually much more flexible.

91
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.670
We have our app slick
that we can use anywhere.

92
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.230
We have our filtered grid,
which we can also use anywhere,

93
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.200
and we can reuse that component, all the
live long day for multiple tasks, as well.

94
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.360
So it's much more flexible.

95
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.950
I'm gonna get rid of this goofy pre-tag,
[LAUGH].

96
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.640
And here we go.

97
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.940
Let's go see if we deployed correctly.

98
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.530
Site deploy failed.

99
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.230
I didn't do the yarn add node,
sass, sass loader piece.

100
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.460
So let's go back to our code we can save,
and

101
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.250
then, we're gonna go over to our terminal.

102
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:54.552
And in the same spot, we have,
says, where we are, okay.

103
00:06:54.552 --> 00:07:01.049
We got yarn add, node, sass, sass loader.

104
00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:15.655
And I have some bash, things to
allow me to quickly add things so

105
00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:21.786
gi add in sass, loader, and
that will both say git add dash a and

106
00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:27.222
git commit dash M, and then,
GM will push it, and now,

107
00:07:27.222 --> 00:07:32.350
we'll wait for that to build,
and see if it builds.
