00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.392
That was a lot we covered so
much in that territory.

2
00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:08.690
What we didn't do that we mentioned
before was submit payments.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.533
So if you want to take this a step
further and do a bonus exercise,

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.679
you can set up payments with Stripe and
Serverless.

5
00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.441
I deployed with netlify, if you wanna
create a function to submit to Stripe,

6
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.090
you can create a function
in a functions folder.

7
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.074
With functions/index.js and
in netlify.toml [build] ,functions =

8
00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:34.352
"functions", and that will
immediately give you a Serverless

9
00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:38.889
function that you can execute,
right inside of that same codebase.

10
00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:42.523
I have a talk that walks you
through how to set all of this up,

11
00:00:42.523 --> 00:00:46.480
we have stripe docs that show you
how to build this integration.

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.356
I tend to use the Vue Stripe Elements Plus
as a piece of a component

13
00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:53.990
that you can use to hook into that.

14
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.148
And I have an example all set up for you,

15
00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:01.802
that does a whole ecommerce site,

16
00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:07.346
it has a kind of similar
experience to the next app but

17
00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:13.530
then it also allows you to,
submit to Stripe as part of it.

18
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.800
So here's is the cart and then I have
this view Stripe Elements Plus Component,

19
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.666
and it goes to Stripe with a testing
key all of the code is here on

20
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.310
Github if you want to explore it.

21
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.799
This should [LAUGH] have gone to,
I think it's the other link in here.

22
00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.422
If we go here, open source in Github,
that's where the link is, and

23
00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:39.425
you can check out all of the code here.

24
00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:42.790
And get started and
look at all of these functions and

25
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.170
see how you would hook that
up with a Stripe payment.
