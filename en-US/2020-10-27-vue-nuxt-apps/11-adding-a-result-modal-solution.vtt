00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's go over the solution
to this exercise.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.340
So we looked at how we could
go through and create this

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.840
bigger and
see if we can win the game and we won.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.370
Let's play again and we start over again.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.150
Let's check out the code.

6
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.170
So if you needed to find it It is
the game solution in the repo.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.760
So if we look at the code, we have
that game, start Vf uiState _start.

8
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.640
And that's the same as it used to be.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.200
But we've added in a different thing for
this section that we added here.

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.310
So instead of the V else because
that takes all conditions,

11
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.265
we're gonna say V elsif.

12
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:46.970
Uistate is character chosen, so
that it's only that state, and

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.710
then we'll put the VLs else
on game state finished.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.138
So we're only gonna show that V else.

15
00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:57.340
We're only gonna show that game state
finish if these two are not true

16
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.870
if we look at the game state finish,
we are bringing in the UI state.

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.560
And you could have done it
a couple of ways, right?

18
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.970
You could have use map state,

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.320
you could have use computer
property called the UI state and

20
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.880
said this return this.store.state.ui
state either one is fine and correct.

21
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.900
So, one thing we wanna do is we
wanna show a conditional for

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.430
if the UI state one you show
you one If not you lost.

23
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.360
You could have also put these
on the H tos it's up to you.

24
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.530
So it's inside that modal.

25
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.880
Then we placed that face in the face icon
that we had in the game resources in here.

26
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.350
And you had two options.

27
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.580
You could say the path class, we were
gonna bind that class to won or lost.

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.210
So if the UI state is lost, then we're
gonna create a class called frown and

29
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.160
turn it upside down with that class.

30
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.130
Otherwise it won't have the frown
class and it'll just be normal.

31
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.950
And we do need to ,there's a couple
different ways of doing this.

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.780
We do need to also add cls3,
that's a class that was already using.

33
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.915
So I could do this here.

34
00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:14.385
Or I could have wrapped this in a G tag
which is a group and changed it with the G

35
00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:21.045
tag and then I wouldn't have had to add
this extra parameter to the bound class.

36
00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:27.660
We also have a button that says add,
click, restart.

37
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.920
And you could have named it whatever you
like, in methods, we have restart and

38
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.828
it says this dot store
commit restart game.

39
00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:37.830
So we're gonna go up to the store and
we're gonna make sure to change the game

40
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.770
from there because that's where
all of the game logic is.

41
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.420
In that store, we have a restart game and
we're passing the state.

42
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.000
We say the UI state is start again.

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.510
So we wanna make sure we set it back to
start we also need to reset two things.

44
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.910
The score we need to reset to zero and

45
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.460
we also need to reset
the question index back to zero.

46
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.640
And so that will restart the game and
allow us to play fresh.

47
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.620
So that is all of the things that you
need to kind of restart this game here.

48
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.430
You might have noticed
one extra thing though.

49
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.620
If we go back to our alien zombie game,
I'm goinna try to lose here.

50
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.130
Pick an artist.

51
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.750
I'm gonna say Woofgang Puck,
cause I know that that's wrong.

52
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.570
I'm actually gonna start showing
this zombie, based on whether or

53
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.500
not I'm winning or losing.

54
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.040
So this is a little bit of extra credit.

55
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.590
If you're losing you're gonna
slowly have this face melt off,

56
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.000
so I'm gonna have another slide for this.

57
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.010
So make the characters face melt off and
expose the zombie.

58
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.720
So if you wanna take it a step further,
when you're done with this

59
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.880
piece of the course,
you can use clip paths that are set up.

60
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.800
They're already set up for you in deaths.

61
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.070
If we were working with SVG, you can think
of we know we have this base SVG here.

62
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.930
In here, you can think of
deaths as like a staging area.

63
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.660
If you did theatre,
it's they're waiting backstage.

64
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.225
That's like a bunch of stuff that we're
not gonna really use inside the SPVG

65
00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:21.505
immediately it's stuff that you're
like hold this for use later.

66
00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:24.195
And inside here we have some clip paths.

67
00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:27.535
We have the bottom clip path and
the top clip path.

68
00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:35.175
And we're going to add the zombie and
add some character clips for that.

69
00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:39.655
I wrote this article called masking
versus clipping when to use each and

70
00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:45.300
it goes over what CSS and
SVG masks and clip paths are.

71
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.370
This is extra credit because it's not
necessary for writing applications, but if

72
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.622
you wanna start to make games like this,
sometimes we wanna hide, and show things.

73
00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:59.580
And this clip paths can be
really powerful for hiding, and

74
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.590
showing bits of information.

75
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.670
But are helpful to the user.

76
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.660
So that's an extra thing that
you can do use gsap to control

77
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.480
the animation with a watcher kind of like
we did with that needle for the score.

78
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.540
So the solution is in
the game solution and

79
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.890
the repo including the extra credit
if you wanted to check it out.

80
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.390
Awesome.
