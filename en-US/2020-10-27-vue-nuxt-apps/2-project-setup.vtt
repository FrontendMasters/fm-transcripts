WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.789
So, we're going to.

2
00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:08.242
If you don't have Vue CLI installed
already, you're gonna npm install -g,

3
00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:13.539
that's global, @vue/cli, or
yarn global add @vue/cli.

4
00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.137
And then, from there I'm gonna
call it vue create aliengame, but

5
00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:19.740
you could call it whatever you want.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.545
So if I go into my terminal and
I say, vue create aliengame.

7
00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.785
I have a bunch of different options.

8
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.033
You might have seen these
in the other course,

9
00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.736
that we can pick different options,
we can also manually select features.

10
00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:41.430
I'm gonna manually select some features,
I want these.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.290
And I can select things based on
whether I'm hitting spacebar or not, so

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.320
we're gonna just start off
with something like this.

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.990
I'm gonna use node-sass,
I'm gonna use package.json.

14
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.700
I'm not gonna set it for a future project.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.720
And now it's going to
initialize that repository

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.070
in that directory that I started in.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.491
I should make the drum roll [SOUND], and

18
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:11.148
then we can go [SOUND]
when it's done [LAUGH].

19
00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:11.793
Cool.

20
00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:16.931
So, while it's doing that, we can
talk through the guide to resources.

21
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:20.710
I wrote out what each one of these are,
in case you forget later.

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.382
And in this Resources folder,
we have the alienzombie source.svg,

23
00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:30.303
that's that original SVG that you
saw before, before it was optimized.

24
00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:36.986
You can go to SVGOMG by Jake Archibald,
that is a great way to optimize an SVG.

25
00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:39.470
And what's really nice is,
you use a service workers.

26
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.250
So, if you go to it, and at any point in
time, let's say you're on a plane later,

27
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.660
you still have access to it later,
that's really cool.

28
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.822
We have the questions.js,
which were the questions for the game.

29
00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:55.919
The main.scss,
which is all of the base css.

30
00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:58.317
The intro,
which is the introduction modal.

31
00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:01.928
The Components folder,
which was all of those grouped components.

32
00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:04.130
And the Graphics folder,
which are all of the graphics.

33
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.980
Let's check out where we are, great.

34
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.900
It even tells us where
we're supposed to go, so

35
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.122
I can say, cd aliengame,
and I can say yarn serve.

36
00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:19.131
So it's starting up a folder.

37
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:24.132
I'm gonna open up a new tab meanwhile,
and I'm gonnao open this in VS Code.

38
00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:33.700
And I'm gonna be switching things
around in my screen with shortcuts.

39
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.550
That's because I use this
tool called BetterSnapTool,

40
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.130
which allows me to kind of expand and
contract, and

41
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.320
move things into different sections
on my screen, which is really nice.

42
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.344
Okay, so, we're now on localhost.

43
00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:48.196
And notice that there's
also a network one,

44
00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:51.150
which is really nice if you
need to check responsive.

45
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.140
So, when we first start up any Vue
application, here's what we will have.

46
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.510
What's really nice about it is,

47
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.660
it immediately sets up a component and
things like that for us, so

48
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.020
we can kinda see some nice defaults,
and I'll show you what I mean here.

49
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.721
So, if we look into this index.html file,

50
00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:12.230
we'll see a pretty standard
index.html file, right?

51
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.740
We've got some meta tags.

52
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.877
We've got some link tags.

53
00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:19.330
You could see where you might need to add
a font, which we'll do in just a moment.

54
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.920
And we also have things that are static,
like a favicon.

55
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.410
Then, if we open the Source folder,
we have things like our Assets folder.

56
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.877
Our Assets folder can
hold things like images,

57
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:36.177
it can hold things like global styles,
it can hold your typical assets.

58
00:03:36.177 --> 00:03:38.511
We also have a Components folder.

59
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:42.616
And, in that Components folder
we have that HelloWorld.vue,

60
00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:48.080
which you saw is the bottom part of that
page, where we have all of the links.

61
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.940
So you can immediately see what
a component might look like.

62
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.920
And it's being brought into this app.

63
00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.850
So you can see that HelloWorld right here,
and that is brought in by that import of

64
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.920
the Components folder of HelloWorld,
and then this Components of HelloWorld.

65
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.410
This name app is optional.

66
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.370
It's not required to run the application.

67
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.534
If you look in the Vue Style Guide
you can see that,

68
00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:18.509
anything that is kind of like
a global style for the application,

69
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.634
either needs to be put in
something like a main dot.

70
00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:26.495
It's not required, but
it's highly suggested that you

71
00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:31.962
either put it in a main.scss folder,
or main.scss in Assets,

72
00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:35.445
or you put it at that top level app.vue.

73
00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:39.710
So you can see some of that top
level app.vue that is not scoped,

74
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.675
that goes for the entire application.

75
00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:47.915
Now, if you're using it inside of
a component like this HelloWorld,

76
00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:52.460
that's where you would
start using scoped styles.

77
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.420
So it limits this CSS
to this component only.

78
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.210
Then, in the Store we
have this index.js file.

79
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.950
You see that we're importing Vue,
we're importing Vuex.

80
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.290
We have that export default
new Vuex.Store, and

81
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.030
then we've got state, mutations,
actions, modules, things like that.

82
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.480
So we have everything set up for
us, this kind of boilerplate.

83
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.520
If you forget to load Vuex,
and part of the CLI, or

84
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.740
you have an existing project, and you're
bringing in Vuex, you can manually add it.

85
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.052
What you would do is,
you go into this main.js file.

86
00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:42.840
You yarn add ,or npm-i Vuex, and
then you would import Store from Store.

87
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.560
And then you would add Store here.

88
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.335
This is using destructuring,
so really it's saying, Store.

89
00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.496
Sorry, my computer's a little bit slow.

90
00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:58.293
Store, Store, and
that is the equivalent to Store.

91
00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:01.052
Cool, but here it is all set up for us.

92
00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:05.489
Also, if you're bringing in a Store and
you don't have the boilerplate in my

93
00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:10.420
Vue Snippets, you can write v-store and
it will output this automatically for you.
