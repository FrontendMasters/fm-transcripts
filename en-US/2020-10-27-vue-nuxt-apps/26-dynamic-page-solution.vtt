WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.250
Let's go over where we've been,
where we're going.

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.871
We did pause on the deploy so
that we could check things out and

3
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.222
do a few other things.

4
00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:14.127
And we had to kind of re-instantiate
that deploy because I

5
00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:17.650
forgot to put in the yarn add node sass.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.980
But now it is fully deployed.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.450
And we have our Nuxt Food App.

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.080
It is now at food app
frontendmasters.netlifyapp.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.310
So that is fully deployed application,
and what's nice is,

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.460
you can see that this failed a couple of
times, but you can see all of the logs,

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.640
and if I wanted to roll back to
a previous version, I can with a click.

12
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.570
So that's pretty cool.

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.600
So we are done with the deploy.

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.010
We are also about to go over

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.590
the exercise of putting
the content into the dynamic page.

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.220
So let's check it out.

17
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.420
If we look at our Localhost,
here's what we've got.

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.140
We've got our soup dumplings, and
it's nice grid and we have our add-ons.

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.480
And this detail section,
it just makes this nice style for us.

20
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.730
I didn't do that.

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.680
[LAUGH] That's like an HTML spec thing.

22
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.360
So if we go look at that _id.view.

23
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.417
Let's look at all of the things
that we did to make that work.

24
00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:20.810
We have a few different sections.

25
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.000
We have that main container
that I mentioned before.

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.562
So we've got main container,
and we have a few sections.

27
00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:29.970
We have

28
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.340
section where we have all of our the kind
of like images and things like that.

29
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.544
And then we have our details,
and we have our options.

30
00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:45.510
If we look below, we have a container
with a bunch of grid template,

31
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.660
Pixels, and,1fr,
fr is like a fraction unit.

32
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.992
And then, we have image, detail, and

33
00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:58.481
options that are kind
of powering that grid.

34
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:03.358
Then if we expand these, for
this section we're doing that thing that

35
00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:07.819
we did a couple of other times
where we are binding the style, and

36
00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.028
we're passing in a template literal,
this like current item.image, we

37
00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:18.570
have access to that current item through
that filter that we created before.

38
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.042
So this is current item.

39
00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.630
And we're looping through there,
and we've got that current item.

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.862
So this is the one that we're
working with that image.

41
00:02:26.862 --> 00:02:30.170
And so
that first section which is our image.

42
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.230
Then we have our details, No VS code No.

43
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.900
We [LAUGH] have our details, where we have
our h1 for the current item, the price.

44
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.540
In this case we're saying price to fix to,

45
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.070
I'm showing the price using the price
a few different ways through the course.

46
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.640
That methods way is nice where
you can pass things through, but

47
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.570
you could also just pass $ sign.

48
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.590
If you made a computed property for
this, that's awesome as well.

49
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.510
We're also capturing quantity, and
like I said with the field sets,

50
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.765
we have a few of these field sets on
it makes that nice little border,

51
00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:11.825
if we go back around here we've got
that add-ons, this little border,

52
00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.895
that's just because I'm
using that field set.

53
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:19.025
And we are using that web aim
way of using field sets as well.

54
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:22.695
So we're binding all of these radios.

55
00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:29.535
We're using radios for options,
and the check boxes for

56
00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:35.530
add-ons, and the reason why there's
this distinction is for options.

57
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.650
Not everything has options.

58
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.200
So like only the Mexican food
where we have the tacos and

59
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.112
burritos and things where we really need
to decide if we're gonna get a burrito,

60
00:03:47.112 --> 00:03:52.400
that's polio or carnea sada or
alpa store or something like that.

61
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.330
We can't order a burrito without knowing
which one of those that is, whereas when

62
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.660
you're ordering some dimsum we have some
add-ons that are just literally add-ons.

63
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.349
We don't have any,
you are ordering that steamed dumpling but

64
00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.319
there's not the it's like a shrimp shuma,
there's no options.

65
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.391
So, we also have this kind of like,
we're making sure that we

66
00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:23.265
have the radio that can select just one,
and then we have the add-ons.

67
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.233
So, here if we go back the soup
dumplings have the add-ons, and

68
00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:33.975
we can select our add ons, but
if we go back to the restaurants,

69
00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:38.563
and we look at our case ideas,
we have options and add-ons.

70
00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:43.392
So that's a slight difference
between the two of them,

71
00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:48.423
I have to decide if I want a plane or
a carnea sada case idea,

72
00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:53.659
but if I want I can get guacamole and
people are the guy and

73
00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.725
well I shouldn't be able to use none but
you get the point.

74
00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:03.010
So we're working through all of that,
cool.
