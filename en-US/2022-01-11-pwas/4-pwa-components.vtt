00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.290
A PWA is typically based
on three main components.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.810
We have, first, a web app, okay?

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.617
And if you're here, I understand that you
know how to create a web app because that

4
00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:16.064
has nothing to do with PWA specifically.

5
00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:20.210
You can create the web app
with plain HTML, CSS and

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.670
JavaScript or using a build tool.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.639
It can be React, create React,
it can be Angular, it can be Next JS,

8
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.380
it can be anything you want.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.410
If it works in the browser, that's a web
app, okay, and we can still do that.

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.548
On top of that, we are going to start
working with something known as

11
00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:45.150
a Web App Manifest that is
actually simple, but powerful.

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.240
And we need to understand what's
going on behind this file.

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.810
And then we're going to talk
about the service worker.

14
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.279
So these are like layers that we
are adding one on top of the other.

15
00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:03.136
So how do you know if a URL is a PWA?

16
00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:07.335
Because so far, I mentioned a couple
of PWAs that we have out there,

17
00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:09.411
but how do you know if it's a PWA?

18
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:14.030
Well, some browsers will show you a hint,
okay?

19
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.529
But if you wanna get
the real technical answer,

20
00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:21.304
the solution that we have
right now is Lighthouse.

21
00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:26.580
Lighthouse, it's actually an open source
tool maintained by the Chrome team.

22
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.050
It's available as a CLI,
so it's available on NPM.

23
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.758
If you have Node JS installed,

24
00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:38.090
you can actually run Lighthouse from the
command line interface or within DevTools.

25
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.720
So you go to Chrome or Edge DevTools and
there is a Lighthouse tab there.

26
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.524
So you can actually use
Lighthouse from there and

27
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:52.730
it will test your website against
something known as a PWA criteria.

28
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.246
So there is a criteria that will tell
you if a website is or not a PWA.

29
00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:03.606
But remember that I mentioned
that we don't have a clear

30
00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:06.586
written in stone definition for PWA.

31
00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:09.511
Well, but each browser has a criteria, so

32
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:14.471
when you are passing that criteria
you will get installation support and

33
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:19.689
if you're not passing the criteria you
will have probably less abilities.

34
00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.796
So the criteria may change with time,
in fact,

35
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:26.380
in the past five years it has
changed a couple of times.

36
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.404
If you pass the criteria, so if your PWA,

37
00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:36.050
if your content passes the criteria,
it's officially a PWA.

38
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.510
Installation will be possible.

39
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.057
A hint for the user may appear,
such as the one we saw on Android or

40
00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:49.434
the little install badge that we
have in the Omnibox in Chrome,

41
00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:51.780
the Omnibox is the URL bar.

42
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.839
And also in the future, this is not
available today, in the future, maybe SEO

43
00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:01.686
and discoverability may be different
when you're passing the criteria.

44
00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:06.100
Such just maybe Google can actually render

45
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.520
a little icon when
a search result is a PWA.

46
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.629
Again, this is not happening right now.

47
00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.375
And when you pass the criteria
your content can get out

48
00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:23.030
of the browser's UI, so
you can actually be an app.
