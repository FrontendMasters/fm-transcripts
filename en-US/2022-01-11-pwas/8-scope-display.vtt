WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.337
We have a question about domains and
subdomains, and

2
00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:07.056
it's actually a good introduction for
the next property.

3
00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:13.198
So I'm going to probably answer the
question while writing the next property.

4
00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:15.302
The next property is called scope, okay?

5
00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:20.470
Scope defines actually the folder or
subfolder that

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.703
defines what's within the app and
what's outside of the app.

7
00:00:26.703 --> 00:00:28.422
So, let me try to explain that.

8
00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:33.087
First, most of the time 99%
of the PWAs are setting

9
00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:36.622
the scope as this, the current folder.

10
00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:42.269
So that means that, If you have a link

11
00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.487
here in your HTML to another HTML,
if it's in the scope,

12
00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:53.167
so if it's in the same folder,
the app will render that link.

13
00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.821
Our window will render that link.

14
00:00:55.821 --> 00:01:00.630
But if it's outside of the scope,
such as an external domain,

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.712
a different domain, or
a different folder, it will be rendered in

16
00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:10.825
some kind of a browser, and
we're going to see it in action later.

17
00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:14.408
The problem is with subdomains, and

18
00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:18.683
I'm going to make a broader question here,

19
00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:23.780
is that what happens if we
have a PWA basis planning?

20
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.951
It's URLs across different domains.

21
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:32.157
They can be sub-domains, or
different, sometimes country TLDs.

22
00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:36.305
Like you have a different TLD for
UK, another one for France.

23
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.497
Well, actually, this is a challenge, or

24
00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:44.210
let's say a limitation that we
have today in the PWA platform.

25
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.255
Each domain even if it's a sub domain,

26
00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:53.046
will always be treated
as an external origin.

27
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.140
So it's not going to be part of a PWA.

28
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.053
Even if you're pointing to the same
manifest, it doesn't matter.

29
00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:00.873
They will be different PWAs.

30
00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:05.843
So if you have different domains,
and the user will be able to install

31
00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:10.914
different apps, so you will end up
with duplicates probably, okay?

32
00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:12.958
And so you shouldn't do that.

33
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.738
It's actually a problem.

34
00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:19.295
So if you're creating,
if you're using dynamic DNS like

35
00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:24.132
star.yourdomain.com that is
pointing to different apps,

36
00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:29.247
like you are deep linking into
different IDs based on the domain,

37
00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:33.074
you will have infinite PWAs actually,
not one.

38
00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:37.611
So it's always a good idea to
keep everything under one domain.

39
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:41.741
What happens with logins,
like if you're using OAuth and

40
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:46.220
you have a different domain,
that's not actually a problem.

41
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.798
Okay, you can call that and
we will see it in action later, but

42
00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:53.809
it will actually open an inner browser.

43
00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:58.246
So for example, if you open Tinder,
and if you click Login,

44
00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:03.118
remember this is a PWA, if we try
to log in with Google, in Tinder,

45
00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:07.485
that goes to another domain
that is not under tinder.com.

46
00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:09.393
Well, this is what will happen.

47
00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:14.269
We have at the top,
like a URL bar that is not editable,

48
00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.451
so this is called an inner browser.

49
00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:21.638
So when you link within your
PWA to an external file,

50
00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:25.550
an external URL,
an inner browser will appear.

51
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.941
And this is not Safari.

52
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:28.341
I'm still in the Tinder app.

53
00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:33.787
So this is by default, automatic,
free in a browser that

54
00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:39.810
will get in a PWA on every platform,
Android, iOS or dekstop.

55
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.629
From here, you can open the browser,
you can share.

56
00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:50.952
Or if you hit Done, or if this URL in
a different domain goes back to my domain,

57
00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:57.242
like returning from the OAuth,
it will go back to the PWA.

58
00:03:57.242 --> 00:04:00.581
So it will close the browser
automatically, as if I hit Done.

59
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:05.565
If you have a link to an external URL,
an external domain,

60
00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:09.146
have in mind and in a browser will appear.

61
00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:13.738
And the user can go back,
or the user will get back

62
00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:18.676
automatically if that URL
goes back to your domain.

63
00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:22.149
So the question is about the start URL.

64
00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:26.349
Can the start URL be a different domain,
being subdomain or

65
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.455
a completely different TLD?

66
00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:29.447
The answer is no.

67
00:04:29.447 --> 00:04:34.028
The browsers today are checking
that the start URL must be

68
00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:38.140
within the same origin as
the web manifest itself.

69
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.152
If you have an absolute link
here to somewhere else,

70
00:04:42.152 --> 00:04:48.185
you're not passing the PWA criteria, and
the start URL may be ignored at all.

71
00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:49.559
So it's not gonna work.

72
00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:54.320
That's why multiorders
Xing PWAs is not something

73
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.648
that we have available these days.

74
00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:00.889
We have a question on the theme color.

75
00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.503
The spec, the web manifest spec,

76
00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:07.751
defines the metadata as a way
to define the theme color.

77
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:14.311
The theme color that we have in
the manifest is actually a fallback.

78
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.676
So in case this metatag is not present,

79
00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:21.490
it's going to use the one in the manifest
that is actually statically defined.

80
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.305
And also, the one that is in
the theme in the manifest,

81
00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:29.865
the theme color that is in the manifest,

82
00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:34.803
is actually useful for
when your app is still not ready.

83
00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:39.027
Think about this, when you open an app,
the app typically starts with a splash

84
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:41.847
screen, and
we're going to talk about that later.

85
00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:47.156
That splash screen will use
the theme color from your manifest,

86
00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:50.116
because the HTML is not loaded yet.

87
00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:51.627
So it's not really your metatag.

88
00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:57.505
So that's why it's always a good idea
to have the theme color on both places.

89
00:05:57.505 --> 00:05:58.708
Most of the time,

90
00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:04.012
you're going to see that the start URL
is also being used with some arguments.

91
00:06:04.012 --> 00:06:05.528
This is completely optional.

92
00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:10.344
But for example, something that is
common to see is that you can add

93
00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:14.128
something like a Google
analytics attribute here,

94
00:06:14.128 --> 00:06:19.121
like UTM source, where you say PWA or
homescreen, or a standalone.

95
00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:24.130
So then, within your Google Analytics or
any other analytics providers,

96
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.215
you can automatically separate between
when the user is using the browser or

97
00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:32.248
when the user is using
your app from the icon.

98
00:06:32.248 --> 00:06:35.918
And we are still missing one
very important property.

99
00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:39.754
If we don't set this property,
we don't have a PWA rate.

100
00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:44.929
The property's called display,
and we are going to

101
00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:50.347
set one of the possible values
that we have these days.

102
00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:56.242
It can be browser, and if we said browser
it means that we do not want a PWA.

103
00:06:56.242 --> 00:07:02.740
So if the user installs the icon, it will
be a bookmark, a shortcut to the browser.

104
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.227
So we don't want that, right?

105
00:07:04.227 --> 00:07:08.126
Another option, and it's nine of ten PWAs

106
00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:12.577
are actually using this value,
is standalone.

107
00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:16.805
Most of the time you're
going to use standalone.

108
00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:21.183
A standalone means that you
actually want your web content

109
00:07:21.183 --> 00:07:24.589
to be rendered as
a standalone application.

110
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:28.958
That's the idea if you don't
have that you have a problem.

111
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.693
Other options that we have are minimal UI.

112
00:07:33.693 --> 00:07:41.362
Minimal UI will ask the browser to render
a minimal navigation user interface.

113
00:07:41.362 --> 00:07:47.852
For example, Sqoosh is standalone.

114
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.828
YouTube music is minimal UI.

115
00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:54.188
How do I know that?

116
00:07:54.188 --> 00:07:58.685
Because YouTube music in
the title bar has this Stop and

117
00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:01.829
Reload button, and the Back button.

118
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.189
Those buttons are not available in Sqoosh.

119
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:09.776
That's the difference from
dekstop between standalone,

120
00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:12.721
Sqoosh and minimal UI YouTube music.

121
00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:14.945
Okay, make sense?

122
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:18.668
iOS is not supporting minimal UI,
only standalone.

123
00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:22.606
So if you set minima UI,
it falls back to browser.

124
00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:26.326
So it will just open the browser
it won't be actually a PWA.

125
00:08:26.326 --> 00:08:31.994
And the final value that we have here,
at least today, is full screen.

126
00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:37.247
That is only suitable for Android.

127
00:08:37.247 --> 00:08:41.560
So dekstop and iOS will fall back
to standalone, like a normal PWA.

128
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.252
To understand what's the difference
between full screen and

129
00:08:45.252 --> 00:08:48.733
a standalone and Android,
let me jump back to the slides.

130
00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:53.686
On Android, when we have a standalone
experience, it will look like this.

131
00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:57.746
You have the theme color
in the Status bar, and

132
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:02.133
the rest of the app appears
with your HTML and CSS.

133
00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:07.086
Minimal UI will actually render
like a larger URL bar with

134
00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:11.212
your theme color,
in this case the orange, and

135
00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:17.111
you will see the current page title,
the current origin, the URL.

136
00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:22.448
And also there is a little menu,
a drop-down menu on Android,

137
00:09:22.448 --> 00:09:26.791
where you can share,
you can see the current info.

138
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:28.858
And the info for
example has the TLS certificate.

139
00:09:28.858 --> 00:09:31.469
And the full screen,
it's completely full screen.

140
00:09:31.469 --> 00:09:33.143
You don't even see a Status bar.

141
00:09:33.143 --> 00:09:34.593
To understand this,

142
00:09:34.593 --> 00:09:39.031
let's see all the display modes
in Android in action all at once.

143
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.490
We have standalone,
minimal UI, and full screen.

144
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.392
So when you're in full screen,
you're actually using also the space for

145
00:09:48.392 --> 00:09:53.451
the Status bar and for the navigation
bar at the bottom, which means the user

146
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:58.139
won't see notifications,
the current battery level, or the time.

147
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:03.933
So full screen is suitable for
games or immersive experiences,

148
00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:09.416
such as if you're doing mixed reality,
or built a reality.

149
00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:12.311
For most apps, typically,
standalone is the way to go.

150
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:16.464
And remember,
minimal UI is not supported on IOS, and

151
00:10:16.464 --> 00:10:20.088
full screen is not supported on iOS or
desktop.
