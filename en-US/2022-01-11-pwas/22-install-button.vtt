WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.524
But before finishing the app,

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:07.482
I want to enhance a little bit
the installation experience.

3
00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:13.041
So the first thing that
I'm going to do now is to

4
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:16.078
uninstall the app here in Android.

5
00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:21.388
Codepad, I'm going to uninstall
the app and let's see again,

6
00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.237
how the installation
experience looks like.

7
00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:30.118
If I refresh the page now, I need to
go to the menu and hit install, or

8
00:00:30.118 --> 00:00:34.415
sometimes I'm going to see
a little snippet at the bottom.

9
00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:40.904
But maybe I would like to have another
button in my toolbar that says Install

10
00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:47.921
that will trigger automatically that
installation behavior so let's do that.

11
00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:52.278
Going back to VS code in my HTML, so

12
00:00:52.278 --> 00:00:57.627
we need to add another button here,
it will be a third button.

13
00:00:57.627 --> 00:01:02.366
So I'm going to copy this and
we should clone this.

14
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.797
And this is going to be bottom install.

15
00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:10.569
And for the icon,
I can use one that is called download

16
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.706
that looks like an arrow
to install an app, and

17
00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:21.197
also what I need is to disable this
button when we are in standalone mode.

18
00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:26.809
So for that I will need an ID or
a way to access this line,

19
00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:30.226
so we can disable the whole item.

20
00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:35.449
So this is going to be item installed and
then in CSS,

21
00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:41.623
in our media query for a standalone,
I'm going to say that for

22
00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:45.803
that item install, I want display none.

23
00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:50.233
Which means we don't want that button when
we are using the app from the icon in

24
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:53.230
the home screen, or
in the dock or in the start menu,

25
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.707
because it's already installed, okay?

26
00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:59.825
Make sense?
So remember that if you're using minimal

27
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:04.806
UI or full screen,
you also need to update the list here.

28
00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:09.809
Or you can use a comma in media
queries to have more than one,

29
00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:14.027
this is how you do an or
operator in media queries.

30
00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:16.745
So you can say standalone or
minimal UI, and

31
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:19.398
then you're not going to see that button.

32
00:02:19.398 --> 00:02:24.998
The next step is to add
the JavaScript code.

33
00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:29.905
So we go to app JS and
we need to have another,

34
00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:35.944
Even handler for Python installed.

35
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.870
But in this case, unfortunately,
we don't have an a straightforward API.

36
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.705
It's a little tricky, the API,
it's called BeforeInstallPrompt and

37
00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.491
it's not an API, it's an event.

38
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.777
If we Google BeforeInstallPrompt,

39
00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:07.301
we are not going to see any
reference from the W3C.

40
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:12.917
It's on MDN but this is because today
is not part of any standard and

41
00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:19.350
only Chrome and Edge or Chromium based
browsers are supporting this event.

42
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.291
And they are committed to support
that in the future as well.

43
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:28.900
So this is not available in Safari or
Firefox.

44
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.041
So what we need to do, we need to listen
for that event over the window option.

45
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:39.263
It's called beforeinstallprompt.

46
00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:43.565
And what we typically do here
is we call preventDefault.

47
00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:50.159
In this case, it will prevent the browser
to render the dialog on the screen

48
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:56.869
inviting the user to install the app
because we will have our own UI for that.

49
00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:02.817
And what we need to do is to store
the event object that we receive for

50
00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:04.102
later usage.

51
00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:08.834
So for example, we can create
the variable here, global, or

52
00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:14.750
in this case in the scope of a function
that we typically call this deep event.

53
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.219
We start as null, And

54
00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:22.924
we save the event that we receive
as an argument as bip event.

55
00:04:22.924 --> 00:04:28.902
Bip stands for beforeinstallprompt,
that's the name of the event.

56
00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:34.077
Now when you click install,
we need to check if

57
00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:40.182
that bip event is actually there,
and if it's there,

58
00:04:40.182 --> 00:04:44.708
we're going to call the method prompt.

59
00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:46.266
What happens if it's not there?

60
00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:52.441
It can be many things,
it can be an incompatible browser or

61
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:57.110
maybe your PWA is not
passing the criteria.

62
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.751
Or maybe the user has
already installed the PWA

63
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:05.440
because if you already have the PWA,

64
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.645
it doesn't make any sense to
invite you to install it again.

65
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:15.907
If that happens here,
I will mark this as a TODO.

66
00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:20.449
We need to show the user information
on how to install the app.

67
00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.457
For now we can make an alert saying,

68
00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:29.669
to install the app look for
Add to Homescreen or

69
00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.555
install in your browser's menu.

70
00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:41.327
Because in that case, there is no way to
trigger the native installation dialog so

71
00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:44.669
the user needs to go and
install that manually.

72
00:05:47.873 --> 00:05:49.919
Let's try this on desktop.

73
00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.108
So here I am in Chrome, and now you
can see at the bottom, in the toolbar,

74
00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:55.780
we have the Install button.

75
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.611
If I click on that button,

76
00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:02.035
you can see that the native
installation dialog is triggered.

77
00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:03.866
Let's try the same on Android.

78
00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:07.639
So on Android,
I have the Install button at the bottom.

79
00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.742
If I click there, you can see it's
also triggering the native dialog.

80
00:06:11.742 --> 00:06:17.018
But before finishing this part,
I want to show you how you can

81
00:06:17.018 --> 00:06:22.204
even enhance this Android
installation experience more.

82
00:06:22.204 --> 00:06:28.117
Going back to be VS code,
I will open the web app manifest and

83
00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:34.269
I'm going to show you two properties
that you can set that will

84
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:40.328
enhance the installation
dialogue experience on Android.

85
00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:42.221
And potentially other
browsers in the future and

86
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:43.984
potentially other platforms in the future.

87
00:06:43.984 --> 00:06:48.729
If you set a description and
it's just a text

88
00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.346
explaining what your
app is about like this

89
00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:58.230
app lets you add nodes
while you're coding.

90
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.986
And if you add another
property called screenshots,

91
00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:09.442
with at least one screenshot following
the same object type as in icons.

92
00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:15.307
So we need a source, a size, and a type.

93
00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:17.904
So what I need is on a screenshot.

94
00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:21.608
If you have one or
more screenshots of your app,

95
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:25.230
you will see how different
the experience is.

96
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:31.209
So first let's take a screenshot,
for example using the iOS simulator,

97
00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:34.980
I can take on a screenshot
from here like that.

98
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.611
And that will be good enough.

99
00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:44.595
On my desktop, now I have this screenshot,
I will just rename that as screenshot png.

100
00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:49.154
And I'm going to put that in my icon
folder, I can add another folder for this.

101
00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:53.051
Like that.

102
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:59.712
So, then I can now go, and
use here the right URL.

103
00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:05.984
And for the sizes, VS code can help us.

104
00:08:05.984 --> 00:08:10.530
At the bottom, it says 11702532.

105
00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:15.948
That's all.

106
00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:19.929
Now let's go back to Android and
see what's different.

107
00:08:22.195 --> 00:08:26.493
So I have just refreshed twice to
actually get the latest content.

108
00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:33.644
If I hit Install, you can see a completely
different dialog with my description.

109
00:08:33.644 --> 00:08:40.125
The screenshot and if you have more than
one, you have a horizontal scroll bar and

110
00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:45.081
an install button that looks much
better than the original add

111
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:49.290
to home screen little
imitation banner that we see.

112
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.416
So if you wanna get this
enhanced experience,

113
00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.749
you need at least one screenshot.

114
00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:57.778
If you have more, it's better,
and you need the description.

115
00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:04.917
And now if I Install is the same process,
it's going to mint an APK on the server.

116
00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:10.311
What happens if we try to click Install
in Safari, what we'll see is an alert,

117
00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:15.791
okay, that you should change with a
different instruction within your HTML and

118
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.457
you know how to do that.

119
00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:23.913
That's because beforeinstallprompt event,
it's actually never fire in Safari.

120
00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:26.907
And the same would happen in Firefox, or

121
00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:30.616
in desktop if you have
already installed the app.

122
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.313
And that's how you enhance the experience
and you push or invite your

123
00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:42.646
users to install the app without
a manual interaction with the manuals.
