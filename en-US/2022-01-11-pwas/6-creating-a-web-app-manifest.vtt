WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.356 --> 00:00:03.548
So the next step is to try this in Chrome,
so

2
00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:08.887
I'm going to local host 5000 here and
I'm going to open DevTools.

3
00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:11.236
So we have the DevTools available here for
us.

4
00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:19.645
So, something that we have in DevTools
is a whole section for application.

5
00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:26.065
This section is the one that
is important for PWAs, okay.

6
00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:28.445
So there are many things here and

7
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.067
we are going to cover most
of them during the day.

8
00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:37.188
But we are going to start with
the first section that says manifest.

9
00:00:37.188 --> 00:00:44.469
Manifest is the first step to actually
make a PWA, it's called Web app manifest.

10
00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.341
And as you can see, it actually
says that there is no manifest,

11
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:49.960
because this is not a PWA.

12
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.126
So that's the first step.

13
00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:55.980
I need to go back to my source code and

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.608
start writing that web app manifest file.

15
00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:04.818
Back to Visual Studio code what
I need to create is a new file,

16
00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:10.116
the web app manifest is a JSON file that
we need to create apart from the HTML.

17
00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:14.238
It's actually like the heart of a PWA and

18
00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:19.583
typically we have only one heart,
right as humans.

19
00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:24.357
Well PWAs only have one manifest,
so if you have two

20
00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:29.919
manifests you have two PWAs,
okay, one manifest one PWA.

21
00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:32.086
So what's a manifest file?

22
00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:34.049
So I need to create a new file.

23
00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.151
First, we need to set the name for
this file.

24
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:43.948
Let me tell you this it's a JSON file,
and for probably five years,

25
00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:50.045
most PWAs authors were calling
this fine manifest dot JSON.

26
00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:52.847
We're gonna still call
that file like this.

27
00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:57.974
It's your name, the only thing that
matters here is that that file should

28
00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:03.109
be served of using the right content
type for a JSON, okay, that's all.

29
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.554
However, the web app manifest
it's actually a spec in the W3C,

30
00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:10.832
so it's an official spec.

31
00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:16.294
As an official spec, they do have an
official recommendation for the extension.

32
00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:25.420
So if we Google Web app manifest spec,

33
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.847
we're going to see MDN first and
then the W3C.

34
00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:35.567
This is the official spec and
if we search here for

35
00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:42.714
extension the file extension that is
recommended is actually, dot web manifest.

36
00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:46.296
But again if you wanna
use dot JSON it's fine.

37
00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:52.788
So we can call that file
app dot web manifest.

38
00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:57.457
So I can rename this as
app dot web manifest.

39
00:02:57.457 --> 00:03:02.997
Actually VS code is smart enough
to recognize extension and

40
00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:09.105
also select JSON by default when
we are in this web manifest file.

41
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:13.472
But again, if you wanna call it
manifest dot JSON, it's fine.

42
00:03:13.472 --> 00:03:16.984
And because it's a JSON,
we're going to start with an object.

43
00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:20.437
So curly braces, and
here we start adding properties.

44
00:03:20.437 --> 00:03:25.720
We can go over the spec and
read one by one but I wanna emphasize on

45
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.821
the most important properties and
actually the mandatory properties.

46
00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:35.327
So the first mandatory
property is called name so

47
00:03:35.327 --> 00:03:39.013
I'm going to Ober that will quote name and
a value.

48
00:03:39.013 --> 00:03:44.236
Before setting the name I wanna emphasize
here that we have a title, okay?

49
00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:51.016
And I used a title here that reflects
on what happens typically on

50
00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:56.552
a web app today with a find
the title element for SEO.

51
00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:59.282
So we're gonna see what
happens with that later.

52
00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:02.890
But the name of the app seems
to be called by masters,

53
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.442
so I'm gonna copy that into my name.

54
00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:08.559
And by the way here I can add more things,

55
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.536
I can add like a coma and
something else like the best PWA in town.

56
00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.878
It can be a really long name, okay?

57
00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:19.351
But at this point you're thinking,
hey Max,

58
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:24.526
we might have a problem because,
typically an app will have an icon.

59
00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:29.009
And let's think about Android or iPhone.

60
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.107
We don't have a space for
a name like this.

61
00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:37.021
Well fortunately, there is a another
property that we can add in

62
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:40.303
this manifest, it's called short name.

63
00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:43.266
And by the way within the manifesto spec.

64
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.458
Every property that is a complex sentence,
so

65
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:51.758
different words
are separated by underscore,

66
00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:56.498
the property names that
the values are using a dash.

67
00:04:56.498 --> 00:05:01.263
So if we have a value that has
multiple words we use a dash, but

68
00:05:01.263 --> 00:05:04.168
the property name uses underscore.

69
00:05:04.168 --> 00:05:08.167
For the property we use snake case and for

70
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:13.817
the value we use Keva case that
is the one that uses a dash.

71
00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:19.124
So for example here for a short name we
can just say code bad or Kota masters.

72
00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:23.421
So, at this point,
you may be asking, Okay,

73
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:27.622
how long should these
short names should be?

74
00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:29.108
Or how short?

75
00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:35.003
Well actually, we don't have a
specification here it depends on the west.

76
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:38.623
It also depends on the font size
that the user has set there.

77
00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:41.331
So it's difficult to
actually set a number.

78
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:46.841
What I recommend typically is
to stay within 12 characters.

79
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:52.060
So if your name states within 12
characters you're kind of safe,

80
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.540
if you're passing that it might not fit,
and

81
00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.226
if that happens it may be cropped or
filled with an ellipsis.

82
00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:07.987
So in this case maybe it's safer to just
stay with just code path, okay, like this.

83
00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:11.235
So we have name, we have a short name,

84
00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:16.226
by the way if I save this file,
so and if I go back to chrome.

85
00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:27.127
Refresh, the manifest still says
that dot manifest was detected.

86
00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:31.887
So I still don't have the manifest
because we do have the file but

87
00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:37.364
we didn't link the HTML document
with that file, so that's mandatory.

88
00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:42.579
Because we are not using a standard
name like the fav icon, okay?

89
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:45.456
We actually need to set
the name in the HTML.

90
00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:50.282
So, back in Visual Studio code in my HTML,

91
00:06:50.282 --> 00:06:53.642
what I need to do is add a link.

92
00:06:53.642 --> 00:07:02.164
Similar to the style sheet it's
another link With a rel manifest.

93
00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:09.381
And the HREF will be app dot web manifest,
like that.

94
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:14.836
So that will actually
link my main document,

95
00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:19.718
my HTML with the web app manifest only one

96
00:07:19.718 --> 00:07:23.609
manifest per HTML is possible.

97
00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:27.523
Okay, so now I have my link let's try it.

98
00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:31.926
I will refresh and
now something appears here with a lot of

99
00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:36.160
warnings as you can see but
at least we have something.

100
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.744
So it's loading the manifest and
now I have some errors and

101
00:07:39.744 --> 00:07:43.487
warnings saying that most
operating system require icons.

102
00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:47.668
Yeah, I know certainly icon and
then we have a lot of other situations

103
00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:52.373
that I should change, because there
are some properties that I didn't set.

104
00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:54.731
So let's go one by one.

105
00:07:57.192 --> 00:07:58.312
Going back to the manifest.

106
00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:05.179
The next mandatory property that
we have to set, is start URL.

107
00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:08.842
So a start URL receives actually a URL,

108
00:08:08.842 --> 00:08:13.066
that typically is
relative to the manifest.

109
00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:17.979
I actually recommend to always
save the manifest file in

110
00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:21.960
the root folder of your
progressive web app.

111
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.360
Don't store that file in a resources
folder or something like that.

112
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.104
You can, but if you do that,
you need to always think about what's

113
00:08:32.104 --> 00:08:36.528
going on because sometimes things
will not work as expected.

114
00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:41.576
So it's a good idea to chef store
the file in the root folder of your PWA.

115
00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:45.491
And by the way,
what's the root folder of your PWA.

116
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:50.336
It's up to you but
you can have a PWA per domain so for

117
00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:57.340
example Starbucks the whole domain
app.starbucks.com is for the PWA.

118
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.563
So their manifest is
actually the root folder but

119
00:09:01.563 --> 00:09:07.647
also you can share your domain and
you can have more than one PWA there.

120
00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:13.598
In fact you can have unlimited
quantity of PWAs in one domain.

121
00:09:13.598 --> 00:09:18.520
This is interesting, so
in that case the best pattern or

122
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.908
the best recommendation that I have for
you is to use a different folder,

123
00:09:24.908 --> 00:09:28.386
each PWA in a different folder, okay?

124
00:09:28.386 --> 00:09:31.837
It's not mandatory actually but
it's actually a good idea.

125
00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:35.751
So for most situations typically here,

126
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:42.668
we actually load the route file or
the route file in the current folder.

127
00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:46.052
Most of the time,
we don't type index html,

128
00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:50.696
because also we don't type index
HTML in the browser, Okay?

129
00:09:50.696 --> 00:09:54.457
So because this is a URL and
not server file names, so

130
00:09:54.457 --> 00:09:57.535
most of the time we just
use forward slash or

131
00:09:57.535 --> 00:10:02.338
dot forward slash that means
the default document in this folder.

132
00:10:02.338 --> 00:10:04.672
Why do we need to set the start URL?

133
00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:09.136
So I said it's mandatory to
pass the PWA criteria, but

134
00:10:09.136 --> 00:10:12.835
it's not actually mandatory from the spec.

135
00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:22.497
Do you remember the Starbucks PWA,
so what happens

136
00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:33.555
If I go to order And I want to
order a hot tea, like a chai tea.

137
00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:35.151
If you look at the URL,

138
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:39.532
I'm currently in that particular
deep link in that chai tea.

139
00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:45.442
So if I install the app at this moment and
I don't have an A start URL,

140
00:10:45.442 --> 00:10:50.858
every time I open the app,
it will actually open the chai tea.

141
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.424
It's like a bookmark.

142
00:10:52.424 --> 00:10:54.740
Okay, we don't want that.

143
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.698
What we need is to always
start from the homepage.

144
00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:02.260
So every time you open
the app from the icon,

145
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.218
it doesn't matter where you are when
you're installing that app.

146
00:11:06.218 --> 00:11:09.265
You always wanna start from
scratch from the start, so

147
00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:11.594
that's why we need the start URL, Okay?

148
00:11:11.594 --> 00:11:16.129
So other properties that we have here.

149
00:11:18.494 --> 00:11:22.468
Not all the properties are monetary but
it's a good idea to set them.

150
00:11:22.468 --> 00:11:27.627
We have for example orientation,
this property allow us to set All and

151
00:11:27.627 --> 00:11:32.699
that's the default value in this
case it means that you're actually

152
00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:38.225
accepting your app to work portrait,
landscape and anything in between.

153
00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:43.354
But you can also say you know
what I don't like my app

154
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:48.497
to work in landscape so
you just say portrait here.

155
00:11:48.497 --> 00:11:53.156
However we need to think that not
everything that we are writing in

156
00:11:53.156 --> 00:11:56.037
the manifest will work everywhere, for

157
00:11:56.037 --> 00:12:00.714
example on desktop portrait and
landscape makes no difference.

158
00:12:00.714 --> 00:12:05.007
On iOS Apple is not supporting
the orientation property so

159
00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:07.027
it's going to be ignored.

160
00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:11.614
Your PWA will be installable anyway but
some properties may be ignored
