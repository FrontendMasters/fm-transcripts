WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.840
I mentioned that a PWA is a website,
right, and it works in the web.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.230
So, actually,
every web browser is compatible with PWA.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.520
Even our old friend Internet Explorer,
but yeah,

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.412
when we are talking
about PWA compatibility,

5
00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:21.029
we are asking about something different.

6
00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.804
Okay, so, for example,
when that PWA is installable and

7
00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:28.049
offline capable,
that of course that's not IE.

8
00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:32.654
Well let's start with mobile,
mobile support.

9
00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:37.902
So on Android, so, if you have
an Android device, you can actually

10
00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:44.620
have offline support and installability
from most of the browsers in Android.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.129
So Google Chrome, Firefox,
Opera, Samsung Internet browser,

12
00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.530
that's the browser that comes
by default with Samsung.

13
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.190
Devices use the web and Microsoft Edge.

14
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.691
So most of these browsers,
all of these browser actually

15
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:06.210
support full PWA installation and
offline capability.

16
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.349
What about iOS and iPad iOS?

17
00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:14.328
Well, we are supporting PWAs with
Safari and only with Safari.

18
00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:18.240
Okay, so Safari, on iPhones and

19
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.280
iPads support offline and
app installation.

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.290
Okay, but only from Safari and now it's
time to actually see these in action.

21
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.930
So here I have an iPhone simulator and
also I have an Android real phone.

22
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.645
So I have a real phone here with me and

23
00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:43.940
you see on the screen
a mirror of my Android phone.

24
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.105
So, let's see some apps in action and

25
00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.974
how the PWA experience looks like
before actually writing our own.

26
00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:54.354
So, I'm going to open Chrome for
example, on Android first.

27
00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:57.703
And let's write a PWA, so I love coffee,

28
00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:03.659
apparently it's something common and
if not, it can be also tea, okay.

29
00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.735
So I'm going to app.starbucks.com, so

30
00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:13.660
this is actually in a Starbucks PWA,
app.starbucks.com.

31
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.237
So when you go there,
if you see at the bottom,

32
00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:21.210
there is like a little banner there
saying, add Starbucks to the homescreen.

33
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.283
And we're going to see how
to improve that later.

34
00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:31.833
Also, if you go to the menu,
you will find an install app menu item.

35
00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:36.639
Okay, and this happens only on PWAs,
so if you go to a normal website,

36
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.418
you're not going to see that menu item.

37
00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:44.530
So, if you click Install App, it's asking,
do you want to install the app?

38
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.328
Yeah, this is actually
making an async operation.

39
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:58.947
The async corporation is
actually compiling an apk.

40
00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:02.357
If you have never heard about apk,
that's Android package,

41
00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:04.662
it's actually an Android application.

42
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:07.653
So, now it says, that you must
add it to your home screen, so

43
00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:10.128
I already have the notification
that it's done.

44
00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:13.939
So, now if I go to my home
screen I will see a new icon,

45
00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.102
the Starbucks icon and
it's not just in the home screen,

46
00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:22.200
I can open the launcher and
just find the Starbucks app.

47
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.713
And now if I open that icon,
it's a full screen application and

48
00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:31.883
from an iOS point of view,
it looks like an app.

49
00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:36.990
I can even kill chrome and
my app is still there.

50
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.378
Is this a native app?

51
00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:41.259
No, this is pure web.

52
00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.023
This is the same HTML CSS and

53
00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.800
JavaScript that was rendered
before within the browser.

54
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.532
And I also wanna show you something else.

55
00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:56.044
If I go to settings, Apps,

56
00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:59.435
I can see all my apps.

57
00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:07.740
And if I scroll here,
we're going to find all the native apps.

58
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.930
And also Starbucks.

59
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.548
And remember, this is a PWA,
this app didn't came from the Play Store.

60
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:22.532
Okay, so however I can of course see all
the storage that it's currently using,

61
00:04:22.532 --> 00:04:25.974
permissions, screen time, battery usage.

62
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:29.258
And I can see at the bottom
that it says that the app

63
00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:31.672
was installed from the Play Store.

64
00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:34.679
That we know that's not true, okay?

65
00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:39.142
So however, my phone, this is an Android
12, is actually saying that and

66
00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:41.738
if I click there,
it goes to the Play Store.

67
00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:44.539
And actually, it's not finding the app.

68
00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.510
So because actually the Play Store

69
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.024
is the one that is actually
compiling the app for us.

70
00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:57.159
We don't need to do anything, we don't
need to comply with apps or rules.

71
00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.533
We don't need to get a publisher account,
just by doing everything that

72
00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:05.419
we're going to do today,
you will get this experience, okay?

73
00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.165
So, that's Android, now let's jump to iOS.

74
00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:14.917
So I have here an iOS simulator, so
I will open Safari because the simulator,

75
00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:19.440
it works pretty well on this,
there are many PWAs out there.

76
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.071
Tiktok is a PWA, Google Docs, Google Drive
is a PWA, YouTube Music is a PWA.

77
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:29.243
So, we have so
many PWAs out there to try, but

78
00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:34.684
there is one that probably you know,
maybe not, I don't know, we'll see.

79
00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:37.961
It's Tinder,
have you ever heard of Tinder?

80
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.077
Probably not, right?

81
00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:44.800
Well, tinder.com is a PWA, so
when you go to tinder.com,

82
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.730
you can actually install a PWA.

83
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.454
So, we don't have this invitation
dialogue that we saw on Android and

84
00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:57.880
later today, we're going to see how
to improve that or how that works.

85
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.545
Well, after accepting all the cookies,

86
00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:05.660
I can actually press the share menu and
I can select Add to Home Screen.

87
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.284
And because it's a PWA, we will get an
icon on the homescreen and at this point,

88
00:06:10.284 --> 00:06:14.448
you are thinking, hey Max,
that looks like a shortcut to the website.

89
00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:19.232
Well, kind of, because if I
open the icon now on my iPhone,

90
00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:24.840
now the experience is fullscreen,
I have this flash screen.

91
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.674
So, I'm not in Safari anymore,
and from an OS perspective,

92
00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:33.260
it also looks like a separate app,
it's in a standalone app.

93
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.610
So, I can kill Safari and
Tinder app is still there.

94
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.280
So, is this a native app
coming from the App Store?

95
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.030
Nope, this is a PWA.

96
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.521
So, I don't need to
comply with after rules,

97
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:50.902
I can actually serve these from my
web server, that's actually a PWA.

98
00:06:50.902 --> 00:06:55.642
Do you have at this point any question
on how the experience looks like on

99
00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:56.831
Android and iOS?

100
00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:01.295
So the question is about user acquisition,
so how easy or

101
00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:05.574
difficult it is to let our
users know that we have a PWA?

102
00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:07.435
I guess that's part of the question.

103
00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:10.675
So, the answer is without the store,
okay, so

104
00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:14.978
because remember that we can
actually publish it in the store.

105
00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:18.879
You actually need to use
the same techniques as a website.

106
00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.979
So, SEO techniques, marketing techniques,
it depends on the case,

107
00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:28.748
for example, Financial Times in
the newspaper, they have a PWA.

108
00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:34.045
And well, they use their own newspaper
to actually advertise their PWA.

109
00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:38.656
They can have like a full page saying,
hey, now you can go to app.ft.com,

110
00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:43.550
that's the URL and add it to the home
screen, or installing from there.

111
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.040
But, it's true that this is one of the
challenges that we have in this PWA work.

112
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.604
Because yeah, not everything is gold here,
we also have some challenges and

113
00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:59.680
discoverability of PWAs is
one of those challenges.

114
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.780
Okay, so that's a good question.

115
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.973
Later we're going to
get deeper on that but

116
00:08:04.973 --> 00:08:09.200
have in mind that
discoverability is a problem.

117
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.202
And maybe the App Store thing
that it's not readable for

118
00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:17.490
all the apps but
the App Store thing comes with that.

119
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.407
Okay, and at the end of today's workshop,
we are going to discuss that and

120
00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:23.665
how that can help.

121
00:08:23.665 --> 00:08:28.937
So, that's support on mobile,
so Android, iOS, and iPadOS.

122
00:08:31.304 --> 00:08:35.736
Now it's time to talk about the desktop
because PWAs are not just for

123
00:08:35.736 --> 00:08:39.030
mobile devices, they run on desktop.

124
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.280
If you have a Chromebook with Chrome OS,
you can actually install PWAs.

125
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.669
If you have another computer or
laptop or PC,

126
00:08:47.669 --> 00:08:52.290
with Linux, Mac OS, Windows 7, Windows 8,

127
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.257
Windows 10 or Windows 11,
you have support for

128
00:08:57.257 --> 00:09:03.540
PWA installation from Google Chrome or
Microsoft Edge.

129
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:09.200
So, these are the only browsers
compatible with PWAs on desktop.

130
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.280
Also, we have the store like
the Microsoft Store for Windows.

131
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.280
Okay, we're going to discuss that later.

132
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.612
But talking about the standard
installation support,

133
00:09:19.612 --> 00:09:23.944
typically we are talking
about browser installation,

134
00:09:23.944 --> 00:09:27.540
it's Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

135
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.405
And probably at this point that today
Microsoft Edge is based on the Chromium

136
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.570
engine.

137
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.650
So, it's taking this ability
from actually Google Chrome.

138
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.690
So, let's see this in action.
