WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:05.689
Coming back on iOS that we know it's
working there it looks like an app,

2
00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.932
we have a couple of problems.

3
00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:13.366
The first problem that I see
is that because it's a web I

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:19.169
can actually select part of
the website like this, okay?

5
00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.783
And sometimes I can select
parts that I don't want to,

6
00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:27.798
like the buttons content
including the icon and

7
00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:32.532
it looks like to webby and
it doesn't look nice, okay.

8
00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.925
So it's weird.

9
00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:39.486
Maybe we went out, I mean,
if I add some notes here,

10
00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:46.670
maybe I want to copy the note content, but
not the button, not the delete button.

11
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.412
It doesn't make any sense.

12
00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:53.200
So by default,
everything is selectable as web content.

13
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.366
And because now we are an app,

14
00:00:55.366 --> 00:01:00.240
the user expectation is that
we should react like an app.

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.280
So we need to work on this.

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.444
And so we need to work a little bit on
our CSS to make it more up capable,

17
00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:08.433
if you want.

18
00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:17.428
So back in our CSS, what we need
to do is disable user selection,

19
00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:22.984
that's a CSS property user-select
on some parts, at least.

20
00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:26.296
For example, we can look at our icons.

21
00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.358
It's a span icon.

22
00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:32.135
And also you we have the buttons.

23
00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:35.424
So we can say that the buttons
with the icon inside.

24
00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:42.691
It's going to read user-select, none.

25
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:47.657
Just to be safe with all
the browser's we still need a prefix,

26
00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:51.779
sorry about that that's
-webkit-user select.

27
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:56.328
So we can apply these to the button.

28
00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:03.650
Maybe we can start the class here,
to the icons and

29
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.542
maybe to the title, the h1.

30
00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:15.687
So if I do this If I go back here
we have the refresh problem, okay.

31
00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:18.330
We need to refresh and we don't know how.

32
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.945
So the only way is to actually kill
the app and open the app again.

33
00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.387
Now, if I try to select the title it
doesn't work, if I tried to select

34
00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:36.488
the button, that's what I'm trying,
it's not working, okay.

35
00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:43.020
And if I try to something here,
like lunch, okay.

36
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.053
I can select lunch, the text but
not the icon, okay?

37
00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:52.582
So again this is not specifically for
PWA's, but

38
00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:58.000
it's something that it's a design
pattern that we should follow.

39
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.900
So that's the first part.

40
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.174
Another thing that I have here if
you look at the bottom, our toolbar,

41
00:03:03.174 --> 00:03:04.240
something's wrong.

42
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.000
So what's wrong?

43
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.494
Well, that Learn button doesn't
feel like being in the right place.

44
00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:13.966
And probably think it will.

45
00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:18.436
In Safari, we don't have
the problem because Safari has its

46
00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:22.466
own tab bar at the bottom,
even when it's hidden, but

47
00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:26.248
I don't have enough content
here to hide that URL.

48
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:33.140
But even when it's hidden, I can hide that
from here probably hide toolbar, there.

49
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.626
We still have a little
piece of browser's UI at

50
00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:42.810
the bottom that maybe work,
so my button is working.

51
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.472
However, when we are in
a standalone application,

52
00:03:49.472 --> 00:03:52.755
the problem that we
have is that this area,

53
00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:58.134
the bottom is used by the West to
actually trigger the multitask mode,

54
00:03:58.134 --> 00:04:02.520
or to go right and left and
move between apps.

55
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.220
And that's known as an unsafe area.

56
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.430
And if you want to render content there,

57
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.940
you need to understand that that
content won't be interactive.

58
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.010
So my Baton,
my whole toolbar is not interactive.

59
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.930
So we have a problem,
how to solve the problem.

60
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.751
Well, maybe you are thinking,
well, Hey, max, that simple,

61
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:25.290
just go find the toolbar.

62
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.308
I think I'm pointing to
the main toolbar here and

63
00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:34.012
add the padding bottom of value
I don't know the value but

64
00:04:34.012 --> 00:04:37.550
let's try like I know 32 pixels, okay.

65
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.302
If I save this, Kill the app,
we can pull the refresh

66
00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:47.381
button while we're debugging and
now it works, okay.

67
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:52.315
Yeah, but the problem is that
I also have the padding here.

68
00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:56.449
And it's, I don't like it.

69
00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.271
Well, we can use media queries,
okay and apply.

70
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.320
We haven't used a media query yet, but

71
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.999
we can apply this padding
only in standalone mode.

72
00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.068
Can we do that?
Yes, it's possible to do that.

73
00:05:07.068 --> 00:05:10.444
Let me show you how,
because it will be useful later on.

74
00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:13.405
But I don't think it's necessary for
this particular example.

75
00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:15.891
You can have immediate query and

76
00:05:15.891 --> 00:05:21.242
there is a new attribute that we
can query it's called display mode.

77
00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:26.284
And as values, I can use all the values
From the display property in the manifest,

78
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.612
such as standalone.

79
00:05:29.444 --> 00:05:32.463
So I can say on standalone,

80
00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:38.380
I wanna apply to this selector,
the padding bottom.

81
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.679
So if I do that, I'm kind of better

82
00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:49.721
Even on desktop, I'm not seeing that.

83
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.451
If I refresh here, I'm not seeing the
padding, and I'm still seeing the padding.

84
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:04.520
Let me close the PWA I should
still see the padding here.

85
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.920
But this is not yet a good idea.

86
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.260
Why?

87
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.190
Because there are some iPhones or
Androids without that problem.

88
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.630
For example,
I can open another simulator that it's

89
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.598
the iPhone SE the iPhone SE, okay?

90
00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:25.910
Or the iPhone 8 if you want,
has a home button.

91
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.652
So we don't have those gestures,
we don't have that unsafe area and

92
00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:33.920
we will still be adding a padding.

93
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.799
So it seems more complicated that
just putting in a value there.

94
00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:43.903
Fortunately, we have a solution.

95
00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:54.692
Today, modern browsers are exposing
some CSS environmental variables.

96
00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:57.389
These are kind of constants
that we can apply.

97
00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.481
For example for these, for the safe areas.

98
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:07.518
In the GitHub project,
I have a text file that says snippets

99
00:07:07.518 --> 00:07:13.259
txt file that is just where I have
here a couple of snippets that are,

100
00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:19.737
if you want to type them or if you want
to copy from my screen it will take time.

101
00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:25.848
So you can just copy and paste from here
for those pieces that will take more code.

102
00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:31.034
For the safe area,
we have these environmental properties.

103
00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:35.330
So I'm not sure if you have used
this before, but now in CSS,

104
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.283
we have this env function.

105
00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:43.430
So we can use env to actually
set the inset-bottom.

106
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.712
In this case it will use
the value that applies to

107
00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:52.438
that particular phone in
that particular context.

108
00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:57.753
The problem of applying these
only on padding bottom is

109
00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:02.951
that it's not always bottom
because they were here we

110
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:10.019
have this one where we don't see that
horizontal rule in this iPhone SE.

111
00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:13.305
So we don't need the padding on the phone.

112
00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:20.916
So, Something that we need to
remember is that I can go landscape.

113
00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:24.984
And now if I go landscape,
okay, we have the safe area,

114
00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:27.416
in like in a different position.

115
00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:32.430
So maybe we actually want to apply
the safe area on every edge.

116
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.601
And that's actually this
kind of padding or margin,

117
00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:40.689
you can apply to padding or
margin, it's up to you.

118
00:08:40.689 --> 00:08:44.561
The important is just in case.

119
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:48.988
So I will apply these to the padding.

120
00:08:48.988 --> 00:08:52.568
And this is what I'm looking for
top right bottom left.

121
00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:54.273
Remember this is clockwise.

122
00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:59.201
So, and
in this case we are applying the margin.

123
00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:01.688
And something that we can do is
also apply a default margin.

124
00:09:01.688 --> 00:09:06.617
Maybe you say okay,
something that you want is the bottom, but

125
00:09:06.617 --> 00:09:09.876
if there is no margin, I want five bucks.

126
00:09:09.876 --> 00:09:13.512
So there is a second argument
to this function that

127
00:09:13.512 --> 00:09:17.582
is optional where you can
define like a fallback value in

128
00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:21.754
case there is no safe area in
the bottom variable, okay?

129
00:09:21.754 --> 00:09:23.585
Just in case you need that.

130
00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:25.629
So now if I apply this.

131
00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:31.033
I don't need to apply
the media query actually,

132
00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:34.153
we can keep that for the browser as well.

133
00:09:34.153 --> 00:09:34.925
But it's up to you.

134
00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.626
Let's keep the media query anyway.

135
00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:42.301
So let's open here in this iPhone,

136
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:45.901
localhost 5000.

137
00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:50.903
That's my server.

138
00:09:50.903 --> 00:09:52.869
And I'm going to install the app.

139
00:09:52.869 --> 00:09:58.270
So the share at your home screen
cope up with the right icon.

140
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.122
Okay, looks good.

141
00:10:00.122 --> 00:10:03.787
And if I open this,
I see my button without.

142
00:10:03.787 --> 00:10:08.628
Any padding because I don't
have that unsafe area and

143
00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:13.791
if we try this now on the iPhone
that needs that safe area,

144
00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:16.384
we're still not seen that.

145
00:10:16.384 --> 00:10:20.895
That is because from iOS 15, we have
something else that we need to add.

146
00:10:20.895 --> 00:10:23.553
This will work on iOS 14.

147
00:10:23.553 --> 00:10:28.181
So to understand what do we need to add,
let me show you something.

148
00:10:28.181 --> 00:10:32.431
If I go landscape on the iPhone 13,

149
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:39.572
you can see that we have some
orange bars are the sites, okay?

150
00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:45.364
So that is that by default,
we do not have full support for

151
00:10:45.364 --> 00:10:48.272
100% of the area for us.

152
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:53.990
So by default we can not render content
at the right at the left of the screen.

153
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.130
We can request access to that.

154
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:03.107
And that will also solve our problem by
adding something in our viewport metadata.

155
00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:10.622
Going back to HTML, I will look for
my viewport metadata and

156
00:11:10.622 --> 00:11:14.493
within the content,
I will add another property.

157
00:11:14.493 --> 00:11:17.400
That is a new one.

158
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.250
In fact, it has been for a couple
of years since the first iPhone 10.

159
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.256
So I'm going to use coma and
it's called viewport-fit,

160
00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:28.922
viewport-fit equals cover.

161
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:35.550
In this case, we're asking OS to
give us all the available viewpoint.

162
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.961
That means that now our content
can be under, a notch or

163
00:11:40.961 --> 00:11:48.607
it can be under maybe in a space of the
display that is hidden for some reason but

164
00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:55.458
then we can use the safe areas to
actually add padding, some margin.

165
00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:59.415
So now if I save, and go back here,

166
00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:04.476
I can kill my process and
open the app again.

167
00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:12.540
And now we see that we finally have
the padding in the toolbar at the bottom.

168
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:18.240
And if I do the same on my iPhone SE, so
I kill the process and open the app again.

169
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.410
I don't have the padding.

170
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:27.274
So now it's working on iPhones with the
multitask Chester, we have the padding and

171
00:12:27.274 --> 00:12:32.660
the other iPhones or Android or
desktop will not have that talent.

172
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.189
What happens if I try landscape now?

173
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.333
If I go landscape,
now you can see that now,100% of

174
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:43.610
the screen we don't have those
vertical bars or the sites.

175
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.762
So 100% of the screen is actually for
my content.

176
00:12:46.762 --> 00:12:49.729
So you need to be very careful here and

177
00:12:49.729 --> 00:12:53.463
check that we have enough
padding in the body or

178
00:12:53.463 --> 00:12:58.826
in the main container of your content
too because if not our content

179
00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:04.995
will actually be rendered behind
the notch and we know that's not visible.

180
00:13:08.306 --> 00:13:12.905
So for now, our PWA looks nice,
at least on iOS.

181
00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:13.676
It looks nice.

182
00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:19.512
But we know that when we go to dev
tools in Chrome and check the manifest,

183
00:13:19.512 --> 00:13:24.296
it says instability that we
don't have a service worker.

184
00:13:24.296 --> 00:13:25.939
So that's the next step.

185
00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:31.637
Because we actually want our app to work
offline and with that we will pass the PWA

186
00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:36.506
criteria and it will be installable
on desktop and also on Android.
