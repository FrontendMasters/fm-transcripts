1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.875
So the next property that is
actually really important is icons.

2
00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:10.737
So before going to icon,
let's switch display to stand alone.

3
00:00:10.737 --> 00:00:13.658
And as I mentioned before,
it's kind of the one that you want.

4
00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:18.084
And then we have the icons property.

5
00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:23.137
Icons, it's actually a collection,
an array of icons.

6
00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:27.949
And the basic icon
declaration looks like this.

7
00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.745
We have SRC, source, like an img tag, and

8
00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:36.088
we can point to an icon sizes.

9
00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:40.669
This is also following the sizes
property in the img tag.

10
00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:43.959
So, for example, I can say 100 by by 100.

11
00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.042
That's how it works.

12
00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:49.780
And then the type,
where we specify the content type,

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.393
for example, if it's a PNG image, png.

14
00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:59.619
So the spec, the web manifest
spec is platform agnostic,

15
00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.321
which means they don't actually recommend

16
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.402
an icon size, or even an icon format.

17
00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:12.018
So it's up to you the icons
that you wanna set.

18
00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:19.136
However, we don't live in the spec
ideal world, we live in the real world.

19
00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:25.299
And in the real world, we actually
need icons in some specific sizes.

20
00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.257
As of today, the sizes that we
need are at least 512 by 512.

21
00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:35.512
So the icon must be square.

22
00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:41.266
And the only format that is
widely supported is PNG, okay?

23
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.808
So don't use ico, I-C-O.

24
00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:47.118
Well, JPEG,
no one is going to use that for icons.

25
00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:49.581
But typically the question is SVG.

26
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:51.052
Can we use SVG?

27
00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:56.432
I mean, you can add another icon because
we can have more than one for SVG.

28
00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:01.753
In this case, even if you set an SVG icon,
and with the right type,

29
00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:06.793
you must set the sizes,
which sounds weird because the SVG does

30
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:11.481
not contain an intrinsic size
when an icon is set at least.

31
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.509
So you actually need to set also one or

32
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.719
more icon sizes that you
want that SVG to be useful.

33
00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.607
SVG icons is actually today
available only on the latest

34
00:02:22.607 --> 00:02:25.343
versions of Google Chrome on desktop.

35
00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:27.638
And it's coming on Android.

36
00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:32.486
So as of today, when we are shooting this
video, it's not even available on Android.

37
00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.057
So we always need an PNG version.

38
00:02:35.057 --> 00:02:38.802
So even in the future,
if SVG is widely supported,

39
00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:42.995
it will be always necessary
to have a fallback png value.

40
00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:48.397
So far for my app, I already have
some icons in the icons folder,

41
00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:51.712
one 512 png, and 1024, okay?

42
00:02:51.712 --> 00:02:56.584
So 1024 is useful for desktop,
where we have more resolution and

43
00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:59.530
the icon can be used in different places.

44
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.496
So I will actually point
from here to icons,

45
00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:08.218
icon 512 png, the sizes will be 512 x 512.

46
00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:12.179
That's the spec in HTML.

47
00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:19.597
And then I have another icon,
1024 by 1024, okay, like this.

48
00:03:19.597 --> 00:03:21.819
So this is how you set the icons.

49
00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.519
The icons can be in a CDN if you want.

50
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.488
So there is no need to have the icon
in the same origin as the manifest,

51
00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:33.615
so we can point to an external CDN and
this will just work.

52
00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:39.559
Okay, so now I have this icons,
I will come back to Chrome.

53
00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:44.532
I'm going to refresh, and
now we have less warning messages.

54
00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:51.366
And, If I scroll here,
I can see my identity, name, short name.

55
00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.824
We don't have a description yet,
we haven't mentioned that.

56
00:03:53.824 --> 00:03:58.221
Presentation, start URL,
theme color, background color.

57
00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:00.888
We haven't mentioned that one,
but it seems like we have one.

58
00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:04.943
Orientation, display, and
then we have the icons.

59
00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:10.437
So it seems like from this side,
it looks okay.

60
00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:12.703
We are still missing some pieces.

61
00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:17.855
But let me tell you this,
iOS and Firefox, both,

62
00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:24.120
they have less strict PWA
criteria as compared with Chrome.

63
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.288
That means that now we can go and
try to install this PWA on an iPhone.

64
00:04:30.288 --> 00:04:35.929
So I'm back here in my iOS simulator.

65
00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:40.222
And iOS simulator,
it's actually a simulator.

66
00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:43.102
Yeah, but also we have emulators.

67
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:46.855
I'm not sure if you have
ever thought about that.

68
00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:49.606
So what's the difference between
a simulator and an emulator?

69
00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:55.711
For example, the Android SDK includes
emulators, but iOS includes simulators.

70
00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:00.280
By the way, if you're wondering
how to install the simulator,

71
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.942
it's part of Xcode there is the IDE
to create native apps for iOS.

72
00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:07.196
And it's available on your Mac OS.

73
00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:10.982
So you need a Mac computer to
actually have this simulator.

74
00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:15.525
So because it's a simulator,
it's an app that looks like an iPhone,

75
00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:18.685
but it's not really a built
on machine with iOS.

76
00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.636
On Android,
it's actually a built on machine.

77
00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:28.360
Because it's a simulator, I can
actually run local host 5000 like this.

78
00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.850
It'll actually get into my web app.

79
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.108
So you can see it looks
pretty nice on iOS,

80
00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:44.175
you can see at the top that I'm seeing
this yellow, that's the theme color.

81
00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:48.758
Safari 15 supports
the theme color metadata.

82
00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:54.169
So that's why we have in the status bar,
also our color.

83
00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.227
Let me prove that.

84
00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:02.088
Going back to VScode,
I'm going to the HTML, and

85
00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:04.482
instead of this I'm going to use red.

86
00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:08.891
I'm going to refresh.

87
00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:12.254
And now you can see that
the status bar is red.

88
00:06:12.254 --> 00:06:17.048
So that the theme color metadata
is also useful today for

89
00:06:17.048 --> 00:06:21.434
the browser, not just for
when we install the app.

90
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.610
I will go back to our theme color.

91
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.759
And now I will try to install the app.

92
00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.253
If you remember to install PWA on iOS,

93
00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:40.894
I need to click Share up to home screen.

94
00:06:40.894 --> 00:06:43.716
Here we are going to
see a couple of things.

95
00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:46.260
I don't have an icon.

96
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.792
I'm not sure if you realize that the icon
that Apple is actually using it's on

97
00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:54.765
a screenshot of the current app,
it's actually really small, but

98
00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:56.313
that's on a screenshot.

99
00:06:56.313 --> 00:07:00.194
Maybe you're thinking, well, maybe we
have a problem with the manifest and

100
00:07:00.194 --> 00:07:01.758
it's not really in the icons.

101
00:07:01.758 --> 00:07:07.079
But if you look at the name of the app,
it says but it's actually our short name.

102
00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.558
So Safari is really my manifest.

103
00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:11.749
What's the problem then?

104
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:17.145
That Safari ignores
the icons in the manifest.

105
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.087
It sounds weird, okay?

106
00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:23.431
We don't have an official
answer from Apple on why,

107
00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:25.561
but they have another solution.

108
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:30.185
So the thing is that, icons in
the manifest are not being used by Safari.

109
00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:35.100
They're going to be used by Android and
desktop, but not by Safari.

110
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.560
So even if I add this,
I have an icon there.

111
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.338
I mean, it doesn't look so bad, but it's
not the icon, right, it's on a screenshot.

112
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:50.416
And if I open Copel, now you will see that
they have an external load experience.

113
00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:55.502
So, okay, we have kind of a PWA.

114
00:07:55.502 --> 00:08:01.821
Just by setting the manifest will display
stand alone and a couple of properties.

115
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.340
We still need to solve the icon problem,
okay?

116
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.134
And we will, but it's kind of there.

117
00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:12.168
Maybe if you're looking at the screen,
you may be already spotting some other UI

118
00:08:12.168 --> 00:08:15.571
issues that we need to solve, and
we're going to do that right now.

119
00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:18.402
But let's go back to the icon problem.

120
00:08:18.402 --> 00:08:26.114
So iOS is not supporting the icon
declaration from the manifest.

121
00:08:26.114 --> 00:08:31.039
We need to define a link element
in the HTML, not in the manifest.

122
00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:35.510
And the link element, if you have been
in the web field doing websites for

123
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.994
a while, you may already know this,
because it's called the iOS icon.

124
00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:40.891
It's the same.

125
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:45.206
It's a link with a real Apple touch icon,

126
00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:49.901
with an href point into
the icon that we want.

127
00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:54.770
Like this one, just that.

128
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.953
It must be a square and png, and

129
00:08:57.953 --> 00:09:02.988
please do not add the rounded
corners to the png.

130
00:09:02.988 --> 00:09:07.068
You know that iOS have rounded
corners over the icons,

131
00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:09.380
but the OS will do that for you.

132
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.533
The OS will apply the mask for you, okay?

133
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:14.073
So it must be square.

134
00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:18.367
So first, the icon will not be updated.

135
00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:23.474
So even if I refresh, and by the way,
how can I refresh my PWA?

136
00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:28.776
I don't have a URL bar anymore,
I don't have a toolbar from Safari.

137
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.728
Do we have a way to refresh?

138
00:09:30.728 --> 00:09:31.755
Actually no.

139
00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:34.874
So, and that's another challenge, right?

140
00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:37.888
Now we are in a standalone app.

141
00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:39.894
We own the window.

142
00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:43.397
So if you need navigation
like a back button,

143
00:09:43.397 --> 00:09:48.850
you must provide that within your
user interface, within your HTML.

144
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.711
Something that you can do to refresh
is you can kill the process.

145
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:55.714
If you kill the app like this, and

146
00:09:55.714 --> 00:10:00.449
you open the app again,
it will load the HTML again.

147
00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:02.302
But the app is already installed.

148
00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:06.264
It's not going to upgrade my icon.

149
00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:09.193
To actually get the icon,

150
00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:15.193
we actually need to add this
to the home screen again.

151
00:10:15.193 --> 00:10:18.894
But before doing that I need
to refresh the page, so

152
00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:21.572
it can take my new link declaration.

153
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:29.454
At your home screen, and now you
can see that my icon appears there.

154
00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:35.382
And if I add another icon,
I have my there with its own icon,

155
00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:37.987
and now it looks much better.

156
00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:43.743
Now you can see it says
with its own icon on iOS.

157
00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:47.748
So as you can see now on
iOS we are kind of a PWA.

158
00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.143
Is it working offline?

159
00:10:49.143 --> 00:10:50.559
I don't think so.

160
00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:57.938
But as I mentioned before, Safari is less
strict in terms of with PWA criteria.

161
00:10:57.938 --> 00:10:59.883
So we have already passed the criteria.

162
00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:03.043
It already installed the app,
even if it's not working offline.

163
00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:07.869
On Chrome on Android,
and Chrome on desktop,

164
00:11:07.869 --> 00:11:14.438
we still need more work to do,
okay, to actually make it work.

165
00:11:14.438 --> 00:11:18.308
Can we try this on desktop even if
you're not passing the criteria?

166
00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:23.131
So back in Chrome if I'm going manifest
within dev tools, you see that

167
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:28.305
instability is not yet available
because we don't have a service worker.

168
00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:31.091
That is something that we will do later.

169
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:33.441
But I have a trick for you.

170
00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:38.403
When you are in Google Chrome,
you can go to the Menu, More Tools, and

171
00:11:38.403 --> 00:11:40.689
you can click Create Shortcut.

172
00:11:40.689 --> 00:11:44.315
This is just a trick to test how
your app looks like right now

173
00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:48.533
without writing a service worker,
without passing the criteria.

174
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.401
So we're going to create a shortcut.

175
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:53.761
Now you can see that it
actually has the icon,

176
00:11:53.761 --> 00:11:57.750
it's not taking the short name,
just the long name.

177
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.424
So I can actually show them manually,
and I can select Open as Window.

178
00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:07.302
This is going to emulate the automatic
PWA installation that we will see later

179
00:12:07.302 --> 00:12:09.940
when we are passing the criteria, okay?

180
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:16.677
So if I create this, now, you can see,
well, let me close the dev tools,

181
00:12:16.677 --> 00:12:21.460
that I do have my own window
that has the theme color,

182
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.054
the yellow theme color,
and it looks like an app.

183
00:12:26.054 --> 00:12:30.619
And it has its own icon within the system.

184
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:35.505
I can now search in my Mac for
and it appears.

185
00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:40.497
And it's just an HTML with
the manifest and icon and, voila,

186
00:12:40.497 --> 00:12:47.033
we have an app on the Mac, and we have an
app on Windows, or Linux or Chromebooks.

187
00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:51.444
So, well, this trick is not yet
possible on Android.

188
00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:55.405
To actually install the app on Android,

189
00:12:55.405 --> 00:13:01.706
we need to pass the criteria,
unless we want a less capable PWA.

190
00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:04.969
So let's jump into that discussion.

191
00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:10.102
Back on the slides, let's discuss
what happens with icons on Android.

192
00:13:10.102 --> 00:13:15.492
On Android, we can have two kinds
of icons or apps in terms of PWAs.

193
00:13:15.492 --> 00:13:18.894
We can have shortcuts or WebAPKs.

194
00:13:18.894 --> 00:13:21.444
So let's try to clarify this.

195
00:13:21.444 --> 00:13:26.062
Shortcuts, it creates a shortcut
to the browser engine.

196
00:13:26.062 --> 00:13:29.191
So it's an icon that goes
to the browser's engine.

197
00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:32.902
It can be Firefox,
it can be Edge, it can be Chrome.

198
00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:36.131
It includes something known
as a browser's badge.

199
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.619
I will show you this in a minute.

200
00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:41.447
And in this case this icon shortcut,

201
00:13:41.447 --> 00:13:46.292
it's installed only at the home screen,
not in the launcher.

202
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:50.025
It doesn't appear like all the other apps.

203
00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:52.415
So not in the apps list.

204
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:57.893
All the browsers use
this method by default.

205
00:13:57.893 --> 00:14:02.284
So on Android 8,
shortcuts have a little badge.

206
00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:07.416
If you look at the screen, every icon,
all of these icons are PWAs by the way.

207
00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:13.068
So they have a little Chrome badge at
the bottom right side of the icon.

208
00:14:13.068 --> 00:14:18.263
Also the shape of some icons
are kind of weird, okay?

209
00:14:18.263 --> 00:14:20.376
We're going to see how to solve that.

210
00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:23.016
So typically we don't want that badge.

211
00:14:23.016 --> 00:14:26.121
We don't want the icon
with a little Chrome icon.

212
00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:28.259
So in fact, it's not just Chrome.

213
00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:31.926
In this case,
you have the same Starbucks PWA, but

214
00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:35.098
install using different browsers, okay?

215
00:14:35.098 --> 00:14:39.544
We want something better, and

216
00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:42.968
that's named WebAPK.

217
00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:47.425
It works only if the PWA criteria passes.

218
00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:49.538
So we are not there yet, okay?

219
00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:52.798
At least the Chromium PWA criteria.

220
00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:56.600
And in this case it's a full
Android native package,

221
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.256
like the Starbucks application
that we saw before on my Android.

222
00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:05.827
It contains the package,
only the apps name, icon, and URL.

223
00:15:05.827 --> 00:15:11.380
So the package does not
contain my web app,

224
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.933
just the link to my web app.

225
00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:17.262
And the APK is installed silently.

226
00:15:17.262 --> 00:15:18.674
Again, what's an APK?

227
00:15:18.674 --> 00:15:24.003
It's the native format on Android for
native apps.

228
00:15:24.003 --> 00:15:26.906
So it's an APK that will
be installed silently, so

229
00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:29.751
we are not going to see any warning,
any message.

230
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:33.299
We don't need to disable
security on the phone, nothing.

231
00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:37.591
We will Chrome,
we will install that APK silently.

232
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:43.329
And the icon goes to the home screen, and
also the launcher, like any other app.

233
00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:48.002
It works only with Google Chrome
on devices with Play Services.

234
00:15:48.002 --> 00:15:52.144
That means that if you have, for
example, some of the latest Huawei

235
00:15:52.144 --> 00:15:56.371
devices that they don't have
Play Services, it's not gonna work.

236
00:15:56.371 --> 00:16:00.327
Google Chrome will use shortcuts,
not WebAPK.

237
00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:01.915
And it's also suitable for

238
00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:05.377
Samsung Internet browser when
you are on a Samsung device.

239
00:16:05.377 --> 00:16:10.188
So if you install the Internet browser on
a non Samsung device, for example, I have

240
00:16:10.188 --> 00:16:14.880
a pixel, I can install that browser in
my pixel, but it's not a Samsung device.

241
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.398
So then I won't have WebAPK.

242
00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:22.708
And WebAPK is not available on Firefox,
Edge, or any other browser.

243
00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:28.514
So if you start PWAs with Firefox, you
will always get that little badge there.

244
00:16:28.514 --> 00:16:35.169
Only Chrome and Samsung Internet can
actually create this WebAPK packages.

245
00:16:35.169 --> 00:16:38.109
And the icons will appear
then in the home screen,

246
00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:41.202
in the launcher, and
they will appear in Settings.

247
00:16:41.202 --> 00:16:48.212
And if you remember they are even
listed as being part of the Play Store.

248
00:16:48.212 --> 00:16:52.876
As a wrap up for icons,
remember to use PNG, color space sRGB,

249
00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:55.519
that's the most compatible icon.

250
00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:58.215
And it's going to be used for
Android and desktop.

251
00:16:58.215 --> 00:17:00.643
And if there is no exact icon,

252
00:17:00.643 --> 00:17:05.612
the OS will click the closest one and
it will resize the icon.

253
00:17:05.612 --> 00:17:09.335
The recommended sizes today is 512 by 512.

254
00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:12.630
You can also add an Android one, it's 192.

255
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:18.823
There are other sizes, if it's the same
icon you don't need to actually do that.

256
00:17:18.823 --> 00:17:22.233
But if you're a designer sometimes you
actually want a different icon and

257
00:17:22.233 --> 00:17:23.445
different resolutions.

258
00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:27.097
So if that's the case,
you can actually provide more than one.

259
00:17:27.097 --> 00:17:29.218
There are some deprecated sizes.

260
00:17:29.218 --> 00:17:34.408
That means that if you follow some
guidelines that you can find online,

261
00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:38.144
they will say that you
should provide those sizes.

262
00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:41.938
But no one is using those sizes,
so don't do that.

263
00:17:41.938 --> 00:17:45.724
And also what we do have is some
sizes that can be applied for

264
00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:47.748
simpler versions of the icon.

265
00:17:47.748 --> 00:17:51.806
Sometimes the icon is is complex,
so they have complex shapes.

266
00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:56.194
Well, then you can create a simpler
version, okay, on these sizes that can

267
00:17:56.194 --> 00:18:00.870
be used on some special places where it's
really small, such as the status bar.
