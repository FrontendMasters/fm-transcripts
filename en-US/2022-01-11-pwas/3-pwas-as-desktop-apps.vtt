WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.396
So, I'm here with Google Chrome for
desktop.

2
00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:08.456
And I'm on a Mac, but it can be
also a Linux, a Chromebook device,

3
00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:12.692
or a Windows device, from Windows 7, okay?

4
00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:18.089
So I just need to go to
a URL that has a PWA inside.

5
00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.100
Many apps, it can be a Starbucks.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.080
Even it can be, for
example, Amazon Luna or

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.501
Google Stadia for
cloud gaming, they are PWAs.

8
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.986
But I will try YouTube music.

9
00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:35.145
It's music.youtube.com, it's a PWA.

10
00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:37.675
And how do I know it's a PWA?

11
00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:41.937
Well, actually, after a while,
if you look at the URL bar,

12
00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.379
you're going to see a new
icon that will appear.

13
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.164
Actually, the browser is
making some tests and

14
00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:50.747
we're going to talk
about that in a minute.

15
00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:56.460
If the test passes, you will see this
icon that says Install YouTube Music.

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.153
And also in the menu,
you will find Install YouTube Music.

17
00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:04.894
If at this point you're asking,
hey, who is going to know that?

18
00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:08.607
Well, give me a second because I will show
you another example that looks better.

19
00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:13.593
If I click on Install YouTube Music,
I have a nice native dialog saying,

20
00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:16.803
do you wanna install the app,
YouTube music?

21
00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:19.845
And I can click Install, and
it will actually install my app.

22
00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:23.111
Before actually doing that,
let me show you another example.

23
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:25.923
That if you're a web designer or
web developer,

24
00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:27.851
you will probably like this PWA.

25
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:29.982
It's called Squoosh.

26
00:01:29.982 --> 00:01:32.068
It's squoosh.app.

27
00:01:32.068 --> 00:01:38.019
It's actually an image compressor,
so you can actually drop a PNG,

28
00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:42.328
even an animated GIF, and
it can compress that and

29
00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:48.914
convert that into a different format or
a more compressed PNG or a WebP file.

30
00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:54.613
If you look at within the UI at the top
right, we have an Install button.

31
00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:58.713
This is actually not a native button,
it's HTML.

32
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:07.428
I just wanna show you this is just
a button, okay, an HTML button.

33
00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:11.597
Well, actually, so
within the user interface of your PWA,

34
00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.162
you can have a button.

35
00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:17.464
And if I click there,
it actually triggers that native dialog.

36
00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:23.111
And if I now install Squoosh and
also I can install YouTube Music,

37
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:30.007
what will happen is now we are going to
have standalone apps from YouTube Music.

38
00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:36.702
And Squoosh, and
they have their own window,

39
00:02:36.702 --> 00:02:41.281
they appear in the alt tab or
common tab YouTube Music, Squoosh.

40
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:46.868
They appear in the search, meaning if I
search for a Squoosh, I have the app.

41
00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:51.676
In Windows, they appear in
the Start menu as any other app.

42
00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:55.446
And now it has its own window,
and you can see at the window,

43
00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:59.694
it's actually separated from
Google Chrome, from the browser.

44
00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:05.548
And that's kind of the idea of how the PWA
installation looks like on desktop.

45
00:03:05.548 --> 00:03:10.194
And also you can see we have other
options here such as on YouTube Music,

46
00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:11.672
we have a back button.

47
00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:15.198
So I can click here this is Adele,
I think.

48
00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:16.811
We don't need to hear that.

49
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.516
And we have a back button.

50
00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:21.944
We have a reload button.

51
00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:24.352
And, of course, this is music so

52
00:03:24.352 --> 00:03:28.742
we can actually have background
audio working here as well.

53
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:33.221
And over the title bar, we have also
a way to see all the extensions,

54
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.274
the Google Chrome extension.

55
00:03:35.274 --> 00:03:40.099
And there is a menu where you can actually
copy the current URL because it's

56
00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.103
still the web.

57
00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:45.072
You can open this in Chrome,
you can uninstall the app or

58
00:03:45.072 --> 00:03:49.991
you can access some, it's like
a mini menu from the browser, okay?

59
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.723
So this is different on Android,
on iOS, iPadOS, or desktop.

60
00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:55.917
It depends on the iOS.

61
00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:58.679
How the window is render is different.

62
00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:03.236
But on both you can see that now
we have a different color for

63
00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:07.337
the title bar,
Squoosh has this kind of pink there.

64
00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:11.552
So we're going to see later how
we can set up these colors and

65
00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:13.671
these metadata for our apps.

66
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:15.609
And it's a window, so

67
00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.733
its responsive design will actually
respond here as a normal website.

68
00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:25.151
With one specific thing that
we need to have in mind,

69
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:30.444
is that we have something known as a mini
mode, that was not available on the web.

70
00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:35.419
We can actually get really small
with PWA standalone windows.

71
00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.450
So for example, YouTube Music
when you are in the mini mode,

72
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.909
just renders controls, just that.

73
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.815
This mini mode is actually smaller
than the smaller window that

74
00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:48.955
you can get in the browser.

75
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.523
So it's kind of a new breakpoint for

76
00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:55.383
your responsive design that
you need to take care of.

77
00:04:55.383 --> 00:04:58.356
We have a question about the camera APIs.

78
00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:03.494
If they're better or
not compared with in the native world.

79
00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:08.564
Well, let's see, if you wanna take
a picture or if you wanna record a video,

80
00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:13.954
you can actually do that on every
platform, iOS, Android, iPad, and desktop.

81
00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:17.638
If you wanna get more control of,
for example,

82
00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:21.970
the zoom level or
some internal settings of the camera,

83
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.793
you have some of that on Android only,
on Google Chrome on Android, okay?

84
00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:32.388
Because there is an API to actually
get some more advanced settings.

85
00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:36.036
And also some of the settings
are coming to desktop.

86
00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:40.055
So think about this,
most of the things, the pandemic,

87
00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:44.687
a lot of tools appear to actually
do meetings, online meetings.

88
00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:49.109
So every tool that you see
typically on Zoom, Meet or Teams,

89
00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:51.634
it's actually coming to the web.

90
00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:54.148
So Chrome is probably the leader here.

91
00:05:54.148 --> 00:05:58.770
So on Chrome APIs,
you have most of the abilities

92
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.509
that you have also in the native world.

93
00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.826
And on Safari,
typically it goes a little behind, but for

94
00:06:06.826 --> 00:06:09.657
basic camera management, it works.

95
00:06:09.657 --> 00:06:13.777
I mean on iOS you can also for example,
pick if you want the selfie camera or

96
00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:17.713
the biomental camera, so
you can actually select that, that works.

97
00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:21.649
But if you want more control,
like fine control, yeah,

98
00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.361
you probably need to go native, okay?

99
00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:29.373
But for video calls, it just works.

100
00:06:29.373 --> 00:06:33.940
There are many PWAs that are actually
based on video calls, and

101
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.073
they work pretty well, starting with
Google Duo, following with Apple FaceTime.

102
00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:43.969
So now with FaceTime,
it's an Apple application.

103
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.868
But now you can start
the session in FaceTime and

104
00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:52.367
share a URL with a Windows user or
with an Android user.

105
00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:56.076
And in that case,
it's a PWA created by Apple.

106
00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:58.631
So FaceTime has a PWA.

107
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:02.955
Also there is a good one,
it's called desktop.com,

108
00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:08.125
it's app.desktop.com,
that's the URL of the PWA that you can

109
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:13.303
actually try and see the camera use
such that they have over a PWA.

110
00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:15.191
And it's just a pure PWA.

111
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:19.334
The question is about the process,
and how that works,

112
00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:24.108
in terms of are we talking about
the same process as the browser?

113
00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:28.430
On desktop, we should say that,
yes, it's the same process.

114
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.738
So when you have a PWA,
if you kill the browser process,

115
00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:34.854
it will also kill your PWA.

116
00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:37.725
So because we are still a website,

117
00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:42.874
this is not like if you have
heard about things like electron,

118
00:07:42.874 --> 00:07:48.238
in electron, it's like a hybrid,
like PhoneGap for desktop.

119
00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:51.925
In that case,
when you compile an Electron application,

120
00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:56.755
you're shipping your own browser engine,
your own web rendering engine.

121
00:07:56.755 --> 00:08:02.673
We're not doing that on the PWA side,
with advantages and problems.

122
00:08:02.673 --> 00:08:06.836
So one of the problem is that if you
close or if you kill the Chrome or

123
00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:10.489
the browser's process,
you're also killing the app.

124
00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.850
It's not typical use case,
but, yeah, it might happen.

125
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.241
The advantage is that we
are not consuming more memory,

126
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:19.848
because it's the same rendering engine.

127
00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:26.062
And most users always
have that browser opened.

128
00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:31.218
So we're not consuming more
resources from the desktop.

129
00:08:31.218 --> 00:08:36.013
Another great advantage,
really great advantage,

130
00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:42.618
is that because it's actually the same
process, you can share cookies,

131
00:08:42.618 --> 00:08:48.174
store ASH, IndexeDB,
data between the browser and the PWA.

132
00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:50.266
Because it's actually the same thing.

133
00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:55.673
So these windows that we have here
are actually like a browser tab,

134
00:08:55.673 --> 00:08:58.003
but outside of the browser.

135
00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:02.557
In fact, we can also create, you can see
that I'm in YouTube Music that looks

136
00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:05.516
like any other Mac application
with its own menu.

137
00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:10.051
I can great the new window, so I can have
two YouTube Music windows, okay, for

138
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.686
example.

139
00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:14.320
And if I sign in,
I'm going to sign in on both,

140
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.164
because it's actually
the same as the browser.

141
00:09:18.164 --> 00:09:22.825
So we have a better goal question, can we
control the minimum size of the window?

142
00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:25.709
And I will make it a browser question.

143
00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:32.673
Can we set up the preferred size of
the window or the position of the window?

144
00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:37.926
Actually today, the specs that we're going
to cover later don't have that support.

145
00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:42.569
So we cannot set in some place a minimum.

146
00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:47.800
However, we can use some APIs that
has been in the web since the 90s,

147
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.400
since I ever started doing web
development, that works pretty well here.

148
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.475
So it's just some global functions and

149
00:09:56.475 --> 00:10:00.866
variables that we have
available in the Window option.

150
00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.866
So we can resize the window.

151
00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:08.510
Because we are in a standalone window,
we have the power to do that.

152
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:16.421
With tabs and browsers, typically we
cannot change the browser window size.

153
00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:20.551
But because this is our own window,
we can actually learn from JavaScript.

154
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:25.804
With just simple call, we can resize,
we can reposition the window.

155
00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:30.730
So if the user goes beyond
a size that you define,

156
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.017
with JavaScript and
listening to the resize event,

157
00:10:36.017 --> 00:10:40.238
you can actually go back to your minimum.

158
00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:44.194
So using some JavaScript,
you can actually make that work.

159
00:10:44.194 --> 00:10:46.684
Here you can see a Windows PWA.

160
00:10:46.684 --> 00:10:49.790
So trivago for a hotel search.

161
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.495
You go to trivago on Windows,
you install the app, and now that app is

162
00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:59.301
available on Windows as with the Mac,
and that app will be resizable.

163
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:05.569
And also it's going to be available in the
third menu like any other app on Windows.

164
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:09.234
Just remember this is,
this is not just on the latest Windows.

165
00:11:09.234 --> 00:11:15.182
This is the Starbuck's PWA
running on Windows 7.

166
00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:18.278
For those of you working
with enterprise customers.

167
00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:23.559
So this is something new,
that it's actually pretty cool.

168
00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:29.295
So if you have ever worked with these
corporate customers like banks and

169
00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:34.568
financial companies,
they typically don't have permission.

170
00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:37.653
Users don't have permission
to install apps.

171
00:11:37.653 --> 00:11:39.298
They can just use the browser.

172
00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:43.339
And those were actually probably
their responsibles of i.e.,

173
00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:47.685
still been here with us,
because they cannot install other browser.

174
00:11:47.685 --> 00:11:50.758
But let's say that era has ended.

175
00:11:50.758 --> 00:11:55.544
So today, they typically have
Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

176
00:11:55.544 --> 00:12:01.481
Well, even if a user cannot install
native apps, they can install PWAs.

177
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:04.946
Because it's actually a browser's process.

178
00:12:04.946 --> 00:12:10.553
So if a user, corporate user,
has permission to install the browser,

179
00:12:10.553 --> 00:12:15.231
to use the browser,
they have permission to install PWAs.

180
00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:20.521
So when you do corporate applications,
you can actually deploy, deploy in quotes,

181
00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:25.159
because we are not actually deploying
an app, we are deploying a website.

182
00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:31.128
But we can deploy corporate
apps without the intervention

183
00:12:31.128 --> 00:12:35.645
of the security teams within that company.

184
00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:40.584
So today, this is global stats worldwide,

185
00:12:40.584 --> 00:12:47.933
installation can happen in 86%
of the use of browsing the web.

186
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:52.507
So let's say that roughly nine
of ten users that are actually

187
00:12:52.507 --> 00:12:56.373
visiting your website can
actually install a PWA.

188
00:12:56.373 --> 00:13:01.083
And when we check offline support,

189
00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:07.057
it's 93%, but 86 can install the app.

190
00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:11.671
Probably you're thinking here,
okay, where is the rest?

191
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:17.058
So why we still have like 10%
of the users without support?

192
00:13:17.058 --> 00:13:20.294
Well, we do not have support or

193
00:13:20.294 --> 00:13:24.905
plans to support from an Android Facebook.

194
00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:28.309
And probably you're thinking Facebook Max,
that's not the browser.

195
00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:30.249
But actually, I'm not sure.

196
00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:34.855
When I'm saying Facebook,
it's Facebook the company,

197
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:40.312
it involves many products including
Instagram and even Messenger.

198
00:13:40.312 --> 00:13:44.744
When you click on a link on those apps,
by default,

199
00:13:44.744 --> 00:13:51.458
that link is rendered in an inner browser,
not actually in the real browser.

200
00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:54.170
And that's called
the Mobile Facebook Browser.

201
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:59.707
Well, PWAs are not compatible
with that situation.

202
00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:02.268
And again, when I'm saying not compatible,

203
00:14:02.268 --> 00:14:07.339
that doesn't mean that your content won't
be rendered, because it's a website, okay?

204
00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:10.230
And later we're going to talk about the P,

205
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.583
the first letter in PWA has to
do with progressive enhancement.

206
00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:17.952
And the whole idea is that if one ability,

207
00:14:17.952 --> 00:14:23.935
one capability is not available,
anyway, the basic content will work.

208
00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:29.486
On iOS and iPadOS, it doesn't work on
any other browser that is on Safari and

209
00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:32.189
it doesn't work on the Apple Watch.

210
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:37.482
The Apple Watch has a browser, but it's
not supporting the technology for PWAs.

211
00:14:37.482 --> 00:14:42.414
And why Google Chrome or
Firefox or Edge on iOS are not

212
00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:46.913
supporting PWAs, that's an Apple decision.

213
00:14:46.913 --> 00:14:53.014
So those browsers are actually
not what you think they are.

214
00:14:53.014 --> 00:14:54.429
So Google Chrome on iOS,
it's not actually Google Chrome.

215
00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:58.150
It looks like Google Chrome.

216
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.882
It has the Google Chrome icon.

217
00:14:59.882 --> 00:15:04.396
You can synchronize your
bookmarks with Google Chrome, but

218
00:15:04.396 --> 00:15:10.342
the rendering engine is actually Safari,
WebKit to be technically accurate.

219
00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:13.112
So is the WebKit WebView.

220
00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.971
Well, PWAs are not available there.

221
00:15:15.971 --> 00:15:19.569
And Firefox on desktop and
Opera on desktop,

222
00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:22.799
they do not support PWAs installation.

223
00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:25.882
They do support PWA
installation on mobile.

224
00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:32.595
And Safari on the Mac is also not
suitable for installation at this point.

225
00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:35.903
So Safari on iOS only.

226
00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:40.788
And finally, also in talking generally,
we don't have

227
00:15:40.788 --> 00:15:45.775
support in Smart TVs,
Smartwatches, Game Consoles, or

228
00:15:45.775 --> 00:15:51.191
XR Headsets, that's augmented reality or
virtual reality.

229
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:55.557
There are some exceptions to that,
such as the Hololens or the Xbox,

230
00:15:55.557 --> 00:16:00.530
that through the store, not through
the browser, but through the app store,

231
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.415
you can actually deploy or
distribute a PWA.

232
00:16:03.415 --> 00:16:08.165
And Facebook has also
announced that they will

233
00:16:08.165 --> 00:16:12.683
support PWAs in the Oculus platform later.
