00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:02.618
So now we are back on Android and

2
00:00:02.618 --> 00:00:08.113
I wanna try my PWA here because we
haven't installed PWA in Android yet.

3
00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:12.398
So how can we run this,
if I open Chrome and

4
00:00:12.398 --> 00:00:17.557
type local host 5000,
we may have a problem.

5
00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:22.557
The problem is that this is
a full Linux stack, the Android,

6
00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:27.473
and local host is actually
pointing to the Android itself.

7
00:00:27.473 --> 00:00:32.193
So and this happens with an emulator,
because it's a built-on machine.

8
00:00:32.193 --> 00:00:36.648
So without publishing
this on the Internet,

9
00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:42.755
how can we test my PWA or
our PWA directly in the Android phone?

10
00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:44.379
Well, we have a trick.

11
00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.904
Going back to Chrome,

12
00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:54.876
I will go to chrome://inspect.

13
00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:59.151
Here we can see that our phone,
in this case my Pixel,

14
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.721
is connected with Chrome 94.

15
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:06.643
And what I can do is
enable port forwarding.

16
00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:12.659
Port forwarding will actually let us
select a port inside the Android,

17
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270
such as 5000.

18
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.982
And then IP address or host,
and port on my computer.

19
00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:26.379
So that means, that if I try localhost
5000 on the Android phone or

20
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.400
on the Android emulator.

21
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.222
If we localhost 5000 in my host computer,

22
00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:35.849
it doesn't need to be
the same port number.

23
00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:40.457
So, now if I refresh, I can see this here,

24
00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:43.913
I can install the app from here or

25
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:49.036
from the little menu that
appear at the bottom.

26
00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:54.222
So now I can install the app,
we see the icon, and I can click install.

27
00:01:54.222 --> 00:02:00.385
Remember, this is going to
compile an app in Google servers.

28
00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:04.608
In fact,
that's known as a web APK Mint server.

29
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:08.785
It's minting like s coin,
it's minting an APK.

30
00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:13.037
Now we need to wait because
it takes a couple of seconds.

31
00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:20.593
And now finally it's done,
it's added to the home screen, Codepad.

32
00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:24.789
So now if I go to the home screen,
I have Codepad.

33
00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.511
And if I open here, I have Codepad.

34
00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:35.979
But it feels weird,
Codepad is only available in landscape.

35
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.198
I'm not sure if anyone remembers why.

36
00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:42.557
I'm trying to go portray with
my phone it doesn't work.

37
00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:44.450
Let's go back to VS Code.

38
00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:53.438
Web manifest, look at this orientation
landscape, we actually asked for this.

39
00:02:53.438 --> 00:02:57.109
And this was not compatible with iOS.

40
00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.600
So in this case, I don't want this,
so I'm going to remove this or

41
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.264
I can keep it with any, it's the same.

42
00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:09.000
And now I need to reinstall the apps,
so I'll need to uninstall the app.

43
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.652
On Android there is no way to install
more than one APK from the same app.

44
00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:18.234
So if I try to install it again, on the
menu, you can see that instead of install

45
00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:23.042
I have open, that will actually open the
app instead of installing the app again.

46
00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:28.775
So I need to uninstall
the app as any other app so

47
00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:36.130
I go to Codepad &gt; Uninstall,
okay, like that, refresh.

48
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.326
So we're going to try
to install this again,

49
00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:49.064
We can see it's adding the Codepad,
this is compiling this on the server.

50
00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:59.414
And finally, we have our app on
Android that works on portrait,

51
00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:04.631
of course this should work such as,
finish the app

52
00:04:07.084 --> 00:04:10.984
And if these should be
saved offline as well.

53
00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:16.643
So I actually my PWA is installable
on Android, it has a nice icon.

54
00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:23.332
And even if you don't believe that,
we can actually go to Settings &gt; Apps,

55
00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:28.156
and our app code bar appears
there with the right icon.

56
00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:32.409
And it even says, that it was
installed from the Play Store, okay?

57
00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.837
But we all know it's not true.

58
00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:38.898
But it was actually
compiled by the Play Store.

59
00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:42.583
The web APK was compiled
by the Play Store.

60
00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.164
So now our PWA Is working on Android.

61
00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:50.973
However, we wanna improve
the installation experience.

62
00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:55.679
And also we wanna add some
little integration with OS,

63
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.940
so that's the next step.
