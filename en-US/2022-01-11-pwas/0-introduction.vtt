WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.329
So my name is Maximiliano,
I know it's a long name so

2
00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:07.354
I can go by Max this is building
PWAs from Scratch, so welcome.

3
00:00:07.354 --> 00:00:11.612
I will go really quickly about
myself I'm a mobile web developer so

4
00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:14.284
I'm from Argentina, from Bueno Aires.

5
00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:19.424
So I've been doing web development
since 1995 so long time ago, and

6
00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:24.665
also mobile apps since 2001,
before the iPhone before the Android.

7
00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:29.768
So, I have started actually with Netscape,
I have been doing,

8
00:00:29.768 --> 00:00:35.357
my first website was actually built
with DOS, just to get you an idea.

9
00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:39.072
Okay, so anyway, so
I have been working on the web and

10
00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.393
publishing content for a while.

11
00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:46.355
So I have a lot of books that I offer,
and the latest books are on web

12
00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:52.147
performance and also I have been authored
some articles and content on PWA.

13
00:00:52.147 --> 00:00:56.139
That's the topic that we're
going to cover today so

14
00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:01.490
you can find some of the content that
I have been offering at fir .dev,

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.950
that's my website, so it's time to start.

16
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.738
So before starting, let's see quickly
what we're going to cover today so

17
00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:12.246
we're going to start with the web app,

18
00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:17.121
I understand that you know how to create
the web app, but it's not yet a PWA.

19
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:21.383
So we're going to understand
why it's not a PWA and

20
00:01:21.383 --> 00:01:25.753
how to make insolation we're
going to set up icons.

21
00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:30.853
We're going to see how to enhance the UI,
because now we're going to be

22
00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:36.299
rendering content outside of the browser,
not just within the browser UI.

23
00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.180
We're going to be an app and
a standalone app and

24
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.262
that needs some new
improvements in terms of CSS.

25
00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:48.566
And how we are dealing with UI by going to
the Service Worker a nd if you don't know

26
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:51.665
what that is, don't worry,
we're going to get there.

27
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:56.486
We're going to make an offline experience
we're going to see also how to,

28
00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:59.713
let's say,
invite our users to install the app.

29
00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:04.149
And also we're going to cover and
discuss about the apps Store and

30
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.950
how we can actually distribute
our PWA in the app store.

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.582
I understand that you know HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript so

32
00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:16.740
that's all you don't need to know anything
about mobile apps or native apps or.

33
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.883
Android apps or iOS apps, just web,
okay, you are a web designer,

34
00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:22.642
or you're a web developer.

35
00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:27.265
So you will be able now to create your
own first progressive web app we going,

36
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:30.022
just start talking about
what's a PWA okay.

37
00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:35.143
So, what's a PWA well, PWA of course
stands for precisive web app,

38
00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:38.869
probably you know that,
but, what understand.

39
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:44.377
So this is a the cover article
that I offer for net magazine and

40
00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:50.971
I really like the idea that the PWA is
actually the current DNA of the web.

41
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:55.842
And this is important PWA is
just the web it's actually a set

42
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.065
of practices is like the sign pattern.

43
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:06.763
To create app like experiences using just
the web dot from that we know and we love.

44
00:03:06.763 --> 00:03:11.918
So let's try to define Progressive Web App
and first I have maybe bad

45
00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:17.436
news it's an open definition,
which means that we don't have a clear,

46
00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:22.255
straightforward definition of
what a progressive web app is.

47
00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:28.306
In fact, maybe you have already done
a PWA at some point at least so,

48
00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:34.481
but let's say that it's an app that
is built with web technologies.

49
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.908
Sometimes it's not clear also,
what's an app like, for example,

50
00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:41.822
is Wikipedia an app or
is just a website okay.

51
00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:46.168
So, I mean, it's not so clear,
but let's say that It's

52
00:03:46.168 --> 00:03:51.135
something that looks like an app or
it has services from an app, but

53
00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:54.794
completely developed
using web technologies.

54
00:03:54.794 --> 00:04:01.052
It can work online or offline and probably
that the last part is actually new for us.

55
00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:06.346
Okay, now we can make that app available
even without user's connection,

56
00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:10.070
without network connection,
it's installable and

57
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.390
this is also new and
I'm not talking about a bookmark, okay?

58
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.440
I'm talking about a real installation
in the operating system and

59
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.223
the icon that we are installing will
actually have Stand Alone experience.

60
00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:30.107
Which means it will be rendered
outside of the browser completely

61
00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:34.814
separated from the browser at
least from a user's perspective

62
00:04:34.814 --> 00:04:39.193
because we still have the that
browser behind the scenes.

63
00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:44.594
Because it's a steal the web isn't this
is not like we are taking a website and

64
00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:48.017
we are compiling that
website into a native app.

65
00:04:48.017 --> 00:04:52.550
That's not the case we are still
under the web platform,

66
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.233
under the web umbrella so and this is
ideal for all those apps out there.

67
00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:03.183
There are just consuming web content or
web services if you think about this,

68
00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:06.468
just take your phone and
see how many of those apps.

69
00:05:06.468 --> 00:05:12.446
That you have there are actually just
consuming a JSON from a web server,

70
00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:15.192
or just content can be even HTML.

71
00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:20.403
They don't have anything else and
the PWA platform are the techniques

72
00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:25.534
that we're gonna see today are clearly
ideal for these situations.

73
00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:31.090
Because think about this when if you're
just creating a native app with Kotlin for

74
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.356
Android, or with Swift for iOS.

75
00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:36.844
Or even if you're using
things like react Native,

76
00:05:36.844 --> 00:05:42.046
you're actually creating a browser,
you're creating your own browser.

77
00:05:42.046 --> 00:05:46.743
And we already have a browser and
we already have a lot of technologies and

78
00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:50.596
languages in the web platform
that is not just HTML and CSS.

79
00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:55.492
Today, we have things like web assembly,
web RTC so

80
00:05:55.492 --> 00:06:00.501
there are a lot of API's that
are actually behind this

81
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:06.763
web platform umbrella that can
actually add more power to our PWA.

82
00:06:06.763 --> 00:06:12.442
And it's also ideal for you if you're here
it means that you're a web designer or

83
00:06:12.442 --> 00:06:15.880
web developer so
you actually work with the web.

84
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.879
And now when you have a client that
is asking you for a nap, you can say,

85
00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:27.188
yeah, I can do that we can do
apps now it's not just a website.

86
00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:31.931
And even if you're thinking about
the app store, we can actually ship,

87
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:35.840
a PWA in app stores and
we're gonna see how to do that later.

88
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.809
So the PWA platform, it's actually
empowering all of us now we can create

89
00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:46.120
experiences not just for the browser but
also for different operating systems
