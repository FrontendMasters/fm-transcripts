00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.311
Before finishing talking about icons,
we need to talk about maskable icons.

2
00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:12.728
Bcause that's something that affects
Android, and it will affect our icon.

3
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:18.306
As we saw before, up to Android 7,
this kind of phone at this point,

4
00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.401
Android accepted icons in any shape.

5
00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:25.567
So you could actually provide
icons that are transparent, so

6
00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:30.449
if you look at that get Get Kana,
it's a Japanese PWA, or the NASA icon,

7
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.273
is fully transparent with its own shape.

8
00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:38.226
But from Android 8,
all the icons must comply with the shape,

9
00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.386
that is set at the OS level.

10
00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:45.902
And each launcher or each manufacturer can
set a different shape, you have circle,

11
00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:51.900
a squircle, rounded square, square, blah,
blah, blah, blah they can be many shapes.

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.177
So when you provide your icon,
your icon should be prepared for

13
00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:00.873
being adaptive to these different shapes.

14
00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:06.959
So, because if not, look at what happens
with the NASA icon at the right,

15
00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.916
or the Get Kana icon, or even Lyft.

16
00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:14.763
So they are actually smaller
within a shape because,

17
00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:20.268
we're not providing an icon
compatible with multi shapes.

18
00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:23.211
To solve the problem in
the webapp manifest,

19
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.006
we must provide the maskable icon, okay?

20
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:30.380
Iit's a serious square icon
like the one that we have, but

21
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.287
with enough discardable panning content
out, of what is known as a safe area.

22
00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:40.736
So this is the official
definition from the W3C spec,

23
00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:45.376
it's a sensory position circle
with a radius of 40% of

24
00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:50.230
the icon's width, and
this point you're thinking what?

25
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.604
Okay, that's right you understand
what's going on, we have an icon,

26
00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:55.762
it's in a square.

27
00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:58.954
We need to actually render
a circle in the middle,

28
00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:02.689
with a radius of 40%, and
that's known as a safe area.

29
00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.633
Everything that is outside of that safe
area, can be actually be outside of

30
00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:11.640
the icon, so we should be very
careful of what we're doing.

31
00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:16.284
How do you solve these from
the word manifest spec?

32
00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:22.114
It's another icon with a property purpose,
maskable, that's all.

33
00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:24.700
So it's pretty simple but,

34
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.885
we actually need to check if our icon,
works well or not.

35
00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:40.608
To do that, I'm going to an online
free tool it's called Maskable.app.

36
00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:47.950
It's actually a PWA so you can install
this maskable tool as a PWA if you want

37
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.897
to, if not,
you can use it from the browser.

38
00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:54.235
Here you can open your own icon, and

39
00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:58.695
see if how it looks like
from different shapes.

40
00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:02.038
For example, I will select my icon,

41
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.053
And here we can try different shapes.

42
00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:15.613
And you can realize that we have
a problem on different shapes on Android,

43
00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:18.946
my icon is not like maskable ready, right?

44
00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:23.971
Because, our content is outside
of the safe area, so we can

45
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:30.116
go to the editor in this maskable.app
website, upload the file again.

46
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.758
And from here,
we can have a small web editor,

47
00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:39.958
we can add more padding until
we are actually happy with that.

48
00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:45.586
We can see how it looks like of course the
background color doesn't look nice yet.

49
00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:50.291
But, I can pick the background color,
change the color, and

50
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:54.738
I can use a picker,
to use the same color like that, okay?

51
00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:59.846
And now,
it looks good on every Android phone,

52
00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:03.047
my PWA icon, will look good.

53
00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:07.396
So I'm done, so
I will just export this in the Mac size or

54
00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:14.080
I can just pick 512 by 512 is actually
the one that is recommended for maskable.

55
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.696
We'll download this, in my folder,

56
00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:26.718
and I can call this icon maskable,
it's a PNG.

57
00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:32.384
We see now that we have our new icon, I
just need to add a new entry, to the JSON.

58
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.490
It's going to point to maskable,
it's 512 by 512,

59
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.911
and now we need to add another property,

60
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:47.252
it's called purpose, and
the value is maskable.

61
00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:49.637
So now, if we go back to Chrome,

62
00:04:56.512 --> 00:05:02.942
And we load our PWA, looking at
the icons here, I can see the new one.

63
00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:07.587
And also there is a tester, a quick
tester within Chrome here, that says,

64
00:05:07.587 --> 00:05:10.857
show only the minimum safe area for
maskable icons.

65
00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:14.581
So now, it's going to show me,
that this one looks good,

66
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.720
that's actually the maskable.

67
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.369
So, when we installed this on Android,
it will actually use this one.

68
00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:27.139
But because on Android we are not
passing the criteria yet, and

69
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.109
we want actually to have a full web APK,

70
00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:35.615
we will need to wait a couple of more
minutes to actually see it in action.
