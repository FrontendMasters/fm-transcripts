00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.070
We are getting to the end of the workshop.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.990
So, remember what we have covered.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.910
We started with a web
app that was not a PWA.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.360
It's not installable,
it wasn't available offline.

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.520
Then we added installation.

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.032
Remember there was a manifest,
some properties there,

7
00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:25.030
including display standalone and
name start URL.

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.660
We set up the icons.

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.245
Remember we have normal icons,
we have the maskable icon for

10
00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:34.990
Android, we have the iOS icon,
but it's actually in the HTML.

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.407
Maybe in the future,

12
00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:41.065
Apple will support icons directly
from the manifest, it's not now.

13
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.393
Then we enhance a little
bit the user interface,

14
00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:47.800
we remove for
example selection over icons.

15
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.910
We also add a safe area so

16
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.726
we are not having a toolbar over
places that are managed by the OS.

17
00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:58.020
We added a Service Worker.

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.928
So we understood what a Service Worker is,
this new paradigm on the web,

19
00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:06.020
where we can actually code a web server,
but client side.

20
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.450
Remember, it's a middleware, so, and the P
in PWA means progressive enhancement.

21
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.210
So if it's not there,
everything should work anyway.

22
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.419
So don't rely on the existence of
the Service Worker to create the good for

23
00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:20.460
web app.

24
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.045
If it's there, it's great,
you will have a faster experience,

25
00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:26.680
but if it's not everything
should work anyway.

26
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.100
We made an offline experience, so
now our app works completely offline.

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.898
We have all the assets that we need,
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web font.

28
00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:42.702
And also we're using local storage to
save the notes that we are typing.

29
00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.110
We have added or
enhanced the Installation Support.

30
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.507
So we have now an Install button that
with the before install prompt, and

31
00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:54.110
we have a better installation
dialog on Android.

32
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.930
Add in the screenshot, and
also some descriptions.

33
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.570
And finally, we discussed how to create
the package for different app stores.

34
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.140
So that's actually how you can take any
website, any web app that you have and

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.740
convert that into an app, and
convert that into a progressive web app.

36
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.430
Thank you for attending this workshop and
see you around.
