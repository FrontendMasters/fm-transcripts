00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.084
Let's do an exercise, so the very
first thing that we want to do for

2
00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:10.433
our flower petals now that
we have them is let's try

3
00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:13.996
coloring our petals by our movie genres.

4
00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:18.151
So, what we want to do is we want to,

5
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:24.397
here's the cell that you're
going to be working in.

6
00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:27.647
And then, what we want to do is we have,

7
00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:32.475
right here, we already have
created five path elements.

8
00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:39.051
And I've kind of already bound the, define
the attribute for each of these paths and

9
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:44.910
we're using the petal path that we
created in the previous notebook.

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.030
Hopefully, you're seeing your
own petal path being drawn here,

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.510
and what we want to do is we
want to select all these paths,

12
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.550
we want to bind our movie data.

13
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.675
So our movies data is right here,
that's what it looks like,

14
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.520
you can kind of open it up and
take a look.

15
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.961
And we want to set film attribute on this
paths based on each of the movies genre.

16
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:19.585
And so, I also have this object for
lookup for

17
00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:24.632
the top four genres and then this other.

18
00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:30.550
So if your movies genre

19
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.520
isn't in here in these top four, then I
have this color for all the other genres.

20
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.130
And also, you might have noticed that for
each of these movies,

21
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.300
oftentimes, the genre is
an array of multiple genres.

22
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.140
And so, just for
the sake of our exercise, let's just use

23
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.370
the very first genre that appears and
then use that to kind of map our fill.

24
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.510
And if you're interested,
you can also play around with

25
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.347
the colors, but
let's do this exercise in this cell.

26
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.319
And I think this lookup is called

27
00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.266
color object, I think.

28
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:25.685
Sorry.

29
00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:32.905
I think it's called color object,
is what this lookup is called then,

30
00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:37.620
it's called colors, I'm sorry, yeah,
so this lookup is called colors.
