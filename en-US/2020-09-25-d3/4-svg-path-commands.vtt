00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.350
I want us to specifically
dive into SVG paths.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.860
And that define attribute
I mentioned earlier,

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.800
because even within the SVG
elements I use really, often.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.590
I find that like the path
element is extremely powerful.

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.840
And once we have a good understanding for
the syntax of that defined attribute,

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.510
we can really draw, really,
any shape that we might dream up.

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.950
Or as we talked about earlier, anything
that we can dream up in Illustrator,

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.770
we can draw in the browser.

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.835
And so
let's take a look at this flower petal,

10
00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:44.022
and this is my little cherry
blossom flower petal.

11
00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:49.926
And so here is the, SVG elements,

12
00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:53.996
so this is what we need to

13
00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:58.893
write to create this shape.

14
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:03.242
And so here we have the SVG and
I say I just want a width and

15
00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:07.140
height of 100 pixels by 100 pixels.

16
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.502
And you can ignore the styling.

17
00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:17.520
But the main thing is this path SVG path.

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.800
And we have the Define attribute.

19
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.303
And we're just saying,
don't fill it with any color.

20
00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:31.593
Show get blank I want the stroke
to have a width of 2 pixels.

21
00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:35.760
And, this is basically saying
move it to coordinate 50 pixels

22
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.220
horizontally and zero pixels vertically.

23
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.450
And so there's a lot going on here.

24
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.133
But the main part that we really, really
want to focus on is this defined stream.

25
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:55.189
And I knew that looking at it right now,

26
00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.793
it looks like a bunch of gibberish.

27
00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:04.902
Like especially if you see it in
the chrome inspector or something and

28
00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:10.202
you see that SVG path and is this string,
sometimes it looks like a lot.

29
00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:16.087
But we can actually break this
down to three different commands,

30
00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:21.000
again the commands that I
like to use quite often.

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.580
With SVG paths, and there's definitely
many more commands that you

32
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.460
can use with SVG paths.

33
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.110
And these are the ones that I think,

34
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.830
especially with the curveto
are the most powerful.

35
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.370
So the three commands are moveto,
lineto, and curveto.

36
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.690
So let's talk about how
they work a little bit.

37
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.560
So moveto has a syntax of x, y.

38
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.810
And the way that I like to think
about it is, it means pick the pen

39
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.129
off the paper and
put it back down at this position x, y.

40
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.740
And then next command is lineto.

41
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.260
And so what this one is,
is we have a x, y position and

42
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.290
what that means is if the pen
is already on the paper,

43
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.730
so we either already have

44
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.440
a moveto command before it or maybe
we're changing on some other commands.

45
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.630
But the important thing is if we
have the pen already on the paper,

46
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.360
draw a straight line to that x,
y position.

47
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.170
And so you can see it here.

48
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.310
And so we chain it off of that moveto so
we have some

49
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.580
first move to x, y position that
we already have the pen on.

50
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.810
And then we draw that straight
line to the line to x, y position.

51
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.040
And the fun one is this curveto
this cubic Bezier curve.

52
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.149
And I think that with this one, and we can
actually draw a lot of different shapes.

53
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:16.120
So with this one is that we have
three sets of x, y coordinates.

54
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.440
The first one is this
blue control point or

55
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.038
anchor I think different materials call
it different things but control point.

56
00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:33.870
The second x,y position is
this purple control point.

57
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.631
And finally, this red one is the x,
y coordinate that we should end up at.

58
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:45.238
And so the way that I like to think about
curveto is again if the pen is already

59
00:04:45.238 --> 00:04:50.581
on the paper, in this example it's
on the paper with a moveto command.

60
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:54.642
So if the pen is already on the paper,

61
00:04:54.642 --> 00:05:01.332
then we draw a straight line to
that final red x, y position.

62
00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:06.117
And then we take the blue and
purple anchor points,

63
00:05:06.117 --> 00:05:10.898
and we kind of drag it to and
we kind of like drag it and

64
00:05:10.898 --> 00:05:15.050
nudge it until we get the curve we want.

65
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.820
And so actually you can also imagine that
if right now in this particular example,

66
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.030
we have the two anchor points going up.

67
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.020
But if you for example curve the,

68
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.930
if you put the purple anchor point,
kind of below that dotted line,

69
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.110
then you can draw a curve that
kind of looks like a sine wave.

70
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.410
So, it really is about kind of where
you position these two anchor points.

71
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.559
So here's how we can break
down that flower petals define

72
00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:50.541
attribute from earlier.

73
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:56.665
So the first set of commands
is this move to 00.

74
00:05:56.665 --> 00:05:59.498
This is Greenpoint.

75
00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:05.042
And then I think of it
as I drew a straight

76
00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:10.087
line to the x = 20 and y = 100.

77
00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:15.014
And then I'm taking these
two anchor points, and

78
00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:22.541
I drag it out to 5040 and 5070 and
that's how I get this first curve.

79
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:28.250
Then what happens is I've
changed on a lineto command.

80
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.770
So that now the very end x,

81
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.252
y coordinate of my previous curve

82
00:06:36.252 --> 00:06:40.893
command is now my starting x, y and

83
00:06:40.893 --> 00:06:46.024
then I draw a straight line to 085.

84
00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:56.061
And then what happens is that previous
lineto command then switches and

85
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:59.160
becomes my starting point.

86
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.780
Draw a straight line to the ending and

87
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.922
the line to -2000 And

88
00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:15.497
then our final curve uses that previous
line to as the starting positions and

89
00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:19.719
draws the curve with
the ending point back 00.

90
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.535
And so
that's how we drew that flower petal.
