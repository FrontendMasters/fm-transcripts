00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.518
I want to take us through,

2
00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:10.580
A little explanation of SVG transform and

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.830
in particular the translate command.

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.770
So in SVG when we set translate on
an element, what we're actually doing

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.180
is we're actually setting the coordinate
system of that particular element.

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.258
So let's try kind of seeing
what that looks like.

7
00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:37.607
[COUGH] Let's play around
with these sliders and

8
00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:44.790
see kind of try and
get an intuitive feel of what that means.

9
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.248
So we have these two rectangles.

10
00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:54.170
One of them has a transform on it and
the other one does not.

11
00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.120
So this one does not have the transform
and this one does have the transform.

12
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
And let's try, so,

13
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.343
You can see that as I'm moving the x and
y around,

14
00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:19.240
the whole coordinate system for
this rectangle is moving around.

15
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.424
And then alternatively,
if we update the x and

16
00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:31.091
y position of this rectangle, then,

17
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:38.226
You can see that even though the x
y positions are exactly the same,

18
00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:45.249
these two squares are at completely
different places in our SVG.

19
00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.311
Even though it's the same SVG container,
just applying

20
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:56.644
this transform translate will change
where both of these squares are.

21
00:01:56.644 --> 00:02:02.205
And the reason why I wanted to bring
that up is because you might have

22
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:07.370
noticed that in our example we
used a translate on our paths and

23
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.560
translate or transform and
translate is very, very useful.

24
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.030
Because then what we can do is for
our define attribute,

25
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.990
our d attribute instead of having
to write your pedal path to be

26
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.900
let's say this is position 300 by 200 or
something.

27
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.000
So instead of having to write your
pedal path as starting at 300 200 and

28
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.830
then going down to 350 200 or
something like that.

29
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.687
Instead of having to do all of that
calculation, you can just pop in this

30
00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:49.502
translate and then it will be positioned
exactly where you want it to.

31
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.117
And you can keep that original kind of d

32
00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:56.140
attribute with the string
that you've already created.

33
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.578
So, and very, very helpful.

34
00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:03.721
And we end up using the transform
attribute a lot to be able to kind

35
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:09.830
of manipulate these SVG elements and
their underlying coordinate system.

36
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.486
So make sure to kind of play around so
that you have a good

37
00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:19.562
grasp on what's happening with
this underneath the hood.

38
00:03:19.562 --> 00:03:23.580
And also, I'm just really proud
of this little interaction.

39
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.520
And so, yeah.

40
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.567
So if not for nothing else, please just
play around with this so that I feel,

41
00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:37.815
[LAUGH] I don't know, I feel there was
good effort put in for this interaction.
