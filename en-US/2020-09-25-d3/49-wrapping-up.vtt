1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.970
Do you recommend any sites for
getting open data?

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.170
So let me answer a slight
bit different question,

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.920
which is like,
how do you go about collecting data?

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.389
Or how do you go about starting
a data visualization project?

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.990
And the way that I want to answer
that is I actually really recommend

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.350
when you're trying to get started with
like a data visualization project,

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.740
to start with something you
are really curious about and

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.330
that you're interested in,
rather than going through an archive

10
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.460
of open datasets, and then trying to
figure out an idea or a topic that way.

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.340
Because I find that for
myself at least, and I think for

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.100
a lot of people, if you start with
something that you're really passionate or

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.550
curious about yourself, and go out and
figure out ways to collect that data,

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.850
whether it's like scouring, like googling
actually turns up a lot of things.

15
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.921
If you have an idea of something
you're interested in, or

16
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:10.337
if you do any sort of like manual,
you can do manual data entry.

17
00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:14.238
So that Hamilton example I've showed,
those are musical lyrics, and

18
00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:16.189
so I went and collected all of that,

19
00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.650
I've manually entered all of
the data myself with the lyrics.

20
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.100
Or you can use different services have
different APIs that are really helpful.

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.732
So I will actually recommend getting
really creative with the data

22
00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:34.299
collection process or
data collection yourself.

23
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.270
So starting with a curiosity,
something you're passionate about and

24
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.528
going out to collect the data yourself.

25
00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:45.818
But if you're like,
I just want to have a set of data, and

26
00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:51.680
I just want to be able to see them and
I'll get my ideas that way.

27
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.550
The, [LAUGH]
I was gonna say,

28
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.795
there used to be,
I'm gonna get really sad saying this, but

29
00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:10.480
data.gov used to have a lot
of really great data.

30
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.651
So the federal government managed,
I think it was called data.gov,

31
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:20.383
had a really great resources about
anything that the government

32
00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:25.305
might need to keep track of,
certainly like census information.

33
00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:29.638
And although I think census information
has moved to a new website, but you can

34
00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:33.724
just google US Census or something,
and all of that should be published.

35
00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:37.055
It used to have all of these weird, sorry,

36
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:40.941
I shouldn't say weird,
it just obscures me, but

37
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:46.123
anything that you feel like
the government might be collecting and

38
00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:51.610
there used to be like data.gov,
I think it's been taken down.

39
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.180
It's been like deprecated and taken down,
and so I haven't followed up on that.

40
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.182
But I think there were
efforts to back up and

41
00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:11.650
archive data.gov, so
you might be able to find that.

42
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.160
Otherwise, I think that interestingly,
a lot of the journals

43
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.250
have GitHub repos full of datasets
that they collected for their stories.

44
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.883
So I think it's that either ProPublica or

45
00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:36.460
maybe FiveThirtyEight,

46
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.810
that has all of their data just published.

47
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.605
Yeah, so they have APIs to interact

48
00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:52.900
with their different datasets.

49
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.620
So actually maybe it
wasn't that ProPublica,

50
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.112
it might have been FiveThirtyEight,
which is another publication.

51
00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:04.910
It might be them that had some,
there we go.

52
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.963
Yeah, so fivethirtyeight/data has so

53
00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:13.532
many datasets of everything they've
collected to write their stories,

54
00:04:13.532 --> 00:04:18.131
I think New York Times probably
has some sort of equivalent.

55
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:22.398
The Pudding has also, I highly

56
00:04:22.398 --> 00:04:27.815
recommend the Pudding, great site for

57
00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:33.068
really high quality visual essays and

58
00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:38.158
storytelling, and I think they have

59
00:04:38.158 --> 00:04:43.084
a GitHub repo of their datasets that

60
00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:48.540
they used in their stories also.

61
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.299
So if you kind of dig around,
one way is if you

62
00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:58.059
see a data-driven story being published,

63
00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.947
especially if it's like a major newspaper,

64
00:05:02.947 --> 00:05:08.606
a lot of times if you go
down to their methodologies,

65
00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:13.110
cuz if it's anything data-driven, for

66
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.217
good reporting they need to kind
of say where they got their data.

67
00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:22.658
And in their methodology section,

68
00:05:22.658 --> 00:05:28.264
some of them will break it down in great
detail, some of them will just have links,

69
00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:33.143
but that's a really great place to
kind of like if you see something that

70
00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:37.614
inspired you and you want to create
a data visualization with it,

71
00:05:37.614 --> 00:05:42.008
methodology sections have really
good data-driven stories,

72
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:46.430
are really great for
figuring out where the data came from.

73
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.650
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to translate
the SVG elements into Canvas and

74
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.198
do something like the force
layout in a more performant way?

75
00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:58.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So actually, another great question.

76
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.559
So d3-force has really great support for
Canvas.

77
00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:07.999
And in fact,
if you look at a lot of their examples, so

78
00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:13.034
another tip about going through
the d3 API is a lot of times if

79
00:06:13.034 --> 00:06:18.565
you click on these images of examples,
they'll link to the actual

80
00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:23.936
like either observable notebook or
blogs with the actual code.

81
00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:27.858
And so yeah, so for
example it will lead to this, and

82
00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:33.047
if you take a look at this one,
I believe this one is done with Canvas.

83
00:06:33.047 --> 00:06:37.752
And you can see,
I'm not gonna delve too deeply

84
00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:41.520
cuz Canvas it looks quite different.

85
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.596
But the key thing is,
you can see that the way that we call

86
00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:51.673
the simulation is still the same,
we pass in the nodes,

87
00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:57.315
and then let's see,
passing the links, and then .ticked.

88
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.780
So we're saying for
each of the links, drawLink, so

89
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.220
that must be a custom function,
and drawNode.

90
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.745
And so yeah, so in here it has the custom

91
00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:18.810
functions to draw those shapes actually.

92
00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:31.830
Yeah, so actually for the force layout,
you'll actually be using the force layout

93
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.600
the same way because it's just
creating the x, y positions for you.

94
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.836
You just have to kind of read
into the Canvas API, and

95
00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:47.628
then a lot of the commands kind of
translate over pretty naturally.

96
00:07:47.628 --> 00:07:53.995
So for example, the path string,
those commands translate over for

97
00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:57.724
the m, I think it's like .move to, and

98
00:07:57.724 --> 00:08:03.130
I think curve is like .curve to,
or something like that.

99
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.703
So it's just about kind
of learning Canvas, and

100
00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:13.500
then once you kind of have even
a basic grasp of the Canvas API,

101
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:20.772
you should be able to translate what we
were doing in SVG today over to Canvas.

102
00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:27.031
And really the biggest thing
especially doing animations in Canvas,

103
00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:33.110
is making sure to clear the Canvas
on each tick of the animation.

104
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.991
So if you don't,
you'll get really interesting bugs,

105
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:38.581
actually very visually
pleasing bugs sometimes.

106
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:43.729
Yeah, so
that's what I will say about Canvas, but

107
00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:48.757
in general,
most if not all of the D3 modules that

108
00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:54.985
have to do with drawing shapes or
actually the shapes module,

109
00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:59.820
most of them have really
great Canvas support.

110
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.860
So you just need to kind of pay attention
to where it talks about that in

111
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.880
the reference, or taking a look at just

112
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.320
examples and seeing if they're
implemented with Canvas or SVG.

113
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.434
And that's all that I've got for

114
00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:24.822
our lessons and takeaways.

115
00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:32.451
Yeah, so I have some final notes,
which is that if you

116
00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:37.618
are interested because observable
notebooks don't function

117
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:42.660
quite like in the index.html file or
a JavaScript file.

118
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.681
If you are interested
in seeing what we did

119
00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:52.560
in all of these exercises translate over

120
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.152
into an index.html file let's say,

121
00:09:57.152 --> 00:10:01.312
I'll be updating these files with

122
00:10:01.312 --> 00:10:05.918
the kind of equivalent of what we did.

123
00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:11.105
So I'll be updating them with what
our bar chart and our film flowers

124
00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:17.296
will look like in an index.html file and
these links, so you can check them out.

125
00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:22.875
And if you're looking for next steps,
some of my other workshops

126
00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:29.064
on Frontend Masters is something I
mentioned earlier in this workshop,

127
00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:34.137
is that this particular workshop
that's an intro to D3 and

128
00:10:34.137 --> 00:10:39.008
SVG, is purely concentrated
on the coding aspect of data

129
00:10:39.008 --> 00:10:43.179
visualization, which is really,
really fun.

130
00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:47.988
But I actually think that the more and
almost more important

131
00:10:47.988 --> 00:10:52.316
challenge of data visualization
is the design side,

132
00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:56.082
that we make sure that
we're thinking about.

133
00:10:56.082 --> 00:11:01.330
That we were thinking through the data,
that we're being careful in the way

134
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:06.424
that we're encoding our data and
translating it to the visual channels.

135
00:11:06.424 --> 00:11:11.268
And so
the building custom data visualizations is

136
00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:15.767
a workshop that's about
how to think about and

137
00:11:15.767 --> 00:11:22.797
do very light analysis of the data,
as well as how to kind of think about,

138
00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:27.292
once you have an idea
from your data analysis,

139
00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:32.369
how you might go about designing and
prototyping and

140
00:11:32.369 --> 00:11:40.371
turning that into something that you can
end up coding with D3 or something else.

141
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:44.918
And the data visualization for
React developers is,

142
00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:49.160
as I mentioned a little bit
earlier is a very gentle

143
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.410
introduction into D3 for React developers.

144
00:11:53.410 --> 00:12:00.230
So it's going to have a lot, a lot of
overlap with this particular workshop.

145
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.390
But certainly if you're interested
in how to use React in D3,

146
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.880
then I recommend kind of like skipping
around to the React portions,

147
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.660
so that you can get an idea of that.

148
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.700
And finally, thank you so,
so much for sticking around

149
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.160
this whole workshop, and
kind of coming along this journey with me.

150
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.660
Thank you.
