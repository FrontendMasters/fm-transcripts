00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.790
So we're going to this last little bit and
scale.

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.951
And so just like with translate,

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:13.432
scale will also affect
the whole coordinate system.

4
00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:22.530
And so if you scale, one thing that we
might expect is for this to get bigger.

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.810
But actually,
the other thing is that the x and

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.390
y positions will now be different also,
because now maybe you can see but

7
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.900
if we scale it by 2 in our unscaled

8
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.410
coordinate system 200 is here but in our
scaled coordinate system 200 is here.

9
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.880
So even if we're placing the squares,

10
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.890
we're setting those same x and
y on the squares.

11
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.540
They will be positioned
at different places.

12
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.690
You might have noticed that in
our exercise in this kind of

13
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.488
rendering function,
in the transform change the translate and

14
00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:15.631
the scale to be able to get this
effect positioning and then sizing.

15
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:20.637
But it's extremely important
the order in which we do this

16
00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:25.440
because depending on the order,
the coordinate system

17
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.833
will be different and
thus like our flower petal and

18
00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:34.930
in this case the square will
end up at different places.

19
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.030
So for example, and I have these two,

20
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.410
the blue one has a translate first and
the purple one has a scale second.

21
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.990
And if we kinda take a look at scale and
then let's say we translate by,

22
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.127
so even the translate by,
you can see is kind

23
00:01:55.127 --> 00:02:00.810
of the coordinate system is being shifted
over almost like a different rate.

24
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.672
And especially if you position now,
if you position the the x

25
00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:10.470
and y it's going to be at
completely different places.

26
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.190
And so that's just because,
for example, for

27
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.470
the second one, we're first scaling up.

28
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.530
What's happening is that we're first
scaling up our coordinate system.

29
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.730
And so
the translation is going to be within that

30
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.290
kind of scaled up coordinate system,
and that's why

31
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.800
it's going to be different from if
we had done it the other way around.

32
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.026
So, what I usually do and
what I usually just keep in mind,

33
00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:50.001
because I've also had many bugs
due to this kind of like ordering,

34
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:54.284
is I always just default
to translating first.

35
00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.017
Translate first, then scale.
