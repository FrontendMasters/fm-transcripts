00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.156
Today, I'm hoping to get through two
primary goals for this workshop.

2
00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:11.874
The first is that you'll be able
to walk away with a very solid

3
00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:15.956
understanding of SVG, or
Scalar Vector Graphics.

4
00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:21.614
And that you'll be able to use it to draw
your own custom shapes in the browser, and

5
00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:26.960
then also be able to feel comfortable
reading and understanding the syntax.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.930
And the second one is D3, and so

7
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.660
S3 is probably the de facto
JavaScript library for

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.629
creating data visualizations in the web.

9
00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.621
And that's really great because it
has a lot of modules, and functions.

10
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:48.762
And it has pretty much almost
everything I've ever imagined

11
00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:53.565
having to create data visualizations
on the web, it has support for.

12
00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:59.676
but that also means that it's really
comprehensive, and it's really a lot,

13
00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:05.241
and it can get really overwhelming
to try and look through the library.

14
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.779
And so today instead of trying and

15
00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:12.947
probably failing to teach you all
the models in D3 and what they do,

16
00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:18.134
I wanna teach you some of the most
fundamental parts of the library.

17
00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:20.671
So that by the end of the workshop,

18
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:25.486
you'll have a good understanding
of those core principles, and

19
00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:30.404
be able to kinda take that and
apply that to the rest of the library.

20
00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:34.708
So I'm going to be teaching
out of this workshop,

21
00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:39.934
sorry this notebook today,
it is an observable notebook and

22
00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:44.250
hopefully you'll have
the link to it in the chat.

23
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.801
But if not, you can find it at

24
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:54.682
observablehq.com/@sxywu, and

25
00:01:54.682 --> 00:02:02.078
it should hopefully be
under the collection,

26
00:02:02.078 --> 00:02:07.211
workshop introduction to D3.

27
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:12.645
And it'd be pretty important
to have this workshop so

28
00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:16.277
that we can go through it together.

29
00:02:16.277 --> 00:02:20.066
There's a lot of exercises in here and
kind of like hands on play.

30
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:27.844
And you can either just play directly
with the notebooks I've provided or

31
00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:33.489
you can also you can sign on
with your GitHub account,

32
00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.251
and then forking and then I think and

33
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:41.656
then you can play with
it that way I think.

34
00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.518
I haven't tried the forking,
but that should work.

35
00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:49.895
Before we get on with the course,
I wanted to introduce myself a little bit.

36
00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:53.641
Hi, my name is Shirley, I call myself

37
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:58.561
an independent creator
of data visualizations,

38
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:03.828
and what that means is just
that I'm self employed and

39
00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:11.348
I work with a variety of clients,
to help them tell stories with their data.

40
00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:16.938
So I almost always work with
them through the whole process,

41
00:03:16.938 --> 00:03:23.076
usually they'll have some sort of
a dataset that they're looking

42
00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:28.794
to either tell a story with visually,
or try to make sense of.

43
00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:32.903
So I'll work with them to
do the data analysis, and

44
00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:37.119
the design and prototyping,
and finally the code.

45
00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:45.551
But my background where I have the most of
my training is in software engineering.

46
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.147
I've been using D3 since 2012, and

47
00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:54.188
I've been using D3 with
various different frameworks.

48
00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:59.602
For that same amount of time I
started with backbone went to react,

49
00:03:59.602 --> 00:04:01.833
and now I use view with D3.

50
00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:06.275
And I've also been teaching D3 and
data visualization courses since 2014.

51
00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:12.702
So, I have a few other different
workshops that I'll elaborate on

52
00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:18.344
at the end of this workshop as
possible next steps so yeah.

53
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:27.452
So for today,
what I want us to do together is,

54
00:04:27.452 --> 00:04:32.676
I always think it's really,
really fun when we

55
00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:38.828
have this overarching project
that we can do together.

56
00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:44.126
So, this is a project that I
have called film flowers and

57
00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:50.975
the original project, Looks like this.

58
00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:56.278
And it is the top summer
blockbusters of the past two and

59
00:04:56.278 --> 00:05:00.321
a half decades, reimagined as flowers.

60
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:05.763
So, each of these flowers
represent a movie and,

61
00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:11.215
the petal shapes are parental
guidance ratings.

62
00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:16.516
The colors are genres, and the number

63
00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:22.158
of petals is the number of votes on IMDb.

64
00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:30.688
And the size of the flower is
the IMDb rating out of 10.

65
00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:34.848
And I always,
always show this every time but,

66
00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:40.465
some of my favorites in here is like,
I think Dark Knight Rises is

67
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:45.792
really pretty, I love Harry Potter,
there's Inception.

68
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:51.371
And then we show this at every
conference that I give this talk,

69
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:57.266
or that I show this project, but
my absolute favorite is Batman and

70
00:05:57.266 --> 00:06:03.185
Robin 1997 Batman and
Robin because of how tiny and cute it is.

71
00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:09.951
Yeah so this is the project that we're
going to recreate in part today.

72
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:15.839
And so,
this is the summer blockbuster movies,

73
00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:19.286
and so I recommend you try and

74
00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:25.316
click on the carrot open
up some of these objects,

75
00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:30.070
take a look at what the data looks like.

76
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.233
This is a little bit of a cleaned
up version of the raw data I had,

77
00:06:35.233 --> 00:06:39.630
but it includes all of the data
that we need for today.

78
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:48.035
And then, this is the visualization of
flowers that we're going to get to.

79
00:06:48.035 --> 00:06:52.972
And you can see that for
themes we have a mapping,

80
00:06:52.972 --> 00:07:00.930
like I said earlier of parental guidance
readings to the type of flower petal.

81
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.907
Number of IMDb votes to
the number of petals, and

82
00:07:04.907 --> 00:07:10.731
rating out of 10 to the size and
the movie genre to the color of petals.

83
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:15.575
And the only slight bit of difference
is that whereas in my project I show

84
00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:20.177
all of the movie genres,
today we're going to only be coloring by,

85
00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:22.540
the first to list in the new genre.

86
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.844
So that would be the only difference
between the project I just showed, and

87
00:07:26.844 --> 00:07:28.634
what we're going to do today.
