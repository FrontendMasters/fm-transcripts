1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.729
Let's go ahead and, Do

2
00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.832
the same thing, this time for
our film flowers.

3
00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:15.199
So let's go ahead and
bring our film flowers over.

4
00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.700
I'm gonna call this film flowers.

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.524
And so, I was thinking,
that what we can potentially do is

6
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:29.410
bring over our film flowers
where we positioned everything.

7
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.380
So it's this piece of code, and then
we're just not have the filter option.

8
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.150
And we'll just have everything being
rendered in kind of that forced layout.

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.610
So I think that might be fun.

10
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.512
So let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:50.658
So the very first thing that we're
gonna do, again, is create the SVG.

12
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.801
And then,
let's create our script tag again.

13
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:03.560
And, I'm gonna stop fighting code sandbox.

14
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.650
Okay, and the first thing we want
to do is we need to go ahead and

15
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.230
load in the movies data for us.

16
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.180
So in our observable notebooks,

17
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.400
I had already loaded in
the movies data separately.

18
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.158
And then, so we were able to
just access it in our notebooks.

19
00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:27.547
But in here,
because we're starting from scratch,

20
00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:30.495
we don't have the movies
data loaded in here.

21
00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.235
So let's go ahead and do that.

22
00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:37.280
So d3 has some options
built on top of fetching.

23
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.870
One of them is dot JSON.

24
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.560
And just it makes fetching JSON.

25
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.000
It goes and fetches and
then turns everything into JSON.

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.960
There's another function called d3 dot CSV
that does the same thing with CSV files.

27
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.347
So it just makes it very
convenient to load our data.

28
00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:07.349
And I have our movies
data already loaded or

29
00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.900
already saved here in our directory.

30
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.560
So let's go ahead and

31
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.790
call that .then, and
then movies should be loaded.

32
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.500
And if I console log movies, there we go.

33
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.832
So this is our movies dataset.

34
00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:39.798
Hopefully, it looks very
familiar to you by now.

35
00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:48.131
And let's go ahead and
copy over our code here,

36
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:55.228
and then go ahead and figure out
how to translate everything over.

37
00:02:55.228 --> 00:03:04.274
So, We're

38
00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:09.242
gonna take that, I'm gonna copy and
paste it over into,

39
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.091
Gonna copy and paste it into our block
that already has our movies data loaded.

40
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:39.277
So here we are, and now we don't have.

41
00:03:39.277 --> 00:03:43.570
Now, we also need to go and
get this calculate graph function.

42
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.900
So, I'm gonna take out that line.

43
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.730
And let's go ahead and
grab it from this, our fourth notebook,

44
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.280
where we went and use scale to
translate our raw data into our

45
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.140
visual channels that
we can use to draw in.

46
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.930
So I'm gonna grab everything in
this calculate data function.

47
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.937
Actually, let me do this.

48
00:04:15.937 --> 00:04:23.892
I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring the whole
calculate data function over.

49
00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:31.776
And then, I'm gonna paste it just
outside of the d3.JSON load.

50
00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:38.307
So now, if we do calculate data and
passing movies, we should hopefully see.

51
00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:44.199
Wait, all right.

52
00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.504
So let's call this function.

53
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.427
I'm gonna do it this way.

54
00:04:56.463 --> 00:05:02.399
And then, You

55
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:08.314
should hopefully be able to see
something being drawn to the console,

56
00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:12.060
which we're not seeing right now.

57
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.260
So let's see what's happening.

58
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.150
I'm going to go and
going here in console log movies.

59
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.210
Okay, perfect.

60
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.260
So we're seeing that.

61
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.340
Things are being console logged here.

62
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.140
We have our color scale,
and it's because we

63
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.430
need some of these arrays to be copy and
paste it over to.

64
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.590
So let's go ahead and do that.

65
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.860
Let's go get all of these arrays.

66
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.914
So those we can find in our
workshop utility functions.

67
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.248
So we have our top genres.

68
00:05:59.584 --> 00:06:02.368
I'm gonna just paste that
right outside of our function.

69
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:08.794
Const topGenres, and
we need to go get our petal colors, and

70
00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:11.365
we also need to go get our petal pads.

71
00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:16.984
So, we're gonna be copying and
pasting for a little bit and do,

72
00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:24.049
Const petalColors, and

73
00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:29.934
we have petal paths
that we need to go get.

74
00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:36.497
Okay, so Let's go ahead and do that.

75
00:06:41.056 --> 00:06:45.458
All right, Petal paths,

76
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:50.455
I'm gonna take this part out.

77
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.217
Okay, perfect.

78
00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:58.930
And then, let's see.

79
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.620
Now, we shall have all of
these variables resolved.

80
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.300
We have movies being calculated.

81
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.390
And so, hopefully now, we should have,
let's take out this .console log.

82
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.390
Now hopefully, we'll have still no.

83
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:26.658
So, let's figure out
where it's going wrong.

84
00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:33.830
Look at that, okay,
calculate group position.

85
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.782
Okay, so I knew the film flowers is
the one I was gonna be a little bit

86
00:07:38.782 --> 00:07:43.130
more complicated to copy over,
but that's okay.

87
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.352
So let's go ahead and
find our calculate grid positions.

88
00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:55.825
Let's see, calculate grid positions.

89
00:07:55.825 --> 00:08:00.636
Actually, we don't need our calculate grid
positions anymore because we're using

90
00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:03.060
our force layout to position everything.

91
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.570
So we can just, we can take that up.

92
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.310
Let's see, there we go.

93
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.720
So that is everything
we needed to copy over.

94
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:22.730
And now, we have the objects with all
of the information that we've gotten so

95
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.610
used to seeing, and
with the colors and the pants.

96
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.260
So now that we have that, perfect.

97
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.830
So let's call that, actually.

98
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.087
And then now, what we need to do is go and

99
00:08:38.087 --> 00:08:41.842
copy over the graph calculation.

100
00:08:41.842 --> 00:08:44.406
So let's go and copy this over.

101
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.930
Now, we should be able to,

102
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:12.107
Say, const graph is equal

103
00:09:12.107 --> 00:09:17.205
to, No, hold on.

104
00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:22.004
So now, we need both
the filtered set of movies and

105
00:09:22.004 --> 00:09:24.870
the filtered set of flowers.

106
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.470
But because we're not doing
our filters right now,

107
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.770
we'll just pass in the movies data,

108
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:37.610
the whole movies data set that we already
have and the translated flowers array.

109
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.800
So let's go ahead and
change this around a little bit.

110
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.890
And so, we're going to pass in our
movies array, our flowers array.

111
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.470
Let's go ahead and
replace this movie's part.

112
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.195
In this flowers part are into flowers.

113
00:09:54.195 --> 00:10:01.091
And now, I believe we have,
let me see if there's any case.

114
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:02.408
So SVG is not defined.

115
00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:05.458
And that's the only error
that we're having now.

116
00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:09.668
So now, we'll go ahead and
calculate our flowers array.

117
00:10:09.668 --> 00:10:13.144
And so that's our calculate data movies.

118
00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:16.618
And then, we're gonna go ahead and
get our graph.

119
00:10:16.618 --> 00:10:18.727
So our graph is equal to,

120
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:27.100
Calculate graph, and
pass in our movies and our flowers.

121
00:10:33.244 --> 00:10:37.629
And I'm gonna console log the graph
just to make sure that that's

122
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:40.996
being calculated the way
that we're hoping for.

123
00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:45.243
Yes, and so,

124
00:10:48.027 --> 00:10:50.565
I'm just gonna pass in yes.
