00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.387
Let's move on to our final lesson.

2
00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:08.195
And that is that we want to
position the film flowers that we

3
00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.005
created by all the genres that they share.

4
00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:17.067
So, so far we've kinda talked
about how to create DOM

5
00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.868
elements with D3,
how to update the DOM and

6
00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:27.230
we dabbled a little bit into
positioning things with D3 scales.

7
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.530
And that's really nice when all
we need to do is translate from

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.910
our raw data directly into
like an XY position, but

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.980
sometimes we want to visualize something
a little bit more complicated and

10
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.680
that's when D3 has a lot more
modules to help us with that.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.220
So I'm going to highlight
a few of my favorites and

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.990
this is definitely not everything.

13
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.580
If you remember that I showed that
whole big chart of different modules,

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.475
and you can reference that to see what
else helps with the layout calculation.

15
00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:10.720
A few of my favorites is d3 shape.

16
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.250
And so d3 shape functions what it does
is it helps us calculate the path

17
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.270
strings that we might need to draw line
charts, area charts, pie charts, etc.

18
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
Because now that we've learned
how to create shapes with SVG,

19
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.350
and now that we've learned the paths,

20
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.750
strings work, we knew like how
cumbersome it might be to, let's say,

21
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.392
like figure out the path to
like code the path string For

22
00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:48.310
this line of like all these like
jagged little up and downs.

23
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.840
And we could probably imagine
the work that it's going to take

24
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.770
to draw all those like curves and
arcs in a pie chart or

25
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.460
if this is an area chart or
like if any of these lines

26
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.820
are actually a little bit more curvy,
that's going to take a lot of work too.

27
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.290
And so d3 has all of these different
shape functions to help us with that.

28
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.095
So here,
just scrolling through the reference for

29
00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:28.710
all of the kind of different
shapes that you could create,

30
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.920
and the part that I really
wanted to point out is that for

31
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.555
each of these,
often times they will provide an example.

32
00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:44.828
Sorry for all the scrolling but
let me try and get to one.

33
00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:49.106
Actually, let me look at d3 lines and

34
00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:53.930
you will actually have a link to examples.

35
00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.150
And so if you're like confused
as to how to use that module,

36
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.990
watch out for this in the reference and

37
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.990
then it will kind of explain in
this observable notebook and

38
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.279
how to use d3 line,
all of the different examples.

39
00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:24.185
And, Yeah, so there's all these kind

40
00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:28.985
of different applications of
different shapes that you can use.

41
00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:33.752
And I also want to make a note that a lot
of the d3 examples like this one has

42
00:03:33.752 --> 00:03:35.480
moved to observable.

43
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.569
And so if you actually go to the d3
account on the observables so

44
00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.304
it's like /@d3.

45
00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:47.210
It has apparently 400 something
notebooks of examples.

46
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.130
And the really nice thing is
that they've actually kind of

47
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.520
grouped all of these
examples by the module.

48
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.250
So, the module that we were
just in is this d3 shape.

49
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.414
So you can go in and you can take a look
at all of these different examples and

50
00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:08.897
you can like click in and you can
look at the cell with all the code.

51
00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:14.535
And now that you're more familiar with
observable you can probably dig in and

52
00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:18.092
like look out what's
happening with the data and

53
00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:23.230
then you can hopefully put together so
they are doing the scales.

54
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.480
They're creating the scales
in different cells.

55
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.440
You can hopefully go through
the observable notebook and

56
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.286
figure out how they're using
that particular d3 example.

57
00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:38.917
So again, I am for d3 shapes,

58
00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:44.520
you might have let's say,
an array like this.

59
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.930
This is the raw data array for
Apple's daily closing price and

60
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.870
it just has the date and the venue.

61
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.555
And then in this example, we're passing
that data array into d3 line and

62
00:04:55.555 --> 00:05:00.330
we're getting back this path string and
we're putting that path string.

63
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.434
I am on this kind of path element,
and we're adding some axes and

64
00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:07.030
that's how we get the line chart below.
