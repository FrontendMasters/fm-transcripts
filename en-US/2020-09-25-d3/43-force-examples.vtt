00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.360
This was kind of like a really like,
high level overview, and

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.550
all of the above steps, and
if you want that in much greater detail,

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.390
I have a blog post that really
breaks down what it's doing.

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.900
And it is an older blog post
that is based on a previous

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.030
implementation of the D3 force layout but
most of the concepts remain the same.

6
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.760
So I think reading this one and

7
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.660
will definitely help you understand how
the force layout is currently implemented.

8
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
And just like a quick see some quick like

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.850
fun applications of D3 force in my own
work and because I really enjoy using it.

10
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.630
And so for example,
when I scroll through this particular

11
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.780
visualization this is a visualization
on the musical Hamilton.

12
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.270
The dots that are just kind of like

13
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.380
jumping around in the background
that's done with the force Leo.

14
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.490
And that's basically saying like
on every scroll just like and

15
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.070
have some random forces and
let it just run wild.

16
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.900
And once I get to this point,
they actually kind of come in and

17
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.100
snap to these positions.

18
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.640
And these positions are actually
calculated with D3 force and

19
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.000
there is a particular force that is,
you can specify that each

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.980
of these news be trying to be centering
on a specific x and y coordinate.

21
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.500
So like each of these are like nodes.

22
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.730
Each of these nodes are a series
of lyrics in the same song,

23
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.440
and that's how they're kind
of being grouped together.

24
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380
I'm using D3 force to group that together.

25
00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.340
So I'm using D3 force in two different
ways in this particular example.

26
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.220
And this one is a more recent
project of mine and is

27
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.260
a how a pandemic might potentially
spread through a community

28
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.130
in it takes actual data
from a particular zip code.

29
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.560
And the way that I used
force here is every time and

30
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.230
these dots each of these dots
represent people and every time they

31
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.060
move from their houses to the center,

32
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.070
and I'm using D3 force to
calculate that position.

33
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.920
Back and forth kinda make this like fun,

34
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.700
a little bit like not a smooth
animation to its end destination, but

35
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.200
more of like, it runs into things,
it bumps into each other.

36
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.560
And actually,
it's a very subtle detail, but

37
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.770
I slightly changed the force layout
code such that and the dots, avoid

38
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.058
the other houses that it doesn't belong
to when it's trying to get to the center.

39
00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:12.230
So, yeah, it's it actually avoids
all of the other buildings.

40
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.100
So it was also a fun use of force.

41
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.570
And the final one I'm gonna share
is this one that we did for

42
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.400
the Guardian, and in this one is about
the homeless relocation program in the US.

43
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.040
And like it,
The Guardian did a really amazing

44
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.150
job on the investigative reporting so
if you're interested, please check it out.

45
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.580
But the place where I used the D3
force actually I think and

46
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.010
not he also used the D3
force layout here and

47
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.980
she used like a radial force to
position each of these nodes and

48
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.860
in these kind of layers and then.

49
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.060
I used D3 force for this animation and and

50
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.610
first to kinda centre the nodes
on each of these kinda groups and

51
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.550
then as the animation starts.

52
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.420
This animation is also using D3 force to
calculate the position as it goes and

53
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.028
from one group to the other,
and this one can comes back.

54
00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:29.650
It is D3 force because of the series of
takes where it's doing the calculation.

55
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.190
And because in each of those
takes the positions get nudged,

56
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.430
and so slightly and
incrementally it kinda gives this like

57
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.590
More natural looking animation effect
than if you had just done like an enemy's

58
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.640
animation with like a linear ease or
something like that.

59
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.070
So, whenever you're,

60
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.110
you want to visualize something that
like looks a little bit more organic.

61
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.490
And I think force layout actually
lends itself really nicely to that.

62
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.360
So, I just wanting to show
some applications of it and

63
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.330
without the context of it being in
a traditional node and link graph.

64
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.300
A lot of the examples I gave are taking
advantage of these two forces

65
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.297
that are positioning around
certain focal points and

66
00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:26.699
the second force being avoiding collision.
