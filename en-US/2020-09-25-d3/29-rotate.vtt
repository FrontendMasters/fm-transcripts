00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.910
Another note about SVG transforms
the time again about rotate.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.300
And similarly to the other transforms,
rotate also affects the whole

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.810
coordinate system and
is set in degrees rather than radians.

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.383
And so if we play around with this,

5
00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:27.692
you can see that there
is the rotation default,

6
00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:33.530
the coordinate system is default-rotated

7
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.494
around the origin, 0, 0.

8
00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:42.584
And there's additional set of

9
00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:48.690
x&amp;y that you can provide to
rotate after the degrees.

10
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.460
To specify if you want
your coordinate system to

11
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.850
be rotated around some other x,y position,
but by default it rotates around 0,0.

12
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.130
So if you kind of rotate these
around you can see how the rectangle

13
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.190
might go to different places
if you change the x y around.

14
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.700
I don't tend to set the x, y

15
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.349
position if I rotate I usually
will set the translate first.

16
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.470
And then set the rotate so
that I just don't kind of get this like.

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.230
It gets really confusing for
me at least if I move the rectangle

18
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.125
within the coordinate system and
it no longer goes where I expected it to.

19
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:43.340
So I tend to translate

20
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.620
together with rotate instead of
trying to move around the x, y.

21
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.940
And on that note,
I also want to give a small warning

22
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.650
that just like before the width and
the order in which you chain rotate and

23
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.540
translate, or really dramatically
change the resulting coordinate system.

24
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.580
So be careful.

25
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.090
And let me show you.

26
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.700
So let's see.

27
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.650
So let's start out with
everything the same, but

28
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.650
if I rotate it a little bit,
depending on the translation, it

29
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.080
dramatically changes where
the coordinate system ends up.

30
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:34.180
And then depending on,
let's see the rotation and really changes.

31
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.730
There we go.

32
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.990
So that's where the second one is now.

33
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.490
Yeah.

34
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.180
Personally, I find it kind of cool and
interesting.

35
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.900
But I guess I just find these kinds
of things cool and interesting.

36
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.500
But again,
the good rule of thumb that I use is

37
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.230
I translate first and then I rotate after.

38
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.670
So that the moving has
already happened before.

39
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930
I confuse myself with rotating
the coordinate system.

40
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.790
So yes, just translate first and
usually things will work out.
