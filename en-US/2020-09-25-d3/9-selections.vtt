1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.580
And let's start with D3 selections.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.770
And so that is we're going to
look at select and select all.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.910
So, this right now this cell is giving us,

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.910
is currently just drawing in
here an SVG container and

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.530
then five rectangle elements.

6
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.990
And right now because we don't
have the width and height set for

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.040
each of the rectangles, nothing is
showing up but that's okay for now.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.900
Because what we want to do is
we want to use D3 to select

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.260
those, select the SVG,
select the rectangle elements, and

10
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.710
then seeing what a D3 selection
looks like underneath the hood.

11
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.880
So let's do this part together like
you can do it, let's do it together.

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.979
So what I'm gonna do is I'm also
going to open up my console.

13
00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:05.674
So we have in this

14
00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:11.050
cell some code.

15
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.340
And so the first one is saying,
let me go and

16
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.150
select this SVG that has
this id of container.

17
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.170
So basically I'm saying, let's go select
this SVG, put it into this variable and

18
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.515
then let's console log or
sorry, let's return that.

19
00:01:34.515 --> 00:01:40.930
And this is what that D3
selection looks like,

20
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.390
it has groups and then SVG, SVG element.

21
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.890
And yeah, and

22
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.670
then if we console log of that what we
can do is take a look in the console log.

23
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.250
And if we expand it
this is really helpful.

24
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.140
The reason why I'm showing this
console log is that it's quite helpful

25
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.300
in debugging.

26
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.780
And if we're kind of confused
what our D3 selection is.

27
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.670
You can console log it and then it will
look like this in our console log and

28
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.600
if we open up this underscore groups,
that's our D3, that's kind of like

29
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.240
the DOM elements that like D3 is kind
of wrapping around with this selection.

30
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.710
So you can see actually
that is the SVG container.

31
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.550
And if we actually click on this,
at least in Chrome debugger, and

32
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.080
I think in Firefox too, it will take you
directly to the element in the DOM tree.

33
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.840
So then that I find to be
really helpful with debugging.

34
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.480
If I'm like, why is this not
happening as I expected to and so

35
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.250
you can even kind of like open it up and
see the rectangles that we've drawn.

36
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.280
So that's the SVG.

37
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.470
Actually now let's take a look
at what happens when we

38
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.160
chain that SVG and select the path.

39
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.373
Sorry, where is the path
I direct this was a,

40
00:03:17.373 --> 00:03:21.000
I was doing something else.

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.870
So I actually I'm gonna publish that.

42
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.070
And then if you just refresh that
should be the correct version and so,

43
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.790
right now, what we want to do
is dot select a rectangle.

44
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.145
And let's take a look at
what that console logs do.

45
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.460
So that if we open up these groups and
then we see that it is one rectangle.

46
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.160
And if we click on that rectangle, and

47
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.540
it will highlight in the DOM
that it's the first rectangle.

48
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.500
So, dot select will

49
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.460
grab the first element that
matches this selector.

50
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.708
And finally, with select all.

51
00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:15.150
We're gonna go and
select all of the rectangles in the SVG.

52
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.192
So what that looks like is in
groups it's a, an array of.

53
00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:25.510
The five rectangles.

54
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.950
So if I click on any of them,
it's the first one then the second one,

55
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.940
the third one, fourth one and fifth one.

56
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.260
So this is what it looks
like underneath the hood.

57
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.146
And the reason why I wanted to show
this is because with a D3 selection,

58
00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:44.731
what happens is that it has
this underscore groups,

59
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:48.567
which is kind of the DOM
elements that D3 has selected.

60
00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:52.897
And then it has this set of functions, and

61
00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:59.720
these are actually the functions
that a D3 selection supports.

62
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.380
So you can chain things
like selecting more things.

63
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.330
Select all being able to filter,
bind data etc, so

64
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.640
these are all of the kind of
like D3 selection functions.

65
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.310
And this is how it's letting us and

66
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.370
you'll see in a bit that
will be chaining and

67
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.070
these D3 or actually you even
you already see now that.

68
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.950
We're chaining like select on select, and
we'll chain more things later on too.

69
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.320
So that's what's happening here.

70
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.120
And so these are kind of all of the
selection methods, and all of them will

71
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.610
either take in a selector string which
as far as I've ever seen, works the same

72
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.760
way as the CSS selector strings that
we might be really familiar with.

73
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.550
Or you can pass in directly
a reference to a DOM element.

74
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.850
And either if that works and
it will return a D3 selection.

75
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.334
And the other thing to know is that
the first two where it's D3 dot select,

76
00:06:06.334 --> 00:06:09.620
that will search through
the entire DOM tree and

77
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.651
return either the first thing that
matches or everything that matches.

78
00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:19.381
And the second thing, second part
is that you can chain you know,

79
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:24.113
a selection and then what happens
there is it will be restricted to

80
00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:28.260
just the children of the selection
that we chained upon.
