1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.107
And now, We have the news and links,

2
00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:14.360
That we did before in
our observable netbooks.

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.512
And so, Let us,

4
00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:26.848
Go ahead and create and
go ahead and select our SVG.

5
00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:32.590
And now, what we can do is go ahead and
use SVG,

6
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.320
we selected the d3 selection of SVG.

7
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.264
And we're gonna kinda replace,
All of the previous selections we did,

8
00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:50.238
look at that we're already getting our
flowers being rendered, and we'll go and

9
00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:59.324
do that and, We're very close,
we have everything rendered.

10
00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:03.804
And so there seems to be a few more
things that we need to do just to get

11
00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:05.896
the simulation part working.

12
00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:09.633
So let's figure out what is going on here.

13
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.820
Let's see if there's any errors now.

14
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.613
Yes, [LAUGH] our width is not defined.

15
00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:21.395
And so let's go ahead and,
I'm gonna scroll back up to the top.

16
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.989
And I'm going to define our width,

17
00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:31.204
let's say, as the width of our window.

18
00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:32.341
So I'm gonna say window.innerWidth.

19
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:37.906
And, yeah, is now drawing everything and

20
00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:46.107
you can see that our SVG doesn't
have the width and height yet.

21
00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:50.948
So we can go ahead and
set the width and height of SVG.

22
00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:55.090
And then after that we should be able to
see everything rendering as it was in

23
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.490
observable notebooks.

24
00:01:57.946 --> 00:02:03.171
So let's go ahead and
update our width and height and

25
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:07.342
the place we're gonna do that is in here.

26
00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:11.813
Let's say select svg, d3 select svg and

27
00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:16.042
set the width to the width at variable.

28
00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:19.454
And actually, in this case,

29
00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:25.054
let's set our height to
the window height also.

30
00:02:25.054 --> 00:02:30.266
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go ahead and update that.

31
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.143
The only other part that
we reference the width and

32
00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:36.919
height is in our first simulation.

33
00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:41.732
Where we center around
the center of our container, so

34
00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:47.601
let's go ahead and do width divided
by 2 and height divided by 2.

35
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.629
And of course,
we don't have the height variable yet.

36
00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.756
So let's go ahead and

37
00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:59.154
come back here to define our height.

38
00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:00.987
And now we should be able to, awesome.

39
00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:06.580
So there we go, we have everything
translated over into our index HTML.

40
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.086
And it was a little bit more
copying pasting them before but,

41
00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:14.100
it was mostly just tracking down
the variables that we were missing.

42
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.661
And in general I like
to organize everything

43
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:25.071
as an all of our constant variables first,

44
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:33.353
some functions where the functions
aren't reliant on the data.

45
00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:37.603
And then everything else being within this

46
00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:42.336
callback function after
the data is loaded in.

47
00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:47.315
And I guess a little bit of a note
about responsiveness because

48
00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:50.868
I know we had a question
about that earlier.

49
00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:56.287
And so if we wanted to make this, If

50
00:03:56.287 --> 00:04:03.051
we wanted to make this our SVG container,

51
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:07.497
resize on window resize and

52
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:14.268
then have all of these positions update.

53
00:04:14.268 --> 00:04:18.882
What we will want to do is listen
to a window resize event, and

54
00:04:18.882 --> 00:04:23.231
maybe somewhere outside of this movie,
loading block.

55
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.981
And so maybe we will have something
here that says window resize.

56
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:32.018
And we will probably have a another
function that's actually,

57
00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:36.599
and let me take that back,
we probably would want

58
00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.547
to do the window resize
within the movies callback.

59
00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:46.335
Because the window resize would be trying

60
00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:50.573
update a lot of things in the blog/ So

61
00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:55.498
we'll probably have the window resize and

62
00:04:55.498 --> 00:04:58.933
probably somewhere in here.

63
00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:06.624
And then window resize we can say go
ahead and recalculate the width and

64
00:05:06.624 --> 00:05:10.589
height and
update the SVG attributes for that.

65
00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:17.885
And then we will want to go down
to the fourth simulation call.

66
00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:22.987
And we will probably say, go ahead and

67
00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:27.931
do simulation, take the simulation

68
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:33.362
that we've already initialized here.

69
00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:35.972
And then let's go ahead and

70
00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:41.648
update this force center where
we're setting the width and

71
00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:45.863
the center of the container and
reset that.

72
00:05:45.863 --> 00:05:50.628
And then we can go ahead and
restart the force simulation so

73
00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:54.238
that everything will update its position.

74
00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:57.089
So that's how we would do
it in this particular case.

75
00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:01.655
And really depending on the chart or
visualization you're trying

76
00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:05.823
to make everything,
it will all change around a little bit.

77
00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:10.379
But that's in general how you would think
about making sure that your visualization

78
00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.286
is responsive.

79
00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:16.486
Yeah, that is how we translate
everything into our index HTML.
