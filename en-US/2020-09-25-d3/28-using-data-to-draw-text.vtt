1
00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.897
So in this case, we want to go, and
for each group, we don't need to

2
00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:11.735
do this whole data binding and enter
a pen because there's only one of them.

3
00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:14.907
So we're going to simply call append.

4
00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:19.147
We're going to append the text element and

5
00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:23.511
we're going to put in
our title as the text.

6
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:28.398
And so these two lines and
we should have, yes, awesome.

7
00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:33.504
Okay, so
now we have all of our titles rendering.

8
00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:41.935
And you can see that we need to also
change a little bit of the styling.

9
00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:45.714
So let's go ahead and do that.

10
00:00:45.714 --> 00:00:50.459
And actually, one of the first
things I'm gonna do just to make it

11
00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:55.311
look visually a little bit better
it truncate, well, truncate.

12
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:59.746
Lodash has a nice function
called truncate and so

13
00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:04.192
I'm going to say truncate
at just 20 letters.

14
00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:10.166
And so that will help us with reducing

15
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:14.790
some of the longer titles and

16
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.545
the small side note about using SVG text.

17
00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.836
If this makes no sense to you right now,
no worries.

18
00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:27.248
I just want to kind of
give the small note for

19
00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:29.534
if you run into this issue in the future.

20
00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:36.240
Which is that with SVG text, it's actually
quite hard to get things to wrap,

21
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.692
so word wrapping with SVG
text is a little bit hard.

22
00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:46.137
And so what I've kind of
started doing over the years

23
00:01:46.137 --> 00:01:52.568
is I kind of put a absolutely
positioned div in front of my SVG,

24
00:01:52.568 --> 00:01:56.650
and then just use divs to put labels on,

25
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.599
let's say each of my flowers or
in other cases,

26
00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.807
if I'm creating other sorts of charts,

27
00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:10.550
maybe I'll label each
of the dots with a div.

28
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.990
So instead of trying to like
fight with SVG text on trying

29
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.816
to get it wrap into like two or
three lines to fit a longer piece of text,

30
00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:27.137
I've kind of just started
to use HTML divs.

31
00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:32.040
Just because divs naturally
already have text word

32
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.839
wrapping built in, so
it's a little bit easier.

33
00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.836
And so for some of these longer titles,

34
00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:45.318
if I was to use HTML divs
then it will look a lot

35
00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:50.185
better because then I
don't have to truncate.

36
00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:55.120
But for the sake of this
exercise because I wanted to show

37
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.065
the sort of nested elements and
necessary selections.

38
00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:02.865
We're going to use text and
we're going to truncate.

39
00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:07.462
But from a design standpoint,
usually for data visualization,

40
00:03:07.462 --> 00:03:12.989
I wouldn't truncate like this, I would
have it a wrap with HTML div elements.

41
00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:19.199
But let's go ahead and style this.

42
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:24.403
So the first thing I'm gonna do actually,

43
00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:28.160
that's a style, font size and

44
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.941
we're going to say I'm
gonna make it smaller,

45
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.990
I'm gonna say 0.7M.

46
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.913
And I also want it to get centered.

47
00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:45.697
So I'm gonna scroll back and
forth a little bit,

48
00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:50.258
but right now you can
see that this is our 00.

49
00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:53.223
This is the center of our flower, but

50
00:03:53.223 --> 00:03:58.391
it's not being centered around that,
so let's center that and

51
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:05.109
I'm also gonna vertically center with
an attribute called DY, so let's do that.

52
00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:11.714
We're gonna call text anchor,

53
00:04:11.714 --> 00:04:16.439
middle, and the outer dy 0.35m.

54
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:24.400
I actually never looked into why it was
0.35m, but it just magically centers,

55
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.351
like vertically centers, the text
on whatever x, y position we have.

56
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.982
So yeah, I don't know why it's 0.35,

57
00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:38.625
but just kind of a standard
that I picked up.

58
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:43.166
So now with this we
should have everything,

59
00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:48.321
I think the one little
thing that I'm missing is,

60
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:53.371
I think I might have set
the font style to italic.

61
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:56.323
And actually,
now that I take a look at it,

62
00:04:56.323 --> 00:05:01.008
maybe truncating at 20 characters
is still a little bit too long.

63
00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:04.030
So I'm just gonna go back and
truncate it to 18.

64
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.226
And I'm gonna style, font style.

65
00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:16.576
Italic.

66
00:05:18.828 --> 00:05:21.568
And that should do it.

67
00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:26.479
So yeah, I'm still a little bit big

68
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.553
actually the look of it, how about 0.7?

69
00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:37.405
I'm not sure why this is overlapping
still but you can probably go back and

70
00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:40.456
forth yourself to try
a different font sizes or

71
00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:44.150
trying different truncations
to make the titles work.

72
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.406
But we just created our flowers together,
which is really exciting.

73
00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:55.680
And the reason why I put the scale,
the transform

74
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.824
scale on the panels instead
of the group is, and

75
00:06:00.824 --> 00:06:05.709
you might be able to guess
that if I had put it on

76
00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:11.368
the groups then not only
would the petals be scaled,

77
00:06:11.368 --> 00:06:15.760
but our text titles will be scaled also.

78
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.140
And that is kind of like
an aesthetic choice of,

79
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.957
yeah, so you can see,
it gets scaled along with it,

80
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:28.694
so it's much smaller than previously.

81
00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:32.582
And that is very much
kind of an aesthetic or

82
00:06:32.582 --> 00:06:39.714
design decision of whether you want to put
the scale on the group or on the path.

83
00:06:39.714 --> 00:06:41.476
And when you're using groups,

84
00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:45.532
I think you'll be making a lot of
these tiny little aesthetic decisions.

85
00:06:45.532 --> 00:06:49.998
But I wanted to make a new I decided to,
after seeing that,

86
00:06:49.998 --> 00:06:53.842
I decided to put it on the pedals for
readability.

87
00:06:53.842 --> 00:06:58.390
Yeah, so these are our flowers.
