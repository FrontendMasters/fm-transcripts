00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.690
So in this section, let's take everything
that we've been doing so far and

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.198
our observable notebooks and
translate it to an index HTML file.

3
00:00:09.198 --> 00:00:14.440
And we wanna translate both our simple
bar chart and our filled flowers.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.620
So let's get started first with
our simple bar chart and so

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.100
I have here a code sandbox and
the setup is our index HTML file.

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.447
And you can see what I've done here is and

7
00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:33.400
hello Dan kind of some
of the standard headers.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.472
I've loaded in RD3 file and

9
00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:42.227
I've loaded in a copy of lodash.

10
00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:47.372
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create my SVG element,

11
00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:51.270
like we used to do in our
observable notebooks.

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.170
I'm going to open up a script tag, and

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.600
this is where all of our
JavaScript is going to go.

14
00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:03.110
And I'm gonna copy over and
the code that we had

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.620
in our simple bar chart where we
did the animation and updating.

16
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.080
And then we're going to edit that
to make it work in our index HTML.

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.040
And hopefully you'll see that
the translation is actually quite

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.760
straightforward.

19
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.300
So oftentimes,
you can take whatever you prototyped

20
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.400
in observable and kind of drop it
straight into your code, right.

21
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.620
And your index HTML or
whatever your setup is.

22
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.262
So this is our code where we,

23
00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:48.932
Animated our simple bar chart and
I'm just gonna take all of that.

24
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:57.186
And actually,
I'm gonna take it until right here,

25
00:01:57.186 --> 00:02:02.021
where we said d3 Select button and
click update bars.

26
00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.850
I'm going to drop it
into our index HTML file.

27
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.565
And, okay, let's go ahead and
edit this a little bit so

28
00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:15.971
that it will work in this page.

29
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:21.220
So the first things that we
want to do is we add this

30
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.725
part where we say HTML back tick,
that is marked and

31
00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:30.840
that is observable specific syntax.

32
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.610
So that's not going to
work in our HTML file.

33
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.620
So let's take that out.

34
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.170
Actually let's take all of this out.

35
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.440
And here we have two
options of doing things.

36
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.250
So either we can go ahead and

37
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.770
just create the equivalent in, so
actually, let's leave this up for now.

38
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.760
And we can either create
the equivalent in here, or

39
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.460
we can create all of these with d3.

40
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.730
So I'm going to show just the option where
we're going to create it in HTML first.

41
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.626
So we have our SVG height is,

42
00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:12.706
think we hard coded, so

43
00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:17.612
let's for now hard code it.

44
00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:22.788
And this styling we can either put
it in a style, a CSS style up here

45
00:03:22.788 --> 00:03:27.700
in the header or I'm just gonna
drop it straight into the SVG.

46
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.080
Then I'm going to put in a tag for
the code.

47
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.770
And then I'm going to put in a button for
the clicking to get the new data.

48
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.212
And I believe I wrapped this in maybe,
I think probably a div tag.

49
00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:04.970
So, yeah, okay, now let's take this away.

50
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.220
So now we already see the SVG element,
probably rendering here and

51
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.260
the new data here.

52
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.460
And now we still have our rectangle
width and our SVG height defined.

53
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.690
And then here we have our
function update bars.

54
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.360
We're going to keep that.

55
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.780
And here we have the transition defined.

56
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.310
And this is where we're randomly
generating our array of data.

57
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.630
And our D3 code where we went and

58
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.500
updated and
transitioned our bars with the new data.

59
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.093
And of course, our D3 select actually,

60
00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:49.212
there is something we want
to make sure to update.

61
00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:53.983
Which is now that we're not
in observable anymore, and

62
00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:59.880
we no longer have this variable SVG,
that is the actual DOM element.

63
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.340
So here we were passed in passing in
the actual DOM element when we were in

64
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.260
observable.

65
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.880
Now what we're going to do
is turn this into a string.

66
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.190
So this is our selector.

67
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.680
So this is saying, look at that.

68
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.730
So it's actually already showing up.

69
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.560
And so this will tell D3 and
to go ahead and

70
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.580
select this element And so that works.

71
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.590
And just the same, let's go ahead and

72
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.620
turn this code into the selector, perfect.

73
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.750
And now last thing we wanna
do is select the button,

74
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.710
and we got everything translated.

75
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.492
So, yeah.

76
00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:53.780
That was hopefully a lot
simpler than I imagined.

77
00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.347
The alternate way that we can do
it potentially, is we can also.

78
00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:04.309
I wanna show this alternate way,

79
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:08.180
although I would say that this is
the easier way to translate it over.

80
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.470
Alternatively, the other option that we
have is let's say we create a div and

81
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.620
then we say okay, let's do a div ID.

82
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.130
Is equal to app.

83
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.780
And this might be how

84
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.230
you'll do things if you're working
with them like react or view.

85
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.894
And if you imagine that now we're
like in within reactor view here but,

86
00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:35.795
and now what we can do is we can say,
okay.

87
00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.150
We can have SUG.

88
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.770
Sorry, we can have D3.

89
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.140
Go ahead and select,
I'm gona call it our container.

90
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.131
And so I'm going to say D3.

91
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.700
Select and select that div with ID app.

92
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.800
And what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use that to create an SVG.

93
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.760
So I'm gonna use D3.

94
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:09.276
In this case,
I'm gonna use D3 to append an SVG and

95
00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:14.613
things are already happening.

96
00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:18.368
And I believe we had
an attribute of height,

97
00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:23.050
and in this case,
I can pass in my variable SVG height.

98
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.250
And then believe I had a style
of was it overflow, visible.

99
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.900
And again,
we could put this in CSS style tag.

100
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.410
But just for the ease, we're gonna put
it with in our JavaScript for now.

101
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.150
And we wanna create our button.

102
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.820
And so we actually need to
do it in a specific order.

103
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.716
So let's go ahead and create a div for,

104
00:07:56.716 --> 00:08:00.975
the button comes first and
then the code tag

105
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.420
So let's take the Taner and

106
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.690
we'll say, we want to create a div.

107
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.784
Let's say we're gonna call it a,

108
00:08:23.193 --> 00:08:29.150
Let's call it, no.

109
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.890
Okay.

110
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.250
Naming is the thing I
struggle the most with.

111
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.050
I'm just gonna call it button code.

112
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.040
And so
now we have that container appendage.

113
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:47.030
And then,
I can do button code that append a button.

114
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.970
And that button should say dot txt,
new data

115
00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.160
and button code dot append a code, yes.

116
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.127
And this is all working
because D3 knows to select and

117
00:09:08.127 --> 00:09:13.324
it's being passed in that string selector.

118
00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:16.806
And it knows because it's
already been created up here and

119
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:20.330
knows to go and
find that in the DOM alternatively.

120
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.883
I could name name each of these.

121
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:34.788
And then I can pass in those, wait, no,

122
00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:40.880
actually, yeah, so
I can pass in each of those.

123
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.300
But the thing to note here is we
have to pass in a DOM element.

124
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.490
So SVG right now is a D3 selection.

125
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.084
To get the DOM element out of that,
we do .node.

126
00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:58.952
Same thing, dot node here.

127
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.600
And, so any of the above works.

128
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.120
I personally think that the first
option is the easiest translation.

129
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.190
But if you already have some sort
of setup with your application,

130
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.429
your web application,
I wanted to show both of these options.

131
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.517
There we go.
