00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.360
So for this notebook,
what we want to do is to be

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.340
able to size each of our petals
based on the movie's rating.

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.930
So we might have noticed so

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.290
far that we've only been mapping
our categorical attributes.

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.488
So our genres and parental guidance for
our flower petals.

6
00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:25.400
But there's also some quantitative data
attributes that we want to map to our

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.090
flower petals also.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.722
So let's try maybe scaling our petals
by the IMDB ratings out of 10.

9
00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.150
And this is what our code looks like.

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.510
So a lot of it is very similar to
what the exercise we just did.

11
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.200
But the only difference is that in
this transform, we have this scale.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.030
So we're changing a scale after
the translate, and we're passing in and

13
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.090
we're just scaling by
the IMDB rating out of 10.

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.655
You might notice that looks like it's
not what we're hoping for, right?

15
00:01:08.655 --> 00:01:13.480
[LAUGH] I did this and I was like,
actually this kind of looks really cool.

16
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.150
It's kind of like a weird
funky artistic vibe, but

17
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.350
that's not what we're going for
with this visualization.

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.240
And we certainly don't want each
of our petals to be this big.

19
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.400
And what's actually happening is that
because the petals that we created

20
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.320
are 100 pixels tall.

21
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.869
If we're scaling, or

22
00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.607
in other words multiplying each of
our flower petals by some number.

23
00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:40.242
Some rating from zero to 10 That means
that some of our biggest petals will

24
00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.480
be like 1000 pixels tall.

25
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.260
And that's definitely not what we want,
at least for this workshop.

26
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.373
So, let's go about fixing
this with D3 scales.

27
00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:57.387
And so here's kind of like a key
concept number two, which is that

28
00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:03.260
we use D3 scales to translate our
raw data into the visual channels.

29
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.310
That we use to render to the DOM.

30
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.630
So let's take a look at
some common data types.

31
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.410
So, the ones that I've come across quite
often is quantitative data attributes.

32
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.970
So that could be the ones we talked
about with the IMDB rating out of 10.

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.580
It could be the number of IMDB votes,
and a second one is temporal.

34
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.400
So that could be a movie's release date or
DVD date.

35
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.953
It could be spatial so
that could be the city or

36
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:44.032
the country that the movie
was released in.

37
00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:48.652
And this is potentially like
we can do a map with, and

38
00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:53.800
maps are something that we
won't cover in this workshop.

39
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.690
But D3 has a lot of extended support and
functionality for it.

40
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.240
And on the other side we
have categorical data types.

41
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.830
So that could be nominal,
like genres and these movie genres.

42
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.500
Or ordinal,
which means that it's categorical but

43
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.120
with a certain implied order.

44
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.510
So, the most common example is t
shirt sizes of small, medium large.

45
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.730
In our example we have
parental guidance ratings.

46
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.820
Because there's an implied order
going from G to PG to PG13 to R.

47
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.980
And so another way that you can think
of these two buckets of data types,

48
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.760
is that one of these data types
the quantitative, the temporal.

49
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.897
Actually, spatial actually, I think I
might have categorised that incorrectly.

50
00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:57.757
Spatial should go under
the categorical one I think.

51
00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:04.724
But the quantitative and temporal one,
you can think of it as continuous.

52
00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:09.497
They're on kind of like a continuous
scale of if it's quantitative and

53
00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:11.333
it's a rating out of 10.

54
00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.600
Then you can have a rating
that's like 3.5 or

55
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.700
7.23, so that's continuous.

56
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.474
And then for these nominal or
ordinal data types,

57
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:28.999
like genres and parental guidance,

58
00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.330
these are discrete, distinct attributes.
