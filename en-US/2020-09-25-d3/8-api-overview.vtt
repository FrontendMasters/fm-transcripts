00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.689
So let's go on to our next lesson, and
so this is where we'll start on D3,

2
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:13.520
and our next one is that we want to select
the existing petal that we just created,

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.654
and we want to be able to
bind our movie data to it.

4
00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:21.266
And so
like we talked about earlier this morning,

5
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.706
the D3 API is like
extremely comprehensive and

6
00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:30.391
supports a lot of the ways that we might
go about building data visualization.

7
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:35.514
And that's really great, but
that can also feel really overwhelming.

8
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:40.132
So in my attempt at organizing
all of these modules, and

9
00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:45.344
their submodules and functions,
I've put them into the steps

10
00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:51.062
in the data visualization creation
process, that I might use them.

11
00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:55.840
And I guess I should actually
give context to mean in the data

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.153
visualization coding process
that I might use them.

13
00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:06.240
So, these are all of the I think,

14
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.726
pretty up to date.

15
00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:15.850
Yeah, so these are most or
if not all of the modules in D3.

16
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.466
And and so I've kind of broken them
down by the modules that I might use for

17
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:26.532
data preparation, and so
those are things like the array modules

18
00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:31.986
in which they will help me to figure
out the minimum and maximum value.

19
00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:36.948
And then the array or
collections which will

20
00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:40.979
help me like group my JSON objects.

21
00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.494
So it's kind of the what
we have our raw data,

22
00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:53.617
and then preparing it to put
into our layout calculation.

23
00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:58.616
And the second step is that layout
calculation, where it might

24
00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:03.726
be that we want to draw a pie chart,
let's not go with pie chart.

25
00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:08.775
And let's say that we want to draw a tree,
and so

26
00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:15.594
we might use D3 to calculate the path,
the define attribute for

27
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:20.012
the path to draw kind of like that little,

28
00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:23.940
link between different tree nodes.

29
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.385
We might use D3 to calculate the positions
of each of those tree nodes,

30
00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:33.034
and so
this is the layout calculation section.

31
00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:39.880
So there's a lot of different layouts
that D3 will help us calculate, and

32
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.867
get us all the positions and
attributes we need to draw in the DOM.

33
00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:50.067
And the third section is DOM manipulation,
so

34
00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:55.237
that's kind of making sure
that the correct DOM elements

35
00:02:55.237 --> 00:03:00.315
are created or removed,
based on the data that we have.

36
00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:05.329
And then, we have some finishing touches,
so, that might be D3

37
00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.539
making it really easy for us if we
have a chart to draw the axis for us.

38
00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:15.868
It has some support for animation,
it has some support for

39
00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:21.741
interactions, and so
that might be being able to drag different

40
00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:26.961
shapes in the visualization or,
that might be being able

41
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:32.647
to brush interacts with a brush
to filter the visualization.

42
00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:36.881
And so those are kind of the broad
categories that I tend to think of these

43
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:37.666
modules in.

44
00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:45.381
And today,
we're going to cover these sections.

45
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:49.021
So we're going to first cover
this DOM manipulation part.

46
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:54.212
And this DOM manipulation part is
kind of the core foundation of D3,

47
00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:59.402
and how it works, and we're also
going to talk about D3 scales, and

48
00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:04.346
we're going to cover a little bit
of transitions for animation.

49
00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:10.073
And then we're going to finish with the
force layout for positioning, our flowers.

50
00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:17.555
And this might look like it's just
such a tiny subset of the library,

51
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:22.328
but actually, it really is this third one,

52
00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:27.361
this DOM manipulation part really is so
core.

53
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:32.526
That just understanding this part
will make a lot of the examples that

54
00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:37.604
feature the other parts,
all the different layout calculations or

55
00:04:37.604 --> 00:04:43.038
interactions, just having a good
grasp of this DOM manipulation part,

56
00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:46.978
will make the rest of
the library make a lot of sense.

57
00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:51.729
And I'm not saying that like the rest
of this will make sense right away.

58
00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.572
You'll still need like a little bit of
patience to read through the docs for

59
00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:56.914
the different modules and

60
00:04:56.914 --> 00:05:00.270
a little bit of patience to sift
through the different examples.

61
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.828
But, you'll be able to read
those example code and

62
00:05:03.828 --> 00:05:09.289
be able to identify what's happening and
be able to figure out how to apply it,

63
00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.705
instead of kind of just copy and
pasting the example code over.

64
00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:18.850
So yeah, so this little bit that
we'll cover really is very powerful,

65
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.871
and will hopefully make you feel really
comfortable with D3 after this workshop.
