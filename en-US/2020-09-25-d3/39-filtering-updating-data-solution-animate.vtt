00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.230
Let's do the part two of
this exercise together.

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.900
So the part two is that we
are going to make everything anime.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.165
So let's get the first thing going
which is that when in flower

4
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:21.105
animates in, we are going to fade it in.

5
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:28.568
So the very first thing we want to make
sure to do is that we are going to,

6
00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.830
Set the opacity on the group element.

7
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.895
So let's go ahead and set the opacity
to 0 on the enter selection.

8
00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:50.597
There's that and then we want

9
00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:58.023
the opacity to go to 1
after the animation.

10
00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:02.800
And so let's go ahead and come down here,

11
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.320
create our transition,
pass in our T that we've defined up top.

12
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.010
And we're going to say
that we want the capacity

13
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.150
to animate from 0 to 1.

14
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.340
And just a side note that we could have
actually put this in the enter selection

15
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.810
because it really is just the enter
selection that we want to be feeding in.

16
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.642
But since we're going to be
doing the animation.transition

17
00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:41.125
call down here anyways,
it's just saves one or

18
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:46.518
two lines to be doing it on
the enter an update selection.

19
00:01:46.518 --> 00:01:51.423
For this on the update selections nothing
happens because with the update selections

20
00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:54.510
the opacity is already 1 so
it's going from 1 to 1.

21
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.727
But for the enter selection in here,
it's going to go from 0 to 1.

22
00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:04.354
So actually let's take a look at if
this is doing what we expect it to.

23
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:15.956
And, So we're definitely

24
00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:24.090
seeing the animating to the new position.

25
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.630
Definitely seen that.

26
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.108
So let's see what happens if we,
wooh, did you see that?

27
00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:37.116
My laptop's like,
please stop making me do all this stuff.

28
00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:42.189
Okay, so what you might have
seen is that it did feed in but

29
00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.782
also because we hadn't specified an X or

30
00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:51.620
Y we hadn't specified the translate
on our enter selection.

31
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.400
It defaulted to all of
the flowers being on 0,0 and

32
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.960
that's why everything kind
of just like animated in,

33
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.170
everything that got newly created,
they got animated in from the top left.

34
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.670
So let's go and fix that, and

35
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.380
I'm just going to be, because I'm lazy,
I'm gonna just copy it and paste it here.

36
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.030
And so this, everything in here is going
to be the state A that we transition from,

37
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.840
because it is before
the .transition is called.

38
00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:31.680
And then the last thing we want to do
is go ahead into our exit selection.

39
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.790
So let's go ahead and
do nothing with the update selection.

40
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.820
This is a comma and
then go into our exit selection.

41
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.490
And we want to save that.

42
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.710
We want to have those exit elements,

43
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.500
those elements being removed to go from 1

44
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.780
opacity 100 to opacity 0, so
it currently has opacity 1.

45
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.345
So we're going to say transition,
and we're going to say opacity,

46
00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:16.740
0, and then we're going to
chain remove on that and

47
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.244
d3 knows to only remove the DOM
element once this transition finishes.

48
00:04:23.244 --> 00:04:30.214
So now let's take a look.

49
00:04:30.214 --> 00:04:35.094
Let's, I don't know if you saw ooh,
look at that.

50
00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:39.574
So this is maybe a little
bit hard to see but

51
00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:45.078
you can see that some of
the flowers got faded out and

52
00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:52.630
then some got faded in and they
definitely all move to their new place.

53
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.300
So there's this lesson all done.

54
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.350
I hope it was fun.

55
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.420
I think this is one of the more
exciting exercises where we get

56
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.718
to kind of see some animations and
we get to filter down on our flowers.

57
00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:18.560
Yeah, so
we've implemented a filter by option.
