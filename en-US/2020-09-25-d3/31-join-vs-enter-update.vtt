1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.285
And so now that we have all of these
different selections calculated,

2
00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:08.756
and we're going to use
that to update the DOM.

3
00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:13.458
And there are actually two valid
ways to update the DOM, and

4
00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:18.739
they result in exactly the same,
it's the exact same end result.

5
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.160
But there is an old way and a new way.

6
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.160
So let's start with the old way.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.437
So with the old way, what we're going to
do is, We're going to take this rect,

8
00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:40.847
which is a D3 selection with all of our
select currently existing five rectangles.

9
00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:44.109
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

10
00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.662
Sorry, this rect is what
the .data returned us.

11
00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:54.269
So it's the one that has the update
selection, enter selection,

12
00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.220
exit selection and this rect itself
represents the update selection.

13
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.770
And you'll see what I
mean in a little bit.

14
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.729
So from rect,
let's grab the exit selection with

15
00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.410
this .exit, and we'll tell D3 that

16
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.280
this selection of the three rectangle
elements, let's remove it from the DOM.

17
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.025
The second thing we do in this old way is,
we go ahead and

18
00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:31.360
we grab the enter selection, and
we create the new rectangles.

19
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.790
And then, the best practice
I used to follow is to set

20
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.400
attributes on that enter selection.

21
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.640
We're going to set attributes
that don't depend on the data.

22
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.443
And then we're going to put
that in this variable enter.

23
00:01:54.714 --> 00:02:00.986
And finally, we want to grab
everything that is either existing,

24
00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:05.242
so our update selection and
our newly created

25
00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:10.294
rectangle elements so
that's our enter selection.

26
00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:15.599
And we want to merge those together,
the enter and

27
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.032
update selections, and
that new merged selection

28
00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:25.957
is what are going to be
in the DOM that perfectly

29
00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:30.690
reflects what's in the new data array.

30
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.740
So, enter and update selections together,

31
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.690
is going to be what's in the DOM

32
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.542
by the end of all of this to perfectly
match what's in the new data array.

33
00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:49.510
So enter.merge, and
then for that selection,

34
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.060
we're going to set attributes that
change when the data changes.

35
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.120
And the reason why we want to
kind of do it that way where

36
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.060
enter is setting attributes that
don't depend on the data and

37
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.760
with the enter+update is
the attributes that do

38
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.100
depend on data is because we
want to make sure to call these.

39
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.915
We want to make sure to set
these attributes every time

40
00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:22.309
the data updates, and
that's why we do it here.

41
00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:28.177
So that's the old way.

42
00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:36.210
And now the new way,
which I think is really nice.

43
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.324
So the new way is just like before,
we go and grab our SVG element.

44
00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:45.808
We select all of the existing rectangles,

45
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:50.860
which is those five existing
rectangle elements.

46
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.410
We bind the data as before
with our key function,

47
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.770
and now we call this
function called .join.

48
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.932
We're going to tell .join that we want
to be creating or removing rectangles.

49
00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:15.405
And this one line if .join takes
care of all of the enters and

50
00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:19.799
exits that we explicitly
called in the old way.

51
00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.600
And that's really exciting because
that cuts out a lot of lines of code.

52
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.560
So, in this one line and this .join,
what it returns is that final enter and

53
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.840
update selection merged together so
that we get that selection

54
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.840
all of the DOM elements that
matched in your data array.

55
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.251
So because we get that enter and
update selection,

56
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:49.801
we can set all of our attributes on it.

57
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:53.023
We can set all of our attributes
that are dependent on the data and

58
00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:56.376
we can set all of our attributes
that are not dependent on the data.

59
00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:58.227
And these few lines,

60
00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:07.890
Do the exact same thing as all of these
lines that I showed you previously.

61
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.400
So the new way is really, really nice.

62
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.807
And if we want to access
specific selections,

63
00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:20.918
because maybe we want to do
specific things on just the enter

64
00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:25.725
selection because maybe like
before with our flowers,

65
00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:29.325
we have a nested SVG or nested structure.

66
00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:33.392
So then maybe when we create
an enter our group elements,

67
00:05:33.392 --> 00:05:38.940
maybe we need to also create an enter
all of our paths and all of our text.

68
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.365
In that case, we have this thing
where we can call .join and

69
00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:51.149
instead of saying that we
want to render rectangles,

70
00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:56.291
we pass in these functions
of the first function

71
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:01.327
is that we get back and
we pass in the function.

72
00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:06.121
And we'll get as input

73
00:06:06.121 --> 00:06:10.920
the enter selection,

74
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.944
From .data and
the important thing is that we need to

75
00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:24.048
then return the enter.append,
so we need to return

76
00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:29.741
that enter selection with all
of the rectangles created.

77
00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:34.021
And then here, we can set attributes or
whatever we need to do for

78
00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.540
the enter selection.

79
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.770
And we can do the same thing
with the update selection.

80
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.695
Although here,
I'm showing it as just returning that

81
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:48.515
update selection because I
haven't really ever come

82
00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:53.867
across too many use cases where
I need to operate on just only

83
00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:59.025
the update selection,
only the existing DOM elements.

84
00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:02.845
But certainly you can do exactly
the same thing as here, here and

85
00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:07.091
finally, a third function where we
get passed in the exit selection and

86
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:09.810
we can do whatever we
might need to with that.

87
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.401
And I should also note that,
you don't have to pass in update and

88
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:23.500
exit, you can pass in just enter,
so the rest of these are optional.

89
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.508
And finally, just as previously .join
returns the enter+update selection so

90
00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:33.512
we can also chain
attributes down here after.

91
00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:43.820
So the new way really is much
more convenient than the old way.

92
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.028
But I wanted to show you the old way
first because I think it's really quite

93
00:07:49.028 --> 00:07:55.168
important to understand where this new way
came from, the thought process behind it.

94
00:07:55.168 --> 00:07:59.894
And kind of how to think through, the
enter selection, the update selection and

95
00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:01.159
the exit selection.
