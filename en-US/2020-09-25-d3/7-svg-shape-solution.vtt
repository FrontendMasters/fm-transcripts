00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.180
I hoped that exercise went well.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.590
Sorry again for
the confusion about the translation.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.380
And but we have some really great,
amazing pedals that

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.712
have come through both in the chat and
in the classroom.

5
00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:20.950
And so for us to go forward
with I wanted to use the one

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.300
that vijay, I hope I'm pronouncing
the name correctly, but vijay, sent along.

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.010
And it's this really cool
looking like flower or

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.120
like it looks kind of like a fire.

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.790
And I thought that just looks so cool.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.070
So, we're going to go ahead and use that.

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.560
And I saw also that a picture had multiple
different pedals, which is really cool.

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.180
So in that case, what you can do
is you've gone above and beyond.

13
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.730
And what you can do is
I actually have this

14
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.700
workshop utility

15
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.200
functions notebook that's kind of like the
secret glue behind all of my notebooks.

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.080
And if you only just go here and
just click on that, or you can also

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.270
access it from this kind of like drop down
is called workshop utility functions.

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.100
Just go in there and
find the cell that's called pedal parts.

19
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.140
And then just paste in your
other pedals in here also.

20
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.790
For anyone that wants to drop in
a bunch of your own custom pads, and

21
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.480
I have up to four options and
that you can kinda just like pasting here.

22
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.630
And you'll see that propagating through
the rest of the notebooks, yeah, so

23
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.290
you can just put your petal passing here.

24
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.886
But for us, let's go forward with this and

25
00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:55.356
firepath it's really cool looking, and

26
00:01:55.356 --> 00:02:03.315
I think I'm just gonna really quickly
kind of decipher what's going on.

27
00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:08.330
Let's walk through really
quickly what's going on with

28
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.210
this flower pedal in retrospect.

29
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.320
I don't know why I chose such a
complicated one to walk through but let's

30
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.470
try and walk through and
hopefully correct quickly together.

31
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.700
So I see a few different
set of commands going on.

32
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.248
So I'm just kind of putting them into
different rows so that it's easier for

33
00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:32.899
me to see.

34
00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.510
So many curves.

35
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.870
Good job Vj.

36
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.130
So let's see what's going on.

37
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.660
We have zero 085 I think
we're starting out here,

38
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.710
we have a line going to negative 20.

39
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.630
So that must be here.

40
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.220
Then we have a curve.

41
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.560
So this must be this curve.

42
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.830
And it ends at negative 3040.

43
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.290
So that looks right.

44
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.890
And then we have another line
that goes down coming here.

45
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.400
So I'm now looking at this negative 2060.

46
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.990
And then another curve.

47
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.280
This is a great looking curve cuz
now you have an anchor point.

48
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.920
So you start here.

49
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.860
And then you have an anchor
point going this direction and

50
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.150
the second anchor point going
down in this direction and

51
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.430
that's how you're getting kind of that,
little gentle sine wave.

52
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.380
And then I see, so you copy and paste it.

53
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.450
So then we went back down here and
then we did this

54
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.060
curve again on the other side so
you married it.

55
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.440
And actually just as a test let's
make sure that the fill works great.

56
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.790
Ooh, the fill looks great too.

57
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.910
Brilliant, this is so exciting.

58
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.370
We're going to keep moving forward in the
notebooks with this fire pedal, and in my

59
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.730
notebooks but hopefully in your notebooks
you'll be able to see your own pedal path.

60
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.440
Being rendered as flowers as we go along.

61
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.070
And as a kind of some SVG debugging,
and these are probably

62
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.530
the two most common bugs I ran
across when I first was starting.

63
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.300
And it's that if you don't see your
shape rendering on the screen,

64
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.800
the two reasons might be that, you didn't
set the width and height on your SVG.

65
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.430
So that defaults to 300 pixels wide and
100 pixels tall.

66
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.360
And and so you didn't set the width and
height explicitly.

67
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.080
And your shapes are being drawn
outside of that viewport and

68
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.480
that's why you don't see it.

69
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.210
That's the first Bug that I've come
across many times and been frustrated by.

70
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.110
And the second one is that for the shapes,
you didn't set your necessary attributes.

71
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.455
So that's your width and
height on your rectangles.

72
00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:06.835
That's your radius on your circles.

73
00:05:06.835 --> 00:05:09.245
And for the path,
it's your define attribute.

74
00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:14.195
So those are the two
common ways that I see

75
00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:19.002
bugs happening and then like confusion.

76
00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:24.162
And so watch out for those and actually I
just thought of a third one, which is for

77
00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:26.072
any paths or lines.

78
00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:34.470
If your shape doesn't kind of like
automatically, making a shape that can be

79
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.240
filled and that won't show
up because by default paths,

80
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.760
and all shapes are filled black and
then stroke none.

81
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.030
And so if you only have a path or a line,
that won't show up either you have

82
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.600
to be able to close your path or something
like that to be able to see the fill.

83
00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.430
So watch out for this.
