00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.065
So I want us to do an exercise, and

2
00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:07.946
what we're going to do is we're
going to try updating our

3
00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:12.948
simple bar chart the two ways,
the old way and the new way.

4
00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.096
And if we've done them correctly,

5
00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:23.462
the bars should show up here
every time I ask for new data
