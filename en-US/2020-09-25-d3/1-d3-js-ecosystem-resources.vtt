WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.409
To create these flowers,
we have these kind of seven

2
00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:10.638
different actions and
then, and within those some

3
00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:15.759
key takeaways that will
help us cover SVG and D3.

4
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.740
So the first is to just draw
a flower petal onto the screen.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.526
And for that we'll use SVG paths,
and so about one we'll be

6
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:30.135
able to learn about SVG
coordinate system and SVG paths.

7
00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:34.749
And in particular the D or
define attribute on SVG paths.

8
00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:41.844
Then we're going to use D3 to select that
existing petal, and bind the movie data.

9
00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:46.193
And for that we'll be able to
learn about D3 selections,

10
00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:50.382
data binding, and
setting attributes and CSS styles.

11
00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:57.337
Then we'll create a petal for each movie.

12
00:00:57.337 --> 00:01:02.625
And, when we do that, we'll learn
about D3's enter append pattern,

13
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.832
and we'll also learn
a little bit more SVG,

14
00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:11.660
we'll learn about SVG transforms, and
in particular the translate command.

15
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.697
And once we have a petal drawn for
each movie,

16
00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:21.470
what we're going to do is then we're going

17
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.592
to render it based on all of the data.

18
00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:30.405
So we'll use D3 scales to
translate our data to what we need

19
00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:32.435
to draw onto the screen.

20
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:37.541
And so we'll use D3 min,
max, extend, D3 scales,

21
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:42.103
and also the scale function for
SVG transforms.

22
00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:46.642
Once we have all of the data
mapped to our individual petals,

23
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:50.469
we'll learn about nesting
with D3 selection, so

24
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.395
turn each of those petals
into flowers of their own.

25
00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:59.234
And we'll also use SVG rotate or
transforms rotate to do that.

26
00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:04.163
And then towards the end,
we will learn about

27
00:02:04.163 --> 00:02:08.973
how D3 does their update and exit pattern.

28
00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:14.625
And what this is, or
oftentimes what you'll

29
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:20.015
probably have is, data sets that change.

30
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:24.374
So, if you have one state of data and
then maybe something happens,

31
00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:27.519
maybe this is like a real
time updating data set.

32
00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.251
And so you'll have like a next
state that you're trying to go to,

33
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.483
and then when that happens with D3,

34
00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:41.716
there's something called
the Enter update exit pattern.

35
00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:47.329
And that's how you update the DOM,
the browser DOM,

36
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.320
to update it from what was rendered for

37
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.076
that first data state
to the next data state.

38
00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.193
And that's when we'll also
learn about D3 transitions.

39
00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:05.862
And that's kind of D3's version
of animations or not version,

40
00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:11.693
but it's D3's implementation
of kind of animations.

41
00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:18.005
So we'll animate from that first state
data state to the next data state.

42
00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:23.042
And finally we're going to
learn a little bit about D3's,

43
00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:27.604
many, many variety of ways
to kind of lay out the data.

44
00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:32.939
So we'll have like a very brief overview
of D3's shapes and hierarchies.

45
00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.475
And then we'll use the D3 force layout to
position our film flowers by the genres.

46
00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:43.992
So this will hopefully be like
a good kinda high level overview

47
00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:49.083
of the D3 library, so
that by the end you'll feel pretty

48
00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:55.452
comfortable digging around in
different parts and most importantly,

49
00:03:55.452 --> 00:04:00.254
there's a lot a lot of
examples in the D3 community.

50
00:04:00.254 --> 00:04:05.941
So, you'll hopefully feel very comfortable
digging into each of these examples,

51
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:10.119
reading the code and
understanding exactly what is going on.

52
00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:17.263
And, So a little bit of resources,

53
00:04:17.263 --> 00:04:21.958
and kind of data visualization ecosystem.

54
00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.613
So here is the D3 API reference.

55
00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:26.897
As [LAUGH] I mentioned earlier, so

56
00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:32.454
these are all the different modules that
you're seeing on the screen right now.

57
00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:36.125
And then if you like, scroll through,

58
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:41.021
I personally find it a little
bit overwhelming, but

59
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:46.375
we'll kind of cover how to go
through this API together.

60
00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:51.564
So there's, it just has a lot

61
00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:58.001
of really great functionality but,

62
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:06.108
I'm just showing this
to you don't get yeah.

63
00:05:06.108 --> 00:05:11.126
But this is kind of how the doc is
structured, and I think it'd be really

64
00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:16.413
helpful to kind of take a look at this
later, to figure out what is going on.

65
00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:21.298
And the next really great resource is,
as I mentioned earlier,

66
00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:26.455
with D3 ecosystem, there's a lot
of examples that have been built

67
00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:31.174
a lot of like little bite sized
examples that have been built.

68
00:05:31.174 --> 00:05:36.857
And when D3 first started in 2011,
a lot of these examples

69
00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:42.017
were hosted on this website
called blocks bldocs.org.

70
00:05:42.017 --> 00:05:45.909
And you can see these
are some of the popular ones,

71
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.245
and I think there's something like 40 or

72
00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:54.170
50,000 of these examples, so
if you want to take a look,

73
00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:00.891
It used to look something like this,

74
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:05.815
where you'll have kind of
a preview of the code.

75
00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:11.465
And, Gosh,

76
00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:15.086
so you'll have a preview of the code.

77
00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:21.156
And then here, you'll have the index HTML.

78
00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:27.035
And so basically this is what's being

79
00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:32.185
rendered up here in the preview.

80
00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:37.553
So this is how we used to kind
of like look at D3 examples for

81
00:06:37.553 --> 00:06:39.754
a good number of years.

82
00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:44.544
So this is the D3 code, and
then we will kind of like look at this and

83
00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:48.241
play around with it to
figure out what's going on.

84
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:52.376
And then I think two years ago or so,

85
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:01.218
Observable was launched, and

86
00:07:01.218 --> 00:07:06.098
let's see if I can give you the home

87
00:07:06.098 --> 00:07:11.759
view, Let me show you the home view.

88
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.897
So yeah, so
Observable is well they describe

89
00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:22.575
themselves I think as a magic notebook for
data and

90
00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:29.080
visualization I think is how
they describe themselves.

91
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.824
Explore and visualize data,
discover and be inspired.

92
00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:38.938
Yeah, so this is kind of a lot of
where the D3 examples are hosted now.

93
00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:44.103
If you look at the docs and For
kind of a lot of the D3 functions

94
00:07:44.103 --> 00:07:48.863
if you see an examples link
right next to that function,

95
00:07:48.863 --> 00:07:53.042
it will usually lead to
an Observable notebook.

96
00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:57.879
And I think of Observable
notebooks a little bit like,

97
00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:02.399
if Jupyter Notebooks were on the web,
and built for

98
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:09.992
instead of writing in Python you write in
JavaScript, and built for visualization.

99
00:08:09.992 --> 00:08:12.447
So, that's what we're using today.

100
00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:17.982
And, I think another note
I should mention about

101
00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:25.137
Observable is that I think the key
difference is that whereas,

102
00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:30.132
my understanding of
other notebooks is that

103
00:08:30.132 --> 00:08:35.532
each cell is evaluated in
a like top down order.

104
00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:42.048
So, whatever cell comes first is
evaluated first, Observable notebook is,

105
00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:46.698
I believe,
evaluated I think they call it reactively.

106
00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:50.738
So, there's a dependency
chain of cells and

107
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:55.733
whatever is at the top root
of that dependency chain is,

108
00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:59.147
evaluated first and then going down.

109
00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:04.078
So actually I've gotten questions
where people were a little bit

110
00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:09.202
confused about where the like
requires where or the imports where.

111
00:09:09.202 --> 00:09:13.479
So, I have a lot of those down here.

112
00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:20.668
And that's just because the cells
can be in any order that I want.

113
00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:25.619
So, I like to just order my notebook
with all of the information up top,

114
00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:29.429
and kind of all of the utility
functions at the bottom.

115
00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:32.557
So if you ever get lost in
any of these notebooks and

116
00:09:32.557 --> 00:09:35.763
you're wondering where
something is happening,

117
00:09:35.763 --> 00:09:40.176
oftentimes a might be at the bottom,
so I just wanted to give that now.

118
00:09:42.522 --> 00:09:48.577
And for observable, I wanted to give a
small disclaimer that as of right now for

119
00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:50.595
like the next few months,

120
00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:56.685
I have a partnership with Observable to
create a certain number of notebooks.

121
00:09:56.685 --> 00:10:01.371
But, I also want to say that I've been
using the Observable for the last two and

122
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.920
a half years and I will have created
this workshop with observable anyways.

123
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.342
So just a small disclaimer but also
that I would have just used it anyways.

124
00:10:11.342 --> 00:10:15.978
And the last two are more kind
of like community resources.

125
00:10:15.978 --> 00:10:19.253
So, there is a D3 slack and

126
00:10:19.253 --> 00:10:24.819
where you can kind of
ask questions about D3.

127
00:10:24.819 --> 00:10:30.179
And then there is a wider
data visualization society,

128
00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:33.331
and they aren't D3 specific.

129
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:40.495
But I think there's a lot of people
knowledgeable of D3 in their slack also.

130
00:10:40.495 --> 00:10:44.626
So I think both would
be great resources for,

131
00:10:44.626 --> 00:10:49.517
if you're really stuck on D3 and
you want some help,

132
00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:54.966
I think those places would be
great places to ask, so yeah.
