00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.151
So now that we have these kind of
data bound on our SVG elements,

2
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:13.277
what we want to do next is to be able to
use them to manipulate our DOM elements.

3
00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:19.696
And to do that our d3 has .attr and
.style.

4
00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:24.439
And [COUGH] all right,
these will set either

5
00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.991
the attributes or
CSS styles on our SVG elements.

6
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:35.358
And so
here we have our five rectangles, and

7
00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:42.176
what we've done is we went and
set the width to sorry,

8
00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:46.962
we just have a variable that says we want

9
00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:51.775
the rectangle width to be 50 pixels.

10
00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:57.605
And then we just set the width to
the number of bars times that width,

11
00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:03.456
set the height of 100,
still have our five rectangle elements.

12
00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:08.556
And here's what we've done,
you say go and get our SVG, and

13
00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:13.567
within that SVG container,
select all of our rectangles.

14
00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:18.594
So here, and
let's bind our array of five numbers,

15
00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:22.948
bind that data on to all
of these rectangles.

16
00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:28.751
And then we're going to use our bound
data, to calculate the exposition.

17
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:34.201
And I want the exposition to be
the index of that rectangle,

18
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:38.673
multiplied by the width,
the rectangle width.

19
00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:42.961
We want the height to just
be the data that's bound,

20
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:48.813
the width to be the previously
defined rectangle width of 50 pixels.

21
00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:53.563
Put in some shape width of 3,

22
00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:58.503
put in some fill color of pink,

23
00:01:58.503 --> 00:02:03.065
and this is how we have this.

24
00:02:04.862 --> 00:02:09.317
And and actually let's talk
about how this is working

25
00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:14.466
underneath the hood first, and
so with the addr and .style,

26
00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:19.516
what it does is it takes a selection,
and it loops through all

27
00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:25.678
of the elements in the selection all
of the DOM elements in the selection.

28
00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:30.634
And it sets either the attribute or
CSS style on all of those elements.

29
00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:34.405
And so if value is a function, so

30
00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:40.293
if what we're passing in
is a function like this.

31
00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:45.913
So if this value is a function,
then what d3 does,

32
00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:52.320
is loops through and
passes in the data that's bound, and

33
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.322
the index of that particular, DOM element.

34
00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:02.622
So what we've done here is for
the x and the height,

35
00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:09.171
we've said, loop through each
of these rectangle elements.

36
00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:14.226
And for the first rectangle,
the data that's been bound is 45 and

37
00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:19.382
the index is 0, so the X will
evaluate to 0, and the height is 45.

38
00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:26.313
For the second one, data bound is 67,
index is 1, x thus is 1 times 50 is 50,

39
00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:31.898
height is the data so it's 67 and
so on with all of the rectangles.

40
00:03:31.898 --> 00:03:35.084
So that's kind of what d3 is doing for

41
00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:39.674
us underneath the hood,
when we call attr or .style.

42
00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:46.129
So I wanted to take kind of
just like a few minutes and

43
00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.053
maybe like five minutes to
kind of just play around

44
00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:55.171
with each of these cells that we covered.

45
00:03:55.171 --> 00:04:00.825
I knew that I went through quite quickly
in terms of, console logging all of this.

46
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:04.129
So I just want you to either,

47
00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.501
here instead of maybe
using the bar d maybe here

48
00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:14.734
maybe we can find some
other data if you want to

49
00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:20.243
pass along some different data,
give it a try,

50
00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:24.836
like console, log different things.

51
00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:31.834
And then for the attributes,
try playing around with these numbers or

52
00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:36.825
try passing along maybe
functions if you want to.

53
00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:42.113
And, if you want to try different
presentation attributes,

54
00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:48.633
here's a list of the different attributes
that you can set on SVG elements.

55
00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:53.519
So I just want us to take a few moments,
to kind of play around with these cells so

56
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:59.000
that you can kind of get a, hopefully more
intuitive understanding of d3 selections,

57
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.096
and how data binding is working.

58
00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:06.640
And how we can use those bound data with
the attributes on these DOM elements.
