1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.060
We're trying to create an array of
objects for creating the flowers.

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.810
And so let's do that together.

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.960
And so the very first thing let's do
is the colors for the movie genres.

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.740
Now thus far we've been using
that object with the genre,

5
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.990
the object that has the genre
to the color mapping.

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.280
And we had to do something weird for

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.140
when our genre wasn't in that color object
because it wasn't one of the top genre.

8
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.180
So then, we had to use this other color.

9
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.590
Let's kinda take a look at how D3
scales makes that much easier for us.

10
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.360
So we're going to use cons color scale.

11
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.960
Let's call it color scale.

12
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.160
We're going to use scale ordinal.

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.460
So that one was where we map from
a discrete input to a discrete output.

14
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.116
And what we're gonna do is we're
going to use as our domain and

15
00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.858
we have this array of top genres.

16
00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:16.960
And that I think looks like
let's take a quick look at that.

17
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.948
So the array of, oops sorry,

18
00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:26.790
the array of top genres looks like this.

19
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.420
It's this array of these
four strings of genres.

20
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.890
And then we're gonna
take a look at the code.

21
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.376
And then, the path colors that we're going
to map to is also, there's no path colors?

22
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:53.497
Petal colors, I'm sorry, petal colors.

23
00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:59.242
So, petal colors is also an array of

24
00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:08.330
Four strings, in this case,
the hex code for the colors.

25
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.870
And so we're going to map these
two arrays to each other.

26
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.340
So, basically, we're saying map each of

27
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.271
the genres in the top genres array to each
of the colors in the petal colors array.

28
00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:29.761
And then because I saw our
movies have genres that aren't

29
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:34.701
in the top genres array, for
anything that's unknown.

30
00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.404
We want to use the other color.

31
00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:50.800
So color object dot other is
just this kind of yellow color.

32
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.720
So we're just saying if

33
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.690
we can map these top genres
to these petal colors.

34
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.291
But if our movie has a genre that's
not in this top genres array,

35
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.502
we're going to use this color
instead when it's unknown.

36
00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.801
So that's the first thing.

37
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:17.460
Then, so let's put that in there and
let's see if it works.

38
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.360
So let's call it color.

39
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.233
And let's use color scale and
say d dot genres.

40
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:31.070
So, for each movie, the first genre.

41
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.590
And let's see if that is working.

42
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.126
Perfect.
So for each of them,

43
00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:45.593
we have the color set on them now.

44
00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:51.435
And I think for some of these,
these are the ones with other genres and

45
00:03:51.435 --> 00:03:54.470
those are being taken care of also.

46
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.378
And then the second thing
we did was get the,

47
00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:08.871
The go from, the rated.

48
00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:12.517
So the PG rating to the type of petal.

49
00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:16.721
And again,
because this is a discrete to discrete,

50
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:19.594
we're going to use scale ordinal.

51
00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:24.682
And actually, here's another thing

52
00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:31.519
that makes life quite a bit
easier with D3 scales.

53
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:35.242
Instead of using the objects
that we were doing before.

54
00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:41.622
Which is that, in this particular example,
we're not going to specify any domains.

55
00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:49.775
And we're just going to say we want the
output to be this array of petal paths.

56
00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:55.165
And what D3 will go ahead and
do for us is that and

57
00:04:55.165 --> 00:05:00.205
every time it sees a new and
parental guidance reading.

58
00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:05.480
It will automatically map

59
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.710
it to whatever petal path
has not been mapped to yet.

60
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:20.392
So let's say that the very
first movie as rating is PG,

61
00:05:20.392 --> 00:05:25.235
then it will map this PG to the first

62
00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:29.926
path in our array of petal paths.

63
00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:37.850
And let's say after three or four more
of the rating PG it sees, the rating R.

64
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:44.251
And so because it's all a new one,
it's going to map that string R,

65
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:49.655
that rating R to the second
path in our petal paths array.

66
00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:54.561
So that's really nice because
we don't have to explicitly

67
00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:58.202
write out an array of, G, PG, PG13, R.

68
00:05:58.202 --> 00:06:00.709
And D3 will just take care of it for us.

69
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.320
So let's go ahead and do that.

70
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.852
So we're gonna call it path.

71
00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:15.415
And we'll say path scale and
we're going to pass in our PG rated.

72
00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:21.031
And so now, cool, so,
you can see that each of

73
00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:26.800
them now has a path,
that is being mapped to it.

74
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.673
So that's why it appeared like this.

75
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.238
In here.

76
00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:38.480
So this is our code thus far.

77
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.258
And then let's do the two new ones.

78
00:06:40.258 --> 00:06:47.620
So let's,
map our ratings out of 10 to our scale.

79
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.170
So let's call that a size scale.

80
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.870
And this one is a continuous mapping,
a continuous to continuous mapping.

81
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.820
And so in this case,
we're going to use scale linear.

82
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.180
And you might have noticed that I
listed a few other continuous scales,

83
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.830
like scale log, or scale power,
or scale square root.

84
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.170
And so I usually tend to use
scale log when there's some

85
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.180
really extreme numbers that are outliers.

86
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.583
And then so those are kind of like if you
just use a linear scale then maybe most of

87
00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.596
your data points will be down here.

88
00:07:32.596 --> 00:07:34.556
But then that one extreme
will be up here and

89
00:07:34.556 --> 00:07:36.630
you can't quite see
the detail within here.

90
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:43.437
And skill log will what kind of like let
you kind of expand the bottom part and

91
00:07:43.437 --> 00:07:47.778
then be able to see kind
of the bottom part also.

92
00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:52.249
Though, be careful with
scale logs because and

93
00:07:52.249 --> 00:08:00.316
a lot of people might not notice that it's
a logarithmic scale that's been applied.

94
00:08:00.316 --> 00:08:03.070
So then it might
potentially be misleading.

95
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.480
Be very careful about
how you label the axes.

96
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:13.036
And, yeah, so logarithmic scales
are also very useful and helpful.

97
00:08:13.036 --> 00:08:17.537
When, let's say the data points
you have might have a kind of

98
00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:20.990
an exponential growth
sort of trend going on.

99
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.352
So that's when I might use a log scale.

100
00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:30.179
And I might use a scale
square root when I'm

101
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:34.346
trying to map the radius of a circle.

102
00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:39.382
So, there's different times when
different scales can be used.

103
00:08:39.382 --> 00:08:44.348
But for our example,
we're just going to stick

104
00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:49.325
to the kind of linear mapping for
scaling here.

105
00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:52.677
And so we have a reading and so

106
00:08:52.677 --> 00:08:57.583
actually now this is where we want to say.

107
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.461
Let's say that we're going to
get the min and max rating.

108
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:11.735
Out of our movies data set, so
we're going to say D3 dot extent.

109
00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:13.670
We're gonna pass in the movies data set.

110
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:19.110
And we're going to say that I
want to know the min max rating.

111
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.870
So dot rating.

112
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.345
And we'll pass that in as the array and

113
00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:29.190
that will probably look something
like 3 to 9.8 or something like that.

114
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.750
This is purely a guess, but the min and

115
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.160
max rating is going to be an array
that looks something like that.

116
00:09:40.124 --> 00:09:44.029
And then I'm gonna say that
I want to map this to,

117
00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:49.710
because we're gonna be using
passing this into transform scale.

118
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:56.540
So right now, our petal paths are kind
of in the shape out of 100 pixels.

119
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:02.570
And so I probably want it
to be smaller than that.

120
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:09.145
So I'm going to scale it from
something 0.2 to maybe 0.75.

121
00:10:09.145 --> 00:10:13.080
And we can kind of like play
around with the scaling.

122
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.520
But for
now that's how I'm gonna do my scaling.

123
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.730
And then finally we're going to

124
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.500
go from the number of votes
to the number of petals.

125
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.980
And again, let's go and
get the min and max number of votes.

126
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:38.728
We're going to use D3 extent, and
this time we're going to say, seven votes.

127
00:10:38.728 --> 00:10:40.236
Yeah, I think it's votes.

128
00:10:40.236 --> 00:10:44.714
And because this one is from

129
00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:49.191
a continuous to discrete,

130
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:55.029
we're going to use a non petal scale

131
00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:59.895
is equal to dot scale quantize

132
00:10:59.895 --> 00:11:05.164
dot domain is min and max votes.

133
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:10.489
And this is something probably that's like
some few thousand to some like million or

134
00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:11.920
something like that.

135
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.347
And the range, I'm going to maybe

136
00:11:17.347 --> 00:11:24.120
do something between five to 10 petals.

137
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.880
So I might do something like this.

138
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.857
Alternatively, I like to just use
this low dash function that time.

139
00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:35.678
We gonna say 5 to 11 and so

140
00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:41.692
this will give me back an array
of between the numbers 5 and

141
00:11:41.692 --> 00:11:45.882
11 because it's not inclusive here.

142
00:11:45.882 --> 00:11:48.852
So this will give me
this exact array back.

143
00:11:48.852 --> 00:11:52.860
But just for the sake of this
exercise I want it to show that.

144
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.840
Okay, so let's call that scale,
and use the size scale.

145
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.227
And we're going to pass in the rating.

146
00:12:02.227 --> 00:12:09.637
And then, for the num petals,
we're going to do num petals scale,

147
00:12:09.637 --> 00:12:14.840
and we're going to pass
in the number of votes.

148
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.370
If we've done that correctly,
then yeah, there we go.

149
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.996
So now we have everything
scaled correctly.

150
00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:26.390
And we're not using the num petals yet.

151
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.120
We'll use that in the next notebook
when we're creating the whole flower.

152
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.932
And that's fine.

153
00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:34.940
We'll create the right number
of petals for each movie and

154
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.100
then rotate them around into a flower.

155
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.730
But as of right now, we have the path,
we have the color, and we have the scale.

156
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.890
And then we have the translation.

157
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.135
And so this is what it looks like.
