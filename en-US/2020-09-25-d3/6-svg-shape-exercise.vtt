00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.880
And so with this one,
I want us to create a flower petal,

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.815
or I want you to create a flower petal.

3
00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:13.896
So not together but individually,
create a flower petal of your own.

4
00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:20.285
And the tip I have, is try sketching
out your idea with pen and

5
00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:25.559
paper first,
just like how I did it with the iPad.

6
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.806
It was just kind of redrawing
out kind of the coordinate,

7
00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:34.582
little axes, and then labeling,
and then drawing out where you

8
00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:39.287
think each of those points should be,
and then labeling them.

9
00:00:39.287 --> 00:00:44.565
I find that that really helps me
kind of visualize the shape and

10
00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:48.536
then where each of the xy
positions should go.

11
00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:52.785
S o yeah,
try drawing your own flower petal, and

12
00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.877
then you can try putting them
into this petal path string.

13
00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:01.550
And this one is extremely important,

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.257
I'm hoping that we would
have someone volunteer

15
00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:10.865
their flower petal path
that we can put in here.

16
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:14.340
And that will actually propagate
through the rest of our notebooks.

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.089
So then when we draw our final flowers,
we'll be able to have your own kind

18
00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:25.769
of original, creative flower path in
the final film flowers we create.

19
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:30.821
I had done the smiley face
exercise a little bit incorrectly,

20
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:35.486
in that, when I was originally
creating this notebook,

21
00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:39.773
this transform is actually
very much intentional.

22
00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:43.766
So we're going to bring that back in and
sorry for the confusion.

23
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.898
Because what I want to do actually,

24
00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:53.971
is to have the 00 be the center
of this smiley face.

25
00:01:53.971 --> 00:02:00.339
So actually we want the x is equal to 0
coordinate to be right in the middle.

26
00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:04.683
And the reason for this,
is more for the petal,

27
00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:10.883
we want to make sure that the tip
of the petal is at the 00 position.

28
00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:16.471
Much like in this one,
for this for this pedal,

29
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.962
the 00 is actually right at the tip.

30
00:02:20.962 --> 00:02:23.274
And this isn't so important right now,

31
00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:27.286
but will become very important once
we start building out the flower,

32
00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:31.367
because this is the position in which
we'll rotate the flower petals.

33
00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:35.962
So very important that wherever
the kind of the center,

34
00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:41.159
where the center of the flower should be,
should be your 00.

35
00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.850
So yeah, so keeping with that,

36
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.634
let's kind of edit our smiley
frowny face a little bit and

37
00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:53.417
instead of what we had before,
which I believe was like,

38
00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:57.819
I think 2575, sorry, are 25, 25 here.

39
00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.242
Now I'm imagining kind of the x is equal
to 0 line to be kind of going through

40
00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:04.574
right at the center of the smiley face.

41
00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:08.752
So I have just edited
it to be this little i,

42
00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:13.163
I've edited to be the x is negative 25,
and

43
00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:16.543
draw a line down to negative 25.

44
00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:21.457
And then this line, instead of being,
originally it was 75,

45
00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:27.197
x is equal to 75 right here, and
I've edited that to be X is equal to 25.

46
00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:29.612
And then here I've done the same thing.

47
00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:35.463
So this used to be 15 and I've edited
that to be negative 35 to come over here.

48
00:03:35.463 --> 00:03:42.865
And then this used to be 0,
I've pulled it down to this -50.

49
00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:47.244
This used to be 85 and this also used
to be 85, so I just brought it to 35.

50
00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:52.455
And so, I just wanted to make that
correction because I knew there

51
00:03:52.455 --> 00:03:57.478
was a little bit of confusion
about the flower petal exercise,

52
00:03:57.478 --> 00:04:03.475
because I had translated it over by 50 and
that is very much intentional.

53
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:08.439
So when you are doing the petal pads,
please make sure to have the whatever

54
00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.604
the central point of the flower
petal that you want rotate by,

55
00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:15.104
please make sure that that's 00.

56
00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:19.881
And this is where 00 is at.

57
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:25.690
For this smiley face exercise, I put this
back to the translate (50, 0) back in.

58
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.179
I've edited the smiley face to
center around the x is equal

59
00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:32.933
to 0 to be at the center of the face.

60
00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:37.501
And then now we're going to do this
exercise, this flower petal exercise,
