00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.162
Let's look at some common visual channels.

2
00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:07.579
And so some common visual channels
are potentially position,

3
00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:09.650
so your x y position.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.491
And it could be size or dimensions, so

5
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:18.053
if you have a rectangles,
width and height,

6
00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:24.431
a circles radius or in our case,
our flower petals like scale.

7
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.062
And so that's also continuous.

8
00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:33.929
And we can have a color channel and
so that could either be sequential.

9
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:41.210
So kinda going from this
light to darker or diverging,

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.384
which means that we have
some central value and

11
00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:52.462
then it diverges going to both sides.

12
00:00:52.462 --> 00:00:56.810
And these visual channels
are also continuous.

13
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.462
And on the other hand, we have some
visual channels that are discrete.

14
00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:07.025
So we have these categorical

15
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:12.820
colors and we can potentially

16
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.700
have different shapes.

17
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.833
So for example, for
our flower petals, we have distinct,

18
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:27.057
different shapes for
each of our flower petals.

19
00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:31.863
And some other ones that we might
commonly use is maybe we'll map

20
00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:35.300
something dots or squares to letters.

21
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.698
So these are discrete visual channels.

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.104
And it's really helpful to think in kind
of this way of continuous or discrete and

23
00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:53.580
from mapping from data to visual
channels when we think about D3 scales.

24
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.954
So for D3 scales, and again,
this isn't the whole list of D3 scales but

25
00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:02.609
these are the ones that I
end up using quite often.

26
00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:08.984
And you can kind of break them down
into this mental model of a continuous

27
00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:14.520
input a continuous data type to
a continuous visual channel.

28
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.282
So that could be scaled linear,
scale log, scale square root, scale time.

29
00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:25.347
And these are mapping from
one continuous data type to,

30
00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:32.589
let's say something like, xy positions or
size a continuous visual channel.

31
00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:37.547
And then we have some scales
that helps you map from

32
00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:42.874
a continuous data type to
a discrete visual channel.

33
00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:48.155
And so, scale quantize is
what we'll use when we map

34
00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:53.568
from our number of IMDb votes
to our number of petals.

35
00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:58.944
Because number of IMDb
votes it could be anything

36
00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:06.429
from a few thousand votes to a million
votes or something like that.

37
00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.433
So it's a kind of a continuous and

38
00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:14.442
data type when we think about it.

39
00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:18.826
But then the number of pedals and
it's either we have five pedals or

40
00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.802
six pedals or seven pedals or
eight pedals and

41
00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:25.500
there isn't like 5.5 pedals or
anything like that.

42
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.906
So, and this scale quantize helps us kind

43
00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:36.164
of translate from that number of votes.

44
00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:40.548
And they will like kind of chunk
into these discrete chunks and

45
00:03:40.548 --> 00:03:44.019
then it will map it to
the number of petals for us.

46
00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.599
And then we have discrete to discrete,
which is a new scale ordinal.

47
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.531
And scale ordinal is really great for
when we're trying to

48
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:58.373
map discrete data type to,
let's say a discrete color.

49
00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:05.736
So this kind of categorical color scheme,
it's very helpful for that.

50
00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:10.019
And then finally we have going
from discrete to continuous, and

51
00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.535
we can use scale band.

52
00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:16.150
And that could be something we have
a bunch of bars that we're trying to draw.

53
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.617
So each bar might be this discrete
thing that we're trying to

54
00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:22.850
represent in the data.

55
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.368
And then maybe it's that we want
to calculate the x-position for

56
00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.082
each of those bars.

57
00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:34.173
And so the x-position is something
that's continuous, visual channel.

58
00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:38.776
And so that's the way that I kind
of think about D3 scales and

59
00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:40.680
when and how to use them.
