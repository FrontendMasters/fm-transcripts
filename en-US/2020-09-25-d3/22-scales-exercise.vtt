00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.305
Let's do an exercise to really
kind of get it ingrained in us,

2
00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.411
how to use these scales.

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:12.865
And what I want to do is,
to have us convert our raw movies

4
00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:20.544
data into the visual channels that we're
going to need to render our flowers.

5
00:00:20.544 --> 00:00:26.478
And the mapping is before PG
rating to the type of flower

6
00:00:26.478 --> 00:00:32.283
petal,number of IMDb votes
to the number of petals,

7
00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:37.452
and IMDb rating out of
10 to the size of petal.

8
00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:41.747
And the movie genre to
the color of petals.

9
00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:45.094
And here's again a reference for
the movies.

10
00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:50.190
And this time around,
it's a slight bit different from how we've

11
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.841
been doing it before, because we're
going to actually create an array.

12
00:00:55.841 --> 00:01:01.551
So it's gonna be an array
of objects that we're

13
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:06.416
going to then bind to our d3 selection.

14
00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:10.257
And the reason why I
like doing it this way,

15
00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:16.145
where I separate out my raw movies array,
from my flowers array.

16
00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:20.556
And my flowers array,
will have all of the visual channels,

17
00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:24.447
visual encodings that I need
to render to the DOM, and

18
00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:28.356
my movies array will have
all of my original raw data.

19
00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:33.406
And the reason why I like to kind of
separate out these two data arrays,

20
00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:35.546
or sorry, these two arrays,

21
00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:40.766
is because often times when I'm
creating visualizations, I might have

22
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:46.013
multiple different visualizations
that's based on the same data set.

23
00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:50.515
And so I've gotten kind of
in this habit of creating,

24
00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:55.919
of separating the kind of translated
visual channels for each,

25
00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:01.742
because there'll be different for
each different visualization.

26
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:07.422
And having that be kind
of like its own contained

27
00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:14.096
array that doesn't mutate
the original raw data just so

28
00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:19.918
that, one calculation for
one visualization,

29
00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:24.320
doesn't mess up any calculation for

30
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.449
another chart or visualization.

31
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.329
And so even when I'm only
doing one visualization,

32
00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.354
I've kinda gotten in that habit of
separating my array of raw data,

33
00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:43.366
from my array of visual channels, just as
like a kind of personal best practice.

34
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:47.776
So let's do that and,
what we're going to do, is for

35
00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:53.274
each of these four different things,
let's use the right scale.

36
00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:58.465
And set the domain and range on them.

37
00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:02.878
And then we'll return it here.

38
00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:08.255
And I think yeah, so I think,

39
00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:13.595
yeah, let's then kind of evaluate and
return,

40
00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:20.122
say the color and the path and
the scale and num petals here.

41
00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:27.448
And if we've done it correctly,
then it will all render in this cell.

42
00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:33.329
And so this again is very similar
to what we've done before.

43
00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.046
If you kind of want to look at
what it should look like, and what

44
00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:41.990
the flowers array should look like, and
this is what it should look like, but yeah
