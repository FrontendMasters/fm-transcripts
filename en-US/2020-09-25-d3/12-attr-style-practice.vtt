00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.519
Now that we have had a bit of
a chance to kind of dig around this.

2
00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:09.756
So, let's try and change some things
around together a little bit,

3
00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:14.734
just to kind of get a bit more
intuitive sense of what's going on.

4
00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:20.194
So the first thing is,
I want to show how with the code that we

5
00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:25.218
already have written,
we can pass in any data we want,

6
00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:28.625
and it will kind of just work in here.

7
00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:34.424
So, for example, let's just make like
an array, and i into this dot data.

8
00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:39.171
Let's make a new array and, let's just
like pass in a bunch of random numbers.

9
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:42.339
Let's say like 94 or 84,

10
00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.040
let me try like 120 and maybe just a 20.

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.901
And you can see now it's only
rendering kind of three of them,

12
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:56.775
because only three of the rectangles
have data bound on them.

13
00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:03.024
So only three of
the rectangles are showing up,

14
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:07.410
and let's try having some more.

15
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.053
And so I just wanted to kinda show
you with select D3 selection,

16
00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:20.205
and data, and attribute,
even just with this combination

17
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:25.631
we can write something
that's like quite dynamic.

18
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:33.158
And, let's maybe we'll play
around with like, actually,

19
00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:39.820
let's play around with the height a little
bit, so let's go back to our bar data.

20
00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:47.303
And maybe if we multiply it by something,

21
00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:52.557
the height changes around,
you might actually

22
00:01:52.557 --> 00:01:58.616
have noticed that our bars
are currently upside down.

23
00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:03.856
And that's because what I mentioned
earlier about the SVG coordinate

24
00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:08.938
system is that, 0 starts up here,
and then increases going down.

25
00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:15.236
So because right now we're
not setting the y position,

26
00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:20.998
and it's kind of defaulting
to 0 which is up here,

27
00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:25.830
and then it's just rendering the height.

28
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.968
Let's actually kind of
impromptu flip that around and

29
00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:37.117
see if we can have the bar chart be
rendering with it right side up.

30
00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:42.157
And so to do that,
what we want is to have,

31
00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.726
So if you think about it,

32
00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:51.751
it's that we want these
rectangles to kind of shift down.

33
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:57.259
And the amount that we want to
shift down by is essentially,

34
00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:03.442
the height of this container minus,
the height of our rectangle.

35
00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:07.537
For this one, we want to shift
down by this much, and for

36
00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:12.782
this rectangle, we want to shift
down by this much, so let's do that.

37
00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:18.416
So for our y position we're being like
passed in the bound data, and then let's

38
00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:24.488
just say, because we know we've hard coded
our height of our container to be 100.

39
00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:28.580
So we just say 100 minus the bound data,
there we go.

40
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.639
So we've turned the bar
chart the right side up,

41
00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.203
by adding this kind of little y attribute,

42
00:03:36.203 --> 00:03:41.948
we can also play around with the styling
of the bar chart a little bit.

43
00:03:41.948 --> 00:03:48.712
It's completely nonsensical, but maybe we
just want to like give a dashed stroke.

44
00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:52.792
And so I'm gonna just say,
I want it dashed 5 pixels,

45
00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:56.531
than empty 5 pixels, so
this is what that means.

46
00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:04.835
And so you'll see that
the stroke is dashed, like that.

47
00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:09.797
So this is how we can kind
of use the attributes and

48
00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:13.440
styles and data binding together.
