00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.716
Hopefully with this exercise,

2
00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:08.196
you now have enter update exit working for

3
00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:13.188
our film flowers using
the new way with join and

4
00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:16.526
let's code together on this.

5
00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:23.030
So, as we always have, we have our SVG.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.660
And we're going to first start out
with our parent group element.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:39.262
And we're going to say svg.selectAll
of our Group elements and

8
00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:45.760
we're going to bind
the data from our flowers.

9
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.440
And in this particular example,

10
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.329
and a filter flowers,
I'm sorry filtered flowers.

11
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.670
In this particular example,
we're going to use the title

12
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.400
as our key, in our key function,
and instead of ID.

13
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.970
We again, if we were making

14
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.460
a full on visualization project,
I highly recommend using a unique ID.

15
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.360
But for this example,
we have the title so,

16
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.130
and that I think will work well enough.

17
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.230
So let's use that as our key.

18
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.160
And and let's use join.

19
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.970
And because we have to create
some pads and texts within our

20
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.890
parent group element,
we're going to pass in some functions.

21
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.910
So the first one is a function and we're
going to receive our Enter selection.

22
00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.750
And so let's go ahead and
create our group element on that.

23
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.590
As you might remember, and actually,

24
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.909
then after we create the groups,
let's create the pet the paths and texts.

25
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.530
And so, again, we're going to do

26
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.330
selectAll paths in our
parent group element.

27
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.970
And then we're going to bind the data.

28
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.310
And this time around, we are passing in

29
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.420
a function and
to create our multiple petal paths so

30
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.890
that again, we're doing .times and

31
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.890
we want the number of petals.

32
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.131
And we're going to use and so

33
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:59.195
I think Bruno in the chat has

34
00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:04.143
suggested another way of copying

35
00:03:04.143 --> 00:03:08.928
over our data into a new object.

36
00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:11.360
And I hope I remember this correctly.

37
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.670
If not, we'll go back to
how we had done it before.

38
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.900
And that is we can first
put in our rotate.

39
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.560
And so that is the index times 360 degrees
divided by the total number of petals.

40
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.246
So we want to actually,
let's do this and it's close.

41
00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:44.622
Wait, no, that's correct.

42
00:03:44.622 --> 00:03:48.197
Return, rotate and

43
00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:52.402
we use the spreader D and

44
00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:58.080
that should hopefully get us and

45
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.344
the data object that we want.

46
00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:06.150
And then here, and for

47
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.038
this particular one I am these petals.

48
00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:16.277
These path elements, the are children
of our parent group elements.

49
00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:21.482
We can either passing IDs but
because we're not trying

50
00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:26.700
to do any like,
I'm difficult updating on them.

51
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.030
I'm not going to pass in a key function.

52
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.140
But if we were to pass in a key function,

53
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.670
we can indeed do it after
that first function.

54
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:48.863
So after we pass in the function
to create our data array,

55
00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:54.838
we can certainly pass in another function

56
00:04:54.838 --> 00:05:01.679
that maybe says like
maybe it's the rotation.

57
00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:04.102
Yeah, that's a bad example but

58
00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:08.947
and it's it really is that we don't
need it for our petal pads but

59
00:05:08.947 --> 00:05:14.958
if you find that you need to be able to
distinguish your children elements also,

60
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:20.730
then you can always pass in another key
function after this first function.

61
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.040
We're going to cojoin, so

62
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.370
that this part takes care of all
of the enter, update exit for us.

63
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.520
And then I'm we are going to

64
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.630
set the attributes on our
petals as we've done before.

65
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.384
And let's just quickly do that together.

66
00:05:47.384 --> 00:05:51.334
No, we want to rotate.

67
00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:54.071
So we use d.rotate and

68
00:05:54.071 --> 00:06:00.128
then we want to scale
these pedals also d.scale.

69
00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:07.432
Let's define attribute and
we're using d.path for that.

70
00:06:07.432 --> 00:06:12.067
And fill is our d.color.

71
00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:18.960
Stroke is also our d.color.

72
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.713
And fill capacity and

73
00:06:23.713 --> 00:06:30.842
fill capacity is just 0.5 and

74
00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:35.336
stroke width is 2.

75
00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:40.167
And once we have this part done
we should be able to see it

76
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:43.541
our flowers overlapping each other.

77
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:44.683
There we go right there.

78
00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:48.034
All of her flowers are just kind
of overlapped on each other,

79
00:06:48.034 --> 00:06:50.500
like on that 00 position.

80
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.830
That's okay because that means
our petals have been created and

81
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.720
let's create some text.

82
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.294
So let us do

83
00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:10.062
the g.append

84
00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:14.432
that text and

85
00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:18.802
let's see,

86
00:07:18.802 --> 00:07:25.566
.text, d.text.

87
00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:31.610
And just some notes of text anchor.

88
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.164
So center our text and

89
00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:41.486
vertically center our text and then,

90
00:07:44.783 --> 00:07:48.978
Set, The font size.

91
00:07:48.978 --> 00:07:50.882
So this is the same thing as before, so

92
00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:53.580
I really don't need to
be doing this right now.

93
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.296
Okay, so and now we should be
able to come back and see,

94
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.952
You're not seeing it and that's because
yes, I haven't set the text on it yet

95
00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:11.110
but and we have the text element
created for each of them.

96
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.140
And I want to put in a note here
that you might be noticing we

97
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.700
are doing the whole Enter,
Update, Exit pattern for

98
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:27.490
the paths within the parent
group elements, Enter selection.

99
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.044
We're also doing you know all of our
data dependent attributes setting within

100
00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.357
the Enter selection.

101
00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:38.581
And this is just because in this
particular example, we don't do any

102
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:44.087
updating on the petals within the flower,
the title within the flower.

103
00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:49.691
The only thing that changes
is kind of whether the group,

104
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:56.481
itself the flower, the whole movie
itself gets filtered out or not.

105
00:08:56.481 --> 00:09:01.661
And thus,
the all the pedals inside don't change and

106
00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:07.302
so that's why it doesn't matter
if we are doing all of this

107
00:09:07.302 --> 00:09:12.390
creation within the Enter selection for
the group.

108
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.103
If for example you have
a nested structure where your

109
00:09:17.103 --> 00:09:20.638
children the element we'll update and

110
00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:25.900
change when the data on your
parent element changes also.

111
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:31.018
So both of these needs to change,
then you would want to

112
00:09:31.018 --> 00:09:37.933
change some of these kind of updating
parts and on what the joint returns.

113
00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:44.353
So you want to chain all of
these kind of data setting and

114
00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:48.400
so you will want to take this out and

115
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.984
you want to say .selectAll
the pads on the Enter

116
00:09:53.984 --> 00:09:58.592
plus update selection together and and

117
00:09:58.592 --> 00:10:06.426
set all of the attributes the data
dependent attributes on there.

118
00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:12.578
But because and
we don't care about updating the children,

119
00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:17.402
it's perfectly okay for
us, in this example to

120
00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:21.987
do everything within
the Enter selection and

121
00:10:21.987 --> 00:10:27.194
that helps us keep the rest
of everything simpler.

122
00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:30.730
And for right now we don't actually need

123
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.416
to do anything on the Update selection for
the group.

124
00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:40.226
And we also don't need to do
anything on the Exit selection for

125
00:10:40.226 --> 00:10:46.425
the group because this .join will take
care of removing our excess selection,

126
00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:50.149
removing our extraneous
groups out of the DOM.

127
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:54.508
Again, I'm we don't have to worry
about all of the children elements and

128
00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:59.216
what happens to those because you know,
as soon as the parent group element gets

129
00:10:59.216 --> 00:11:02.331
removed those children
elements get removed also.

130
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:07.268
So, for this part one of the exercise
we don't have to worry about the Update

131
00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:09.516
selection or the Exit selection.

132
00:11:09.516 --> 00:11:14.940
Instead, what we'll finish up with
is we will chain on this .join,

133
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.630
which again gives us back
the Enter plus update selection.

134
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.975
We will chain our trends form.

135
00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:29.698
Hence form because then and every time
we filter down on these movies and

136
00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:34.275
then the positions of each of these
flowers can update accordingly.

137
00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:45.400
And so that will be d.translate.

138
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.393
And so, hopefully if we did
this part correctly, then,

139
00:11:55.005 --> 00:12:00.031
We did not, I did not, so
let's see what happened and

140
00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:06.646
I'm going to scroll back up really
quickly to see what's happening.

141
00:12:12.569 --> 00:12:14.932
Path, that is okay.

142
00:12:14.932 --> 00:12:19.254
So the otter is not being set,
that's right.

143
00:12:19.254 --> 00:12:21.049
Okay, so I know what happened.

144
00:12:21.049 --> 00:12:24.494
And what's happening right now is we

145
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:29.275
have to remember to return
that Enter selection and

146
00:12:29.275 --> 00:12:35.169
then once we've returned that
s selection of group elements,

147
00:12:35.169 --> 00:12:41.949
the newly created group elements,
then d3 knows in .join, to join and

148
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:47.194
merge that Enter selection
with our Update selection.

149
00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:50.423
So now, we should have it correctly.

150
00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:55.181
And actually this is also incorrect
because we want to get the title out of

151
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:59.480
our data and hopefully that will
have everything rendered cool.

152
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.992
So now we have everything rendered.

153
00:13:00.992 --> 00:13:05.609
And if we then go ahead and try to filter.

154
00:13:05.609 --> 00:13:11.467
Perfect, so
you see that all of the flowers

155
00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:15.862
are being entered and exited and

156
00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:20.439
updated to the right positions.

157
00:13:20.439 --> 00:13:24.580
And so let's take a moment
to kind of congratulate

158
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.249
ourselves to getting this far.

159
00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:30.205
This is I think, very exciting.

160
00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:32.549
[LAUGH] So let's take a moment.

161
00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:37.410
Let's play around a little bit and
enjoy the fruits of your labor.

162
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.735
And yeah, all right, that is bugging me.

163
00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:46.882
So I'm gonna truncate that title.

164
00:13:46.882 --> 00:13:50.080
So we're gonna do your truncate.

165
00:13:52.074 --> 00:13:56.175
We pass in the length to truncate
two choose or pass in 20.

166
00:13:57.981 --> 00:14:03.439
Awesome, so yeah, look at that.

167
00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:08.102
There's also a little bit
harder to tile up, but

168
00:14:08.102 --> 00:14:12.880
I think this is the fire-like
flower petal that VJ

169
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.994
provided us with, really, really cool.

170
00:14:21.513 --> 00:14:25.628
Yeah, wow,
