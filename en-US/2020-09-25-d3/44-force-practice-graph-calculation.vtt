00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.341
What I would like us to
do is position all of

2
00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:09.238
our film flowers by the genres
that they share and

3
00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:17.375
bonus points if we can make it work with
our filters at the same filters as before.

4
00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:26.065
And Just to show how the end
result should look like.

5
00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:32.175
I'm gonna give a slight disclaimer now
that I'm on a 2015 MacBook Pro and

6
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:35.748
it is not handling
the force calculation very

7
00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:40.179
well with everything else
that I'm putting out there.

8
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:47.382
No, so and it might look a bit janky but

9
00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:54.370
usually it should be much smoother.

10
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.299
And this is one of those
examples where there's so

11
00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.760
much animation going
on that definitely for

12
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.300
older devices it's gonna
look very laggy and janky.

13
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.074
And this is where I would recommend
that we move away from SVG and

14
00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:12.706
use Canvas instead.

15
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.200
But we don't have the time for that today.

16
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.120
So we'll just deal with this add
kinda slight bit janky animation

17
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.780
that's going on.

18
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.180
And if you're working on your own project,
and

19
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.430
this is about where I would consider
using Canvas, html5 Canvas.

20
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.844
So it is very slowly, patiently,
it started at some random positions,

21
00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:40.725
and it's trying to kind of like you
can see it playing nudging each

22
00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.947
other because I have some forces applied.

23
00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:47.221
That says that don't overlap each other.

24
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:51.030
But then I also have some links so
that they're attracting each other.

25
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.210
So it's like struggling to find
an optimal layout right now.

26
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.360
But what's happening is it's
already really cool to see

27
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.780
because the movies are positioned
by the genres they share.

28
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.340
You can actually start to see like
the genres that are closer to each other

29
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.022
like the sci fi action,
adventure, horror and fantasy.

30
00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:20.134
You can see like rom com is close
to each other and drama and crime.

31
00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:23.167
And so like even from that perspective,

32
00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:27.189
forced layouts are really fun and
really fun option.

33
00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:33.475
And I think what makes this potentially
even better is if we have the filter and

34
00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:38.793
we can be like I wanna see all of
the movies positioned like this but

35
00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:41.131
without the R rated movies.

36
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:44.860
And then it will start to reposition and

37
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.517
what if I only wanna see the GMP
g ones and then there we go.

38
00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:55.352
And whoa,
he is really going at it in there.

39
00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:59.580
And, and it's all of the GMP
g rated movies are comedy and

40
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.282
family and animation and
ventures and mystery and

41
00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:07.445
you can see that like it's
like Scooby Doo or Toy Story.

42
00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:14.550
So a lot of really great potential for
the force layout.

43
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.313
So I'm going to actually like, stop this.

44
00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:23.299
I'm gonna comment out
this cell because and

45
00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.329
I would suggest you do the same thing
because if we keep having it and

46
00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.745
run it,
it's just gonna bog our notebook down so

47
00:03:33.745 --> 00:03:39.688
much that we're not going to be
able to do our exercise together.

48
00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:44.217
So and before actually,
before I get started on this code,

49
00:03:44.217 --> 00:03:47.849
I wanna kind of show you
my graph calculations.

50
00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.659
So this is the function that I'm using to

51
00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.044
turn our movies data into the node and

52
00:03:57.044 --> 00:04:02.136
link set of arrays that
D3 force needs to do

53
00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:07.936
its calculations and so
I'm creating a nodes and

54
00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:13.194
links, arrays and then one genres object.

55
00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:18.476
And I'm going through and I'm pushing
the flowers into my nodes array.

56
00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:25.292
So here, some basically looping
through all of the filtered movies and

57
00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:30.859
I'm finding,
I'm finding the corresponding flower and

58
00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:35.417
I'm pushing the flowers
into the nodes array.

59
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:40.622
And then, for
each of the genres on that film,

60
00:04:40.622 --> 00:04:45.826
I'm going to loop through
all of the genres and

61
00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:49.962
I'm saying I go and find the genre and

62
00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:54.767
if it doesn't exist, then create it and,

63
00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:59.590
and and
set the genre on the genres object.

64
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.144
And finally create a new link where
the source is the genre object and

65
00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:07.690
the target is a flower object.

66
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.650
And I'm saying return the nodes array,

67
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.012
the links array and
their genres turned into an array also.

68
00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:20.486
And so
this is what we're seeing is a graph and

69
00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:24.816
it has all these different arrays.

70
00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:30.729
So we will use this graph
array to do our code.
