1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.840
So we have an exercise,
which is to kind of try and

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.940
get ourselves more familiarized
with these SVG paths.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.475
And so, I wanted to have us
create a smiley face together,

4
00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:20.370
[LAUGH]
so I'm going to actually bring up my

5
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.780
iPad so that you can see what I'm drawing.

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.886
And then, you can shell out

7
00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:38.555
the xy coordinates of what you think

8
00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:47.457
Needs to happen to draw a smiley face,
let me actually bring up my iPad.

9
00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:58.068
And it will, of course, to me and,

10
00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:08.147
And there we go, okay, so
let's do this together,

11
00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:12.515
so what kind of smiley
face should we draw?

12
00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:19.859
[LAUGH] Should we just draw a,
Pretty simple one like this or

13
00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.271
actually, I think what do
you guys think of this?

14
00:01:26.832 --> 00:01:32.265
[LAUGH] Give me like nods or like thumbs
ups, a smile for encouragement, thank you.

15
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:37.196
[LAUGH] And okay,
let's try drawing this one,

16
00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:41.115
[SOUND] if you wanna get really fancy,

17
00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:45.539
I wonder how you would draw a heart shape,

18
00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.753
if anyone figures out the SVG path for
these heart shapes.

19
00:01:51.753 --> 00:01:55.595
For the sake of this exercise,
let's just draw kind of this one.

20
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:01.559
So I'm not gonna draw
the circle around it, but

21
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:05.679
let's draw just the eyes and
the mouth together, okay.

22
00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:12.543
So I have it currently
in a coordinate system,

23
00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:17.472
100 pixels by 100 pixels,

24
00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:26.383
And so, let's say this is 50 pixels, so

25
00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:33.343
let's draw the first eye,
let's say this is also 50 pixels.

26
00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:40.473
So what does that eye look like,
let's shell it out,

27
00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:46.244
and so I think that means that
we might want to move to,

28
00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:49.727
what does this point look like?

29
00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:50.741
&gt;&gt; About 25?

30
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:54.221
&gt;&gt; Ooh, thank you, so x position at 25 and

31
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:58.008
then a y position,
what does that look like?

32
00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:01.532
&gt;&gt; 25 maybe also?

33
00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:06.523
&gt;&gt; 25 maybe also, okay,
and we're just gonna draw

34
00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:11.529
a straight line down to here,
so that is a line two.

35
00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:15.436
And so,
it should have the same x coordinate, but

36
00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:21.030
then what should we do for the y then
since we we said this is 25 by 25.

37
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.261
So, this one should be,

38
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:29.676
should we give it-
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

39
00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.054
&gt;&gt; What did you say?

40
00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:35.550
&gt;&gt; Five or ten,
depending on how far you wanna go.

41
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.323
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's make it go down by
10 pixels and let's call this 35.

42
00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:51.889
All right, let us put that in, 25 and

43
00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:58.035
if you're following along, and please
put it in the notebook yourself also.

44
00:03:58.035 --> 00:04:03.454
And I personally just think it's kind

45
00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:09.560
of fun just like seeing the notebook work.

46
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.395
[LAUGH] And 35, wait, okay, so

47
00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:19.486
that's because, hold on, Sorry, so

48
00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:24.569
if you saw that,
if you're following along in the notebook,

49
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.597
will you delete this line
that says transforms.

50
00:04:28.597 --> 00:04:34.779
So I don't think we need that,
so just delete that line and

51
00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:39.321
if you haven't touched the notebook yet,

52
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.870
I'm gonna publish that change.

53
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.362
So then just reload and
you'll be able to see it.

54
00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:52.723
And then, let us then draw,

55
00:04:55.082 --> 00:05:02.440
This other side so that one,
we shall have the same,

56
00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:10.896
Y coordinate, and actually,
this is very interesting

57
00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:16.276
because what we're going to do
next is in the same path string,

58
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:22.060
we're going to say, okay,
draw that line down, pick up the pen and

59
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.480
move it to this new place and
where our second eye is going to be.

60
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.810
So we're going to say move it to,
so if we want it to be,

61
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.370
I guess symmetrical,
we will want it at 75.

62
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.396
So we say move it to 75, 25,

63
00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:47.773
line two and then we just said 75, 35.

64
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.585
So, let's confirm that that

65
00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:58.932
looks as we wanted to, so

66
00:05:58.932 --> 00:06:03.900
we say move to 75, 25 and

67
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.977
then draw a line straight down to 75, 35.

68
00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:16.922
See what happens, and to execute the cell,
the shortcut is shift, enter, and

69
00:06:16.922 --> 00:06:18.770
then you can execute the cell.

70
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.548
And then, we have these two
cute little dots of eyes,

71
00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:27.680
[LAUGH] and so
it's working exactly as we were hoping to.

72
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.290
So now we just need to put
in that little smile, so

73
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.440
let's put in that smile together.

74
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.886
So for that smile,
we need to have a curve too, So

75
00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:43.807
again, we actually need to
pick up our pen again and

76
00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:47.130
then move it to this new position.

77
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:55.160
So let's do this, but first figure
out what that new position should be.

78
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.340
So, let's figure out the xy for that,

79
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.770
if you want to shout out some positions
for where you think this should be.

80
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.527
Can you see that,
let me use a different color, so

81
00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:11.481
let me know where you think
this position should be.

82
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.666
&gt;&gt; 75, 30, 75, 15?

83
00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:24.540
&gt;&gt; 75, wait, hold on 75,
15 actually I think,

84
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.930
do you mean x is 15 and y is 75?

85
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.900
&gt;&gt; Yes,
&gt;&gt; Cool, thank you, so you were saying 15,

86
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.000
you said 15, right, and 75?

87
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.480
Okay, so we'll have this be,
let me use a different color actually,

88
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.890
let me use the same colors
as I used in our examples.

89
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.359
So you said 15, 75 and

90
00:07:52.359 --> 00:07:57.721
then let's write out our curve two, and

91
00:07:57.721 --> 00:08:03.410
actually let us fill
in the very end first.

92
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.390
So let us do this one first,
so if we want that to be

93
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.491
perfectly symmetrical
because this one is 15,

94
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:18.471
75 that means, bear with me,
as I do really bad

95
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:23.100
math on the spot, 100 minus 15 is 85.

96
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.860
Please correct me on this,
[LAUGH] that sounds right, right?

97
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.020
So, we're going to end up by 85,
75 and then

98
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.895
let's draw some anchor points.

99
00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:49.680
So do we say just for
the sake of cuz I say, yeah, okay, so

100
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.850
let's draw some anchor points.

101
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:58.977
Let's draw one down here, and
then let's draw one down here,

102
00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:03.820
so I think that's about
where we need it for

103
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.740
the curve to go where it is, yeah.

104
00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:14.842
What do you think that looks?

105
00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:19.060
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Does that need to be

106
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.250
symmetrical between your curves or
does that matter?

107
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.843
&gt;&gt; It doesn't actually really matter,
I mean,

108
00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:28.577
it really depends on what
kind of smile you want.

109
00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:31.549
I guess right now, we're going for
a symmetrical smile, but

110
00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:34.830
if you want an asymmetrical smile,
that's fine, too.

111
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.461
That's perfectly fine,
we can do that, should we do that?

112
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.527
Okay, give me the coordinates for

113
00:09:41.527 --> 00:09:46.404
the blue that you want,
the blue anchor point, oops.

114
00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.220
Okay.
&gt;&gt; 20, 100.

115
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.487
&gt;&gt; 20, 100, thank you,
David, all right, and

116
00:10:02.487 --> 00:10:09.572
then our non-symmetric purple anchor,
coordinate control point.

117
00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:14.805
Where should we have that
since it's non-symmetric,

118
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:19.381
anyone that wants [LAUGH]
to volunteer the smile?

119
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:20.598
&gt;&gt; 85, 90.

120
00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:23.454
&gt;&gt; Cool, 85, 90, let's see what happens.

121
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:35.528
All right, let's enter this in and
see what happens.

122
00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:43.062
All right, so then we have M15,

123
00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:47.781
75, C20, 100, 85, 90,

124
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:51.962
85, 75, ooh, look at that.

125
00:10:51.962 --> 00:11:00.294
[APPLAUSE] That's our
asymmetric smiley face.

126
00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:05.202
[LAUGH] I

127
00:11:05.202 --> 00:11:09.263
think you look pleased, but some of you
are in shadows so I can't quite tell.

128
00:11:09.263 --> 00:11:14.084
[LAUGH] But yeah, there it is, yeah,
these are our three lines, and

129
00:11:14.084 --> 00:11:18.736
depending on where, well,
how we play around with the numbers,

130
00:11:18.736 --> 00:11:23.070
like if we do that,
then we get a little slanted smiley face.

131
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.300
Because we pulled the anchor point
all the way to all the way to

132
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.130
like the zero, so we basically placed
the anchor point at this corner.

133
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:39.000
And if we do the same thing
to the other anchor point and

134
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.070
if we pull it all the way to the other
100 corner and then we'll see this.

135
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.804
If we instead, you know what would be fun,

136
00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:53.486
is if we pull the anchor point up so

137
00:11:53.486 --> 00:11:57.826
instead of coming down to this corner,

138
00:11:57.826 --> 00:12:01.920
what if we pull this anchor point up.

139
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.899
So then let's try like a 40 or
something, And

140
00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:10.030
now we don't have a smiley face anymore,
we have a little squiggly.

141
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:16.730
So yeah, this is why I think the path,
SVG path, is so powerful,

142
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.850
and this is why I especially think that
the curve to the command is so powerful,

143
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:27.010
because you can probably imagine
if we like, and with the curve to,

144
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.570
we can draw and you kind of curve shape.

145
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.090
And then if you just start to
chain these commands together,

146
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.560
then you really can kind
of make any shape you want.

147
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.250
And if you were to, for example,
create a custom shape in

148
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.330
Illustrator and then export it,
then you can potentially.

149
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.400
Sometimes, they export it
a little bit weird but

150
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.440
you can potentially read through this
path string that they'll give you.

151
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.580
And then, you might be able to kind
of decipher what's going on and

152
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.390
that'd be really cool.
