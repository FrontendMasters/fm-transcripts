00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.582
Previously, we covered drawing a pedal for
each movie.

2
00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:12.390
And then we learned how to apply
deep rescales to map our raw data,

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.830
into our visual channels.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.347
And this is what we ended up with,
with all of these different pedals,

5
00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:26.906
with the right colours, at the size, with
the right shape, the right path shape.

6
00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:30.967
And at the end of the last lesson, and

7
00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:36.210
we also talked about scales for
SVG transform.

8
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.218
And how that also changes
a whole coordinate system,

9
00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:44.894
when you apply a scale.

10
00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:49.542
As well as an extremely
important note about,

11
00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:53.127
if you end up chaining transforms.

12
00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:56.276
So if you end up chaining translate and
scale,

13
00:00:56.276 --> 00:01:00.090
to be really careful about
the order in which you chain.

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.492
Because depending on which
one you prefer first,

15
00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:07.868
the coordinate system will
actually end up looking different.

16
00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:14.680
And I've had many bugs,
also because of this much confusion.

17
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.900
And the general rule of thumb that I've
learned through all of that confusion,

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.350
is to put the translate first and
the scale second.

19
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.110
And that usually leads to
the results that I'm looking for.

20
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.290
So next,
I want us to cover how to turn each of

21
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.337
those petals into flowers for each movie.

22
00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:42.780
So this is, I mean this is quite exciting.

23
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.090
So, let's do this.

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.930
And so
to do that to be able to turn each petal,

25
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.150
which is a path into flowers.

26
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.800
What we're going to have to do,

27
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.340
is to make our paths first
into this g element.

28
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.120
And the SVG g element stands for
group, and it

29
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.000
helps us group all of
the children elements together.

30
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.013
So that we can manipulate
its attributes all together.

31
00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:23.310
So if you're familiar with
Adobe Illustrator, this is if you put

32
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.495
all of your path and other shape elements
into a group in Adobe Illustrator.

33
00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:33.145
And move it around or
scale it or rotate it together.

34
00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:40.819
So with a flower,
the new kind of SVG elements that

35
00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.510
we need to create for
each flower looks like this.

36
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.370
So, it's got that group element and

37
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.960
we'll use that group element,
to move all of the children together.

38
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.070
To position in the right place for
the grid, or right place in the grid.

39
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.830
And we'll have a number of path elements,

40
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.710
and each of these path elements
will be drawing one of the petals.

41
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.520
And the number of petals for
each flower depends on the movies data.

42
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.670
It depends on the number of votes,
MDV votes for the movies and

43
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.820
that we calculated in
the previous lesson for scales.

44
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.982
And we calculated the number of petals for
each movie.

45
00:03:29.982 --> 00:03:34.956
And then finally, we want to
just add a text element where we

46
00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:37.949
can put in the title for each movie.

47
00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:48.230
And just a note that group elements,
g elements don't render anything.

48
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.449
And so yeah,
let's use D3 to build these flowers.

49
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.689
So this is what the first
part will look like.

50
00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.736
And so we want to very similar
to what we did with the paths,

51
00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:10.379
we want to select all of
the group elements in our SVG.

52
00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.736
And we are going to bind
our flowers dataset,

53
00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:20.596
the flowers data that we
calculated in the previous lesson.

54
00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:27.416
And we're going to bind that flowers
array, to our selection of group elements.

55
00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:31.478
We're going to enter and
append those group elements and

56
00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:36.738
what will happen is, we're going to
get 135 of these group elements.

57
00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:40.789
Because if you have 135 movies, and

58
00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.944
each of those g elements
will have the movie data,

59
00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:50.265
the individual movie data bound to them.

60
00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:54.427
And we'll just put that
selection of 135 group elements,

61
00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:58.278
into this variable that we'll call g,
for simplicity.

62
00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:08.021
And if we're to take a look at
what that D3 selection looks like,

63
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.840
it looks like this.

64
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.920
And so indeed we have an array
of 135 group elements.

65
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.489
And if we open it up, each of them has
the data, movie data that we bound to it.

66
00:05:28.388 --> 00:05:30.737
So the next step we want to take,

67
00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:35.830
is we want to create a text with
our title for each of these groups.

68
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.920
And so the line we want,
is we want to take that group that

69
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.910
D3 selection of groups,
the g, we say append text.

70
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.360
So create a text element for
each of those, and

71
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.860
set the text to the title, so
that's what's happening here.

72
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.540
And visually, this is what it looks
like for each of these groups.

73
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.440
And we've created a text element and
the important thing to note with D3 is,

74
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.620
whatever data that was bound
on the parent element.

75
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.870
When you create a child element
within that, the child element

76
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.580
inherits that exact same data
that's been bound on the parent.

77
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.620
So this is what's happening here.

78
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.220
And the text element inherits
the movie data for that group.

79
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.670
And because of that, we can In this case,

80
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.730
with this group,
the data says that the title is minions.

81
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.120
And that's why we can say,
get the title from the bound data and

82
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.100
then we'll render minions,
or a rule render inception.

83
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.030
And so that's how kind of that data
binding, an inheritance is working.

84
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.010
So if we want to take a look
at what the D3 selection

85
00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.320
looks like for the text elements,
this is what it looks like.

86
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.780
So interesting which is in news that
the parents are estimating, sorry.

87
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.190
It has the array of SVG text elements,

88
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.220
with the same data as the parent
group elements bound to them
