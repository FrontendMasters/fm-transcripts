00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.309
So we're going to take that simple bar
chart that we've been working on, and

2
00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.421
we're going to have it animate.

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:12.423
And when we animate on
update what we want is, for

4
00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:17.547
all of the bars that we've
created to animate up,

5
00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:23.037
so what's gonna happen is
we're going to use the y and

6
00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:29.625
height attributes so that it will
look like the bars are rising.

7
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.663
And then then for the updating bars,

8
00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:37.961
the bars that have remained in the DOM,

9
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:43.311
we're going to animate
to their new positions.

10
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:46.798
So this is we're going to be updating x,
and

11
00:00:46.798 --> 00:00:50.852
this is kind of what I
mentioned earlier about how,

12
00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:55.473
with the animations,
we're going to see the shuffling of

13
00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:59.931
those bars from the old data
array to the new data array.

14
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.815
So for the updating bars,
we're going to animate

15
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:09.360
to their new positions,
with the x position.

16
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.642
And finally for
any bars that are exiting and

17
00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:17.085
are going to be removed,
we should animate them back down.

18
00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:21.633
And so
again we're going to be setting the y and

19
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:25.840
height attributes, to make that happen.

20
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.910
So we're going to put our cone right here.

21
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.760
And everything outside it is kind
of just set up to have this but

22
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.546
the important thing to know is that
we've actually put our update code and

23
00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:47.398
also our animation code in this
function called update bars,

24
00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:51.448
that gets called every time
the button is clicked.

25
00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:57.442
And this is how we might if we're
working in like a index HTML file,

26
00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:03.438
or if we're building something
out in our local dev environment,

27
00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:07.721
this is how we'll most
likely do the updating,

28
00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:14.384
where we put our update code into
a function, and we call it from outside.

29
00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:17.820
And the end result should
look something like this.

30
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.699
And so,
if you notice this bar just animated from

31
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.102
over here to over here,
because in state a,

32
00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:32.338
it was probably second or
third index in the array and

33
00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:38.050
now that looks like it's
the sixth element in the array.

34
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.239
And so if you keep doing that,
This is what,

35
00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:50.265
What our end result should look like.

36
00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:59.694
And another note is when
you're doing the code,

37
00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:04.393
try doing the update code
with the new way with .join.

38
00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:12.298
And the hint is that because we're going
to have to animate specific enter and

39
00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:17.283
exit selections,
that we want to use dot join and

40
00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:24.480
kind of pass in those three functions,
to get the effect that we want.
