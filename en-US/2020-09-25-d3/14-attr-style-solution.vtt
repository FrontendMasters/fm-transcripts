00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.043
I hoped that exercise when pretty okay,
and so

2
00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:09.149
now let's do the exercise together.

3
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.837
So, first thing we want to do
is we want to go ahead and

4
00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:18.860
use D3 to select all of these paths,
so let's do that.

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.364
Actually out of habit let's
first select our SVG element,

6
00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:32.517
then let's go ahead and
select our SVG element,

7
00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:38.369
then out of the SVG,
let's pass in a string for

8
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:43.939
selecting all of our
paths within that SVG.

9
00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:50.694
And, then let's bind our movies data,

10
00:00:50.694 --> 00:00:55.272
so this is our movies data.

11
00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:59.701
So let's go ahead and
bind our movies data, and

12
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:04.804
actually, let's take a look
at what this looks like.

13
00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's console log this really quickly, and
let's take a look at what that looks like.

14
00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:17.013
So this is what we have,
and as of right now for

15
00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:21.565
just right now we are only
concerned about this _groups.

16
00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:23.700
If we open this, ooh did you see that?

17
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.767
It's kind of interesting, isn't it?

18
00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:30.016
So it's saying, that we have 135 movies,

19
00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:33.111
and we have five paths, and

20
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:38.103
there's an empty 130, empty x 130.

21
00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:43.590
So, in the next notebook,
we'll kind of talk about what this means,

22
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.426
but for right now,
let's just take a look at these paths, and

23
00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:52.624
then if we click on this,
we can see this is our paths.

24
00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:58.518
And, let's take a look
at what's been bound.

25
00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:03.977
And so yeah, so we have our first movie
and then if we open up the second

26
00:02:03.977 --> 00:02:10.019
one at the very bottom we have our
second movie, which is Independence Day.

27
00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.960
And we can see right
here that we have genres.

28
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.862
And so
that's what we need to do the fill, so

29
00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:23.027
let's go and say fill,
and let's go and say,

30
00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:27.666
passing a function and that function will

31
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:32.722
take in as input the data
that's been bound.

32
00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:39.303
And let's say that we are going to
use that look up the colors look up,

33
00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:46.245
and let's say I want to look up just
the first genre, and fill with that.

34
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:55.411
Awesome, and I'm going to put in as,

35
00:02:55.411 --> 00:03:00.098
if we can't find the genre and

36
00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:04.973
the colors, then we're going

37
00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:09.297
to use the color for other.

38
00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:14.533
And so that's our fill, and just for fun,

39
00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:19.492
let's do the same thing for the stroke.

40
00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:25.147
So let's just do the first genre
look it up in the colors object,

41
00:03:25.147 --> 00:03:29.355
and if that doesn't exist
use the other color.

42
00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:32.769
And you can probably
noticed that our stroke did

43
00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.851
nothing because they're the same color.

44
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:40.105
So let's use this attribute
called fill-opacity, and

45
00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:43.211
let's put the fill-opacity at 0.5.

46
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:48.599
And then we'll see we have this,
which is our petals have

47
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.446
a kind of faded fill and
then we have the stroke on the outside.

48
00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:59.083
Let's just make our stroke
a little bit bigger,

49
00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:02.482
stroke-width is 2, there we go.

50
00:04:02.482 --> 00:04:07.561
And so this is how you can use
D3 selections, data binding, and

51
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:13.221
attributes, to kind of draw the shapes
that you want into the browser.
