00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.265
And for this exercise,
what we're going to be

2
00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:12.687
doing is we want to create
a flower petal for each movie.

3
00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:17.114
And then we want to,
let's just same thing as before,

4
00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.657
we're gonna color the petals
by the first movie genre.

5
00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:26.100
And but we're also going to select the
type of flower petal based on the parental

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.660
guidance reading.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.122
And so this is where and
we have our movies here.

8
00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:36.320
And then we have our path object here.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.047
So this is kind of our lookup
from the parental guidance

10
00:00:41.047 --> 00:00:45.773
reading to our paths, strings and
then we have the same

11
00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:50.730
color object with the mapping
from our genres to colors.

12
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.770
And we want to be able to translate

13
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.162
are petals, by a certain xy,

14
00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:09.100
so that we can put them in this grid.

15
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.370
And I've kind of outsourced
that calculation for you and

16
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.300
you can just pass in the index to this
function called calculate positions.

17
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.876
And that will return an array of xy.

18
00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.012
And you want to set the fill.

19
00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:27.612
And you want to set the define attribute.

20
00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:33.150
And so let's have your code be in here.

21
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.700
And this is what your end
result should look like.

22
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.365
Who that looks really cool, doesn't it?

23
00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:45.014
And with the kinda fire flower
petal looks really cool.

24
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:50.575
And then let's come back and we'll do once

25
00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:57.217
you have had a chance to
kinda put your code in here,

26
00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:03.418
we will come back and
do the exercise together.
