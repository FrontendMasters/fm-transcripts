00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome to building a full-stack
AI-powered app with Next.js.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm your instructor, Scott Moss.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.856
A little bit about me, I've been
an engineer for over a decade now,

4
00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:14.970
working on all different types
of technologies and projects.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.214
My last stint as an engineer was
at a company called Netflix,

6
00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:19.867
you might have heard about it,

7
00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:24.340
where I worked on all different types of
things there, pretty interesting stuff.

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.820
And I say that because I no longer
am a professional engineer.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.510
I don't write code for a living anymore.

10
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.342
I'm actually an investor now, where I
actually invest in some of the exciting

11
00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.790
technology companies that
are coming out today.

12
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.740
So I spend a lot of my time doing that.

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.167
But it has enabled me to write code for
fun now,

14
00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.667
which is actually just
been more enlightning.

15
00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.571
And I feel like it's gotten me past
this plateau which I thought I was at,

16
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.010
because I only get to
work on exciting stuff.

17
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.230
So I don't have to worry
about scaling issues.

18
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.760
I just get to work on cool stuff that
comes out every day, so to me that's fun.

19
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.024
And yeah, in this course, I wanted to just
give a little insight into the window

20
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:08.800
of how I build full-stack applications
using some of my favorite technologies.

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.080
I have a lot of opinions
on how to do things.

22
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.140
If you've ever taken any of my courses,
you know that I can be very random,

23
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.402
but also at the same time have some type
of path that I'm moving towards, too.

24
00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:23.622
So yeah, I thought it'd be really cool for
us just to build something together and

25
00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:27.843
collaborate that way, and just have that
moment where we learn from each other and

26
00:01:27.843 --> 00:01:29.790
build something cool.

27
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.057
So this course, if you've taken any of
the intro courses, those courses are,

28
00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:37.433
obviously, just a little slower
intentionally to just get you

29
00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:41.192
the foundational skills that you
need to know, and there's notes and

30
00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:42.870
stuff associated with it.

31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.707
This course you're just gonna be following
along with me as we build something and

32
00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:50.266
we'll just be referencing Docs as we go
because those are the best notes when

33
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.954
you're building something, so.

34
00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:54.520
But I'll take my time,
I won't move too fast.

35
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.658
If there's commands that you all need,
I'll take my time,

36
00:01:57.658 --> 00:01:59.770
you can look at those commands.

37
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.489
And then also for your reference,

38
00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.470
I already pushed up the finished app code
to my GitHub in which you can check out.

39
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.603
Here's my URL, so my URL, my GitHub
handle is Hendrixer, named after my son,

40
00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:10.850
his name is Hendricks.

41
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.460
And yeah, it's just fullstack-ai-nextjs,
you can check it out.

42
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.360
The complete app is there.

43
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.210
So as you're following along,
please reference this for

44
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.640
any of the code that we'll be writing.

45
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.986
I will probably be referencing
it as I move along, just so

46
00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:27.440
I can stay consistent with what's here.

47
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.047
So I'm not teaching you something
completely different than what I already

48
00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:34.198
pushed up, because as you know,
I don't remember a lot of stuff,

49
00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:35.450
I just do it again.

50
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.195
So sometimes it's slightly different, but
I will be referencing this as well, so

51
00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:41.020
you should also do that if you feel lost.

52
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.020
But it's gonna be fun.

53
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.640
We're just gonna move.

54
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.047
You can think of this as like
a pair programming exercise.

55
00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:49.890
We're all just gonna pair program
together and it's gonna be cool,

56
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.558
I'm really pumped about it.

57
00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:52.802
Any questions so far?

58
00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:55.855
Okay, well let me give you the demo of
the app that we're gonna be making so

59
00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:59.057
you kind of know what we're aiming for,
and then we'll just jump right in and

60
00:02:59.057 --> 00:02:59.714
try to make it.

61
00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:06.680
So the app we're going to be making
is a journal app called mood.

62
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.860
And mood is basically, it's an app where
you can write your journal entries.

63
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.624
And then using AI,
what it'll do is it will basically try

64
00:03:15.624 --> 00:03:20.289
to determine what the mood of
your journal entry is, and

65
00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:25.451
try to give you a sentiment
analysis on what you were feeling,

66
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:29.250
what you were saying,
how you felt that day.

67
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.090
Was it negative?

68
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.050
Was it positive?

69
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.150
It'll try to do all of that.

70
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.410
And we're gonna leverage
AI to make that happen.

71
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.301
And that way, you kinda have all
these journal entries where you can

72
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.710
kinda go back and say,
how did I feel last week?

73
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.150
Or what was my day like yesterday?

74
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.790
Or what was my month like?

75
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.880
Was I in a bad mood this month?

76
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.060
And it's quite powerful.

77
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.260
So if you asking yourself, I don't
know how to do anything AI related,

78
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.370
that's fine.

79
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.990
You don't need to know anything about AI.

80
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.750
Everything you need to know we're
gonna cover in this course.

81
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.892
But if you know how to use an API, then
you already know everything you need to

82
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:04.411
know [LAUGH] cuz that's all we're
gonna be doing is using an API.

83
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:08.726
But we will dive deep into that a little
more, there's a lot there to unpack, but

84
00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:10.890
yeah, you're gonna be building that.

85
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.900
So basically here it is,
here's your landing page.

86
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.840
It's got award-winning copy on it.

87
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.420
And then you click Get Started,
and you can sign in.

88
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.830
So I can sign in with Google here.

89
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.752
Once you sign in,

90
00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:25.880
you are introduced to this dashboard here
where you have some journal entries.

91
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.147
It looks like I already have an entry
that I made, so If I click on this entry,

92
00:04:30.147 --> 00:04:31.830
you can see a few things here.

93
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.470
So you get this text editor here
where you can write some entries.

94
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.481
So this one, actually,
I had ChatGPT generate this entry, so

95
00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:40.012
I made it intentional.

96
00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.578
[LAUGH] I asked, I was like,

97
00:04:41.578 --> 00:04:45.520
can you write an entry of someone
who had a really down bad day?

98
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.371
And that's what it wrote [LAUGH], so
if you're reading this like, wow,

99
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:51.890
Scott, are you okay?

100
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.440
No, I didn't write this.

101
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.940
ChatGPT did, okay?

102
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.164
But as you can see, the analysis that
we got back from this post was that it

103
00:05:00.164 --> 00:05:05.028
determined the subject, so the subject was
a series of unfortunate events [LAUGH].

104
00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:06.680
That's the actual subject.

105
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.660
&gt;&gt; Lemony Snicket?

106
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.282
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Lemony Snicket is
the series of unfortunate events.

107
00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:13.669
You know what, now that I'm seeing
all the letters capitalized,

108
00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.130
I think it thinks it is that.

109
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.056
That's kind of crazy, cuz why else would
it capitalize the letters like that,

110
00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:19.290
like it's a title or something?

111
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.530
That actually makes sense.

112
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.240
And then the mood is defeated.

113
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.420
So it's, [LAUGH] the person who
wrote this is in a defeated mood.

114
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.410
And then, is it negative?

115
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.050
Yes, it is negative, it's true.

116
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.570
And then also, it generates
this color based off the mood.

117
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.050
So if your mood is brighter,
this color will change.

118
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.590
So I'll just give you an example.

119
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.410
I'm just gonna go ahead and
get rid of this and be like,

120
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.000
today was the best day ever, right?

121
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.810
And then what it'll do is it'll auto-save.

122
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.910
Actually, I think it's gonna break,

123
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.798
because I didn't start at the database
actually, let me do that.

124
00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.210
So it'll auto-save, no, I did, never mind.

125
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.529
There we go.
So it autosaves, and

126
00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.430
you can see the color change to green
based off you're in a happier mood.

127
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.492
And now the subject is the best day ever,
and the mood is happy, and

128
00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:02.090
it is no longer negative, right?

129
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.045
So we're gonna build all that, so then you
can go back and track all your journal

130
00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:10.080
entries and kind of just see how your
mood was, as long as you like to journal.

131
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.293
And then the other thing that you'll
be making is this history right here,

132
00:06:13.293 --> 00:06:14.170
this history plot.

133
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.664
So this is basically,
we're gonna be using AI to determine your

134
00:06:18.664 --> 00:06:22.328
sentiment of all the journal
entries that you have,

135
00:06:22.328 --> 00:06:27.090
and we're gonna score them based
off on a scale from -10 to 10.

136
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.740
-10 being you're just so
down bad, 10 being you are so

137
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.830
happy you're probably flying and
then 0 being neutral.

138
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.520
So we're gonna plot those journals so you
can see how your mood changes over time.

139
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.860
So you can see this is the first
entry you wrote, it was terrible.

140
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.610
The next entry you wrote
was very positive.

141
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.155
And then you kind of neutraled
out on the next one,

142
00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:50.100
a little more content on the next one.

143
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.290
And then the last one we just wrote was
terrible, this is when our cat left us.

144
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.620
So we'll be doing that, and
then you get an average sentiment up here.

145
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.399
So on average, all the journal
entries that I've written is a 0.1, so

146
00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.700
it's slightly above neutral.

147
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.270
So I'm just a very neutral
person right here.

148
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.940
So 10 being excited,
anything negative is pretty bad.

149
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.505
That's the second AI
thing we'll be making,

150
00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:16.540
we'll also be making another
one here in the journal.

151
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.496
So we want to be able to ask questions
about our journal entries just to

152
00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:22.954
get some feedback.

153
00:07:22.954 --> 00:07:26.885
So you can ask a question and
you will be able to, yeah,

154
00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:29.720
get some feedback on any of this stuff.

155
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.139
So I can ask like, how has my

156
00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:41.511
mood been in the last week or so?

157
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:43.410
And I can ask this question here.

158
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.500
It'll load, and
what it's doing in the background,

159
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.321
it's trying to grab all
the necessary context and

160
00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:53.980
match it with the question that I have and
then come up with an appropriate answer.

161
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.260
So it always says something silly, so
I'm curious to see what it says this time.

162
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.198
Okay, so based on that context,

163
00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:05.255
today was terrible due to finding
out about your cat's infidelity.

164
00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:08.713
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It can be [LAUGH] inferred that your

165
00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:11.784
mood has likely been negatively
impacted in the last week or so

166
00:08:11.784 --> 00:08:13.570
with a particularly bad day today.

167
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.828
However, the previous
inference about a positive and

168
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:18.280
upbeat mood before yesterday still stands.

169
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.820
So you can ask pretty much whatever
question you want about any of

170
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.440
your entries.

171
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.726
So we'll be making all of that today and
then we'll get to testing and

172
00:08:24.726 --> 00:08:25.640
then deployment.
