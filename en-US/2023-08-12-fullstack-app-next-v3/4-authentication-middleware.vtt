WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.443
And then the last thing we wanna do is
just make sure we in like right now we

2
00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:04.420
have off ready to go.

3
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.881
But like we're not forcing
anybody to authenticate and

4
00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.460
we're not protecting any routes.

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.200
So let's do that.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.140
Let's protect some routes and
force people sign up.

7
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.190
So we will do that.

8
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.220
So the best way to do that is there's
actually a lot of ways to do it.

9
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.800
The best way in my opinion is
just to use the middleware.

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.695
So if you don't know what middleware is,

11
00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:27.180
it's basically just
a function that you can use.

12
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.648
It's a function that you can run on
the edge in front of your deployment in

13
00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:36.591
Next.js that will basically protect
any of the routes that you have and

14
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.000
run some type of check.

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.100
In this case, we can check to
see if someone is authenticated.

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.950
So it's just a function that runs
before any route is navigated to.

17
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.005
So in order to do that we need
to go to the root of our repo,

18
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.630
make a new file call it middleware.ts.

19
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.830
It's not a React file so this is the TS.

20
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.020
The name has to be called middleware, and
it has to be on the root of your file.

21
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
That's a convention,
that is not my opinion.

22
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.160
It has to be called middleware, and
it has to be the root on your repo.

23
00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:12.699
All right, and then what we're gonna do,
we have this really

24
00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:16.970
cool chart here that does some advanced
stuff, we're not gonna talk about that.

25
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.950
What we're really gonna do is just take
this authmiddleware that they have.

26
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.600
And we're just going to export that.

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.910
So let's do that.

28
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.210
So import the off.

29
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.020
Actually I'm just gonna type it out and
it should bring it in for me.

30
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.900
There we go.

31
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.408
Import off middleware from clerk
next js there was going to export.

32
00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:39.742
The default off middleware,

33
00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:45.630
it's a function where you can pass in
different types of configurations.

34
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.669
I think what we wanna pass
in is going to be like

35
00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:55.190
public routes which should be an array.

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.740
There we go.

37
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.690
These are routes that we don't want.

38
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.500
We don't want to lock down, right?

39
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.220
Because if we lock down our homepage,
no one can ever see our website.

40
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.520
So in this case,
we wanna make a public route for slash.

41
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.770
So everything else is
going to be protected.

42
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.158
But that's the only route we
wanna protect is that one, or

43
00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:14.070
that we don't wanna
protect is the homepage.

44
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.820
So we'll do that.

45
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.622
Then the next thing is,
it's just this regex right here.

46
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.810
I'm gonna copy this and put it in there.

47
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.991
And basically what this is saying,

48
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:33.950
so there's two ways to configure what
routes you want this middleware to run.

49
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.561
So you can prevent
the middleware from running,

50
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:40.070
you can prevent this because off
middleware returns a function.

51
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.430
So we can prevent this
function from running.

52
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.060
By putting a matcher here to determine
what we want this to run on or

53
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.510
what we don't want this to run on.

54
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.416
Or we can just skip this and we can just
write some code in here ourselves and

55
00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.690
the middle will run on every single route.

56
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.230
But then we can write our own checks
to be like if request dot URL is this,

57
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.850
don't do anything if request dot
URL is this, then do something.

58
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.260
So many ways to do the same thing
programmatically or, this way.

59
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.530
I think it's better to do it this way
because you don't have to worry about any

60
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.710
logic inside of this function up here.

61
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.710
You don't have to worry
about any if statements.

62
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.688
And, cuz, like, if you're doing
expensive things in this middleware,

63
00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:23.290
like making API calls,
making database calls.

64
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.387
You have to put that underneath your
checks it just gets really sloppy so

65
00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:32.120
this just like this prevents dysfunctional
even running unless it matches here.

66
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.192
&gt;&gt; So basically we're saying is this
is just a regex that says pretty much

67
00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:38.962
everything the homepage and
then like the API.

68
00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:42.343
This TRPC thing is just like
some hipster version of RPC and

69
00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:44.760
TypeScript that people are using today.

70
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.470
I'm sure someone's going to teach it or
use it soon.

71
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.020
It's pretty cool, but we're not using it.

72
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.010
Yeah, it's pretty much
just matching everything.

73
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.220
Okay, so we got all that set up.

74
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.300
From there,
we should mostly be good to go.

75
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.720
I think the only thing that we wanna do
next is probably set up some, here we go.

76
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.600
We mostly just wanna set up
these environment variables.

77
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.409
These environment variables are gonna
tell our sign in and sign up.

78
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.420
Where to go after they sign in and
sign up, basically.

79
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.090
So hey, I just signed a user up,
where do I go?

80
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.180
I just signed a user in,
where do I route them to?

81
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.360
So we're gonna copy that.

82
00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:36.584
And I'm gonna head over to our env.local.

83
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.303
And I'm going to paste those in there.

84
00:04:42.794 --> 00:04:45.740
So the reason these have
a prefix of next public.

85
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.357
Anybody know?

86
00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:49.678
Anybody ever used Next.js know why
those have a prefix of next public?

87
00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:51.808
And these other ones and
this one up here doesn't.

88
00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:58.613
So any environment variable
you put your prefix with next

89
00:04:58.613 --> 00:05:00.798
public is available to
you on the front end.

90
00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:03.660
If you don't put next public,
you can't access it on a front end,

91
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.700
you can only access it on a server.

92
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.300
So the secret key is a secret key.

93
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.020
We don't want this on a front end,
so it can't be.

94
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.090
But anywhere next public,
you can do it on a front end.

95
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.926
So the sign-in URL is sign-in.

96
00:05:14.926 --> 00:05:16.720
The sign-up URL is sign-up.

97
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.849
After someone signs in,
we want to send them to slash journal.

98
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.417
But after someone signs up, we actually
wanna send them to this new user thing,

99
00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:31.160
this new user route that we, made the made
the second fork, we didn't make the route.

100
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.980
We didn't make the page yet.

101
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.610
And we'll talk about why we
need to do that in a minute.

102
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.380
Something to do with async behavior and
a race condition.

103
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.190
These are optional too.

104
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.423
You don't have to provide these you can
just pass them props to the sign in

105
00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:47.930
component and a sign up component,
and it should do the same thing.

106
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.435
But I had like a bug when I was working on
this curriculum where I forgot to change

107
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.630
this to new user.

108
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.860
It was it was on something else.

109
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.875
But I passed the prop into
the sign up component to say, hey,

110
00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.680
go to New User after sign up,
and it would never go.

111
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.070
And I just could not figure it out.

112
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.990
Like I was literally in
the source code of this SDK.

113
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.500
Like why is this not working?

114
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.266
And it was because this environment
variable takes precedent over a prop, and

115
00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:13.520
it was something else, and
I just never thought to check it.

116
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.660
So, I was like, well, I'm just not
even gonna use the props anymore.

117
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.950
I'm just going to use
the environment variable.

118
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.170
So, that's why these are here.

119
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.581
So, the last thing we're gonna
do before we test this out,

120
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.080
because if someone signs up right now,
it's just going to navigate them.

121
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.120
It's gonna break because we don't
have a page for a new user.

122
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.888
So let's just go make a page for
a new user right quick.

123
00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:34.800
We'll say page.tsx.

124
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.530
We won't worry about putting
anything in here right now.

125
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.803
Let's just get it to work so
we could actually test our

126
00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:45.060
auth to see what might be broken,
so we can debug if we need to.

127
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.679
Hopefully, we don't.

128
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.443
Since I've spent so
much time hyping up clerk, and

129
00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:54.177
I'll just return a div that says hi.

130
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:03.680
Cool.

131
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.090
All right, let's give it a try.

132
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.835
You may want to stop and start again just
to have those environment variables be

133
00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:14.398
reinitialized, although I
don't think we need to.

134
00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:18.327
I've just run into so many issues
where I had to reset like if I were

135
00:07:18.327 --> 00:07:20.834
just restarted to fix some of the things.

136
00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:24.099
I just, every time I changed
the config file the next config.

137
00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:28.344
Every time I change a database schema,
every time I change an environment

138
00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:32.740
variable, I just restart cuz it just
eliminates a lot of potential issues.

139
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:42.000
Now, if I go back to our app,
I try to reload here.

140
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.750
It's initializing and
the expected behavior happened.

141
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.765
We didn't get forced to a sign-up page
because we said this was a public route,

142
00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:49.360
so that's great.

143
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.450
But now if I try to go to slash journal,
let's see what happens.

144
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.960
We immediately get redirected to sign in.

145
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.570
I don't have an account, so
I'm not going to sign in.

146
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.079
Instead, at the bottom,
I'm just gonna click sign up.

147
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.310
Redirects me to the sign up page here and

148
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:13.208
what you can do your email your password
or whatever or just continue with Google,

149
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:17.396
I'm just gonna continue with Google,
gonna click that,

150
00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:23.120
and- Looks like it navigating
me to journal, which is fine.

151
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.260
We'll look at that in a minute, but
that's not what we wanna look at.

152
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.924
What we wanna look at instead is if you
go back to our clerk dashboard, it should

153
00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:32.440
have went away from getting started and
it should have showed you this now.

154
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.590
Hey, what's some confetti?

155
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.865
And then you can see that there is
a user now that is you if you sign up,

156
00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:41.620
so there you are, you're signed in,
you're ready to go.

157
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.278
I expected that to navigate to new user,
but for

158
00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:47.130
some reason it went to slash journal.

159
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.100
Why did it do that?

160
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.840
Let's figure that out.

161
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.460
So I'm just gonna look for
a slash journal.

162
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.230
In here,
I don't have it anywhere other than, here.

163
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.000
So I don't know why it, I don't know
how we even knew what that was.

164
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.270
Because I didn't tell it anywhere.

165
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.230
So let's see if we can override
this with some of the props.

166
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.044
So in the props here I know
that there is a actually,

167
00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.820
let's just go look at the docs.

168
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:15.100
I know that there is 2 things we wanna do,
so there's like an after sign up URL.

169
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.060
And then a redirect URL.

170
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.510
So I'm just gonna set both of
those to the exact same thing.

171
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:27.950
So after sign up URL, I want you to go
to slash new user and then redirect URL.

172
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.910
I also want you to go to,
wait, I know why I went.

173
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.260
I know why I went to Slides Journal.

174
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.358
I'll show you that in a second.

175
00:09:34.358 --> 00:09:39.365
Slash new user,
is actually really smart way did it

176
00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:47.800
like have an implement that yourself
as a headache, so let's try that again.

177
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.995
I'm already signed in so
I think it's just going to,

178
00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:55.630
if I click try to sign up again,
yeah it'll just keep going to journal.

179
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.834
So until we add the sign
out functionality,

180
00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:05.057
what you can do to sign out
is just open up your browser,

181
00:10:05.057 --> 00:10:12.060
go to application, go to session,
storage, I'm sorry cookies.

182
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.726
Click on your cookies and you can just
clear out all your cookies here, and

183
00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:21.380
it also adds a JWT in the local storage,
so you can delete that too.

184
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.526
Just delete your local storage
in your cookie storage and

185
00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:25.010
that should effectively sign you out.

186
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.829
So now, when I go back here.

187
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.030
It goes to sign up.

188
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.190
But if you take a look
at the URL you can see.

189
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.158
The reason it tried to redirect me to
journal is because it kept track of

190
00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:45.243
the URL that I came from, which was or

191
00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:48.260
it kept track of the URL
that I was trying to go to.

192
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.310
When I click that button,
I tried to go to slash turtle.

193
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:56.090
So it kept track of that was like, hey,
this person try to go to slash journal.

194
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.960
So after they're done,
go to slash journal.

195
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.686
So that's what it's trying to do,

196
00:11:01.686 --> 00:11:05.500
which is smart because I really liked
that flow from a UX perspective.

197
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.253
When you like,
I tried to go to this page, but

198
00:11:07.253 --> 00:11:09.016
I'm not signed in let
me sign in right click.

199
00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:12.495
And then I hate when it just like sent you
to another page that you were not trying

200
00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:16.140
to go to like, that's not the page
that I was trying to go to like.

201
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.133
I wanted to go to this page so it keeps
track of the page you were intending to go

202
00:11:21.133 --> 00:11:23.096
to and transfer that intent.

203
00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:27.961
So but we we should have overwritten
that by adding the redirect URL here to

204
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:32.198
new user so no matter what's in
the URL it should ignore that, so

205
00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:33.933
let's see what happens.

206
00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:42.650
And no, it didn't, I think there's another
prop we have to add somewhere else.
