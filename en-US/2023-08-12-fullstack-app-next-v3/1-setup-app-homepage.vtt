1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.866
Well, let's just get started.

2
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:07.880
So I'm just going to stop all the stuff
that I have that you will be using soon.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.567
And we're just gonna start a new,
so let's try that.

4
00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.679
I'm just gonna start a new here.

5
00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.603
And I'm just gonna make a new directory.

6
00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:21.906
Actually, I'm just gonna use create
next app, so you can do npx.

7
00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:28.352
And then create-next-app.

8
00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:34.540
And then, I'm gonna do latest,
but caution here.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.309
When I do latest this is going to resolve
to the latest version as of today.

10
00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.063
So if you're taking this course
in the future and you do latest,

11
00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:44.664
you might get a different version
than the one I have now, and

12
00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:46.459
that version might be a breaking change.

13
00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.620
So after we do latest, I'm gonna show
you the version that it resolves to.

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.816
So then you can use that version if you're
watching this course later to make sure

15
00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.473
you're on track with what we're doing.

16
00:00:54.473 --> 00:01:00.506
So make sure we have that and then I'll
just give it a name here, I'll call it AI.

17
00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:03.536
Actually, I'll just call it mood,
since that's the name of it, so

18
00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:04.857
I'm just gonna call it mood.

19
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:07.979
The other thing to note
is that you need to make

20
00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.937
sure you have at least
Node.js version 18 installed.

21
00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.516
20 works, I think we had people use 20 the
other day, and that seems to work fine,

22
00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:17.080
but at minimum, it needs to be 18.

23
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.216
And that's because 18 has a smorgasbord
of features that Next.js 13 relies on.

24
00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.803
And then now it's just
gonna walk you through,

25
00:01:25.803 --> 00:01:28.382
if you've ever built an extra ASAP,
you've probably seen this before, but

26
00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:30.860
it's just gonna walk us
through our settings.

27
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.670
I typically pick the defaults,
but I'll walk through them.

28
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
So TypeScript, I love TypeScript,
although I hate writing types.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.797
ESLint, Tailwind, for
sure we'll be using Tailwind.

30
00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:43.913
I don't care too much about the source
directory, this is important,

31
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:45.660
you will use the App router.

32
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.068
If you say no here, you will be writing
a completely different app, [LAUGH] and

33
00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:50.705
you will not be able to follow along.

34
00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:53.782
So say yes to App router,
if you don't know the App router is.

35
00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:58.070
Check out the intro the next day of course
we're talking about the App router and

36
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.950
how that works, but
we'll obviously be using it, so

37
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.155
there'll be commentary and
we won't mess with this here.

38
00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:04.775
And yeah, and

39
00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:08.466
then it'll go install all the things, so
you can see everything it's installing.

40
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.061
We have, TypeScript next,
Tailwind post CSS,

41
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:17.243
autoprefixer ESLint, all the things
that we need react, react DOM.

42
00:02:17.243 --> 00:02:20.752
And that's the important thing to know is
that like Next.js isn't necessarily just

43
00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:23.004
sitting on top of react, so
you still need react here.

44
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:28.965
It's not like some framework that is using
react internally, it sits on top of it.

45
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:33.743
So then we'll go into mood and
let me make sure I exit out of

46
00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:38.836
that VS Code instance, and
then we'll just do this, okay?

47
00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:43.567
Cool, so now we're here,
the very first thing that I like to do is,

48
00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:47.395
I'm going to make a new file
called a .prettier file.

49
00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:55.070
Because my setup doesn't work unless my
auto formatting ESLint vs code setup,

50
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.316
doesn't work unless I have prettier file.

51
00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:02.882
And I also like to just turn off
semicolons because I can't stand them.

52
00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:07.734
And I like single quotes,
I cannot stand double quotes unless

53
00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:12.135
it's in a HTML attribute or
a JSON object, that's it.

54
00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:17.400
I will never use a double quote
anywhere else, and I posted,

55
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.780
someone asked the other day for
that setup for my verses code.

56
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.933
I have it here, in a guess, I guess
I could post this link somewhere, but

57
00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:30.354
I'll just highlight it if that's
just too hard to look at.

58
00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:31.310
What am I talking about?

59
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.127
I gotta post that somewhere.

60
00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:34.828
Okay, so let's head back over to our app.

61
00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:38.107
All right, so now we have that quick
little tour, if you haven't built Next.js

62
00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:41.163
in a while or haven't seen the app router,
we're not gonna get in too def.

63
00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:43.583
That's what the intro course is for, but

64
00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:46.360
just to give you a world's
view of what we have.

65
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.111
I'm just gonna run this right quick,
npm run dev.

66
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:53.650
Get this thing going,
we're gonna get started on 3,000.

67
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.184
Quick tip, if you're in a terminal,
you can hold down command,

68
00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:58.730
click on any URL and
it'll open it in a browser for you.

69
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.646
Even if it doesn't highlight like this,
it's pretty cool.

70
00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:06.345
So just open that up, and then you
should see something like this, right?

71
00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:10.988
Next.js' standard Hello World
app with all the flair that you

72
00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:15.467
could expect from for sale,
with the consistent branding.

73
00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.567
So yeah, you'll get this pretty cool.

74
00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:21.035
And then in the app directory,
we just have these four files,

75
00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:22.040
right we have a favicon.

76
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.787
If you don't have the favicon is,

77
00:04:23.787 --> 00:04:26.830
it's this logo that goes
in a tab of your browser.

78
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.538
That's what if avocados,
and a global CSS file,

79
00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:33.731
we have this layout file and
we have a page.

80
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.171
So I'm just gonna reset all of this
gonna go into this home page and

81
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:40.065
delete everything,
we don't want that stuff there.

82
00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:43.414
I'm just gonna return
a div inside of here.

83
00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:46.452
I'm going to turn off my
GitHub co-pilot for now,

84
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.640
cuz it's really annoying
when I'm trying to teach.

85
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.646
It recommends stuff I don't wanna do, and

86
00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:53.716
then it gets in the way
of the autocomplete.

87
00:04:53.716 --> 00:04:59.518
So I'm just gonna say home here,
I don't need this image.

88
00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:00.824
And then for the global CSS,

89
00:05:00.824 --> 00:05:04.460
I don't need any of this other than
the tailwind directives up top.

90
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.942
So I just got rid of all of that.

91
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.960
So just doing a reset here, that way
we don't have any of that stuff there.

92
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.420
All right, and just for sanity check, our
app still works, we didn't break anything.

93
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.632
Should be good to go on that.
