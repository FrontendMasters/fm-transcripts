1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.900
We're getting somewhere.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.422
So now let's experiment with like,
let's give the AI a fake journal entry and

3
00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:10.368
then ask it to perform an analysis
on it and see if we can.

4
00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:14.232
Because I mean, the goal here,
right, is to be able to,

5
00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:17.140
we're trying to get back this from the AI.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.952
We wanna give you a journal entry, give me
back the mood, the summary, the color, and

7
00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:23.320
whether it's negative or not.

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.300
So a couple things there.

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.730
One, we got to figure
out how to ask it that.

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.840
Two, we got to figure out how
to make sure it's consistent.

11
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.590
Because that's the thing about AIs.

12
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.192
There's a little bit of randomness into
it that keeps it from giving you the same

13
00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:36.320
thing every time.

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.030
I can give it the same problem and
get back.

15
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.100
If I ask it again right now,
I will get back something different.

16
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.180
The code might be the same this might be
different maybe this H1 is down here it's

17
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.324
not always gonna be the same.

18
00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:50.610
So how do we get structured
output from something that's

19
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.549
completely random what do we
have to ask it to get it?

20
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.492
And then how do we keep
all that working so

21
00:00:57.492 --> 00:01:02.437
it's like It's very hard to get
that to work and LinkedIn comes in.

22
00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.210
So let's see if we can try
to do some of this stuff and

23
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.350
then we'll bring in some
of the Liang Cheng tools.

24
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.410
So one is the prompt.

25
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.030
So let's say we have some fake entry here.

26
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.472
Well, I guess this will be
the entry will be the prompt.,

27
00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:22.040
how can we try to get some of that back?

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.730
So the first thing is prompt engineering.

29
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.470
Prompt engineering is like, let's craft
the best prompts, let's think about it.

30
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.493
And that way if we write
a good enough prompt,

31
00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:31.900
it will give us back the results
that we want, right?

32
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.762
So what I can do in that
case is I'll head back to

33
00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:41.004
where I'm writing in my prompts here and

34
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:46.136
I'll say I'm going to
give you a journal entry.

35
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.099
I want you to analyze it,
For a few things.

36
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.040
I need the mood, A summary,
what the subject is,

37
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.272
And a color representing, The mood.

38
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.729
You need to respond back.

39
00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:29.870
With formatted JSON like so.

40
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.470
And then I can give it an example
of what that JSON should look like.

41
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.414
So I can say, yeah, it should look like,
name, or I'm sorry mood,

42
00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:46.680
there's like the mood and then there's,
like what else I say subject.

43
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.133
And subject stacks, and
then you have color.

44
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.368
It is like trying to give
a person instructions negative.

45
00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:14.070
And then finally I can say I'm
just going to the next line and

46
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.160
I'm gonna say, entry like this.

47
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.630
And then I'm gonna write
the journal entry.

48
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.467
Today was a really great day.

49
00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:31.334
I finally was able to grab that

50
00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:38.850
pair of shoes I have been dying to get.

51
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.810
All right, so that's my entry,
so we can save that.

52
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.890
And let's see what it gives me back.

53
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.590
And then we'll run it a few times to see,
like, how it differs.

54
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.090
Maybe it'll give us that back exactly
every time and we'll just get lucky.

55
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.350
Maybe it won't, by the way.

56
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.076
Either way, it won't be this is still
missing some things like this doesn't even

57
00:03:57.076 --> 00:04:00.320
know what type these things are like
negative supposed to be a Boolean.

58
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.570
So like it's just so many things here.

59
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.017
So let's run this refresh this
it's gonna take a minute.

60
00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:13.307
So you can see here I personally did get
back an object here so it did work for

61
00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:19.940
me actually did it twice I got back
mood happy subject getting new shoes.

62
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.150
Color yellow, negative false.

63
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.340
So, for me,
it worked out pretty good twice.

64
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.470
And actually, when I look at both of them,
it gave me back the same thing there.

65
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.260
So that was actually really cool.

66
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.470
The problem is you're not gonna
get this every single time.

67
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.270
Sometimes when I run this,
it might be something else.

68
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.158
The other problem is,
it's not gonna give me,

69
00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:48.670
now it's giving me error at the same time.

70
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.120
It's like, yeah, watch,
I'll give it to you and say watch.

71
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.060
Check this out.

72
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.710
The other thing is it doesn't
know the types of things.

73
00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.140
This false is false, it's supposed to
be like a Boolean and not a string.

74
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.880
So then you might ask yourself, yeah, I'll
just go in here and be like, I can like

75
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.270
give this thing I mean, you're basically
giving it a schema at this point.

76
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.911
You're like, if I give it a schema
of what it should look like and

77
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:13.680
I ask it that it should only respond with
this, I should get that back every time.

78
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.960
But sometimes you might see
something like, it'll respond and

79
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.936
instead of just giving you back
this object that you want,

80
00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:23.350
it'll put a word before it's like,
here's your answer.

81
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.140
And that word in front of it will mess
it up because you can't parse that.

82
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.935
So it's like little things like that you
might not get actually wrote a pretty damn

83
00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:30.820
good prompt here.

84
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.460
So it's like, yeah, I understand it.

85
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.940
And that's just cuz [LAUGH] I do this so
much.

86
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.709
But most people probably
wouldn't know how to do this.
