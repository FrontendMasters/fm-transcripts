1
00:00:00.274 --> 00:00:02.347
Basically, what we want to do is,

2
00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:06.140
we only get the analysis when
it's first pulled down, right?

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.769
But we instead want to
get the analysis and

4
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.862
we want to change it every
time something new comes in.

5
00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:20.324
So what we need to do is basically
make the entire analysis thing like

6
00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:21.489
a component, right?

7
00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.256
So if we take, where does it start?

8
00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:28.372
I guess it starts kinda
everything in here,

9
00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:31.970
all this is like the thing
that's on the right.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.040
We need to make this a new component,
so it's a client component.

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.916
And then inside that client component,

12
00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:38.956
we can use state to keep
track of analysis and

13
00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:42.502
then we can have it change when something
comes in or basically it's a form.

14
00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:46.935
We need to do that because right now
the only way to get this to re-render is

15
00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.450
to do a revalidate or
something like that, which is fine.

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.544
We can do that too, but
I think it'll be as mood.

17
00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:58.700
Actually, let's just try it,
let's see what happens.

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.352
So we can go into the API route and
we can say revalidatePath,

19
00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:09.535
I think the path will just be journal.

20
00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:23.118
/Entry.id, we can see
what that looks like.

21
00:01:23.118 --> 00:01:26.408
I mean, if it works now,
we can just do that, I'm fine with that.

22
00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:34.618
Let's see, so we'll let that load.

23
00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:38.304
I guess that should have made it happy,
so we'll see if it changes.

24
00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:41.448
Cuz now we can't tell if it changed or
not, and it was the same thing.

25
00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:46.543
So I'll say, today was so great.

26
00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:53.736
Yeah, that's what I thought.

27
00:01:53.736 --> 00:02:00.288
It wasn't going to do it, I just refreshed
that, by the way, it didn't do that, okay?

28
00:02:00.288 --> 00:02:04.596
Yeah, so we're just gonna move that to
a client component, so let's do that.

29
00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:08.133
So I will go into this page here,

30
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:13.378
we're just gonna pretty
much grab all of this.

31
00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:17.945
We're gonna create a client component,
so I'll make a new component here, and

32
00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:20.441
I'll just call it the analysis component.

33
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:36.632
Scholars do that and
use client up top, like that.

34
00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:51.007
Cool Actually,

35
00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:56.528
let me just make sure I'm doing the exact
same thing I had on the repo here.

36
00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:58.615
I don't wanna do something
completely different.

37
00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:03.173
What did I do here from that?

38
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.152
That's right, I remember what I did there,
I guess I'll stick to that.

39
00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:14.382
So what I did with
the final version actually,

40
00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:17.540
I just put it all in editor versus
just making another component.

41
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.415
Since the editor was
already a client component.

42
00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.516
I guess that makes sense,
guess we could just do that.

43
00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:29.107
Yeah, let's just do that, that makes sense
because it'll actually be easier since

44
00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:31.186
the data is in here versus
me having to pass it down.

45
00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.990
So let's do that, I'll just put it
into the editor, I like that better.

46
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.443
So we're bringing this in the editor.

47
00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:45.032
Basically, all we need to do is go
to the page and we don't even need.

48
00:03:45.032 --> 00:03:49.090
We just wanna take everything
that has the border right here,

49
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.287
just going to get rid of all that.

50
00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:52.920
We're basically gonna do
everything we have here.

51
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.221
We're the grid and stuff, all this is
just gonna happen in the editor now.

52
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:59.560
Whereas the editor was only the editor,
now the editor's gonna be the whole page.

53
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.410
Does that make sense?

54
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.317
Before it was just the text box,
now it's gonna be the entire page,

55
00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:06.009
that's basically what we're doing.

56
00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.575
So we're basically going to bring a lot

57
00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:14.339
of this stuff over to the editor,
so let's do that.

58
00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:18.842
Let me copy that again,
I'm going to go to the editor.

59
00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.377
We have this text area here, right?

60
00:04:20.377 --> 00:04:24.411
So I'm just going to paste
that stuff in right now.

61
00:04:24.411 --> 00:04:29.447
Obviously, it's gonna break,
that's totally fine.

62
00:04:29.447 --> 00:04:33.266
And we're gonna do the same thing
we had in the original page,

63
00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:37.920
which is just bringing I guess,
in this case, just a grid stuff.

64
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.390
So let's bring the grid stuff over,
like that.

65
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.526
Got our grid stuff, and
then we'll wrap this text area and a div

66
00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:55.064
So it has a class name of cols-pan-2,
just like it did in the other one.

67
00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:04.489
And then for this one, should be good
there other than the analytics data.

68
00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.169
Obviously, just not gonna work there,
it's gonna break,

69
00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.826
that's fine I'm back on a page,
I don't want a grid here.

70
00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:18.389
So I go to the grid, go to the call
span stuff, It just have an editor.

71
00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:31.056
Cool, also don't need to do any of
the analysis stuff in here at all,

72
00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:32.818
he's get rid of that.

73
00:05:32.818 --> 00:05:36.361
I'm gonna use that because we're
gonna do all an editor now,

74
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.655
I mean you still want to make the call
to get the data here are just that we're

75
00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:42.851
passing the entire entry to the editor

76
00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:54.019
And then I'm just gonna paste
that right above my autosave,

77
00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.637
where now I can get the analysis,
like that.

78
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.152
So that should get rid of those errors or
they should pretty much render the same.

79
00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:12.087
It might be some CSS differences,

80
00:06:12.087 --> 00:06:16.854
but yeah, I'm asking,
it looks pretty much the same.

81
00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:21.058
And then now that it's all in a client
component, we can grab some state and

82
00:06:21.058 --> 00:06:21.941
do some stuff.

83
00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:25.308
So I'll just stay right here for
a second if you wanna check it out.

84
00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:30.645
Really, the only thing I did was take
everything we had in this page as far as

85
00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:36.350
like the CSS the grid and stuff, and just
applied it to the top level of this one.

86
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.936
And treat it text area like the editor and
everything else was the same.

87
00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:44.837
Also, don't forget,
I have the code on GitHub,

88
00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:47.542
you can copy that if you
wanna take a look at it.

89
00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:53.590
So now I'm going to set up that
state to get our analysis,

90
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.378
so what we can do is make a useState.

91
00:06:57.378 --> 00:07:01.988
So we can say, this is our analysis,
we can set an analysis.

92
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.554
UseState, it's default is
going to be entry.analysis,

93
00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:20.101
like so, and then instead of,
where is it that?

94
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:25.720
Instead of using entry.analysis for the
destructuring, we'll just use analysis.

95
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.890
We'll pull from that, right?

96
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.493
And then all we have to do is after
this update, we could just say,

97
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.448
yeah, set analysis to be.

98
00:07:34.448 --> 00:07:42.950
This updated thing which I believe this
will be a distructured data, actually.

99
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.001
So this will just be data.analysis.

100
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.279
And then now this array
is bound to the analysis,

101
00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:07.275
which gets changed every
single time we call update.

102
00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:10.177
Which should cause a re-render,
which should change these values,

103
00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:11.763
and we should see some changes there.

104
00:08:15.032 --> 00:08:19.490
First, as before, it was bound to
the entry.analysis, which never changed

105
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.081
because that came in as a prop from a
server component that never re-renders, so

106
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:25.582
that would never change.

107
00:08:25.582 --> 00:08:29.020
Now, it will change because
this is where we call update.

108
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.040
And we get back to update,
which is on data.

109
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.506
Data is an entry, entry has a .analysis.

110
00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:38.431
So we change it, and
calling this re-renders everything.

111
00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:44.505
So let's see what we broke.

112
00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:48.202
Today was so great.

113
00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:52.862
Okay, today was math,

114
00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:57.289
I had an just okay day,

115
00:08:57.289 --> 00:09:02.425
had better seeing worse.

116
00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:08.334
And let's see if something crashes here.

117
00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:10.601
Okay, so what do we have?

118
00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:15.302
This thing says,
cannot read properties of undefined

119
00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:19.192
reading analysis, line 25, let's see.

120
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:23.306
It's probably something to
do with this update here.

121
00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:27.409
So I already returned data.data,
I was smart about it.

122
00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:32.199
I already knew I was gonna use it,
apparently, so

123
00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:36.313
I don't need to destructure in this case.

124
00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:38.826
It's like one of those times
where you're like, all right,

125
00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:39.996
I'm going to put my keys up.

126
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:43.463
And the house summer, so I don't lose
them, and you forget where I put them up.

127
00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:44.581
&gt;&gt; And where was TypeScript?

128
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:48.066
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
where was TypeScript in all of this?

129
00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:56.027
[LAUGH] So we'll do that,
see what happens.

130
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:02.490
Okay, so let's see here.

131
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.532
This thing says,
I think I know why this might be, but

132
00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:09.514
can I remove analysis as it's undefined?

133
00:10:09.514 --> 00:10:16.649
Yeah, so I think this just means we
need to go to our API on the update,

134
00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:21.831
which is here, and
we just need to make sure that.

135
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.767
It's now we're returning
the updated entry which is

136
00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:34.871
fine we don't need to await this or
actually that we do, so

137
00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:41.240
basically the updated entry won't
have the new analysis on it, right?

138
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.866
We just updated the analysis here.

139
00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:48.093
So you might think like, alright, well,
I'll just do that really cool includes

140
00:10:48.093 --> 00:10:52.738
thing here and include analysis and
then now it will have analysis on it.

141
00:10:52.738 --> 00:10:57.191
That's true, but I think it will have
the old one on it because we updated

142
00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:59.897
the analysis after this entry got created.

143
00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:04.230
So it'll be whatever the analysis
was before, so we won't do that.

144
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.498
So instead we need to send back
this updated analysis here.

145
00:11:09.177 --> 00:11:13.218
So I'll just say data and
then this will be,

146
00:11:13.218 --> 00:11:19.008
best way to do this is probably
just spread over updated entry,

147
00:11:19.008 --> 00:11:26.755
and then you can say analysis, And
then that's the updated thing like that.

148
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.321
That way, we still get back
an object that is literally an entry

149
00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:37.940
plus an analysis property on it.

150
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.770
That is the updated analysis, so

151
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.933
it remains that entry shape and
I'll have to change my code.

152
00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:49.400
If I were to sit back,
I'll just send back an entry here.

153
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.740
And then also I'll make an object that
says entry and it's the entry and

154
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.830
I'll put another property says analysis
that would break my code on the front end.

155
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.754
Because it's not looking for
a property called entry.

156
00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:05.145
It expects the whole object to be
the entry, I don't wanna change that.

157
00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:08.482
So I'm just making a whole new object
that is the same thing as this.

158
00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:12.593
Plus this one field which my front
end is expecting to be here.

159
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:21.779
Did I spell that right?

160
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:26.504
Now I feel like that's not spelled right.

161
00:12:26.504 --> 00:12:30.281
I guess that is right,
I just can't spell it right like here.

162
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:34.373
[LAUGH] My what is bothering,
there's a word just fixed that

163
00:12:34.373 --> 00:12:35.854
&gt;&gt; You look at any word too long,

164
00:12:35.854 --> 00:12:36.926
it looks very weird.

165
00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:38.706
&gt;&gt; I've been looking at
this word way too long.

166
00:12:38.706 --> 00:12:42.154
I'm like that does not seem right.

167
00:12:42.154 --> 00:12:46.350
Analysis, I had to say it to myself,
analysis, analysis.

168
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.923
Now that seems so weird.

169
00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:51.360
It was a couple years ago,
I think I was doing that with rice.

170
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.980
I was like, rice.-

171
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.585
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because you- [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; So weird.

172
00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:56.495
&gt;&gt; Almost normal word that
you'd never question otherwise.

173
00:12:56.495 --> 00:12:57.426
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If you just look at it too long and

174
00:12:57.426 --> 00:12:58.462
you're like, what's going on here?

175
00:12:58.462 --> 00:12:59.841
&gt;&gt; What is that?

176
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:03.700
Yeah, that's happens, I don't know,
Maybe it's a condition, I don't know.

177
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.858
&gt;&gt; It's so weird.

178
00:13:05.858 --> 00:13:07.931
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] you're cool.

179
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:13.530
So it seems like it's working there, so
then I'd like, you know, actually I lied.

180
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.821
Today was so amazing, and

181
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:24.367
let's see, it says I'm happy now.

182
00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:29.025
Hey, it does.

183
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:32.219
Today was amazing, my day, happy, so cool.

184
00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:36.419
That works, got the update going,
everything's cool there.
