00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.655
All right, well, let's see if we can
style these EntryCards a little bit.

2
00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:10.110
We'll need some more information to truly
get them where we want them to be, but

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.672
we'll style them as much as we can.

4
00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:19.642
And then we will work on getting
the editor for the entry.

5
00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:22.060
So when you click on it,
you go to the actual page,

6
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.838
there's an editor there on
which you can edit the entry.

7
00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:29.813
We'll get that smooth going with
auto-saving and stuff like that,

8
00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:34.883
and then we can hook up the AI part to it,
which does the analysis on it.

9
00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:41.494
So, okay, let's start with that then.

10
00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:46.477
First thing first is,
let me just close all these windows, is,

11
00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:51.658
yeah, let's work on making that
EntryCard look a little better.

12
00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:55.510
So I already have some CSS for
that as well.

13
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.811
I'm gonna go to this little
EntryCard I have here.

14
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:04.029
Just gonna copy this, come here.

15
00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.030
And I'm just gonna just paste
it in here in my EntryCard.

16
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.509
A few things happen in here,
kind of talk about it,

17
00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.770
but, I mean, it's mostly just CSS, right?

18
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.114
There's only some JavaScript about the
date, and I'll tell you why I did that.

19
00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:22.985
But yeah, I mean, it's just a card
with a rounded corner, background,

20
00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:27.169
and shadow, just like the other card,
and a bunch of padding.

21
00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:31.141
This right here where it says,
small colon, this is for responsiveness.

22
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.319
So it's like, hey, when you're on
a small screen, do px instead.

23
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.146
I'm actually just gonna take all this off.

24
00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:39.652
I think at one point I was gonna make
this responsive, and then I was like,

25
00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:40.680
I'm not doing this.

26
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.805
[LAUGH] So, I didn't, this is not
a design class, this is not gonna happen.

27
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:53.787
So you don't need that, and I'll just put
the date, analysis, and analysis.mood.

28
00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:57.094
We don't have these yet, so
this is probably going to freak out.

29
00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:03.269
Right, so I'm just going to
put something else in here for

30
00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.945
now that just says summary, and then mood.

31
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.089
We will have date, though.

32
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.348
So the reason I had to
do this with a date,

33
00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:16.483
because date itself is a date object.

34
00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:19.130
You can't render an object in React,
it'll get an error.

35
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.869
It'll say, you tried to render an object,
we expected a React component.

36
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.350
And then if you just throw the date
in there that's dateToString(),

37
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.342
it looks like crap.

38
00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:33.360
So this is just a really
quick way to format it.

39
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.384
You don't need to install Moment.js,
which is 12 gigabytes, in order to-

40
00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:37.993
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

41
00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:41.060
&gt;&gt; Format a date string.

42
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.171
date-fns is actually a really good
package you can use, but even then,

43
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:47.236
I don't need to use those anymore,
I just use the regular date object.

44
00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:50.091
It's come a long way, you can format
some stuff pretty well with it.

45
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.482
So we got that, and, yeah,
let's see what that looks like.

46
00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:59.998
It should already be on the page,
so yeah, there we go.

47
00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:03.058
Looking much better, looking much better.

48
00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:06.098
The last thing we wanna do is
be able to click on this and

49
00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:07.930
have it go to that page, right?

50
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.077
So let's set that up.

51
00:03:10.077 --> 00:03:15.044
So what we can do is just
basically wrap these in a Link.

52
00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:19.442
I'm not gonna do them here,
I'm gonna do them in the component that's

53
00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:22.540
rendering them,
which will be the journal page.

54
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.361
So in the journal page here, these
EntryCards, I'll wrap them in a Link,

55
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:27.979
like so.

56
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.253
That way, if I wanna reuse
these cards somewhere else and

57
00:03:34.253 --> 00:03:36.420
not have them link somewhere,
I can do that.

58
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.400
If I were to put the Link
in the card itself,

59
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.380
it's always gonna be linking somewhere.

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:48.092
That defeats the point of having
something flexible as a component.

61
00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:51.117
So for the href, pretty simple.

62
00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:57.838
We're just going to say
/journal/${entry.id}.

63
00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:02.749
We can take this key prop and move it
upward one, so it can leave us alone.

64
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.625
And that's it.

65
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:09.690
And now we can navigate to
a page that we didn't make yet.

66
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.364
So if you hover over it,
you can see it will try to navigate there.

67
00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:17.145
And it works.
