1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.647
All right, well, let's make this journal
page cuz it's just 404 right now.

2
00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:08.117
So, to make the journal page,

3
00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:13.732
we're going to Dashboard route group,
and we will make a new layout.

4
00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:16.333
So make a new layout in here.

5
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.908
Reminder, a layout is just a component
that wraps all of its sibling and

6
00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:21.408
children pages and layouts.

7
00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:23.796
So it's like a template, it just wraps it,

8
00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:27.097
it's great for sharing UI across
sibling and child routes.

9
00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:32.148
So, we want all of the pages in our
dashboard to have this certain layout.

10
00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:35.708
So instead of, let's just take
this side nav and this top nav,

11
00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:39.777
move it to components and we'll bring
it into every single page that we want.

12
00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:44.303
Let's just make it once and
then we will wrap every page inside of it,

13
00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:45.405
and we get that.

14
00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:48.881
And the benefit of that is, one, we don't
have to bring it in every single page.

15
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.904
Two, because it's a layout, it doesn't
re-render when the route changes.

16
00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:54.927
So we don't have to worry about,

17
00:00:54.927 --> 00:00:58.231
why is my nav bar flashing every
time someone changes routes?

18
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.556
You don't have to worry about that,
it stays static.

19
00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:02.084
So, that's what we're gonna do.

20
00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:07.194
So we'll say, Dashboard Layout.

21
00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:13.893
Like this, and this, export default that.

22
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.164
And because it's a layout, the only
requirement that it needs is that it just,

23
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:20.805
I mean, it's not even a requirement.

24
00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:23.063
But if you don't do it,
it's like why are you using a layout?

25
00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:25.918
Is that you need to just render
the children, that's really it.

26
00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.620
You don't have to,
it's not gonna break if you don't.

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.021
But it's not gonna serve
its purpose if you don't.

28
00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:34.764
So, render those children.

29
00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:35.374
So for now,

30
00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:39.344
we'll just keep the dashboard as a pass
through just to render the children.

31
00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:42.734
That way we can get
the journal page on the screen.

32
00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:46.462
And we'll come back and make this
actually look like something soon.

33
00:01:46.462 --> 00:01:52.159
So we've got a layout here, and then
we need a new folder, call it journal.

34
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.665
So we can have that segment.

35
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.914
And then we want a page,
we wanna be able to go to /journal.

36
00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:01.711
So that means we have to make
a page in the Journal folder.

37
00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:09.899
This allows us to go to /journal which is
where our app is trynna navigate us to,

38
00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.420
So, we'll make a journal page

39
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.232
And for now, we will just return
some data that says Journal.

40
00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:28.201
That way we can just see
something on the page.

41
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.494
Cool, everybody with me?

42
00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:42.500
Awesome, let's just verify
we didn't break anything.

43
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.446
I click here,
should go to /journal like that.

44
00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:49.280
Cool, so what is the journal page?

45
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.036
Well, if you remember from the demo
I gave you at the beginning,

46
00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:55.066
the journal page is where we list all
the journal entries that we have.

47
00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.121
And we can also create a new one.

48
00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:02.303
So, that means this page is gonna be
responsible for pulling in, fetching,

49
00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:07.263
getting all the journals in an ordered
manner by date, organizing them.

50
00:03:07.263 --> 00:03:09.974
And then also holding,
being a container for

51
00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:14.340
the new journal button that we can use
to click on to create a new journal.

52
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.799
So it has those two functionalities.

53
00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.385
We'll focus on getting the journals.

54
00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:22.552
Well, I guess we should focus on creating
a journal first since we don't have any

55
00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:23.260
journals to get.

56
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.249
So, we'll focus on, we'll pick which one,
it doesn't really matter.

57
00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.207
We'll figure it out, but we'll do that.

58
00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:34.347
But first, let's get this dashboard
looking like a dashboard.

59
00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.999
Cuz right now it's not,
and it's bothering me.

60
00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.390
So, let's do that.

61
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.251
So in this dashboard layout,
let's write some CSS here.

62
00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:46.209
I'm basically just going to just
do a simple dashboard layout.

63
00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.798
You got being on the left, you got
a little skinny nav bar on the top.

64
00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:53.524
And then you got your content
below the nav bar on the top and

65
00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:56.050
to the right of the sidebar on the left.

66
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.210
There's a lot of ways to do it,
there isn't a right way.

67
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.922
I'm not making this responsive, so I'm
just gonna use absolute positioning for

68
00:04:01.922 --> 00:04:02.851
a lot of stuff here.

69
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:06.502
So, first thing I'm gonna
do is make this dashboard.

70
00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:11.875
I could just drill into making
this like h-full and w-full.

71
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:16.729
And then if its parents are full, it's
parents are full, it'll be full screen.

72
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.164
I can just shortcut all of that and
just be, yeah, each screen and w-screen.

73
00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:27.220
You're as big as the screen,
that's how big you are.

74
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.633
So we got that, and
then I'm gonna make this relative.

75
00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:32.836
Cuz I'm gonna make some
absolute position things.

76
00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:35.490
So I need something relative,
now want this to be.

77
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.241
And the next thing I'm gonna
do is make the sidebar.

78
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.200
So, I'll just use a side here,
you can use diff.

79
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.130
This literally doesn't make a difference,
I'm just trying to be correct.

80
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.396
So I'll use an aside here.

81
00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:59.352
I'll make this absolute, put a top of 0,

82
00:04:59.352 --> 00:05:04.654
and a left of 0, and a height of full.

83
00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:12.677
And a border, right,
with a border that is black.

84
00:05:12.677 --> 00:05:17.306
And 5% opacity, maybe 10%,
we'll play around with that.

85
00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:23.833
And I'll just put the word Mood in here,
like that.

86
00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:27.579
&gt;&gt; Layout.

87
00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:33.009
&gt;&gt; And then next to that, I,
I gotta give this a width.

88
00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.955
Let's make this a width of,
say, 200 pixels.

89
00:05:37.955 --> 00:05:40.080
Use a number here.

90
00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.543
And I'll make a div here that
offsets that cuz this sidebar is

91
00:05:47.543 --> 00:05:50.628
gonna be on the left 20 pixels wide.

92
00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:52.038
So I have to account for that.

93
00:05:52.038 --> 00:05:57.275
So I'll give this a class name,
I'll give this a margin right of,

94
00:05:57.275 --> 00:06:02.340
I'm sorry, margin left of 200 pixels,
same width as this.

95
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.833
To offset that.

96
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:13.707
Then inside of here, I will make
a header with a nav inside of it.

97
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.543
Actually, I don't even need a nav,
I'm just gonna make a header, and

98
00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:23.332
here it'll just be, Hello, and then for

99
00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:27.380
this header, this is also gonna
be absolutely positioned.

100
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.586
So I'll say absolute.

101
00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:31.278
Actually, you know what?

102
00:06:31.278 --> 00:06:34.391
I don't need to make this absolute
position, this could be relative.

103
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:40.225
But I will give it a height, I'll give
it a height of, I don't know, 60 pixels.

104
00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:43.960
That might be too big,
that might be too small, we'll see.

105
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.073
Border bottom, with a border of black/10.

106
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.340
We'll just say hello there.

107
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.321
And then finally,
this is where our content will go.

108
00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:12.736
Cool, so let's see how ugly this is.

109
00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:15.152
[LAUGH] It actually worked out.

110
00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:17.183
[LAUGH] It's exactly
what I wanted it to be.

111
00:07:17.183 --> 00:07:21.086
So, we have our thing on the left,
our navigation on top and

112
00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:23.050
then our content right here.

113
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.787
So this is the journal page right here.

114
00:07:27.227 --> 00:07:30.400
I guess it does work out on
the first time sometimes.

115
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.843
We all get that one time.

116
00:07:31.843 --> 00:07:35.190
I gotta go play the Lotto tonight,
hit those numbers.
