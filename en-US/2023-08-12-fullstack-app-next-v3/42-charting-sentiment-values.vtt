WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.210
Now that we have that, if we go back to
our page, we can finally write our query.

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.490
So we wanna find where userId is user.id,
like that.

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.610
And now we have our analysis.

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.552
But I just wanna select the sentiment
score and nothing else,

5
00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:22.668
I don't really care about anything else.

6
00:00:29.123 --> 00:00:33.580
And then I'll return the analyses,

7
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.040
then I'll also return the,

8
00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.565
I'll return the average analysis score.

9
00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:51.070
So average or
guess some would be analysis.reduce.

10
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.106
You know, what is this all And

11
00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:05.726
then like current, so
just be all plus current,

12
00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:09.610
so that'll add them all up.

13
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.644
And cons would be average sum

14
00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:20.890
divided by analysis.length.

15
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.035
And I'll just make sure that it is,

16
00:01:25.035 --> 00:01:28.911
we'll be optimist and round up.

17
00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:37.234
Cool and our average

18
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:48.552
Operator plus replied to types number and
yeah,

19
00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:51.966
I guess I need to do that
current dot since my score.

20
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:52.698
There we go.

21
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:59.370
All right, so we got that.

22
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.194
Let's see what we broke here.

23
00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:08.215
Or average, and then analyses.

24
00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:16.929
Okay, data, cool.

25
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.225
And I'll just put the average in here.

26
00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:24.690
Let's see what we get and
I'll just log the analysis.

27
00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:30.640
All right.

28
00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.204
Man, I haven't used reduce in a minute.

29
00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:38.013
Felt weird.

30
00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:45.757
Okay, and then we go to History,
looks like it's working.

31
00:02:45.757 --> 00:02:50.310
It has success 2 and then on the server
side, we can see the analysis.

32
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.170
So wow, he was really down bad on that
first one and then this was really good.

33
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.830
Really happy and
somewhere just slightly above neutral.

34
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.940
I feel like everyone needs to shoot for
five in life.

35
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.040
Maybe shoot for five.

36
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.969
Like this is, you're asking to
let down at eight and at seven,

37
00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:15.360
you probably need to check in somewhere,
but at five, that's healthy.

38
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.510
So shoot for five, put that up on your
wall in your office, shoot for five.

39
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.590
All right, so we got that.

40
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.140
Now let's, let's make some charts.

41
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.670
Let's make something,
make something out of this.

42
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.038
So we're gonna install
a package called rechart.

43
00:03:34.038 --> 00:03:37.558
So npm install recharts or recharts.

44
00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:42.238
It's I think it's plural watch it be
rechart and someone else made something

45
00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:46.712
called recharts that's not this, and
it's going to mess me up, right?

46
00:03:46.712 --> 00:03:51.420
Isn't it always like that?

47
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.543
Let's just go verify.

48
00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:04.257
It was definitely called,
yeah, it's plural, okay.

49
00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:08.190
You just never know,
never know with people these days, man.

50
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.360
Okay, so we're gonna make a chart.

51
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.450
But a chart is mostly all client-side
stuff, so we need a client component.

52
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.020
So let's do that.

53
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.866
I'm just gonna go to our component folder
where we put pretty much all of our client

54
00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:23.640
components but
components can be server components too.

55
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.870
It's not only pages.

56
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.110
Yes, you want me to say that?

57
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.610
Okay, yeah.

58
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.660
&gt;&gt; A question for you.

59
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.651
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Is it going to be a client component

60
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:35.107
because of interactivity, use of hooks,
or is it a client component because

61
00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.570
it's pulling in a third party
library into the stage?

62
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.695
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

63
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.376
Yeah, both.

64
00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:45.104
So it's a client component because it's
pulling in a third party library that I

65
00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:49.210
know is using interactivity as far
as like hooks and stuff like that.

66
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.110
So it just won't work unless you at
least put clang component on top of it.

67
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.070
Yeah, so great question.

68
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.798
So we'll make a history chart.

69
00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.504
HistoryChart.tsx here,

70
00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:06.696
I'm going to say use clients.

71
00:05:16.527 --> 00:05:22.991
Cool, HistoryChart, it's gonna take in.

72
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:28.420
Some data that's gonna be the entries or
the sentiment scores.

73
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.989
I just realized I want to get the date of
them too so I can plot them on a date.

74
00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:37.945
So we'll go back and change
the select from just sentiment score

75
00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:41.909
to also get created at as well so
I can get that date.

76
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.727
Okay, cool so we got that and
then basically.

77
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:47.598
This one's kind of cool.

78
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:52.486
It actually is very simple to render this
basically all we have to do is just I'm

79
00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:54.080
making a line chart.

80
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.180
So it's very simple to do it they
have a line chart component.

81
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.990
You don't need the x axis for
it if you don't want but I did, so

82
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.881
I can like plot it have
updated out here but

83
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.970
now I think created out is
better because you want to see.

84
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.370
How you felt that day regardless
if you went back and updated it.

85
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.451
If you go back and update a journal entry,
you're still updating it based off what

86
00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:14.820
you felt that day when
you originally made it.

87
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.246
So if I made a drone interest today,
and then a week later, I went back and

88
00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:19.050
updated it.

89
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.740
I'm not going to update it,
but what I felt today.

90
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.355
I'm going to update it, but what like,

91
00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.410
I have a new thought on what
I felt when I wrote this.

92
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.493
So, I think I'm gonna change that
to create it not updated at but

93
00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:33.930
yeah, we're gonna import
from recharts a few things.

94
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.005
So we need the container
line chart line x-axis and

95
00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:40.305
then tooltip to make some
really cool tooltips there.

96
00:06:40.305 --> 00:06:45.468
So we'll do that imports from recharts in

97
00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:51.080
the responsive container, we got the line.

98
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.371
We got the x--axis, we got the tooltip.

99
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:57.885
What else do we need?

100
00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:59.653
Line chart.

101
00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:02.606
Now the last one line chart.

102
00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:04.005
Cool, we got that.

103
00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:09.909
From here, we can just return
the responsive design, or

104
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.579
the responsive container, like that.

105
00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:18.835
We can give it a width of 100%,
And a height.

106
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:23.485
I can't remember,
I think you got to give this

107
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:28.019
a number Now you can do it, okay?

108
00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:30.238
It's the other ones you
got your number two.

109
00:07:30.238 --> 00:07:34.312
So we got the responsive container here
and then from here we want to do line

110
00:07:34.312 --> 00:07:39.560
chart, Like so.

111
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.565
And a line chart takes a width and
a height,

112
00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:44.746
which doesn't really matter because
it's gonna be responsive but

113
00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:47.105
this is mostly like you
putting the aspect ratio.

114
00:07:47.105 --> 00:07:52.098
So I do like a width of 300,
a height of 100 and

115
00:07:52.098 --> 00:07:55.940
then this is where you pass in the data.

116
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.666
So we'll say data.

117
00:07:57.666 --> 00:08:02.593
Data needs to be an array of object which
entries is that that will be passing

118
00:08:02.593 --> 00:08:07.130
in and then now we just say what
properties we want to go on what axes and

119
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.249
lines, right?

120
00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:12.822
So for instance, this line, the main line,
we were going to say the data key for

121
00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:15.350
that is gonna be called sentimentScore.

122
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.650
So look for
an object on this array of data.

123
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.071
And for each one of those,

124
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:22.340
this is what's gonna create
a lot of the points in a line.

125
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.156
So let's do that.

126
00:08:23.156 --> 00:08:28.558
Not link but line.

127
00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:34.649
We can say data key is sentiment

128
00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:39.809
score like that, color.

129
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.109
I'm sorry, type that's what I want.

130
00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.596
Monotone.

131
00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:50.970
Also I have an error so the stroke
was gonna copy that stroke color.

132
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.530
I should just copy all of these.

133
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.833
So stroke color you put whatever you want,

134
00:08:56.833 --> 00:09:00.380
just like some lavender color
that GPT gave me export.

135
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.765
And stroke was the thickness
of the line and this dot,

136
00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:09.300
just a radius of the circle on which
the dots are when you hover over them.

137
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.245
The bigger the number,
the bigger the circle.

138
00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:14.427
Active dot as in when
you're hovering over it.

139
00:09:18.952 --> 00:09:22.031
We want the x-axis and we want that
to be that key that I talked about.

140
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:24.168
I'm gonna put created at
instead of updated at.

141
00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:29.592
X-axis, data key CreatedAt like that,
and then the last one is a tooltip

142
00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:34.502
that you don't really need, but
I think if you hover over a point.

143
00:09:34.502 --> 00:09:40.337
It's really nice to see when you made
that entry and what your mood was or

144
00:09:40.337 --> 00:09:44.629
whatever other information
you want to put on that.

145
00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:49.800
But by default, the tooltip is gross
looking so I couldn't stand it.

146
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.164
I know we didn't do a lot of styling
in this one, but this was so

147
00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:53.770
bad I couldn't take it.

148
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.515
So, we're gonna make a custom Tooltip,
and the way we could do that is just do

149
00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:03.490
content like this and then we can pass in
a custom component for CustomTool tips.

150
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.630
So we'll make that one up here.

151
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.410
I'll just say CustomToolTip.

152
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.301
You can put more than one
component in the file if you want,

153
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:11.390
although I don't recommend it.

154
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.502
I think in this case it's fine seeing
how this component's never gonna be used

155
00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:18.730
anywhere else other than this chart.

156
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.870
But because it's not exported,
you probably couldn't test it.

157
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.490
But that's fine.

158
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.990
This thing takes in a couple things.

159
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.964
It takes in payload, I think.

160
00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:34.003
Label and something else

161
00:10:39.837 --> 00:10:42.914
Active, whether it's active or
not there we go yep.

162
00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:48.110
So for this one I mean,
it's subjective, it's just design.

163
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.110
So I'm just gonna return
basically kinda what I had before.

164
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.098
I'm actually probably just
gonna copy most of it.

165
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:02.701
Cuz it's mostly just design,
and I'll talk about it.

166
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:07.658
Yeah, so I'm only really
showing three things here I am

167
00:11:07.658 --> 00:11:12.908
going to be showing words that I
put like a little dot in the left,

168
00:11:12.908 --> 00:11:17.398
that's the color that since analysis,
you get back.

169
00:11:17.398 --> 00:11:19.874
I'm gonna put them,
dateLabel will configure that.

170
00:11:19.874 --> 00:11:22.795
So whatever date this is created,
and then I put the mood.

171
00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:25.739
So, it looks like I'm getting
back everything the analysis,

172
00:11:25.739 --> 00:11:28.847
I'll have to go back to our query to
make sure we get the analysis and

173
00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:31.860
not just a sentiment score,
like the whole thing.

174
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.470
So we'll do that.

175
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:40.056
And then for the analysis itself,
we can just get that from the payload.

176
00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:46.968
So I'll just say payload=, I'm sorry,

177
00:11:46.968 --> 00:11:53.042
analysis Analysis.

178
00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.460
There we go.

179
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.870
It goes payload, which is an array0.

180
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.490
I think the payload from that.

181
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.590
So that's the analysis.

182
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:08.344
I'm gonna format the date string
because it's just bad if you don't and

183
00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:10.430
this one's really easy.

184
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.190
You can just do dot to local string.

185
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.470
The label itself will be the x-axis label,
which in our case will be the CreatedAt.

186
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.100
So that'll be the create at time string,
make a new date out of it.

187
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.208
And then this is just me saying I want
to show the week, year, month, day,

188
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:28.380
hour and minute, and
it'll format that for me.

189
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:35.230
So we got our date label And I really
only want to do this if it's active.

190
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.650
So as you're hovering over it,
so I'll say if active.

191
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.841
Return this otherwise just return no,
don't show anything.

192
00:12:48.803 --> 00:12:54.476
Cool and now we can just go out here and

193
00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:57.771
say CustomToolTip.

194
00:12:57.771 --> 00:12:59.424
Like that.
Don't worry about this error.

195
00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:15.241
All right, have our HistoryChart.

196
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:18.260
All we need to do now is bring that in but
before, let's fix this.

197
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.089
So before I was only
selecting sentiment score,

198
00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:25.850
we're actually gonna select everything
now because we wanted everything.

199
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.215
After looking at what I
was doing in HistoryChart,

200
00:13:28.215 --> 00:13:29.920
I realized we needed everything.

201
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.070
We needed the mood, the color, right?

202
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.140
We needed the created app.

203
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.220
So we'll just select everything,
get rid of that.

204
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.770
Select, we have our analysis.

205
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.580
Now we can just bring that in.

206
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.110
So we'll just say, let's put a div here.

207
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.187
This will be like average sentiment.

208
00:13:52.908 --> 00:13:55.054
Average like that.

209
00:13:55.054 --> 00:13:59.330
I don't like putting white space in
here like this, cuz it's not guaranteed.

210
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.920
You might have a tool that like clears it.

211
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.088
So if you want to maintain white space,

212
00:14:04.088 --> 00:14:08.216
I just recommend like putting
it in the brackets and

213
00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:12.730
doing this, and
that way it will maintain white space.

214
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.230
So I'll do that and
then here's where the chart will go.

215
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:26.574
And that's just gonna take in
the data Which is the analysis.

216
00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:40.849
All right, let's see what we broke.

217
00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:43.453
Okay, so
I don't I know why it's not rendering,

218
00:14:43.453 --> 00:14:47.736
so I don't think it's rendering because
this thing doesn't have a height on it.

219
00:14:47.736 --> 00:14:54.950
Because it has a height of like full
100% and right now there's no height so

220
00:14:54.950 --> 00:15:01.091
I'll just put First you got to put
a height on this one, I believe.

221
00:15:01.091 --> 00:15:04.530
So let's say with full height full.

222
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.515
Start with that,
that doesn't do it and then down here,

223
00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:09.140
I could just do the same thing.

224
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.780
Let's see what happens.

225
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.180
Okay, here we go.

226
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:21.000
So this thing says can't render payloads.

227
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.630
Let's go take a look at what payload is.

228
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.850
That's what I thought it was, I guess not.

229
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.140
I think I know why.

230
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.995
It's because it only shows
a payload if it's active, so

231
00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:32.571
you gotta move that down to active.

232
00:15:40.498 --> 00:15:42.195
Okay, and there we go.

233
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:49.899
Okay, so it's backwards cuz,

234
00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:53.271
we want to sort this.

235
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:57.781
Yeah, so we wanna say orderBy,

236
00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:02.292
CreatedAt, and ascending, or

237
00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:06.312
yeah, sending there we go.

238
00:16:06.312 --> 00:16:12.070
There we go.
So he started off really bad, resigned.

239
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.060
That was the mood?

240
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.752
[LAUGH] I've never heard someone
describe what it was like I'm just

241
00:16:17.752 --> 00:16:19.439
resigned just over it.

242
00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:23.110
And then Contain and then, calm.

243
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.334
You can kind of see how that
pots over time, so he added,

244
00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:29.910
we go back ass some more.

245
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.770
So let's go have some more,
let's go ahead and do one here.

246
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:39.250
I will go back to try to achieve

247
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:44.512
like okay, this was cool but

248
00:16:44.512 --> 00:16:49.556
what happened this morning

249
00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:56.805
when you woke up creates a short entry.

250
00:17:01.772 --> 00:17:05.330
I woke up naturally,
without the need for my alarm.

251
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.078
&gt;&gt; This is a better character
arc than some films I've seen.

252
00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:08.850
&gt;&gt; Sometimes.

253
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:13.160
[LAUGH] I can be like, OK,
but what about your friends?

254
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.380
What did you do with your friends?

255
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.275
And then it gets crazy, I'm telling you.

256
00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:19.944
We'll find some stuff out.

257
00:17:19.944 --> 00:17:21.263
OK, let's do that.

258
00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:30.138
Today's dawn was a comfortable
talks like this is so funny, okay.

259
00:17:30.138 --> 00:17:34.631
Let's go back hey there we go,
so you can see his mood has

260
00:17:34.631 --> 00:17:39.040
definitely gone up to renew
from resigned to renewed.

261
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.055
That's progress that's
beautiful I love to see it
