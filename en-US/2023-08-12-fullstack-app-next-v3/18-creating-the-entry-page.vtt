00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.761
Let's work on the actual editor page in
which we go and create that experience

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:11.980
in which you can add journal entries to,
and edit them, and things like that.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.340
If you don't know this about me, I used to
have a startup that was a headless CMS.

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
I spent so much time working
on editors at this point.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.300
I know way too much about it.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.846
I have an overflow of information on
how text editors work in a browser.

7
00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.930
And we're gonna use the most simplest
approach and it's gonna be great.

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.390
So we're not gonna do nothing crazy.

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.210
So yeah, let's get started.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.280
The first thing we need to
do is create that route.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.302
So if you go into the journal folder,
make a new folder.

12
00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:49.821
All right, and then in this folder,
we're going to call it id.

13
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:51.454
Because we're navigating to /id.

14
00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:55.560
We don't know what the id is,
so it has to be dynamic.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.370
And then in here, we can do page.tsx,

16
00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:06.700
Very, very, very simple.

17
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.990
Then we'll just say EditorPage.

18
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.648
Or I guess you could
just call it EntryPage.

19
00:01:13.648 --> 00:01:17.879
That might be better, EntryPage.

20
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.260
There we go.

21
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.007
And then inside of the props here,
because it's in a dynamic route,

22
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:29.310
we should have params.

23
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.686
And then we can just return that div,
and then I'll just do params.id.

24
00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:39.920
I do params.id because
I've named the folder id.

25
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.857
If I named the folder anything else,

26
00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:47.794
it would be params.anythingelse.

27
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.673
Cool, so now when I click on this,
it actually goes somewhere.

28
00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:02.810
Which is really cool.

29
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.180
All right,
let me make another entry right quick.

30
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.111
Okay, yep.
And then when I click on New Entry,

31
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:11.121
it goes to the new entry as well,
so we're good there.

32
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.920
And there's the problem,
we should have three entries now.

33
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.330
I just made a new one, but
it's only showing two, right?

34
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.290
I'm gonna make a fourth one.

35
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.337
There's a fourth one.

36
00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:22.005
If I go back, it's still only showing two.

37
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:23.520
I'm gonna make a fifth one.

38
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.340
It's still only showing two.

39
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.090
If I refresh this, boom,
they show up, right?

40
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.620
So that's the problem that
I was trying to show.

41
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.250
We'll fix this problem later.

42
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.123
But for now, that's because, again,
fetching data on the server, updating

43
00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:44.650
data, creating data on the client,
they know nothing about each other.

44
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.750
They're not connected systems.

45
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.770
By default, you have to connect them.

46
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.900
So this page that's fetching from
the server doesn't know that

47
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.240
the database in which it
pulls from got changed.

48
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.729
So it doesn't know that
it needs to do anything.

49
00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.138
The quick way you could get around
this is just change the layout.

50
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:09.410
Well, no, you couldn't do it here.

51
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.525
No, there is no quick way.

52
00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:13.043
[LAUGH] I was gonna say you could
just change this into a template.

53
00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:16.380
But I forgot we're getting the data
in the page, not the layout.

54
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.571
So there really isn't a quick way
other than, I guess, changing.

55
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.480
No, there isn't a quick way.

56
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.729
It's gonna be the way that I
figured out is the quick way, but

57
00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.277
there is no other quick way.

58
00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:30.237
[LAUGH] You can't just change this to
a client and be like, done, right?

59
00:03:30.237 --> 00:03:33.730
You can't just be like,
got it, we're good now.

60
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.013
No, because then all this breaks.

61
00:03:35.013 --> 00:03:37.750
This breaks, this breaks.

62
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.829
You can forget about doing that.

63
00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.500
None of this is gonna work.

64
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.620
It's just dead now, so
it's not that simple, yeah.

65
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.090
&gt;&gt; A hypothetical way to do that, though,
would be to pull out those pieces that we

66
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.629
wanted to be rendered on the client
into separate components,

67
00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.194
give them to use client directive, and
then import them to this page component.

68
00:03:58.194 --> 00:03:59.310
Is that correct?

69
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.343
So that everything here would still be
server rendered, but then there would be

70
00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:07.130
those little kind of islands of
client rendered and client hydrated.

71
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.749
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you go down that approach,
what you would have to do is,

72
00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.982
basically, all of this would be server.

73
00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:14.528
All of this would be server.

74
00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:18.200
And then this part would be client.

75
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.230
So you go to make another component called
entries list or something like that.

76
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.200
That's a client component.

77
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.264
And then it fetches data on the client,
like in a use effect.

78
00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:32.530
I would just do a use effect and get all
the data, and then you can render that.

79
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.370
That would work, but
it won't look like this when you load it.

80
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.210
It won't look like that.

81
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.841
You will see this thing pop up,
this thing pop up, and

82
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.960
then these things will pop up afterwards.

83
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.400
And then the slower your connection,
the more dramatic that would be.

84
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.000
But then you can show loading
states if you wanted to.

85
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.450
So like I said,
there's never a right answer.

86
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.669
There's only trade-offs in software,
that's really it.

87
00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.610
It's just like, well,
what trade-off do you wanna deal with?

88
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.450
Nothing's perfect,
which one can you deal with?

89
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.480
Which one do you want to deal with?

90
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.712
That's basically it.

91
00:05:00.712 --> 00:05:03.589
I go for the one that's the easiest to do.

92
00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:08.220
And then I don't change anything,
so [LAUGH] that's basically it.

93
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.119
I don't move on from that.
