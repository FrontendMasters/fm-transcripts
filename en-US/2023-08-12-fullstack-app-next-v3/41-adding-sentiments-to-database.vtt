1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
Cool, so we got our sentiment score.

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:06.753
Now what we wanna do is go
to our history page and

3
00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:10.950
grab the sentiment score for
every single entry.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.464
For now, let's get every single entry.

5
00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.828
Eventually you probably wanna
do it like gimme last week's.

6
00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:19.256
Or however you wanna plot it,
there's really, it's up to you.

7
00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:22.447
So, we'll do that.

8
00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:25.706
Get data, async.

9
00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:33.126
And we need the user, so user =

10
00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:38.549
await getUser from clerkId, and

11
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:45.984
Analyses, that's the plural of analysis,
I'm pretty sure.

12
00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:49.632
[LAUGH] Equals, we want to do prisma here.

13
00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.107
So, all right, oops!

14
00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:55.152
Why did I do that?

15
00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:57.532
That's not what I wanted.

16
00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:05.201
So the prisma,analysis.findMany,

17
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.761
there we go.

18
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:10.051
So do find many where.

19
00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:14.709
Okay, let's go look at the schema.

20
00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:16.723
We probably,
we're gonna have an issue here, right?

21
00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:21.711
So, How do we know what analysis to get?

22
00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:25.044
And how do we get it?

23
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:28.797
We wanna get, let's say we wanna get
all the analysis for a certain user.

24
00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:34.825
What is the query that we have to run to
do that based off the analysis schema?

25
00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:38.894
&gt;&gt; You have to grab every entry and
then every-

26
00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:41.462
&gt;&gt; Just grab all entry where we

27
00:01:41.462 --> 00:01:43.141
have the clerId.

28
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:43.673
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

29
00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:44.804
you'd have to do that first, right?

30
00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.052
You'd have to say, gimme all
the entries for this user first, and

31
00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:50.731
then gimme all the analysis Ids for
all these entries.

32
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:52.956
That's gross, we're not doing that.

33
00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:55.064
&gt;&gt; Does prisma have a type of join?

34
00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:56.615
&gt;&gt; Does what?

35
00:01:56.615 --> 00:02:00.097
&gt;&gt; Does prisma have a type of join?

36
00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:03.264
&gt;&gt; They do, but
you have to have that relationship set up.

37
00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:09.332
So, we actually have to go back and
set up a relationship for all of these.

38
00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:14.111
So we need all of our analysis to know
about the user in which they belong to.

39
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:16.448
So, let's go back and do that.

40
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:18.487
And of course,
this is 100% gonna break our database.

41
00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:20.942
So we will probably be
dropping the database.

42
00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:23.828
And coming back and
adding new stuff, that's okay.

43
00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.710
I'll have ChatGPT write me out
some journal entries or something.

44
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.651
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's so

45
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.503
much better at it than me.

46
00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:31.554
Okay, so let's do that.

47
00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:35.434
So let's just say, cool,
userId, that's a string.

48
00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:37.995
And then you have user,
which is tied to user.

49
00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:45.086
And it's a relationship that
has a fields of userId and

50
00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:50.644
a reference of Id and undelete of cascade.

51
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:56.640
So we got that.

52
00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:04.628
And then we'll just, we'll have to
index this so we can actually use it.

53
00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:08.607
So, I guess the best way
we can do it is we could,

54
00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:13.792
I wonder if I put this here,
would I be able to use it by itself?

55
00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:18.015
I don't know,
I'm just gonna just say index userId.

56
00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:23.874
And then we've gotta go
back to the user side and

57
00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:27.092
add the the other side of
the relation on the user.

58
00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:31.989
So now a user also has analyses.

59
00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.236
Like that.

60
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:42.252
I'm gonna make that optional.

61
00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:44.160
Well, I guess that would be that.

62
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.095
What am I doing?

63
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:48.226
What, wait, go back, there we go.

64
00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:49.934
Maybe a bunch of analysis.

65
00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:54.818
Cool.

66
00:03:56.163 --> 00:04:03.226
Now, let's go ahead and watch what happens
when prisma says that you can't fix this.

67
00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.991
So, let's see.

68
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:10.936
It's gonna say, yeah,
you added this thing and it's required.

69
00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:13.677
And there's already three
analysis in your database.

70
00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:16.397
So this is just not possible to execute.

71
00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:20.292
But I'll do it if you're okay with me
just completely dropping the database.

72
00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:23.156
So I'm, yeah, go ahead and
drop the database.

73
00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.046
So, now we have nothing in our database.

74
00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:27.028
So I can't even log
into the app right now.

75
00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:31.728
So I got to just kinda go home.

76
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:37.248
And I'm going to clear all my stuff.

77
00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:41.191
Just moving on out, clear all my stuff.

78
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:45.043
Do that, do that.

79
00:04:46.493 --> 00:04:51.368
Okay, and I'm also gonna restart my app
because I did some database stuff and

80
00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:53.393
it won't be good if you don't.

81
00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.627
All right, so we got that.

82
00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:03.721
Give you all some time to do that.

83
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:08.925
I won't do anything other than
just logging in Hopefully,

84
00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:10.931
all this still works,
we haven't done it in a while.

85
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.560
[LAUGH] It still works.

86
00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:21.059
And we're back to where we started.

87
00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:28.585
So, I'm gonna go to ChatGPT,
and I'm gonna say.

88
00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:34.950
I got my unfortunate day one right here.

89
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.769
I'm just copy, this one was good.

90
00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.411
So, actually I made a happy one too.

91
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.964
So, just to even it out.

92
00:05:40.964 --> 00:05:42.786
So, to be fair.

93
00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:46.446
[LAUGH] What's funny is that this one
carried over from the previous one,

94
00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.833
it was the first sentence.

95
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.409
Today was a remarkable turnaround
from yesterday's debacle.

96
00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.771
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] When I saw that, I was like,

97
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.902
wait, this could be a story.

98
00:05:55.902 --> 00:05:57.749
I should just keep asking it
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

99
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.323
&gt;&gt; So what happened today?

100
00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:02.311
[LAUGH] Really?

101
00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:03.066
And what else?

102
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:06.242
[LAUGH] This is really, this is good.

103
00:06:06.242 --> 00:06:09.423
This is, I could turn this into a video.

104
00:06:09.423 --> 00:06:11.858
It's like a TV show,
every day I just generate a new one and

105
00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:12.822
make a video out of it.

106
00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:14.500
And you just tune in and see what happens.

107
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.335
You just don't know what's gonna happen,
it's hilarious.

108
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.450
Anyway, so we got that.

109
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.164
[LAUGH] I'll make a new entry here.

110
00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:27.408
Well, okay, what did we get?

111
00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:30.381
We got an error here.

112
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:36.328
500 for entry, what is this?

113
00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:37.545
Yeah, so we gotta go back.

114
00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:41.963
This makes sense, we need to go back and
add all this stuff.

115
00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:43.619
We gotta add the user now, right?

116
00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:49.774
We added the user to the to the analyze,
but we didn't add it in our query, right?

117
00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:54.440
So if we go back to where we're making
the analyze on the post request to

118
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.378
a new entry, we don't add the userId here.

119
00:06:57.378 --> 00:07:00.256
So we have to do that now.

120
00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:02.442
That makes sense, so we'll do that.

121
00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:05.294
And then we need to-
&gt;&gt; Sorry, where do you just go to do that?

122
00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:09.750
&gt;&gt; Sorry, yeah, so that will be
an API journal route.tss in the post

123
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.228
request on which we make a new entry.

124
00:07:12.228 --> 00:07:17.541
Inside the prisma.analysis.create,
you need to also parse in the userId.

125
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:23.472
Because now an analysis has to have
a userId on it, which is what just failed.

126
00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:25.006
&gt;&gt; Okay.

127
00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:27.110
&gt;&gt; I think that's everywhere
we need to add it.

128
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.338
We shouldn't have to add it on update
cuz it should already be there.

129
00:07:29.338 --> 00:07:31.899
Well, no,
that's wrong cuz we do an UPSERT.

130
00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.759
So we have to add it in UPSERT as well,
just in case.

131
00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.369
So we got to go into the UPSERT,
inside the create.

132
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:41.427
And do user.id as well here,
just in case that happens.

133
00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:50.657
Awesome.

134
00:07:52.457 --> 00:07:55.045
That should fix that.

135
00:07:57.116 --> 00:08:00.475
Yeah, I guess it did, it just did it.

136
00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:02.895
So, for this summer.

137
00:08:02.895 --> 00:08:04.025
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got this here.

138
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.660
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Let's see.

139
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.823
This is, why would we get this?

140
00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:16.834
I think this one just broke because
that one didn't have an analysis on it.

141
00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:19.552
So I think that's gonna
be the only broken one.

142
00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:22.969
But I think if I make another one,
it should be good.

143
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.102
Let's see.

144
00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:34.169
I don't know why that
takes forever sometimes.

145
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.458
We'll try that again.

146
00:08:39.697 --> 00:08:40.648
There we go.

147
00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:45.257
Yeah, so that one broke
because it created the entry

148
00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:49.358
within the analysis
query after that failed.

149
00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:51.382
So, the entry was there, but
it doesn't have an analysis.

150
00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:52.881
So that one is broken.

151
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:56.231
I'm gonna clean that one up in a minute.

152
00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.840
But, yeah.

153
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.486
&gt;&gt; My analysis just isn't working
somewhere under the hood.

154
00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:04.835
&gt;&gt; We'll put that in there.

155
00:09:09.564 --> 00:09:10.956
See what it's talking about.

156
00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:12.500
This thing's lagging behind.

157
00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:17.515
Cool, okay.

158
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.800
What are those days?

159
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.477
[LAUGH] My goodness!

160
00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:29.770
A day filled with miseries and trials,
but with a glimmer of hope for tomorrow.

161
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:36.734
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; My goodness!

162
00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:38.316
That is funny.

163
00:09:40.758 --> 00:09:42.447
Let's make another one.

164
00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.888
I'm gonna go grab the happy one.

165
00:09:44.888 --> 00:09:47.087
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] for temperature 0.

166
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.829
&gt;&gt; I know, well, no,.

167
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:50.971
Well, ChatGPT is not temperature 0.

168
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:53.541
Yeah, this one's something else.

169
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.688
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, find it now.

170
00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:01.479
&gt;&gt; Can you continue the thread for
the rest of the-

171
00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:02.039
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

172
00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:04.421
&gt;&gt; Entries, one more paragraph-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

173
00:10:04.421 --> 00:10:09.190
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; And what a remarkable turn around!

174
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.947
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

175
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.033
&gt;&gt; So good.

176
00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.466
We'll just do one more,
we'll just do one more.

177
00:10:18.466 --> 00:10:20.070
&gt;&gt; The first rays of dawn.

178
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.564
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; The cage of the sky was huge and warm.

179
00:10:23.564 --> 00:10:27.260
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll do one more here.

180
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.548
One more, one more.

181
00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:32.993
I'll just have it,
I'll just do another one, okay.

182
00:10:32.993 --> 00:10:35.566
Okay, this is great.

183
00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:40.749
What happened last night?

184
00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:45.132
Make a entry about

185
00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:49.517
that, be short.

186
00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:52.018
Aah, man!
I hope this is good.

187
00:10:53.572 --> 00:10:54.799
And calm.

188
00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.537
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

189
00:10:56.537 --> 00:10:57.192
&gt;&gt; Wow!

190
00:10:57.192 --> 00:11:00.375
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Wow!

191
00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:05.287
Okay, got it.

192
00:11:05.287 --> 00:11:07.360
You are just in your feelings.

193
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.964
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I get it.

194
00:11:13.034 --> 00:11:15.285
My goodness, okay.

195
00:11:16.657 --> 00:11:18.440
&gt;&gt; Maybe this is Drake's journal.

196
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.571
&gt;&gt; It's Drake's journal.

197
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:21.075
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's Drake's journal.

198
00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:22.307
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

199
00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.843
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

200
00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:27.599
Tranquil [LAUGH] tranquil.

201
00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:29.926
Wow, that's a, you know what?

202
00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:32.256
That color, it is pretty [INAUDIBLE].

203
00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:35.023
I don't know why, but
that's the right color right there.

204
00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.151
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; I don't know why but

205
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:37.801
they picked a really good color for that.

206
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:41.017
Retreating to my study
[LAUGH] found solace and

207
00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:43.987
surrendering to rest after a trying day.

208
00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:47.282
[LAUGH] My God!

209
00:11:47.282 --> 00:11:48.731
It's so good.

210
00:11:48.731 --> 00:11:50.838
Okay, I think we're good there.

211
00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:52.465
I do have to delete the other one,
otherwise,

212
00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:53.775
it's just gonna break everything.

213
00:11:53.775 --> 00:11:56.534
So I'm gonna go do that in prisma.

214
00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:01.070
Stop that and start it again.

215
00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:07.776
So hopefully, it's, it's this one.

216
00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:09.904
You can see it doesn't have 1,
it's grayed out.

217
00:12:09.904 --> 00:12:12.671
So, I'll delete that one.

218
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.859
Okay, cool, good there.
