WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
First thing first is we
should work on the home page.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.165
Let's actually just get
our routes figured out.

3
00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:09.697
What is the structure of our app?

4
00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.767
What are the routes gonna look like?

5
00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.498
How are you navigating to places and
things like that?

6
00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:16.768
So let's build out our routes,
that's kind of where I like to start.

7
00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:22.701
And then from there, what I'll like
to do is just go from page to page.

8
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:26.375
Sometimes I might get sidetracked,
where I'm like, this page has a feature,

9
00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.651
and that feature touches so
many parts of the app, so

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:30.290
you gotta go build those things out.

11
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.118
So I guess it's a death-first
approach to building an app.

12
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:38.235
I'll go to a page, and then I'll drill
down every single feature into that page

13
00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:39.894
before I go to the next page, and

14
00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:43.599
I'll drill down every feature on that
page before I go to the next page.

15
00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:47.340
That way, I'm not switching back and
forth between different features, and

16
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.957
I don't wanna leave anything
in an incomplete state.

17
00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:52.246
So that's kinda how I work
when I'm working solo.

18
00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:55.284
So that's what we'll probably do today.

19
00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:59.120
So let's get that structure going so
we know, like I said,

20
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.903
I have the reference here.

21
00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:04.585
On GitHub, we can kinda take a look
at all the routes that we have.

22
00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:09.309
It's actually really not that much,
so few routes here.

23
00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:12.325
We obviously have our index page,
which is just going to be page.tsx.

24
00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:16.244
That's gonna be our homepage, so
we'll be putting some stuff in there.

25
00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:18.551
Then we have these five other folders.

26
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:21.321
So this first folder is dashboard.

27
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:26.107
But if you put parentheses around
a folder in Next.js app router,

28
00:01:26.107 --> 00:01:29.877
this doesn't get added to
the segment in the route.

29
00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:33.330
So this won't actually be a new route,
it's just a way for

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.232
me to group pages together
that have similar UI.

31
00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:37.423
So we need to make that.

32
00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:40.016
We have our API,
we'll talk about that some other time.

33
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:44.175
We got this new-user thing here, and
this is actually just a hack around

34
00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:47.049
authentication, we'll
talk about that later.

35
00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.661
And then we also have these
two catch-all routes for

36
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:55.189
sign-in and sign-up that we'll
also use for authentication.

37
00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.215
So we'll just pretty much go in and
make these right quick, so let's do that.

38
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.342
So over here in my directory,
I'll make a new folder,

39
00:02:04.342 --> 00:02:07.053
dashboard with parentheses in it.

40
00:02:07.053 --> 00:02:07.667
So we have that.

41
00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:12.918
And then next to that,
I'm just gonna add my API.

42
00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:22.313
And another folder,
we're going to have new-user.

43
00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:35.455
And another one will be sign-up,
and another one would be sign-in.

44
00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.842
Not a file, but a folder.

45
00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:44.293
Cool, so we have all of our folders here.

46
00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:48.589
They don't really do anything
until we add a page.tsx to them.

47
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.795
So we can't really route
to them right now,

48
00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.552
but just so
you can visualize what's happening here.

49
00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:57.593
For now, let's just work on the homepage,
it's pretty simple, just some design here.

50
00:02:57.593 --> 00:03:01.001
And then we'll move on to
actually doing the dashboard,

51
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.199
getting user authentication,
and stuff like that.

52
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.171
So you can think of this as our warm-up,

53
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:08.789
just getting our fingers
ready on these components.

54
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.479
So this one's not too crazy, in fact, it
doesn't even have a lot of functionality,

55
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.260
but let's do it.

56
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.390
So basically, for this one,
just want to add a class name here, and

57
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.430
we're gonna be using Tailwind.

58
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.331
So I'm just gonna make this page full
screen vertically and horizontally.

59
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:30.350
So I can just say, w-screen and
h-screen, like that.

60
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.669
That's the same thing as
saying our width is 100% VW,

61
00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.178
view width, and height is 100 VH,
which is view height.

62
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:41.898
It's the same thing.

63
00:03:41.898 --> 00:03:47.445
So we got that, I'm just gonna put a
background of black on a dark theme there.

64
00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:51.819
We'll start from that,
and then what I'll do is,

65
00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.493
I'm actually just gonna make this a flex.

66
00:03:55.493 --> 00:03:59.851
So I'll say flex, and
then I'll say justify-center, and

67
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:04.138
then items, which is a line,
items-center, like that.

68
00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:11.951
And I'll just add a div for our content.

69
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:17.449
So inside our content, we'll just have an
h1 here, this is where our title will go.

70
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.192
And we'll have a paragraph here,
this is where our description will go.

71
00:04:22.192 --> 00:04:25.920
And then we'll have another
div here with a button in it,

72
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.337
and this is where our button will go.

73
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:37.884
Other thing you wanna do is just make
sure the text is white, like that,

74
00:04:37.884 --> 00:04:42.260
otherwise it'll be black and
we won't be able see the text.

75
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.090
Cool, so let's go check this
out wherever I put this.

76
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.404
Here we go, it's exactly what I wanted
to be centered in the middle of screen.

77
00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:57.892
Pretty easy, let's make this title bigger.

78
00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:04.392
So I can say className, give it a text of,
I don't know, 5xl, so that's huge.

79
00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:08.452
Actually, that's not even as huge as
I thought it was gonna be, [LAUGH] so

80
00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:10.259
I'm gonna make it even bigger.

81
00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:16.252
Yeah, 6xl for our title, and
I'll say, The best Journal,

82
00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.912
app for hardcore.

83
00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:26.340
No, just the best journal app, period.

84
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.386
We could just use ChatGPT to make this for
us.

85
00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:30.953
Honestly, that's what we should have did,
but

86
00:05:30.953 --> 00:05:33.153
we're gonna save the AI stuff for later.

87
00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:37.219
So best Journal app, period.

88
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.324
And then further description,

89
00:05:41.324 --> 00:05:46.645
this is the best app for
tracking your mood

90
00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:51.812
throughout, Your life.

91
00:05:51.812 --> 00:05:58.610
All you have to do is be, Honest.

92
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.696
[LAUGH] There you go.

93
00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:04.382
Cool, so we got that,
we'll make that a little bigger.

94
00:06:04.382 --> 00:06:07.568
So className,
maybe make that like a text of 2xl.

95
00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.553
That's good.

96
00:06:09.553 --> 00:06:16.308
And then make this one not as bright,
so we can say, text, and then white.

97
00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:20.640
And then we can do slash here for
opacity, and

98
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.754
I could make it a little, let's try 60.

99
00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:26.403
So that's 0.6 or 60%.

100
00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.372
There we go.

101
00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:30.775
The other thing we can do is that
I don't like how far left and

102
00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:32.149
right these things go.

103
00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:35.145
So what I'll do is,
you can put a container on it, but

104
00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.812
the containers already has set max widths,
and

105
00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:41.224
then you've got to go modify
the Tailwind config to do that.

106
00:06:41.224 --> 00:06:46.086
It's a little sloppy, so I'm just gonna do
my own container, and just do a max width.

107
00:06:46.086 --> 00:06:49.775
So on this div, that contains the content,

108
00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:54.574
I'll add a className here,
and I'll say width is full.

109
00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:58.279
So 100% but I'll put a max width.

110
00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.863
And let's pick a random number, right?

111
00:06:59.863 --> 00:07:06.349
I'll just say,
let's say a max width of 600 pixels.

112
00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:11.246
So when you put a square bracket around
a value like this and tell one class,

113
00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:16.066
this means I wanna add a custom value
instead of some hard coded values, or

114
00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:17.957
whatever value I want here.

115
00:07:17.957 --> 00:07:22.560
And then just to make sure it stays
centered, you can just say mx-auto,

116
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.556
which just stands for margin left,
margin right auto, so it stays centered.

117
00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:30.056
That will do that, and there we go.

118
00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:39.583
Cool, other thing is I don't
like how they're touching.

119
00:07:39.583 --> 00:07:42.859
So what's the margin bottom on these?

120
00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:46.662
A Margin bottom of 4 on that,

121
00:07:46.662 --> 00:07:52.596
another margin bottom on
the paragraph of 4 so

122
00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:55.806
they're not touching.

123
00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:57.950
There we go.

124
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.547
And then for the button, we'll just
make a little button right quick.

125
00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:10.328
We can just call this a background
of blue-600, like that.

126
00:08:10.328 --> 00:08:14.743
And we can add some padding of 4, and

127
00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:20.449
then we can say we want
it to be rounded corners.

128
00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:24.438
Let's make it a rounded large,

129
00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:29.174
and then we'll say font or text-lg.

130
00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:32.453
Actually, text-xl.

131
00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:34.713
There we go.

132
00:08:34.713 --> 00:08:42.113
And actually, I'm gonna change the padding
from 4 to px-4, and then py of 2.

133
00:08:42.113 --> 00:08:46.163
There we go, much better.

134
00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:48.699
And now you got a button, cool.

135
00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:51.912
Only thing we need to do is just
make this button go somewhere

136
00:08:51.912 --> 00:08:54.437
when you click something,
so let's do that.

137
00:08:54.437 --> 00:08:57.619
So I'll wrap this button in a link tag.

138
00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:03.113
So if I bring in the link
tag from next link, like so.

139
00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:06.993
Mine just auto import it if you're
wondering why I didn't go import it cuz

140
00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:09.446
it's did it for me, but
it's from next link.

141
00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:10.938
You've probably used it
before if you use Next.js.

142
00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:13.519
And then all you have to do
is just add a href here, and

143
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.005
then the path you wanna go to.

144
00:09:15.005 --> 00:09:18.896
In this case, when someone clicks get
started, we want them to go to /journal,

145
00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:20.288
which we haven't made yet.

146
00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.146
So obviously, it'll 404 if we click on it.

147
00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.743
And that's it.

148
00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:31.936
And we just made
award-winning landing page.

149
00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:38.299
So now if we click that,
goes a journal, we get 404.

150
00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:41.397
Cool, so the light work with
a Tailwind and a React.

151
00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:41.897
Okay,
