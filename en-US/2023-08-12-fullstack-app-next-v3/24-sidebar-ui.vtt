WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.169
So now we need to add the panel on
the right so we can get ready for

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.090
our sentiment stuff.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.900
So let's do that.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.980
We're going to do that
in the journal ID page.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.700
So right next to the editor.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.863
So what we can do is we can just
make this probably the easiest

7
00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:22.850
way is probably just to do a grid.

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.340
So we're gonna say grid.

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.794
And you can say this has like a columns,
or

10
00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:34.010
I'm sorry, grid calls of 3 like that.

11
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.340
You're at this editor and a div.

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.261
And we can say, you have a call span,

13
00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:46.140
Of 2 of that 3, basically.

14
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840
And then we can go down here and

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.637
we can say this is where
like the AI stuff will go.

16
00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:59.069
All right, so just some basic Tailwind and

17
00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.740
you can see it's already sectioned off for
us here.

18
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.240
Pretty good.

19
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.365
Let's just make a visual separation at

20
00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:14.670
a border left with
a border black of like 5.

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.750
I think that's the other
ones are like 10 I think.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.200
There we go.

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.509
So now we got that visual border there.

24
00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:28.330
Cool.

25
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.308
And then for the AI stuff,
we'll just try our best to,

26
00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:36.292
I don't know exactly what
I had on the last one, so

27
00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:40.380
I'm just gonna remake it cuz I
don't think it was that crazy.

28
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.480
If we had like a top panel at the top that
had the word analysis on it then that

29
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.750
would change colors.

30
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.760
So let's do that.

31
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.330
So this will be like the color one.

32
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.003
We'll just put a hard
coded color in here for

33
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:57.130
now give like a background of like
blue 300 something like that.

34
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.185
Give it some padding, so
PX of 6 maybe and a PY of 10 and

35
00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:11.150
so just say, analysis,
I'll just put a H2 in here.

36
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.045
Analysis, and
it'll look something like that.

37
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:27.190
The tricky thing with having the colors
change is that it could be any color and

38
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.610
some colors, depending on the color.

39
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.060
The text has to be black or white.

40
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.160
And cuz I don't know what color it'll be,
[LAUGH], it's always gonna look back.

41
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.140
There's a way around it.

42
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.820
I can force the AI to only
pick one of these colors, but

43
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.630
I didn't feel like doing that.

44
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.349
But you could totally do that.

45
00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.840
And in that way, yeah,
there's a way around it.

46
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.055
I mean, there's actually a tool that will
probably take a hexadecimal string and

47
00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:56.940
then tell you what color your text
should be in order for it to be legible.

48
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.215
I guarantee there's an NPM package for
that.

49
00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:06.470
We could probably use that to actually,
that'd be the best package.

50
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.456
If it bothers me, we'll do that.

51
00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:12.268
I'll just make the text
a little bigger here 2XL.

52
00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:16.100
So we have that, everything
after this is like a UL here, so

53
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.180
let's make a div, a UL in here.

54
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.050
And each one of these LI's
is gonna be something.

55
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.080
So I think we had, what do we have?

56
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.087
We have the subject,

57
00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:33.300
we had the mood, we had the summary.

58
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.100
And then we had whether it was negative or
not, right?

59
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.810
I think we had those.

60
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.494
Yeah, so this would be the subject so
I can say,

61
00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:49.890
guess the easiest way to do this,
it's just like make these a flex I guess.

62
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.561
I don't feel like writing
a bunch of LI's so

63
00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:54.150
I'm just gonna make
an array appear somewhere..

64
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.971
Because that's just annoying and

65
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:02.318
I'll just say analysis data it's
gonna be an array of objects and

66
00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:06.414
a name in this case we'll
have subject like this.

67
00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:12.397
And we'll just hard-code it we'll
just put an empty string here for

68
00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:17.570
now I got to turn this copilot
off I can't just do that.

69
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.960
It's going to, I just can't do it.

70
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.460
There we go.

71
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.744
So we've got the subject there, and

72
00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:29.650
then the value will just be a string for
now, and then we have the summary.

73
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.854
Actually, I think the summary is first,
yeah, and then subject, and

74
00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:40.001
then we have the mood and then we have,
whether it was negative or not.

75
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.023
Cool so we got the analysis data and

76
00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:55.449
then we'll just loop over them
with these allies down here.

77
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:04.448
So, analysis data.map, get the item,

78
00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:10.610
and let's just make an LI, like that.

79
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.048
And then, each one of these things in
the LI, I mean, I guess the easiest way to

80
00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:18.362
probably do this is just a flex,
so you can say class name.

81
00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:22.912
Flex align, I'm sorry,

82
00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:29.922
items-center, and then justify-between.

83
00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:33.261
So they're on far ends of each other.

84
00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:40.660
[COUGH] And then, in-between the LI we
can just do item we did two things.

85
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.429
So we'll say, let's make a span and
we'll say item.name.

86
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:51.378
And then the next one will be item.value.

87
00:05:52.926 --> 00:05:56.900
Let me change that to a word called
false and not a Boolean called false.

88
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.578
Save that and add a key so
it can shut up and

89
00:06:03.578 --> 00:06:07.180
I'll leave it for a minute.

90
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.800
I mean, it's really just us iterating over
an array of objects and making some LI's.

91
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.340
I do that a lot when I have like static
data, because I'd rather write an array

92
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.300
of objects than write 4 LI's,
I don't want to write this 4 times.

93
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.632
It's just terrible because them I'm like,
it's not styled correctly,

94
00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:29.950
I got to add some more classes.

95
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.265
You got to do that in 4 different places,
no.

96
00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:35.980
[LAUGH] Versus just doing this.

97
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.518
And obviously,
this data is gonna be dynamic anyway,

98
00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:41.346
we're gonna get this from the back end,
but for now, yeah.

99
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:55.512
If you like, took this a step further and
this is nothing to do what we're working

100
00:06:55.512 --> 00:06:58.043
on, but
you can have like a data-driven UI.

101
00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:02.340
Imagine taking some data and
using that data to describe a UI.

102
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.250
You can have a UI that looks different for
every single person.

103
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.364
Add some AI into that you can have AI
create a specific UI for a specific person

104
00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:13.880
based off like the things they watch, the
things they do, the questions they ask.

105
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.359
This is something that I had to
explore a lot when I was making a CMS,

106
00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:25.459
like, how do we allow people to
create whatever UI's they want,

107
00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:29.811
and it basically came down
to iterating over stuff.

108
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:31.046
Ok, cool we got that.

109
00:07:31.046 --> 00:07:36.715
Yeah I guess we wanna take
this div with this UL and

110
00:07:36.715 --> 00:07:42.540
not put it in the div with
a with a blue background.

111
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.230
We'll put it after I guess.

112
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.266
I'm just gonna do that.

113
00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:46.871
There we go.

114
00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:54.320
And guess we could just make these
things look a little better.

115
00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.139
So for the title here,
I could just say give me

116
00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:05.194
this like a text large, and then text,

117
00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:09.942
semi-bold, the font semi-bold,

118
00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:13.633
I don't know, we'll see.

119
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:20.840
I don't think that did anything.

120
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.970
&gt;&gt; It's fine.

121
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.600
&gt;&gt; It's fine?

122
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:24.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fine.

123
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.730
OK, font semi bold.

124
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.940
I guess we can add some padding to
this because it's kind of gross.

125
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.730
So PX of like 2, there we go.

126
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:42.473
And even some padding Y
as well let's do like 4.

127
00:08:42.473 --> 00:08:43.840
There we go.

128
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.784
And last thing would be
like a border bottom,

129
00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:56.830
border top with a border black of 10.

130
00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.060
Cool, all right.

131
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.580
Warm it up with some basic stuff here
to get those fingers juices going.

132
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.130
&gt;&gt; Did you throw the border?

133
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so threw the border on the LI.

134
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.541
So border bottom, border top,
and then border black, and

135
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:13.506
I did 10% opacity on the black.

136
00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:21.570
You can make yours look however you want.

137
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.740
The design part is subjective,
it's up to you, but

138
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.180
that's the information I'm putting here.

139
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.730
Okay, so let's get everything that we need
in order to have this analysis working.

140
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.422
So before we can do the AI stuff,

141
00:09:34.422 --> 00:09:38.350
we need to have somewhere where
this analysis is saved, right?

142
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.620
So let's go check out our schema.

143
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.360
That's where we save
things in our database.

144
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.240
So if you go here, We already have
it we have a model called analysis.

145
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.280
You can see we have mood.

146
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.120
We have summer we have
color we have negative.

147
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.403
What we need to do now is we need to
generate this analysis every time

148
00:09:56.403 --> 00:09:58.860
the journal entry is changed.

149
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.410
So when is the journal entry changed?

150
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.680
Well, I guess once when it's created and
then once again when it's updated.

151
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.218
So we need to go to those
two places in which

152
00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:12.264
we're creating a journal
entry on the backend and

153
00:10:12.264 --> 00:10:17.460
when we're updating a journal entry on
the backend and create a new analysis.

154
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.790
But before we could do that, we need to
find some way to generate this analysis.

155
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.832
So that's where the AI stuff comes in.
