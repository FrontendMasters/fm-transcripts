1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.015
All right, well, we have reached the end.

2
00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:07.129
I guess the last thing we can do is
just kinda wrap it up with our friend on

3
00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.084
ChatGPT, to see what he's talking about,
to see how his day went.

4
00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:16.105
Wait, it's literally,
the title is called Man's Unfortunate Day.

5
00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:17.557
Is that what they called it?

6
00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:21.049
[LAUGH] My God.

7
00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:24.423
Okay, thanks.

8
00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:30.453
So well,
[LAUGH] we're reaching the end here.

9
00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:37.327
Can you tell me how everything
has been for you so far?

10
00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:38.032
New entry.

11
00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:41.481
Let's see.

12
00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:48.467
Reflecting upon the rollercoaster
of the past few days.

13
00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.489
[LAUGH] Sense of gratitude and growth.

14
00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:57.977
&gt;&gt; Today's triumphs brought
a different kind of learning.

15
00:00:57.977 --> 00:01:02.975
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As an AI, I don't have
personal experiences, but in sharing and

16
00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.257
helping to process these
humans' experiences,

17
00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:10.493
I've hopefully provided a useful,
empathetic perspective.

18
00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:11.650
I love that.

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.064
That's a great journey for this AI.

20
00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:14.774
I love to see it.

21
00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:18.254
So, I guess with that, we will end here.

22
00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:23.355
The only thing I would say going forward
is just please just make more stuff.

23
00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:26.528
I was talking to my friend who's
currently learning to code right now.

24
00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:31.345
And it's taking him much longer
than he anticipated because he's

25
00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:36.432
stuck in this loop where he only
consumes and he doesn't make things.

26
00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:38.023
You need to help the combination, right?

27
00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:42.001
You can't just consume things and
not write code.

28
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.972
Cuz it makes sense on paper when you read
it and when you watch a video is like,

29
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:45.955
wow, that makes sense.

30
00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.529
I get it, yep, moving on.

31
00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:49.498
But then when I ask you to do it,
you can't,

32
00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:52.498
because that's the thing about
writing code, it's a skill set.

33
00:01:52.498 --> 00:01:55.690
It's not a fact in history that you
can just remember the date of and

34
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.714
recite it when you need to,
it's like shooting a basketball.

35
00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:01.491
You can watch a video of
Steph Curry shooting a basketball,

36
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:04.280
you can go look at the science and
the physics behind it all.

37
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.179
But until you go into the gym and
shoot the basketball a million times,

38
00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.766
you're not even gonna be close to it.

39
00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:10.135
That's the same thing with writing code.

40
00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.855
So, just write more code.

41
00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.395
If you feel like, man,
I don't know this, this is hard.

42
00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:17.513
Just write more code,
eventually it'll come.

43
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.771
Through the pain,
through the looking up the errors,

44
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.880
through the scrubbing back through
the videos and like, what did they do?

45
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.736
Just doing all of that more and
more and more, you will get better.

46
00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:32.195
So, that's just my only tip going forward,
and that's just with any technology.

47
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.679
That's basically what I
do to learn new things.

48
00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.064
And I've got to the point where I can
learn a language in a day or two,

49
00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:42.822
cuz I just go in, I'm like, a new language
function, function, function, function,

50
00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:46.347
a raise, a raise, a raise, loops,
loops, loops, loops, loops.

51
00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:47.799
And I just do it over and
over and over again.

52
00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.064
So I'm like, all right,
this feels good to me.

53
00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:55.506
I am 50% there, another week I'll be 80%,
in a month it will be normal for me,

54
00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:56.140
all right?

55
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.520
So just write more code, and
then you'll be killing it.

56
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.471
So that's all I got.

57
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.525
Thanks everybody for coming.

58
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.242
Hopefully you learned a lot about Next.js.

59
00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:07.854
You gotta pick into my mind in how I
build things, which can seem sporadic and

60
00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:08.707
random at times.

61
00:03:08.707 --> 00:03:11.246
Because I am, I am sporandic and random.

62
00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:13.546
But I always find a way somehow.

63
00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:17.271
But hopefully this inspired you to
go do some more things with Next.js,

64
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:18.685
maybe even some AI things.

65
00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:20.680
I highly recommend
checking out Link Chain.

66
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.351
There's tonnes of content on YouTube that
walks you through how to build agents and

67
00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:29.155
ingest things like PDFs, images,
JSON files, and websites, and

68
00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:30.573
build some crazy stuff.

69
00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:33.044
That's pretty much where
I learned everything.

70
00:03:33.044 --> 00:03:36.820
I also have a very active Discord,
so check out the Link Chain Discord.

71
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.076
And yeah,
looking forward to seeing what you all do.

72
00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:43.024
Hit me up on Twitter, it's the best
place to hit me up if you wanna talk.

73
00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:47.562
Other than that, thanks for coming

74
00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:51.051
