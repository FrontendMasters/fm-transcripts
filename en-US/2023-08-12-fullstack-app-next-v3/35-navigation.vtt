00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.946
We could do a nice little spinner here and
show some thing, but

2
00:00:02.946 --> 00:00:05.760
I'm not gonna add it cuz I wanna
focus on some of our AI stuff.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.992
We got two more AI features
I wanna get to and

4
00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:11.470
if you wanna see a spinner you can
look at the code I have them get up.

5
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.516
It's just like four lines of CSS, so.

6
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:22.958
Okay, let's get to the,
actually I do want to add some links

7
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:28.218
here on the left cuz it's bothered
me that I can't click on it.

8
00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:29.515
So that's what I'm gonna do.

9
00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:36.470
I'm gonna go to journal layout,
and we're gonna go to this aside.

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.340
I'm gonna drop some links in here.

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.958
So I'm gonna make some
links over at the top.

12
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.299
I'm gonna make some links for it's gonna
say href and that's gonna be that.

13
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:51.483
It's gonna be home and
then it's label as home and then,

14
00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:56.950
I'm gonna make one for
journal so we can go there.

15
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.880
Let's label this journal.

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.620
There we go, so much better.

17
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.050
And then in aside,
I'll just put the div here for mood.

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.450
That's our logo and then underneath here
it'll just be a ul with some li's in it.

19
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.715
So I'll just iterate over the links,

20
00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:24.850
grab a link Return an li.

21
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.889
As a link tag from next/link,

22
00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:36.642
put an href of link.href and

23
00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:41.230
the value is link.label.

24
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.415
Add the key here of link.href.

25
00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:47.314
There we go.

26
00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.757
I know this is gonna look janky, so
I'm just going to add some classes now.

27
00:01:55.757 --> 00:02:01.723
I already know it's gonna look bad,

28
00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:04.808
px of 2, py of 6.

29
00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:08.310
And text of xl.

30
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.511
That should be good enough.

31
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:16.670
It's still gonna look like crap but cool.

32
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.900
You don't have to add these
if you don't want to.

33
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.357
I'm just adding so I can actually click on
something without having to go to the URL

34
00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:23.464
and change the URL.

35
00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:24.480
It was bothering me
