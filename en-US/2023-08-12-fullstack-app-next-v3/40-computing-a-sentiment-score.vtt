00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.100
Now what we wanna do is we wanna create a
page that shows your history plotted over

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.880
time on the sentiment,
the score of your sentiment.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.110
So a few things that we have to
do in order for that to happen.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.574
First, we need to figure out what your
sentiment score is on a certain entry,

5
00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:17.070
which we're not,
we're not doing that right now.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.180
So we can go back and do that.

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.740
The next thing we need to do is figure
out, we gotta save that somewhere.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.210
So we gotta update the database so
we can save that.

9
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.930
And then the last thing is creating
a UI where we can plot that.

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.529
And then we also wanna calculate
your average sentiment,

11
00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:36.031
so you can understand how you've been.

12
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:40.590
Eventually, if you want it, you could
put that on a sliding time range.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.282
Pick a date range,
see how you felt within this date surface.

14
00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.003
You can even go further and be like, okay,

15
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.783
within this range show me certain
words that I use surface,

16
00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:55.840
common words that I use or understand
what I was saying in that moment in time.

17
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.360
You can get really deep [LAUGH]
to understand yourself,

18
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.947
as long as you're honest with
the stuff that you write.

19
00:01:04.594 --> 00:01:05.440
Okay, let's do that.

20
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.532
So first thing first, let's make
a new page inside of our dashboard,

21
00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:14.520
sibling to journal, and
that will be called history.

22
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.531
So I'll make a new folder called history
and inside that folder, make a page.tsx.

23
00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:28.570
And then history is just going
to be a page, a server function.

24
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.893
So we'll do that,
default History like that.

25
00:01:41.223 --> 00:01:43.600
Okay, that's it, nothing crazy.

26
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.289
Just a div.

27
00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.346
I'm just gonna add that to my links in my

28
00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:58.263
sidebar so I can actually click on it.

29
00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:01.387
There we go.

30
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.997
Okay, so now we should be able to go
to history and it shows us history.

31
00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:16.602
Okay, first things first
is we're gonna figure

32
00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:20.320
out how everybody knows what they are.

33
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.770
So let's think about it.

34
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.368
We could go down into AI and make some new
functionality, just to get the sentiment.

35
00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:32.026
But we know that we're
using this analyze function

36
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:36.610
every time an entry is saved and updated.

37
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.880
We can just add another property on our
schema to ask for a sentiment score.

38
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.190
And then we can save that.

39
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.790
So I think that's what I'll do.

40
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.015
So I'll go to our schema
in this parser here,

41
00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:54.562
and I'll just say, sentimentScore.

42
00:02:54.562 --> 00:03:02.971
And I'll say this is a z.number And
describe

43
00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:10.709
I do remember, I think this one
was a little struggling, so

44
00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.226
I'm probably gonna use
the one I used before.

45
00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:18.515
Which for this one, I described
it as sentiment of the text and

46
00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:23.715
rated on a scale from -10 to 10,
where -10 is extremely negative,

47
00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:27.119
0 is neutral, and
10 is extremely positive.

48
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.502
It actually took me, or
actually I asked GPT to write this for me.

49
00:03:32.502 --> 00:03:36.700
Because everyone that I wrote would
not give me what I was looking for.

50
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.550
It was like sometimes and not sometimes.

51
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.610
It was just,
this is not what I'm looking for.

52
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.336
So I was like, I told you, it's like,
this is what I'm trying to do,

53
00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:45.420
write me a prompt for this.

54
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.411
And it was like, cool, here you go.

55
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:47.697
And I just paste it in and it works.

56
00:03:47.697 --> 00:03:52.983
And I was like, dang, that's Meta [LAUGH].

57
00:03:56.392 --> 00:04:00.702
Cool, all right, so I'll paste that in.

58
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.521
Now we need to go update everywhere
we're doing this to account for it.

59
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:08.841
We were mostly doing spread
in most of the places, so

60
00:04:08.841 --> 00:04:11.300
we probably should be good in most places.

61
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.390
But let's just go double check.

62
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.990
We definitely got to update the schema for
sure.

63
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.830
But let's go check in the API calls.

64
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.320
Those two ones on the update and create.

65
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.730
Yep, we're spreading here.

66
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.840
So if it gets created we should be good.

67
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.420
If you want to update it,
it should be good.

68
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.650
And then on this one,
we're also doing spread.

69
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.350
So we should be good.

70
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.491
We shouldn't have to change anything
here cuz we're not manually adding any

71
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.605
properties, everything's spread.

72
00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:40.340
Are we returning it though,
from the parse?

73
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.301
So let's see.

74
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:45.960
Yeah, we're just returning the whole
thing, so that should be good too.

75
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.020
That's all we really gotta do
is just update our schema.

76
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.970
So we'll come down here, make a new one

77
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.893
called sentimentScore and
this will be a Float.

78
00:04:57.893 --> 00:05:02.837
If you do an integer it'll break
cuz you're gonna get back decimals.

79
00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:09.058
It's not gonna be whole numbers from -10
to 10, it'll be floats from -10 to 10.

80
00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:20.495
And I'm gonna add a default here so
our database doesn't freak out.

81
00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:23.854
So default, this is going to be 0,
as in neutral.

82
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.235
And then npx prisma db push should
be good cuz we added a default here.

83
00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:40.555
Good to go, I'm gonna stop my server,
start it again.
