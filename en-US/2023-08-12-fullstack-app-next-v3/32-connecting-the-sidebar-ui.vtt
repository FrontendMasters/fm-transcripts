00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:03.678
Let's work on bringing
all that down to the UI.

2
00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:06.760
And then we'll work on
the update of the autosave.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.237
So all right, this one's easy, right.

4
00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:14.163
So cuz it's a server component, so
all we have to do is go to this page,

5
00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:15.425
journal &gt; page.

6
00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:18.180
You see where we have getEntries.

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.679
Well we also just want to get
the analysis for this entry,

8
00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.980
we can do this in like
three lines of code.

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.010
We actually don't need to do
another query with prisma.

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.575
We can just say hey, for this entry we
can just do this thing called includes or

11
00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:40.229
include, and
we wanna include an analysis to be true.

12
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.407
So this will work for
the one that we just created, but

13
00:00:44.407 --> 00:00:47.873
the other ones won't have an analysis
because we didn't have an analysis for

14
00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:50.860
them cuz they were created
before we had analysis.

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.600
So I might go back and just delete those
from the database just so it works.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.295
But yeah, it'll work for the one I
just made cuz it has analysis, and

17
00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:00.558
any one going forward.

18
00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:02.161
Cool, so now we have that analysis.

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.850
All right, am I on the right page?

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.430
I'm on the wrong page, I'm sorry,
I need to go on the one that has ID on it.

21
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.030
I'm like, wait, why does it say entries?

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.670
You need to go to journal ID page,
that makes more sense.

23
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.599
Same thing though, underneath
where I just put include analysis.

24
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:27.926
This is like a join table in SQL or MySQL,
this is like a population in Mongo.

25
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.350
All right, and now,
We can just replace these values, right.

26
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.370
So we could just say cool,
this will be entry.

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.422
Actually let me just,
I'll just write them, nah,

28
00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:49.430
I don't feel like writing them out,
I'm gonna do structure.

29
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.885
That's just, I can't do it.

30
00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:56.526
[LAUGH] So we'll say mood, summary.

31
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.679
Can you stop capitalizing that please,
there we go.

32
00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.815
color, subject, and
then negative) = entry?.analysis.

33
00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:14.918
And now we just pass those in here, so

34
00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:20.965
this will be summary,
this will be subjects,

35
00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:26.565
this will be mood, and this will be color.

36
00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:31.268
And then I guess the other one
that I didn't add was, let me see.

37
00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:32.887
Mood, subject, summary.

38
00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:37.110
&gt;&gt; Is negative color?
&gt;&gt; Negative, yeah,

39
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.870
I don't know why I did that.

40
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.402
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm like, what?

41
00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:43.905
Negative and then color.

42
00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:50.454
Yeah, I guess color goes down here,
right, color is bound to this.

43
00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:55.761
Where is that, right here,
it's bound to this, right.

44
00:02:55.761 --> 00:03:01.327
So you basically just get
rid of this CSS class.

45
00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:05.573
And then you add a style tag I
need to say backgroundColor, and

46
00:03:05.573 --> 00:03:07.707
then you would just say color.

47
00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:13.148
Cool, I'll save that.
This thing's just freaking out cuz

48
00:03:13.148 --> 00:03:15.024
it's off sype script.

49
00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:18.671
So hopefully we're good here,
let's see what happens, boom.

50
00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:22.840
Looks good.

51
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.062
So the only one that's messed
up is the negative one, and

52
00:03:25.062 --> 00:03:27.068
that's because it's trying
to render a boolean.

53
00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:33.159
So you'll just say like, if it is negative
put the word true, or false if it's not.

54
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.159
Or I'm sorry, yeah, that way, yeah.

55
00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.867
So if it is negative, negative is true,

56
00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:42.460
otherwise it's false,
as a string and it'll show.

57
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.670
Cool, pretty awesome.

58
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.841
So right now obviously when we update this
it's not going to update in real time

59
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:59.525
because we didn't go back and add that
analysis function on the update API call.

60
00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:01.488
But we'll do that after
after we come back.
