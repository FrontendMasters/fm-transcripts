00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:04.647
Now, let's turn this into an editor,
cuz right now, it's not, it's just a div.

2
00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:09.523
There are a million
ways to make an editor.

3
00:00:09.523 --> 00:00:10.698
We're gonna pick the easy way.

4
00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:15.857
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna make another div in here, and

5
00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:24.178
I'm gonna give this a className of,
Let me see, how do I wanna do this?

6
00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:31.447
Actually, I'm gonna give the root
div a className of w-full.

7
00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:35.816
All right, full, which probably, I don't
know if this does anything because I don't

8
00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:39.729
remember if this thing, yeah, we don't
do anything here, we'll get to it.

9
00:00:40.947 --> 00:00:46.960
So we'll do that, and then inside of here,
I'm just gonna make a textarea.

10
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.760
I know the original text editor.

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.407
[LAUGH] I'm gonna give it a value,

12
00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:58.806
the value is just going to be something
that we need to keep track of.

13
00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:00.166
So let's make some state.

14
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:06.965
So we'll just say, value and
then setValue = useState,

15
00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:12.377
and we'll make sure that
the default state for

16
00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:16.419
this is gonna be entry.content.

17
00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:21.484
So when it loads up,

18
00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:25.022
the value of the textarea will
be whatever the entry value was.

19
00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:28.365
So then we just pass value here, like so.

20
00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:34.211
And then onChange.

21
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.920
Yep, just to setValue,
so we could just say,

22
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.958
set that value to e.target.value.

23
00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.484
There we go, cool.

24
00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:57.686
And then just make this thing bigger,
so I'll give it a className,

25
00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:06.622
w-full h-full, give it some

26
00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:12.115
padding of 8, and text-xl.

27
00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:19.382
And then in this page,
I just wanna make sure this is also full.

28
00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:26.721
I'll go back to the editors,
you wanna see that.

29
00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:34.306
So nothing crazy here,
just a standard input.

30
00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:38.132
Just binding the value in
the onChange to a hook.

31
00:02:38.132 --> 00:02:40.936
The only thing different that you probably
aren't used to is just setting that hook.

32
00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:45.902
Usually, you'd probably use
something like that, right, or null,

33
00:02:45.902 --> 00:02:47.650
or something like that.

34
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.227
Remember, this is the initial value.

35
00:02:50.227 --> 00:02:52.826
Once you change it,
it's not gonna be this anymore.

36
00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:55.805
It's the initial value, and
it doesn't reset back to this, so

37
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:57.249
it's not the starting value.

38
00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.836
It's literally the first time it renders,
this will be the value, and

39
00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:04.522
never again until it re-renders again.

40
00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:09.814
But by the time it re-renders again,
if we do it right with the save logic,

41
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:14.274
that will also be different, but
we'll get into that as well.

42
00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:20.774
Okay, let's see what we got.

43
00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:24.261
Didn't break, so there we go.

44
00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:29.955
Looks good, looks good here,
so we can type some stuff.

45
00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:30.844
But it's not gonna do anything, right?

46
00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.365
If I refresh this,
it's just gonna go back.

47
00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:33.092
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't save yet.

48
00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:37.218
&gt;&gt; Right, so
it's the best text editor you can get.

49
00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.268
Yeah, so
we got a nice clean text editor here.

50
00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:44.587
Honestly, the outline is bother me,
I can't take it.

51
00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:47.446
I really need to do something about that.

52
00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:50.335
Please get rid of that, thank you.
