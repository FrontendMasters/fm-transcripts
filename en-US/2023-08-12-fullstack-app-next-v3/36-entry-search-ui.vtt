1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.172
So what we wanna do now is we wanna add
in a search bar right here where we can

2
00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:05.310
ask questions about our journals and
do things.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.932
So let's talk about
the architecture behind that,

4
00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:13.966
some of the AI stuff that we need, and
then also the UI stuff that we need.

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.869
So it's a search bar, so
people's typing into something, and

6
00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.441
then they're clicking a button.

7
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.872
If you've known Next.js 13,

8
00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:22.335
you can use server actions to
submit forms to the server.

9
00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:29.177
So we could do that, but I wanna show
the response after you submit that form.

10
00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:30.844
You can also do that with a server action.

11
00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:33.388
I just don't like how you have to do it.

12
00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:37.333
So I'm gonna use client-side component for
that, because it's just easier to do that.

13
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.234
So let's do that.

14
00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:41.555
We're gonna make a client component here.

15
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:45.204
I'm gonna call it question,
so you can ask a question

16
00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:58.667
And it's gonna be pretty simple,
it's just a form,

17
00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.422
doesn't really take any args,
it's a client component.

18
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:07.629
Sort of returning a form here.

19
00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:19.021
And yeah, we have the input, and

20
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:25.580
has a place holder that says,
Ask a question.

21
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.099
We got that, we have a button
here that just says Ask, and

22
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.555
then we just need some states.

23
00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.860
So we'll say value and setValue,

24
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.764
because you state default to a string.

25
00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:50.392
Bind that value to the input
like it typically would do,

26
00:01:50.392 --> 00:01:53.819
and that will make up on change handler.

27
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.814
So onChange, I'm just gonna get the event

28
00:01:58.814 --> 00:02:03.268
object and event.preventDefault.

29
00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:09.296
Stop the form from reloading the whole
page when it submits to a server,

30
00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.017
and then we'll do things here.

31
00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:19.170
Lastly, just to add in the onChange
handler to the function.

32
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.214
Of course, I want this to look good,
so I'm gonna add a class name.

33
00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:33.005
I'm going to give this a border, and

34
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.876
then a border-blak of 20.

35
00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:42.532
I'm gonna give it a px of 8, or,

36
00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:48.390
I'm sorry, 4, py of 6, font or

37
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.253
text of large, rounded of large.

38
00:02:54.253 --> 00:02:56.456
Should be good enough.

39
00:02:56.456 --> 00:03:01.244
And for the button, This has to be

40
00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:05.273
type=submit, so we can hit Enter.

41
00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:10.890
So I have a class name of background.

42
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.144
I don't know, pick a color, blue-400.

43
00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:22.835
We'll also have some padding
on the left and right of 2 or

44
00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:27.535
actually more on that,
4 and then 2 on the y.

45
00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:33.999
It's also rounded of large and

46
00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.722
texts, we'll make it

47
00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:44.199
the same of large, cool.

48
00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:51.567
&gt;&gt; Need a C in the className on line 2,
a slack.

49
00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:52.548
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

50
00:03:57.307 --> 00:04:03.677
All right, and
let's bring that into our layout.

51
00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:07.556
We'll just do it, no,
it's not layout, where is it?

52
00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:08.714
It's this page.

53
00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:12.631
So the journal page/journal/page.ts,

54
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:19.524
we'll just drop it right here after our
h2, before our grid with the cards.

55
00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:24.147
Let's put a new div here,
and let's bring in question.

56
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:33.722
Let's add some margin to the div,
my, drop like 8.

57
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.146
And you'll get this ugly looking form.

58
00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:51.084
Probably went a little crazy on
the padding, it's a little bit.

59
00:04:51.084 --> 00:04:52.341
&gt;&gt; The button is so cute.

60
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:53.451
&gt;&gt; The button's cute, yeah.

61
00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:55.043
&gt;&gt; Yes.

62
00:04:55.043 --> 00:04:56.792
&gt;&gt; I might pull that
padding back a little bit.

63
00:04:56.792 --> 00:05:00.053
Just keep it real a little bit.

64
00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:02.633
There we go, that's a little better.

65
00:05:05.434 --> 00:05:12.343
Cool, you can make this full width too,
but it's fine for me right now.

66
00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:18.745
&gt;&gt; Before you leave this, you wanna
move your onChanged to the form submit.

67
00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.049
&gt;&gt; That's right.

68
00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:23.245
Yeah, I'm like, man,
I've been doing server actions too long.

69
00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:26.537
There we go, that makes way more sense.

70
00:05:26.537 --> 00:05:29.550
I'm like, what is going on here?

71
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.943
I'm just rename this,
That's still gonna stay onChange,

72
00:05:35.943 --> 00:05:36.994
we just need to handle submit.

73
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:40.403
There we go.

74
00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:44.420
I'm like, what?

75
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.397
handleSubmits, and
that's a preventDefault.

76
00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:57.724
I guess that's the benefit of server
components or server actions.

77
00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:07.356
And I guess for this onChange in here,
it's just setValue, e.target.value.

78
00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:17.061
&gt;&gt; And if it were a server action,

79
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.771
you would just swap out the on submit
online 17 first action, right?

80
00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:24.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it was a server action,
I wouldn't even need to bind a value or

81
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.415
onChange to input.

82
00:06:25.415 --> 00:06:28.985
These would just go,
I wouldn't need a state, and

83
00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:34.475
I would just have an action here, and
that would call a function on the server.

84
00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:39.507
Yeah, I just haven't written a client-side
form other than this curriculum so

85
00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:42.172
long that's been deep in server actions.
