WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.870
Well, so if you think about it,
we can start working on the dashboard part

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.819
that brings in all the journal entries and
things like that.

3
00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:14.220
But because the journal entries and stuff
that are gonna be scoped towards the user,

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.950
that means we would either have to just
make a bunch of mock data right now.

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.650
And then we have to delete it
later to bring in the real data or

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.738
we can just start using the real
data right now, hook up a database.

7
00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:27.543
But if we do that, that means we
need a user, and if we need a user,

8
00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:29.131
that means we need authentication.

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:31.305
So this is where I'm just
gonna work on authentication.

10
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.498
So let's just get
authentication out the way.

11
00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:36.721
And typically,
authentication is just so hard to do,

12
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.883
it's honestly a drag if you
try to build it yourself.

13
00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:43.595
But we're gonna use a really cool
service that makes it super easy.

14
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:47.648
I'm now in the boat of never rolling your
own authentication any more unless you

15
00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.039
have a really good reason or

16
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.124
you have the best authentication
engineers on the planet for

17
00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:55.601
some reason at your company, and
that's just what they like to do.

18
00:00:55.601 --> 00:01:00.042
Other than that, I think you shouldn't
roll your own auth going forward because

19
00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:01.947
who wants to be a security expert?

20
00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.994
So, we're gonna use
a service called Clerk,

21
00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:10.401
I don't know if anybody's ever heard of
Clerk, but it's actually pretty dope.

22
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:11.912
So let's go there.

23
00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:12.930
So if you go to clerk.

24
00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:20.590
.dev, it's by far probably one
of the best services I've seen,

25
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.633
and I've tried them all
out in the last few years.

26
00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.331
It kind of reminds me of Auth0
in the early days, but even

27
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.266
still better than that, Auth0 still took
like, I don't know, an hour to set up,

28
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.781
this literally takes five minutes or
less to set up, it's kind of crazy.

29
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:37.929
So, what we wanna do here is you wanna
go make an account on Clerk, it's free,

30
00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.185
you don't need a credit card.

31
00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:42.856
You don't need anything to get started,
you literally don't need anything,

32
00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:44.517
you just need an account to sign up.

33
00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.297
That's literally it.

34
00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:49.851
So I guess, let me see if I can make a new
account to go through the whole flow.

35
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.330
Yeah, that's what I do, so you can
see I already have some stuff here.

36
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.733
So once you make an account, you'll see
this right here that says Add application,

37
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:57.663
just click that,

38
00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:01.526
click Add application, and it's just
gonna walk you through this form.

39
00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:02.238
So let's do that.

40
00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.864
I'll just say Mood v2 since
it's my second one and

41
00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:11.024
then here you can kind of pick what
authentication strategies you want.

42
00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:15.653
So, you want people to sign up with email,
you want people to sign up with Google.

43
00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:22.349
You want people to sign up with their Xero
[LAUGH] account or their HubSpot account,

44
00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.020
you can do that too,
you can switch on whatever you want.

45
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.778
The cool thing is,
if you use one of these third-party or

46
00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:34.379
one of these SSL ones like Google,
these social ones,

47
00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.944
you don't need to go configure your
own app right now to get started.

48
00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:42.252
You don't have to go on Google and
configure your own OAuth app,

49
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:43.977
you'll just use theirs for now.

50
00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:47.986
In production, you definitely probably
wanna configure your own, so when someone

51
00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:51.666
gets the Oauth Moto, it shows your app and
not whatever they're gonna show.

52
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.794
But you don't have to do that right now,
it's literally free.

53
00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:58.549
So I'm gonna keep e-mail on,
I'm gonna keep Google on, and

54
00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.527
then I'm just gonna click
Create Application.

55
00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:04.252
And this is a preview of what the form
will look like, if you use their form,

56
00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:05.223
this is what you'll see.

57
00:03:05.223 --> 00:03:08.158
So if you can see if I
turn on the phone number,

58
00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:12.117
it says use phone either
username Facebook ads, Facebook.

59
00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:12.889
That's pretty cool.

60
00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.190
So I was gonna do Google and email, I'm
gonna create, click Create Application.

61
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.837
And then what you can see here just make
sure you have next year selected which by

62
00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:23.060
default it already does.

63
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.461
Because I don't know if he knows we're
doing this or just as soon as everyone's

64
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:29.891
gonna actually ask because it's probably
the best react framework out there.

65
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:35.632
But make sure you have that and then
copy these environment variables here.

66
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:39.164
So copies environment
variables here .env.local.

67
00:03:39.164 --> 00:03:42.820
And then what we'll do is go into our app,
we'll make a new file.

68
00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:48.481
Called .env.local.

69
00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.549
And we'll just paste that stuff in.

70
00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.438
So the difference between env.local
file and a regular env file,

71
00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.638
it's just really what
Next.js's conventions are.

72
00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:02.975
If it sees an env.local file, it'll
automatically load those environment and

73
00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:05.220
variables into the environment for you.

74
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.381
Whereas if the .env file, I don't know if
it loads that up automatically for you,

75
00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:13.185
I think you would have to load that up
yourself using something like the .env

76
00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:14.923
package that you have to install.

77
00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:16.134
So that's the difference.

78
00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:20.479
We'll probably use both because one of the
other tools that we use will automatically

79
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.759
load up the .env file for the databases,
so we'll use both of them most likely, but

80
00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.107
just know that that's why that's here,
it's for that reason.

81
00:04:28.107 --> 00:04:32.885
Okay, so once we have that, I'm just gonna
show you preview of what the docs are so

82
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:36.581
you kinda know what it looks like and
how to get started with it.

83
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:37.977
But we are using Next.js 13, so

84
00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:40.345
make sure when you're looking
at this that you are aware.

85
00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:43.383
But the first thing we wanna do
is just install the clerk/nextjs.

86
00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.149
So let's do that.

87
00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:48.022
So I'm gonna head back to my app,
I'm gonna keep it running,

88
00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:50.030
I was gonna open up a new
tab in my terminal.

89
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.333
I was gonna say npm,
I'm just gonna actually paste

90
00:04:55.333 --> 00:05:00.277
what I copied, npm install @clerk/nextjs.

91
00:05:00.277 --> 00:05:01.639
Let that thing install.

92
00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.698
And really, there's only a few things
we need to do, one, we need to

93
00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:12.223
set up the provider for our entire app,
we'll do that in our route layout.

94
00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:16.765
The other thing we need to do is we need
to set up the sign-up and sign in pages.

95
00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:21.033
And then the last thing we need to do is
protect any route that we want to protect.

96
00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:22.164
And then we're done.

97
00:05:22.164 --> 00:05:26.588
That's it, everything else from there is
just using any helper functions you wanna

98
00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:31.072
use to check to see if a user's logged in
programmatically, like when you're making

99
00:05:31.072 --> 00:05:35.269
an API call, or you're doing a server
action, or some server site data fetch.

100
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:36.631
So it's actually quite simple.

101
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:43.544
So, let's just do the setup for
the provider.

102
00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:46.665
You only have to import the Clerk provider
here and wrap it around your route,

103
00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:47.926
it's actually quite simple.

104
00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:53.214
So if we go to our route layout,
which should be in app layout,

105
00:05:53.214 --> 00:06:00.267
you can import from @clerk/nextjs, and
you can get the Clerk provider like so.

106
00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:03.340
And just wrap it around the HTML here,

107
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.350
you don't need to pass any props to it,
it's pretty simple.

108
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.532
The reason you don't have to pass any
props because it's just gonna read

109
00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:15.251
those environment variables that we added,
so you don't need to pass it anything.

110
00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:19.917
Okay.

111
00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:25.350
The next thing we wanna do is just.

112
00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.256
What did you say?

113
00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:28.532
&gt;&gt; Could you share that
import statement again?

114
00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:29.855
&gt;&gt; This one?
Yeah, here you go.

115
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:33.313
Yeah, question?

116
00:06:33.313 --> 00:06:37.888
&gt;&gt; Are you using a VS Code plug in for
that tailwind autocomplete?

117
00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:39.734
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I forgot I had that.

118
00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:41.994
Yeah, I have a VS Code plug in for that.

119
00:06:41.994 --> 00:06:43.191
Let me see.

120
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.321
What was it called?

121
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.450
It is called tailwind and
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.

122
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.162
Yeah, it gives you autocomplete for
Tailwind.

123
00:06:55.162 --> 00:06:59.920
I also think when you hit Save,
it will shift the order of the classes,

124
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.841
cuz some classes in Tailwind,
if you put them after another class, work

125
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:10.426
differently, so it will put them in the
right order to get the expected behavior.

126
00:07:10.426 --> 00:07:13.742
But yeah, it's mostly just for the auto
complete, you get some linting too.

127
00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:15.659
So yeah, I am using that.

128
00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.973
It doesn't work all the time though,
sometimes you have to do weird stuff too.

129
00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:23.081
Like instance, if I start adding
a class name here or something,

130
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:24.446
it won't work all the time.

131
00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:27.858
So if I say text,
you can see right there it's not working.

132
00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:31.835
But then you kind of start over and
do it again, then it will, so

133
00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:33.424
it kind of just depends.

134
00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:37.230
&gt;&gt; If you didn't select Typescript,
can you just make the files JSX?

135
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.755
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you didn't select Typescript,
you can do JSX, and that's totally fine.

136
00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:43.079
You don't have to use Typescript for
any of this stuff,

137
00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:45.701
I'm just using TypeScript so
people who want to use TypeScript

138
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:48.035
can see an example of what
it's like to use TypeScript.

139
00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:56.102
&gt;&gt; Does wrapping the route layout with
a provider make it a client component?

140
00:07:56.102 --> 00:07:58.276
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

141
00:07:58.276 --> 00:08:03.917
If you were to take a provider that
was made before server components were

142
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:10.296
created, that provider would not work by
default because it would be using client

143
00:08:10.296 --> 00:08:16.042
side, things like Hooks use provider or
use context and stuff like that.

144
00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:18.020
But Clerk is on top of things and

145
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.974
they've been literally updating their
SDKs since Next.js 13 came out and

146
00:08:22.974 --> 00:08:27.181
they have made sure their provider
works for server components.

147
00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:32.691
They follow the guide on the Next.js
documentation on how to use providers,

148
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:33.803
which is here.

149
00:08:36.192 --> 00:08:43.459
Let's see, somewhere in here,
here we go, providers.

150
00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:46.917
So they basically follow
this guy to make sure

151
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:51.471
that their providers work in layouts and
things like that.

152
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:54.247
Whereas by default,
you're right, they wouldn't work.

153
00:08:54.247 --> 00:08:58.664
But to answer your question more broadly,
nothing is gonna transform your component

154
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:02.360
to a client component other than
putting the word use client at the top.

155
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.634
This is not automatically gonna
turn into a client component,

156
00:09:05.634 --> 00:09:07.794
you literally have to put that at the top,

157
00:09:07.794 --> 00:09:11.891
otherwise you'll just get an error saying
this should be a client component.

158
00:09:11.891 --> 00:09:15.180
Please put this at the top,
please put use client at the top.

159
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.711
But yeah,

160
00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:19.791
it will never just automatically change
your component to be client from server.

161
00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:25.451
Cool, any other questions?

162
00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:35.267
&gt;&gt; There's some debate around
Tailwind CSS in the chat.

163
00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:40.091
&gt;&gt; I'm happy to enter that debate because
I just came around to Tailwind less than

164
00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:43.542
a year ago, I had this
conversation in the last course.

165
00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:48.346
I think when it comes down to just like
if you're already gonna write your

166
00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:51.987
own CSS from scratch,
you might as well use Tailwind.

167
00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:54.501
If you don't plan on writing
your own CSS from scratch,

168
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:56.870
there's probably better
alternatives out there.

169
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.433
Find a component library
that's already styled, and

170
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.784
then use the props on that
to change those styles.

171
00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:03.442
That's probably a lot better.

172
00:10:03.442 --> 00:10:05.513
But I'm now in this point where I'm so

173
00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:07.924
opinionated with how I
like things to look.

174
00:10:07.924 --> 00:10:11.950
I would rather use a component library
that's headless that has no style

175
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.118
affiliated with it whatsoever,
only functionality and

176
00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:16.838
then use Tailwind to style it.

177
00:10:16.838 --> 00:10:21.726
And then the only thing I'm fighting
with is configuring Tailwind which I've

178
00:10:21.726 --> 00:10:25.592
read a fight with that than write
my own CSS from scratch, so.

179
00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:28.371
&gt;&gt; There are some pretty
exciting component libraries

180
00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:30.966
coming out that leverage Tailwind as well,
so.

181
00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:32.283
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is getting better now.

182
00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:36.900
There are some component libs that
use Tailwind, so I just think, yeah,

183
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.398
Tailwind as a utility.

184
00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:42.199
If you think of Tailwind as
like a recipe to some meal,

185
00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:46.603
like this component library use tailwind,
I think is great.

186
00:10:46.603 --> 00:10:50.332
But yeah, I think using tailwind just
raw by itself, it can feel like,

187
00:10:50.332 --> 00:10:51.401
why am I doing this?

188
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:55.805
I don't wanna do this, but it's not
that bad specifically because they make

189
00:10:55.805 --> 00:11:00.549
the class names sound very similar to the
functionality and what you're using, so

190
00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:02.673
you can kinda learn it really quick.

191
00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:04.463
And even then you don't really
need to learn everything.

192
00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:08.155
I keep this tab open,
that's the component one, but

193
00:11:08.155 --> 00:11:12.598
I keep the other Tailwind tab open,
actually open it right now.

194
00:11:12.598 --> 00:11:16.138
Because I don't remember all this stuff,
but it's so easy to look up,

195
00:11:16.138 --> 00:11:17.622
I know what I'm trying to do.

196
00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:19.979
If I'm like, I need a border,
I know that if I go here,

197
00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.262
it's gonna show me how to do it.

198
00:11:21.262 --> 00:11:24.873
I just go straight down to this one
example I look at every single time, and

199
00:11:24.873 --> 00:11:27.333
I grab it, and I'm done,
cuz it's very simple.

200
00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.702
It's not something you need to be
great at, the documentation is good,

201
00:11:30.702 --> 00:11:34.366
you just need to know what you need to do,
and then you're probably good to go.

202
00:11:34.366 --> 00:11:39.280
This is really cool because it's gonna
leverage the catch-all routing system that

203
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.186
Next.js has.

204
00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:42.712
So just a refresher on
how catch all works.

205
00:11:42.712 --> 00:11:46.854
So what that means is,
let's say I go into the sign-up folder,

206
00:11:46.854 --> 00:11:49.167
I make a new folder in here, right?

207
00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:53.821
And let's say this new folder says
this is just me writing scratch code,

208
00:11:53.821 --> 00:11:58.881
you don't have to follow along right now
if you don't want to show an example.

209
00:11:58.881 --> 00:12:02.781
This right here is basically
saying it's a dynamic route, so

210
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:08.407
when someone goes to /signup/ anything,
I'm gonna call it ID, activate this route.

211
00:12:08.407 --> 00:12:13.319
What I could do though is if I don't
know how many routes are gonna be

212
00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:17.382
after /signup, I could put dot,
dot, dot in there.

213
00:12:17.382 --> 00:12:21.070
And now it's a catch all route,
which means if anyone goes to

214
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:26.441
/signup/anything/anything/anything/anythi-
ng/anything, show this page.

215
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:30.047
Then I can take it a step further and
then I can just put another square

216
00:12:30.047 --> 00:12:33.842
bracket around it, and it does the exact
same thing of what I just said,

217
00:12:33.842 --> 00:12:36.461
but it also includes if
anyone goes to /sign up.

218
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:38.470
So that's what a catch-all route is.

219
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.167
It's just basically any route that,
in this case,

220
00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:45.116
will come after sign up, show this page.

221
00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:49.243
So we're gonna do that for authentication,
that way if anybody tries to go to /signup

222
00:12:49.243 --> 00:12:52.988
anything, it's gonna show our signup form,
there's just no way around it.

223
00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:53.889
Do you have to do that?

224
00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:59.188
No, but I guess it's just making
sure people don't get messed up.

225
00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:02.731
You could also just build your own logic
and show a 404 if they don't go to

226
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:05.950
the page that you want, and
then have them redirect back to signup.

227
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.135
So I think it's just a little easier
than setting up that redirect logic, and

228
00:13:09.135 --> 00:13:11.105
setting up a 404, and
doing all that stuff.

229
00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:13.065
Just like, hey,
if you go to /signup anything,

230
00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:14.709
we're gonna send you to the signup page.

231
00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:17.116
So that's exactly what we're gonna do.

232
00:13:17.116 --> 00:13:20.394
We're just gonna follow the instructions
of what they expect us here to do.

233
00:13:20.394 --> 00:13:25.325
So if you look at the sign-up page here,
if you're looking at these docs,

234
00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:29.655
make sure you're clicking on the one
that says app and not pages.

235
00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:33.585
We're not using pages,
that's Next.js 12, we're using app.

236
00:13:33.585 --> 00:13:37.345
So all we have to do is just make a signup
folder, and we're gonna do the catch all

237
00:13:37.345 --> 00:13:40.167
inclusive, which means double
brackets with the signup.

238
00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:41.195
So let's just do that.

239
00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:45.726
So I'm gonna change my from

240
00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:50.359
ID to sign-up like that.

241
00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:51.401
Thats a single.

242
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:57.551
[LAUGH] Funny story,
I took singing classes before,

243
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:03.712
and I'm not good at it, so
[LAUGH] I stopped doing it.

244
00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:07.596
And now if you go into this file,
you do page.tsx, because again,

245
00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:10.131
if you don't add a page, it's not a route.

246
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:13.189
So we have to add a page at the root of
a folder in which we want our route to be.

247
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:18.298
So we're gonna add a page here, And

248
00:14:18.298 --> 00:14:24.495
all we're gonna do is just import
the sign in component from @clerk/nextjs,

249
00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:29.501
I'm sorry, the sign-up function,
not the sign in like that.

250
00:14:31.508 --> 00:14:36.183
We're just gonna make a component here,

251
00:14:36.183 --> 00:14:40.867
we'll call it the SignUpPage, like so.

252
00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:43.887
Oops.

253
00:14:43.887 --> 00:14:47.824
And we're just gonna return the signup.

254
00:14:50.406 --> 00:14:53.287
Like that, and
it's gonna export default this.

255
00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:56.126
I mean, as we don't even need this
wrapper, we could probably just return

256
00:14:56.126 --> 00:14:58.965
the sign-up component, but you probably
want this wrapper, that way you

257
00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:01.556
can style this page to make it look
like what you want it to look like.

258
00:15:01.556 --> 00:15:03.447
If you wanted to style
the component itself,

259
00:15:03.447 --> 00:15:05.055
there's two ways to do that in Clerk.

260
00:15:05.055 --> 00:15:09.623
You can do that on their website
where you can style it, but

261
00:15:09.623 --> 00:15:13.736
you can also just make your
own sign-up component.

262
00:15:13.736 --> 00:15:17.819
You don't have to use theirs, you can just
make your own and use like their inputs

263
00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:21.317
and things like that or call their APIs,
so it gets really flexible.

264
00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:25.505
We're not gonna do that, we're just gonna
use the one that they gave us cuz why not?

265
00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:27.218
They already thought about it.

266
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:32.864
So we have that there, so
to export default that SignUpPage.

267
00:15:32.864 --> 00:15:35.694
So now we have sign up and we're just
gonna do the same thing for sign in.

268
00:15:35.694 --> 00:15:41.669
So for sign in,
make a new folder inside of that folder,

269
00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:46.514
got our [[...sign-in]] like that.

270
00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:52.209
I'm just gonna just copy this code
here cuz it's literally the same code,

271
00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:54.179
just instead of SignUp, it's SignIn.

272
00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:58.665
And I'm gonna go into there,
make a page.tsx.

273
00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:05.420
And I'm just gonna paste.

274
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.418
I'm just gonna grab
everything that says signup.

275
00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:11.114
On Mac, you can just do a keyboard
shortcut of CMD+Shift+L, and

276
00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:12.898
it'll copy everything there.

277
00:16:15.132 --> 00:16:17.835
And you can just say SignIn.
