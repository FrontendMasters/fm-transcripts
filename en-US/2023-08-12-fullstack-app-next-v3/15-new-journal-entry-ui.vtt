1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.823
Let's work on trying to
finish out this journal page.

2
00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:07.230
We're getting as close as we can so
we can actually create a journal and

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.039
start to see those journals fold in.

4
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.611
Cuz we're gonna run into, I wouldn't say
issue, but we're gonna run into a business

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:19.500
decision that we're gonna have to make
when it comes to getting this data.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.920
And I can't wait to talk about it.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.997
Or at least showing the data, mostly
because we're getting data server side on

8
00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:32.570
this journal page, but at some point
we're gonna have to create something.

9
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.830
And yes, with server actions you
can create things on the server.

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.960
If you've seen the intro Next.js,
I've talked about server actions.

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.130
You also heard me say that I don't
like to do that when a UI is waiting.

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.260
So I probably won't use server actions for
that, so I'll do it on the client.

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.561
So if I'm doing that on the client
as I'm creating something,

14
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.550
but all the entries are being fetched
on the server, how does the server know

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.440
that it needs to go refetch all the
entries that was created on the client?

16
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.610
So there's a miscommunication there.

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.830
So solving that is a really good
exercise in what Next.js is capable of.

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.430
But we'll get to that.

19
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.190
What we'll do now is let's just create
some components for the entries we don't

20
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.330
have and a component to create a new
entry and we'll go from there.

21
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.830
So let's do that.

22
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.760
First things first is, let's go to
where we'll make some components.

23
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.769
So what I like to do is to make
a components folder on the root, so

24
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.900
I'll say components, like so.

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.679
And then inside of here,

26
00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.596
I'll make a EntryCard.tsx,

27
00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:46.341
and then I'll say NewEntryCard.tsx.

28
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.338
So for the entry card, well,
let's just say EntryCard,

29
00:01:55.338 --> 00:02:00.476
it's gonna take in an entry, like so.

30
00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:01.207
Gonna be exported.

31
00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:07.570
And then for now we'll just show the IDs.

32
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.770
We'll make it look good in a minute.

33
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.531
Let's just say entry.id, super simple.

34
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.772
And let me rename this so
I spell it right, EntryCard.

35
00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:27.640
And then for the new entry card,
it's very similar.

36
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.000
Actually, that's the whole point, it's
supposed to look similar, it's jus for

37
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.760
a new card.

38
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.956
This won't take an entry cuz
it's creating a new one.

39
00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:42.089
And instead we'll just say,
new entry, like that.

40
00:02:45.662 --> 00:02:49.060
I always like to make my
components just show a div,

41
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.733
some hello world thing, render them,
and then go back and make them.

42
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:59.180
That way I can actually see them on
the screen when I'm making them.

43
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.484
It's very rare that I'll
go make a component and

44
00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:04.531
just flesh it out completely
before I even render it somewhere.

45
00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:08.357
Unless I know exactly what I'm doing or
I copied and pasted something,

46
00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:10.287
it's very rare that I'll do that.

47
00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:13.727
Because I need to build it visually
because It's a UI component,

48
00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:14.670
I need to see it.

49
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.400
So very rare.

50
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.496
So I always do this back and forth motion
of getting them, just make it render

51
00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:25.148
something, go render it, and
then come back and make it look good.

52
00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:28.743
Because a lot of the time in CSS,
it's just me opening the browser,

53
00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:32.527
playing around with the CSS in the browser
to see what styles I need, and

54
00:03:32.527 --> 00:03:35.860
then going back and
adding those classes to the component.

55
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.891
It's a lot easier to design in the browser

56
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:43.400
with the the dev tools than it is
to go in here and add the stuff.

57
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.565
Although Next.js and Tailwind makes it
really quick, you just hit save and

58
00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:47.763
it refreshes immediately.

59
00:03:47.763 --> 00:03:49.242
But sometimes, lmaybe the state,

60
00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:52.160
maybe the thing that you're designing
is hidden behind a few clicks.

61
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.004
And then this thing's got to happen, and
this thing's got to happen, it's a modal.

62
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:58.366
So having to do that,
saving it and open it back up and

63
00:03:58.366 --> 00:03:59.992
do this stuff is a little annoying.

64
00:03:59.992 --> 00:04:02.483
It's a lot easier just to open
the browser sometimes and

65
00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:05.990
just go play with the CSS there and then
figure out what you got to do in the code.

66
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.000
Okay, so we have those components.

67
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.423
Now we're gonna go back
to our journal page, and

68
00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:16.270
we're gonna just gonna bring those in.

69
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:23.790
So first thing I wanna do though is,
I wanna make a grid.

70
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.090
So I'm gonna make a grid here.

71
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.266
I'm gonna call this grid.

72
00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:34.458
And I'm gonna say grid-cols.

73
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:38.000
I want this to be three columns, so

74
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.383
grid-cols-3, and
then I want them to have a gap of

75
00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:49.134
4 which is about 16 pixels.

76
00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:59.730
So the first thing in the grid is
always going to be the new entry card.

77
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.680
It's always gonna be at the top.

78
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.150
And then everything after that
are just gonna be the entries.

79
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.144
So then I can just say,
entries like this and

80
00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:16.680
.map, get myself an entry, and

81
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:25.417
then just render out a EntryCard,
And parse in the entry as a prop.

82
00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:31.830
And if you really just hate
that red squigly, go ahead and

83
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.501
give it a key of entry.id.

84
00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:36.893
Cool.

85
00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:45.427
I also prefer to do layout first before I
do UI design because I feel like layout

86
00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:48.620
affects the UI design when
you don't have a design.

87
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.168
Obviously, if you're at work and
you already have a design,

88
00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:53.148
this doesn't matter.

89
00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:56.183
But if I'm designing,
I'm just like, I mean, actually,

90
00:05:56.183 --> 00:05:58.695
I'll still probably do
the layout first anyway.

91
00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:02.627
Because it's a lot easier to do
the broad strokes than do the details,

92
00:06:02.627 --> 00:06:07.492
than having to do the details, bring it
into the layout, just to find out, wait,

93
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.440
well, that's not gonna work.

94
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.852
So I feel like you shouldn't
sacrifice good layout for a design,

95
00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:16.713
the layout should come first, and
then the details should come after it.

96
00:06:16.713 --> 00:06:20.965
That's come from somebody that
knows nothing about design, so

97
00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:22.390
don't listen to me.

98
00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.155
All right.

99
00:06:30.038 --> 00:06:32.677
Cool, so we're really not gonna
see anything here, right,

100
00:06:32.677 --> 00:06:33.959
cuz we don't have anything.

101
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.460
But let's start to make
it look a little better.

102
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.680
So I want these to kind of look like cards
almost, so that's what we're gonna do.

103
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.500
But the first thing that's truly
bothering me is the fact that there's

104
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.530
no padding on this.

105
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.210
I just can't take it, so
I'm gonna put a padding of 10 on all this.

106
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.419
There we go, so much better.

107
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.595
And actually what I wanna do,
I wanna put a title on this page.

108
00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:03.700
So I'm gonna wrap this div in

109
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.550
another div Like this.

110
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.231
That way I can put an H2
here that says turn or

111
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:17.004
entries or journal.

112
00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:22.330
Something like that, give it a class name.

113
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.360
Let's try 3xl for the texts.

114
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.400
Let's do a margin bottom of 8,
see what that looks like.

115
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.930
Yeah, there we go.

116
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.378
But now I gotta bring that
padding up to the root diff.

117
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.260
There we go.

118
00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:49.300
So we get something like that.

119
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.780
&gt;&gt; Can I see your top level imports-
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

120
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.960
&gt;&gt; For the two components we just made?

121
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.626
&gt;&gt; Yep.
So I've used at which will give me root

122
00:07:57.626 --> 00:07:59.778
slash components slash the name.

123
00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:02.280
&gt;&gt; I tried to destructure
them both in one.

124
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you try to destructure
them, that would be a named export.

125
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:12.631
So some people do that as a,
there's really no wrong or right way.

126
00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:15.363
The only thing you have to do
is you can't do that for pages.

127
00:08:15.363 --> 00:08:15.910
For pages,

128
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.872
anything that's a special file in Next.js
as a component has to be a default export.

129
00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:22.897
Otherwise, Next.js doesn't know
what the name of the export is, so

130
00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:24.460
it can't import it.

131
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.368
And it's not gonna do some static
analysis like TypeScript is gonna do and

132
00:08:28.368 --> 00:08:30.900
read your files to get
the names of the exports.

133
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.630
So it just has the default exports.

134
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.110
Components, you can do
whatever the hell you want.

135
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.896
These aren't special files.

136
00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:39.746
You just got to make sure you import
them the way that you exported them.

137
00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:41.660
But pages and layouts and templates and

138
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.432
things like that that are specially
named have to have the specific exports.

139
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:53.730
Okay, let's work on this card here.

140
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.630
So I already have a bunch.

141
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:03.219
And this is where I said, you don't
remember all the CSS, so I'm actually just

142
00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:07.120
going to go see all the CSS I already
made for this, cuz it's a lot and

143
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.604
there's no way in hell I'm gonna remember
all that or try to do it again, so,

144
00:09:14.563 --> 00:09:18.271
Here we go, actually, wait.

145
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.455
There we go.

146
00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:27.024
So it actually kind of looks like this.

147
00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:33.410
Worry about the on-click for now.

148
00:09:39.296 --> 00:09:42.160
I mean, I guess it's not that
hard now that I'm looking at it.

149
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.964
It just puts a cursor pointer on it,
overflow hidden, rounded the corners,

150
00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:49.416
make the background white,
adds a shadow, and then some padding, so

151
00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:57.040
I guess it's not too bad, But to copy
that, this is what the repo is for.

152
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.170
It's in the new entry TSX
file if you wanna copy that.

153
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.230
You also don't need to make this
look like exactly what I have.

154
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.848
The style of this is not gonna
affect the functionality, so.

155
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.210
Okay, and then if you go check this out,
just to verify it's there.

156
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.460
Now what's bothering me is that it's
a white card on a white background and

157
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.474
I can't stand it, so I'm gonna fix that.

158
00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:32.736
Inside of our page, I'm just going to
give this a background of zinc dash

159
00:10:33.753 --> 00:10:39.064
Let's start with 500, and
then add some opacity,

160
00:10:39.064 --> 00:10:45.920
modifier of 50 ,and let's just
see what that looks like.

161
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.500
Nope, let's try 10.

162
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.940
Absolutely not, let's lower that to 400.

163
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.397
Much better, much better.

164
00:10:58.397 --> 00:11:04.170
Okay, and
then we say give this a height of full.

165
00:11:05.657 --> 00:11:07.260
Nope, that still didn't work.

166
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.990
It doesn't like that.

167
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.019
And that's because this doesn't
have a height of full on it.

168
00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:16.990
I'm not doing all that.

169
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.805
It's just gonna look like that for now.

170
00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:23.327
I gotta put a height full on this,
and I gotta put a height full on this,

171
00:11:23.327 --> 00:11:24.950
and then it'll be good.

172
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.081
That's just so much work.

173
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:29.545
I guess I'll do it now
that I mentioned it.

174
00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:30.961
[LAUGH] Let's just do it.

175
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:35.235
Height full on the thing in the template,
and

176
00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:39.750
then We'll put one here too.

177
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.600
We'll probably get some scroll too, I bet.

178
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.582
A little bit of scroll, yeah.

179
00:11:45.582 --> 00:11:53.955
So to fix the scroll what you would
have to do is just do some math, right?

180
00:11:53.955 --> 00:11:58.532
So you have to come here and say height is

181
00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:04.400
going to be calc 100 view height minus.

182
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.915
What did I put before the thing, 60.

183
00:12:07.915 --> 00:12:12.609
Or, I'm sorry, you want to do that here.

184
00:12:12.609 --> 00:12:18.226
You would still want
a high fall on this and

185
00:12:18.226 --> 00:12:23.534
then you would say, this has a height of

186
00:12:25.754 --> 00:12:30.858
100 View Height, or
sorry, calc(100vh-60px).

187
00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:36.235
The reason we do that is because 100
View Height is the entire screen,

188
00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:42.530
but minus 60 pixels because we have
a header up top that's 60 pixels.

189
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.070
And there's no margin between them,
so we just calculate that.

190
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.908
And that's why I chose to do
things absolutely positioned,

191
00:12:48.908 --> 00:12:50.640
cuz I could just do math and do stuff.

192
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.435
But if you were gonna make this
relative or mobile responsive,

193
00:12:54.435 --> 00:12:59.462
you probably couldn't get away with this
unless you had some crazy media queries.

194
00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:01.792
So there we go, no more scroll.

195
00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:05.692
Everything's exactly the height and
width that it needs to be.

196
00:13:12.765 --> 00:13:14.490
Okay, so we got this new entry.

197
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.289
It literally does nothing
when we click on it.

198
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.711
Let's change that.
