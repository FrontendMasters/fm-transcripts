00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.462
What is machine learning?

2
00:00:01.462 --> 00:00:06.320
I kinda start already showing you examples
of machine learning, deep learning,

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.880
but I haven't even explained
what that actually is.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:20.390
So, for that,
I will be using kinda by example.

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.600
Show you how we can differentiate
between statistics,

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.860
machine learning,
deep learning, and even AI.

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.017
So let's start with just statistics,
what is statistics?

8
00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:39.998
And let's start with
some practical problem,

9
00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.990
let's say I'm a shoemaker in 19th century.

10
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.420
And have no idea about machine learning
distributions and everything else.

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.680
But I want to create really good shoes and
they know I'm creating them.

12
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.540
But I don't know what's the optimal size

13
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.260
I should use to basically
provide to my customers.

14
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.270
And let's say I want to
massively produce them, right?

15
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.230
And hope that it will satisfy the needs
of my customers, so what I can do?

16
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.560
I can just go to 100 random strangers,
right?

17
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.320
And ask them what shoe size do they have,
let's say 8, 9, 10,

18
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.590
11, 12, 13, I don't know.

19
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.510
And for instance, some people say,
5 people say they have size 8.

20
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.990
More people will say that they have
size 9, and so on and so forth, so

21
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.835
I can almost plot of this
distribution of sizes, right?

22
00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:46.975
And statistics allows me to
just get those 100 numbers and

23
00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:50.645
find the average, for
instance, or also mean.

24
00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:55.845
Is the same thing which
is just a summation

25
00:01:55.845 --> 00:02:00.515
of all of those numbers divided by number
of people participated in my survey.

26
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.580
So, I just simply can say that,
if I go with the mean size,

27
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.580
which in my case probably
going to be number 11,

28
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.571
I will satisfy the majority, right?

29
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:20.645
And probably people with size 8 and 9,

30
00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:25.475
not gonna be satisfied with big shoes

31
00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:29.840
with size 11, and 12 and 13 will not fit.

32
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.480
But still,
at least big chunk of people will, well,

33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.680
get their shoes the right size.

34
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.330
So statistics allows us to find some basic

35
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.190
information about the distributions,
right?

36
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.780
And then statistics kinda
evaluated into machine learning,

37
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.120
machine learning, the way how I see it,
it mostly deals with the distributions.

38
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.430
So back to our shoe size example, that
looks almost like a normal distribution.

39
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.750
If you not familiar with
the normal distributions or

40
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.470
Gaussian distributions, or
bell curve distribution.

41
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.680
It's called this because it is
kinda look like a bell curve.

42
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.886
It is symmetric, I'm just drawing it,
it's not that symmetrical,

43
00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:22.250
and it can be easily
described by two numbers.

44
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.360
The kinda mean value,

45
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.568
where we have this peak and
standard deviation,

46
00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:35.720
think about it like the width of
the distribution in the middle.

47
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.850
So, machine learning, pretty much
what it's doing all the time is

48
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.320
trying to find
the corresponding distribution.

49
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.600
And find the values which can
describe this distribution and

50
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.940
this process called fitting.

51
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.670
So machine learning is pretty
good with taking a lot of

52
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.340
practical observations, right?

53
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.050
Different measurements and
trying to find those distributions and

54
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.970
corresponding values which can
describe this distribution.

55
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.607
And people been doing that for,

56
00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:16.960
not centuries, well,
I can probably say centuries.

57
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.860
And the thing is, at this point
you don't need a lot of computer.

58
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.870
Majority of those operations
are requiring just summation,

59
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.520
division multiplication, but
all of that can be done by hands.
