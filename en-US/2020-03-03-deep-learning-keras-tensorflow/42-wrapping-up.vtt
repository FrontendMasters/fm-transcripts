00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.690
We can spend a lot of time on image
parts and computer vision, right,

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.120
and I think that was fun.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.360
With text, I tried to shrink
everything into limited time we had,

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.390
but the main point is that probably
the most important part with the text

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.300
analytics is how you preprocess your text.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.270
Right, how you simply
locating everything and, for

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.840
instance, you can use word embedding or
hot encoding.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.260
And that might actually
give you different results.

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.470
And reinforcement learning allows you
to simply build this model which will

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.420
help your agents simply observe
the environment and act accordingly.

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.200
For instance, in simple examples,
just move your car to the left or

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.450
to the right to get a particular goal,
in our case is just balanced this pool.

13
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.150
But that's the simple examples of
how deep learning can be used.

14
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.100
And well, I hope you had a lot of fun.

15
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.650
[LAUGH] I know we digged a little bit
too deep into math at some points, but

16
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.200
still I really hope it helped with better
understanding what deep learning is and

17
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.810
how it can be used.

18
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.362
All right then, thank you very much,
it was awesome, all right.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.954
