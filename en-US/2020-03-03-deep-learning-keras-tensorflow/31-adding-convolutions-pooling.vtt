00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.090
Let's modify our model a little bit,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.089
so after doing MaxPooling,
we can simply connect.

3
00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.178
Or we can have multiple convolution
layers if we want, but yeah,

4
00:00:14.178 --> 00:00:19.650
let's quickly go through this code
example and see what we do in here.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.941
So once again, we're using TensorFlow
importing our mnist data set from Keras.

6
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.760
Callback function,

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.000
pretty useful if you want to do
something during the training part.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.550
So for instance, when we used a model fit,
I'll fix this error in a second.

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.405
So I can specify callback and
this function, in our case,

10
00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:48.840
myCallback function will be
executed on every epoch_end.

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.290
And it just simply comparing was
the current accuracy of our training run.

12
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.470
And if it's, for instance, larger than
99% I can simply terminate my run.

13
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.320
So if you don't know how many epochs
you need to run your training,

14
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.430
but you want to get to your particular
accuracy, that's one of the way to do it.

15
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.700
You just specify, okay, I just wanna
get to 95% accuracy and then I'm done.

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.200
And this callback will terminate

17
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.280
my fitting process as soon
as we get to 95% accuracy.
