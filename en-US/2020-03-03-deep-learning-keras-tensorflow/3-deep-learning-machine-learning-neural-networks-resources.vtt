00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.780
We're also gonna be
relying on three books,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.812
Deep Learning with Python
by FranÃ§ois Chollet.

3
00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:12.150
He is actually the owner of Keras.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.550
Keras is one of the deep
learning frameworks.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.300
It was a standalone framework
designed precisely just to

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.950
gonna create this high level API's for
deep learning.

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.700
And Keras originally was using Torch,

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.965
TensorFlow and a couple of other deep
learning frameworks on the backend, right?

9
00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:38.415
But right now Keras became
part of the TensorFlow itself.

10
00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:42.111
So, right now you can just import Keras,
for instance,

11
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.656
by typing importtensorflow.keras.

12
00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:49.201
And interestingly enough,
all the API architecture or

13
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.305
all the API structure got preserved.

14
00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:57.127
So if you find any examples
about Keras from which we're

15
00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.103
gonna use TensorFlow version 1,

16
00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:05.862
you can still use it because Keras
syntax haven't changed at all.

17
00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:09.327
You will just need to instead
of typing import keras,

18
00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:12.410
type input tensorflow.keras and that's it.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.250
All right, so Francois Chollet is the
author of Keras and he's got this really

20
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.180
nice book Deep Learning with Python,
published about two years ago.

21
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.920
But as I said, just because of
the preservation of Keras APIs,

22
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.239
all of the examples in this book can
be used even with TensorFlow 2.0.

23
00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:32.967
Hands-On Machine Learning
with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and

24
00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:36.900
TensorFlow by Aurelien Geron
is a really good book.

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
And we will be using actually
examples from the book

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.920
in the last part of the course, when we'll
be talking about reinforcement learning.

27
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.570
Actors, robotics, all of that, so
that's part of the reinforcement learning.

28
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.445
And also if you want to know
specifics of TensorFlow itself,

29
00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:57.440
Hands-On Neural Networks
with TensorFlow 2.0 by

30
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.910
Paolo Galeone is the really good book.

31
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.010
It also explains the internals of
TensorFlow 2.0, so are worth, and

32
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.960
I put all the links to their
GitHub repositories with examples.

33
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.220
So for instance, if you click to author
names, it will redirect you to GitHub

34
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.733
where the corresponding
source code which they

35
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:28.210
used in their books will present so
you can play.

36
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.350
All of those are Python based, once again,
like I haven't included a JavaScript

37
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.060
source code here, but if you would
like to play with Python code,

38
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.910
that's the way to find it
really interesting examples.

39
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.385
If you just want to learn
more about TensorFlow,

40
00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:47.880
tensorflow.org is the good way to start.

41
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.060
So, it will tell you how
to install TensorFlow.

42
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.660
On tensorflow.org,
it's under heavy load for some reason,

43
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.490
but anyway,
that's the way where you can start.

44
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.700
TensorFlow allows you to have almost
the whole ecosystem for machine learning.

45
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.020
So with JavaScript, you can run codes, or

46
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.110
create models, train the models and
to do the inference right in your browser.

47
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.400
But you can also create mobile and
IoT mods and deploy them for

48
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.820
instance, on Raspberry Pi's,
or something like that, right?

49
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.406
And, of course, for the production,
if you working for the company,

50
00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:34.236
TensorFlow provides this whole model
training, deployment ecosystem.

51
00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:38.140
And we probably gonna touch it
a little bit at the end of this class.
