00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.305
&gt;&gt; Evgenii Ray: Hello everyone,

2
00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:05.470
and welcome to the Frontend System
Design Fundamentals Workshop.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.350
My name is Evgenii Ray, and
I'm your workshop host today.

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.970
So before we start our workshop,
I'd like to quickly introduce myself.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.474
So I've been working in the industry for
the last decade, and

6
00:00:18.474 --> 00:00:23.206
I spent a good chunk of my career
working on complex UI apps.

7
00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:27.653
So, I was working at the JetBrains for
three years, and

8
00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:31.786
currently I work as
a frontend engineer at Meta.

9
00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:37.584
So, when I was building this course,
I was thinking that it could be useful

10
00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:43.659
to have some fundamental course that
would explain how all these libraries and

11
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.697
frameworks that we as a UI
specialist use every day work.

12
00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:53.683
So the idea of this course is to
give you this fundamental knowledge

13
00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:58.857
that you can apply in everyday job or
when you have the job interview.

14
00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:03.491
So you know how every library is designed.

15
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.771
What are the API used for
a certain complex patterns?

16
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:13.411
And before we start, let's understand
what's the frontend system design.

17
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:17.113
So if we split the application
design into three parts,

18
00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:20.202
it's a backend API and the frontend.

19
00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:25.584
So to me, the frontend is about API
communication, how we communicate

20
00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:31.022
with the API and how we manage
the data that we get from the server.

21
00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:35.457
So it's about how we store
this data in a way that we can

22
00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:39.303
utilize the device resource efficiently,
so

23
00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:44.373
we don't overuse the memory
of the device and so on.

24
00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:49.363
It's also about how we're handling
the complex user interactions.

25
00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:53.999
So for instance, you need to display
thousands of elements on a screen,

26
00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.493
how will you do that?

27
00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:59.249
Having the limited gram or
having the small screen.

28
00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.739
And same applies to the asset management.

29
00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:08.009
So the complex apps tends to have
multiple chunks that we need to load.

30
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.779
So how would we load them efficiently?

31
00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:17.159
So our application loads fast and all our
web vitals metrics are on the high level.

32
00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.603
First of all start with
the core fundamentals.

33
00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:22.826
So this is one of the most
important section of the course.

34
00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:28.766
Because it will give you the exposure of
how browser treats the HTML elements,

35
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:33.717
how staking context is connected
to the formatting context, and

36
00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:37.403
how everything is connected to the GPU.

37
00:02:37.403 --> 00:02:39.810
So we're gonna look at
the browser rendering cycle.

38
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.284
And also,
what are the composition layers and

39
00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:47.304
how can we utilize the GPU
to optimize the rendering?

40
00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:52.319
So, once we finish with core fundamentals,
we're gonna look at the DOM API.

41
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.201
So it will be kind of a DOM API
refresher because the DOM API for

42
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.669
us is like a shovel.

43
00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:02.375
We need to know how to work with the low
level APIs to modify the DOM tree.

44
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:07.165
So once we're done with the DOM,
we're gonna look at the Observer API.

45
00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:12.925
The Observer API is a very efficient
tool to design complex patterns.

46
00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:17.685
And we're gonna look using
the live-coding exercises.

47
00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:22.775
How can we utilize the observer
to build such complex patterns.

48
00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:26.209
The fourth section will
be very code-heavy, so

49
00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.073
we're gonna take a look at
how virtualization works.

50
00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:33.506
And we're also going to
live-code it from scratch, so

51
00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:37.022
you can understand how
everything is applied together.

52
00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:39.379
So once we finish with
our code-heavy part,

53
00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.618
we'll move to application state design.

54
00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:46.455
So we're gonna check how can we design the
state in a way that the search operation

55
00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:49.888
is efficient,
the access operation is also efficient.

56
00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:56.438
And how can we utilize the browser
storage API to offload the device memory.

57
00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:58.342
Then we'll move to network section.

58
00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:03.736
So we're gonna look what are the protocols
of communication available to us.

59
00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:08.481
And we're also gonna take a look
what are the ways of talking to

60
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.866
server we have on the UI.

61
00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:15.826
And I'm going to discuss a very Hollywood
topic, which is the REST/GraphQL,

62
00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:18.204
and I'll provide my opinion on that.

63
00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:23.013
And then we'll finish up with web
application performance, we're gonna look

64
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:28.542
at how can we optimize our JavaScript
assets, CSS assets, images, and fonts.

65
00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:33.178
And the last section is kind of a bonus
section, we're going to simulate

66
00:04:33.178 --> 00:04:38.361
the interview environment and try to
design the 3D like application newsfeed.

67
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.563
&gt;&gt; Student: Before we get started,

68
00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:42.394
what would you say the prerequisites
of the course are?

69
00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:47.592
&gt;&gt; Student: Things that
you should know prior to-

70
00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:49.339
&gt;&gt; Evgenii Ray: I think it's good to know

71
00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:53.335
how the browser renders the page,
how it reads the HTML,

72
00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:56.762
basic networking knowledge
also would be good.

73
00:04:56.762 --> 00:05:02.650
And some basic JavaScript, so
you don't need to be very proficient.

74
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.185
And you also need to have the latest
Chrome browser, because we're not going

75
00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:11.465
to utilize any bundlers and
we're just gonna run everything natively.
