00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Evgenii Ray: So
now let's become browser, part two.

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.191
So now we are slightly
complicate the exercise.

3
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:09.160
We are going to build all
the formatting context.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.370
Also we are gonna detect all
the elements outside of normal flow.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.421
And we're also going to build stacking
context DOM, RenderObject tree,

6
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:20.004
RenderLayer tree and
the GraphicLayer trees.

7
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.081
So we can see how
everything works together.

8
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:28.851
The HTML is pretty simple and
we're gonna render it line by line.

9
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.791
So let's start with the step one.

10
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:34.951
So we render the HTML element.

11
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.441
So when we render HTML element so
the DOM tree is updated.

12
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:45.048
So we added this element to the tree,
also the RenderObject is created.

13
00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:48.920
Because we create 100 objects for
every DOM element,

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.370
then the root GraphicLayer is initiated.

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.670
And the root RenderLayer is initiated.

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.537
And we start with a default
stacking context and

17
00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:01.706
default blocks formatting context
because we use the root element.

18
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.236
So let's continue and render the body.

19
00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:07.846
When to render the body,
the DOM tree is updated.

20
00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:10.923
The RenderObject tree is updated,
but rest is untouched.

21
00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:17.976
&gt;&gt; Evgenii Ray: So next we render
the section tag with a few flex items.

22
00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:20.048
So we updated our DOM tree.

23
00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:22.848
And we updated our RenderObject tree.

24
00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:27.752
Now, no position absolute apply
to our any CSS transformation,

25
00:01:27.752 --> 00:01:33.848
we keep our single RenderLayer and
we also keep our single GraphicLayer.

26
00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:37.898
But now we need to update
our formatting context tree.

27
00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.832
So since the display flex is assigned,

28
00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.653
we're creating a new
flex formatting context.

29
00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:47.100
And one thing interesting is usually the
div doesn't create the block formatting

30
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.689
context.

31
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.002
But because now it's a flex item and we
are within different formatting context,

32
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.314
this means that this instructs
the browser that now the div element

33
00:01:57.314 --> 00:02:00.474
should initiate the block
formatting context.

34
00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.926
So we get to two more contexts here.

35
00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:12.666
Okay, now let's render the absolutely
position item with a span with some text.

36
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.656
So we updated the DOM tree.

37
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:18.990
We added two more rendering objects,
and since the element has

38
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.659
the position absolute assign to that,
so we update our render layer tree.

39
00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.716
And now we have two layers.

40
00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:31.237
So the next thing that we
do is because the span or

41
00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:36.081
sorry, actually because we have
the position absolute assign,

42
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:40.852
we also move out the element from
the default stacking context.

43
00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:44.922
So now we have a separate realm
where we put all our elements.

44
00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:47.062
So we create a new stacking context.

45
00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:51.976
And within this stacking context,
we created a new default block

46
00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:57.082
formatting context and
initiated the inline formatting context.

47
00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:57.887
Yeah, I hope it's clear.

48
00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:01.961
[LAUGH] So now we are rendering
the new div element and

49
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:07.174
since this div element has
the display inline block assigned, so

50
00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:14.254
this means we need to update the DOM tree,
we also update the RenderObject tree.

51
00:03:14.254 --> 00:03:18.698
GraphicLayer is untouched, RenderLayer
tree is also untouched because we don't

52
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.673
play with the staking context here.

53
00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:25.862
And now we're updating our root stacking
context and creating a new block

54
00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:31.147
formatting context because the display
inline block is assigned, okay?

55
00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:33.657
Let's render the last one.

56
00:03:33.657 --> 00:03:36.564
So here,
we assigned the absolute positioning, but

57
00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:39.317
we also assigned the 3D transformation.

58
00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:42.671
So this means that we need
to update the DOM tree.

59
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.091
We also update the RenderObject tree.

60
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.381
Then we create a new RenderLayer.

61
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.801
But the difference is,

62
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:52.851
this RenderLayer will be assigned
to the different GraphicLayer.

63
00:03:52.851 --> 00:03:57.471
So because we initiated
a 3D transformation.

64
00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:00.746
So we promoted this layer
to the new GraphicLayer.

65
00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:03.362
And we also initiated
a new stacking context,

66
00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:07.456
where we placed the new formatting
context initiated by the div tag.

67
00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:10.912
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So the stacking context that
we end up with at the end, if you were

68
00:04:10.912 --> 00:04:15.076
actually to view this in a browser,
basically you'd have the root context.

69
00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:17.913
And then the stacking context one
would be right on top of that, and

70
00:04:17.913 --> 00:04:19.086
the stacking context two.

71
00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:22.076
&gt;&gt; Evgenii Ray: Yeah,
it will be on top of the next one.

72
00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:24.756
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Perfect, that was all
I wanted to clarify, thank you.

73
00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:25.516
&gt;&gt; Evgenii Ray: And we're done.

74
00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:28.791
So we initially started with
the very simple concepts,

75
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:31.746
just some box model margins and bottings.

76
00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:35.096
When we overused what
are the painting layers and

77
00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:40.008
how they work together, and
now we can call ourselves Jedai of reflow.
