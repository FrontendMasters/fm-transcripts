WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.772
We'll start off by looking at
product design fundamentals.

2
00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:07.790
What exactly is product design or
digital product design?

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.520
And let's be clear,

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.005
I'm not gonna start teaching you
how to make a chair, for example.

5
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.320
But when it comes to digital
product design, what exactly is it?

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.086
How is it different from
our traditional web design?

7
00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:26.228
So we're gonna explore those kind of
fundamental principles of the discipline

8
00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:28.450
and how it's different.

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.060
So let's begin with, well,
what is product design?

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.630
Now, of course there is no
universal agreement about this,

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.070
cuz Perish the thought we have
standards in our industry.

12
00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:44.847
And it could be very confusing
cuz you might think, well,

13
00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:48.205
I've done a little bit of designing apps,

14
00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:52.867
therefore am I a product designer,
or am I a UX designer, or

15
00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:58.310
am I an experience designer, or
am I a UI designer, and so it goes on?

16
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.532
Truth is, it doesn't really matter
what you call yourself, right?

17
00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:05.292
[LAUGH] Whatever wins you
the job is my attitude.

18
00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:11.449
But for our sake as we talk about
product design as a discipline,

19
00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:16.582
really it's about the process
of conceptualizing, creating,

20
00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:23.039
and refining digital products basically
like SaaS apps or software interfaces.

21
00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.402
So it's a kind of blend of
user experience design,

22
00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.781
user interface design,
and interaction design.

23
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.451
All right,

24
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:34.880
that probably doesn't overly help you
to understand what product design is.

25
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.692
So let's try a little illustration
instead, a Info Graphic.

26
00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:46.013
So if you imagine kind of the work
that we do as digital designers,

27
00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:51.212
he uses the broadest term that you
can possibly come up with, right?

28
00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:55.121
At one end of the spectrum
of kind of web-based

29
00:01:55.121 --> 00:02:00.340
technologies is the informational
end of the spectrum.

30
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
So we're talking about document-based
websites such as news sites,

31
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.280
marketing sites,
that kind of thing, right?

32
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.910
Government websites,
all of those type of sites.

33
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.005
And then at the other end of the spectrum,

34
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:19.517
we've got task-orientated web
apps such as design tools,

35
00:02:19.517 --> 00:02:24.188
accounting apps, online software,
that kind of thing.

36
00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:28.341
So actually, Figma itself is a SaaS app,

37
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:33.878
it's a web app that runs
through web technology.

38
00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:37.908
Now in the middle, you've got a whole
range of different things that are both

39
00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.139
interactive and informational.

40
00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.569
So an e-commerce site has got
interactive elements to it, but

41
00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.947
it's also got informational
product information on there.

42
00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.929
And then social sites, you could argue or
somewhere in between, right?

43
00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:56.479
So it's very much a spectrum, and
we kind of work all along that spectrum.

44
00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.593
So that end of the spectrum
the informational end of the spectrum,

45
00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:03.171
I'm gonna call that web design, right?

46
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.408
I noticed I'm saying, I'm gonna call it
that because other people I'm sure would

47
00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:09.741
have other names for it.

48
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:16.103
And then at the other end of the spectrum,
we're talking about product design, okay?

49
00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:20.996
So that is the end of the spectrum
we're gonna be looking at today, right?

50
00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:21.574
And so,

51
00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:27.216
I wanted to clarify that up front because
obviously that makes a big difference.

52
00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:32.896
Many of the things I talk about today will
apply across the whole spectrum, right?

53
00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:38.873
And you don't need to
necessarily specialize in one

54
00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:42.564
part of that spectrum, right?

55
00:03:42.564 --> 00:03:45.841
Don't feel that if you call
yourself a UX designer,

56
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:49.204
you only get to work on
the informational end.

57
00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:51.449
Or if you call yourself
even a web designer,

58
00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.453
you only get to work on the informational
end, you don't think that if you call

59
00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:59.241
yourself a product designer,
you only ever get to work on web apps.

60
00:03:59.241 --> 00:04:01.353
The reality is that over your career,

61
00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:04.595
you will probably work in a lot
of different areas, okay?

62
00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:10.896
So I, for example, call myself a UX
designer, but I spend as much time working

63
00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:16.081
on web apps as I do working on
informational websites, right?

64
00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:20.177
So a lot of the skills are transferable,
but

65
00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:25.600
there is more to product
design than you might think.

66
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.792
It's very easy to make an assumption
that you understand a discipline

67
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:37.060
simply because you work in an adjacent
discipline, if that makes sense.

68
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.277
This is this is an example
of how old I am, right?

69
00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:45.407
That when I trained, when I started my
career, the web didn't exist, okay?

70
00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:52.487
And I remember a time when print designers
went, yeah, we can do the web too, right?

71
00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:58.137
Which was absurd, they had no
understanding of the web, right?

72
00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:01.157
And equally,
I remember a time a little bit later,

73
00:05:01.157 --> 00:05:05.794
when those very same web designers who
moaned at the print designers, right,

74
00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:11.257
started turning around and saying,
yeah, we can do mobile too, right?

75
00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:15.305
So there are specialisms,
there are differences, but

76
00:05:15.305 --> 00:05:18.671
there are also transferable skills, right?

77
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:23.737
So, we need to be aware of
the unique challenges that

78
00:05:23.737 --> 00:05:28.583
are associated with working on web apps,
right?

79
00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:31.926
I'm doing the more product
design end of things.

80
00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:37.306
And to me, I mean,
I'm sure there are lots of others as well,

81
00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:41.650
but the three that really
stand out to me is first,

82
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.155
that when it comes to web apps,
there is repeated use, right?

83
00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:48.835
So you think about it.

84
00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:51.885
Think about the web apps that you use,
right?

85
00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:55.595
The chances are,
you use them fairly regularly, okay?

86
00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:59.425
You open Figma every day,
probably multiple times a day,

87
00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.934
you live in that thing maybe, right?

88
00:06:02.974 --> 00:06:08.914
Even with certain e-commerce sites which
are somewhere in the middle like Amazon.

89
00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:14.290
I'm on Amazon way more than
I probably should be, okay?

90
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.263
Or Netflix, right?

91
00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:19.342
I'm in and out of that app all the time.

92
00:06:19.342 --> 00:06:24.312
Now, compare that to more informational
based websites, all right?

93
00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:27.012
You may be visit them once in a blue moon.

94
00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:31.767
Okay, I don't get up in the morning go,
right, I'm gonna go visit the UK

95
00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:36.992
government website today because that's
what I do on a Monday, you know?

96
00:06:36.992 --> 00:06:39.488
You go when you have to.

97
00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:44.562
So that element of repeated
use means that a minor

98
00:06:44.562 --> 00:06:52.841
point of friction can become irritating
when you encounter it regularly.

99
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:56.305
You can put up, if the UK government
website is a bit difficult to use,

100
00:06:56.305 --> 00:07:00.459
it's not the end of the world,
I maybe visit it once a year, right?

101
00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:05.012
If Figma has a little thing where I have
to go through two drop downs rather than

102
00:07:05.012 --> 00:07:07.463
one, I freak the hell out because it's so

103
00:07:07.463 --> 00:07:11.059
annoying when you have to do it for
the 50,000th time.

104
00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:17.472
So being aware of that creates a unique
challenge that product designers

105
00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:23.437
face more than informational designers,
I'll throw out another random name for

106
00:07:23.437 --> 00:07:28.551
these things, you can see how little
I care about the names of things.

107
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:35.571
So that's one thing to bear in mind,
the second challenge is the complexity.

108
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.311
So when it comes to
document-based websites,

109
00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:44.273
the biggest challenge you really
have is navigation, right?

110
00:07:44.273 --> 00:07:49.881
You've got to navigate around that app and
maybe filling in a form, okay?

111
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:53.571
That's about as bad as it gets from
a user interaction point of view.

112
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:57.652
But when you move into any kind
of web app, then suddenly that

113
00:07:57.652 --> 00:08:03.164
complexity of the tasks that people
are trying to complete skyrockets.

114
00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:08.635
And so, there is very complicated
range of functionality that somebody

115
00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:14.195
might be doing when working with a web
app that they wouldn't necessarily

116
00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:19.374
be facing if they were working
just on an information website.

117
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:22.198
So that's the second problem.

118
00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:27.689
And the third problem is something that
we touched on in one of the questions

119
00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:33.374
in the user research and testing,
is this concept of procedural knowledge.

120
00:08:33.374 --> 00:08:38.746
Now, for those of you who don't
know what procedural knowledge is,

121
00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:42.738
is that,
we learned to do things by habit, right?

122
00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:48.608
So if we do something and it works for
us, we do it again, and again, and again.

123
00:08:48.608 --> 00:08:52.372
And we learn that, and even if
that's not the best way of doing it,

124
00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:56.198
it gets us to the results, so
we're kind of happy with it.

125
00:08:56.198 --> 00:09:01.371
So the classic example,
have you ever seen somebody type in

126
00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:06.657
a whole website address into
the Google search box, right?

127
00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:10.710
They do that because they did it once and
it worked.

128
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.150
And so, they do it again,
and again, and again.

129
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.924
And then they just select the first thing
from the dropdown list and they get on

130
00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:20.952
the website, that's a whole extra step
than if you just typed in the address bar.

131
00:09:20.952 --> 00:09:24.178
But people do that because
they've learned that it works,

132
00:09:24.178 --> 00:09:25.991
that's procedural knowledge.

133
00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:27.879
So, I could say to you,

134
00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:32.701
let's think of a website that
most of you go to at some point.

135
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.851
Well, let's pick Amazon.

136
00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:38.971
Everybody been to Amazon relatively
recently or fairly often, right?

137
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:44.673
So if I said to you,
where's the search box on Amazon, right?

138
00:09:44.673 --> 00:09:47.327
You'll probably picture in
your head that site and

139
00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:50.873
that the search box is kind of
in the middle at the top, right?

140
00:09:50.873 --> 00:09:54.593
Or if I said to you, where's
the shopping cart on Amazon, right?

141
00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:59.053
Or indeed on any e-commerce site,
you're almost certainly going to say.

142
00:09:59.053 --> 00:09:59.646
&gt;&gt; Upper right.

143
00:09:59.646 --> 00:10:01.700
&gt;&gt; Upper right, okay?

144
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.539
So there are procedural knowledges that
are specific to a site, right, and

145
00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:11.455
then there are also procedural knowledge
of our expectations of how websites

146
00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:13.057
on a whole work, right?

147
00:10:13.057 --> 00:10:17.686
Like shopping basket, top right,
or navigation, cross top,

148
00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:20.268
down the left-hand side, right?

149
00:10:20.268 --> 00:10:22.490
So we've learned these behaviors.

150
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:30.620
Now, why does this matter in terms of
a challenge for web apps in particular?

151
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.959
Well, if we're using something
continually, if we're using Figma day in,

152
00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:39.330
day out, if we're using our banking
app day in and day out, right?

153
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.928
If you move any of those elements,
you break people's procedural knowledge,

154
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:48.058
suddenly they don't understand,
where's that thing gone, right?

155
00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:53.185
If Amazon moved their shopping basket
from the top right to the top left,

156
00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.214
all hell would break loose.

157
00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:59.311
And you see this every time something
like Facebook redesign, right,

158
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.617
everybody flips out.

159
00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:04.430
It sometimes makes the news that people
are up in arms about the fact that this

160
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.336
app has changed.

161
00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:11.486
So we've got this added component
because people are using the app on

162
00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:15.726
a regular basis that if you break
their procedural knowledge,

163
00:11:15.726 --> 00:11:19.626
even to make it better,
right, it causes problems.

164
00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:24.127
So those are the three big challenges
that you need to bear in mind when you're

165
00:11:24.127 --> 00:11:27.492
talking about building and
working on web apps.

166
00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:30.961
Product design has a lot
of similarities and

167
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:36.115
a lot of crossovers with any other
form of UX design or web design,

168
00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:41.294
but it also has some unique challenges
that we need to be aware of.
