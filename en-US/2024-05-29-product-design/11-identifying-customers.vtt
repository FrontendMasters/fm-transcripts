1
00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.262
I wanna dive in a little bit deeper into
the subject of understanding our audience.

2
00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:06.599
It's shocking, isn't it?

3
00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.984
That a design course talks
about understanding users,

4
00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:12.296
who would've known that was coming.

5
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:18.600
But it is, when you're talking about
product design you really have to,

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.377
it's such an important area to talk about.

7
00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:27.518
And particularly, when you're
talking about products as well,

8
00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:31.191
I think it's essential
because essentially,

9
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:35.965
how you positioning your product and
who you're targeting,

10
00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:39.540
as I said when I use that
task app as an example,

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.544
can fundamentally affect the nature
of the product that you're producing.

12
00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:48.436
So, right at the beginning,
we need to identify and

13
00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:52.668
understand who our audience is,
really before we try and do anything else.

14
00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:57.600
And even if it's an existing app
that you're working on, please,

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.546
please make sure that is clearly
defined before you go any further.

16
00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:07.352
Otherwise, you're gonna constantly
be hitting disagreements over what

17
00:01:07.352 --> 00:01:11.772
needs to be in or what needs to be out
of the app because people will have

18
00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:14.768
different views about
who the audiences are.

19
00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:18.944
So basically what we need to
do is segment our audiences,

20
00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:22.777
which is a marketing term but
actually very useful.

21
00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:27.515
If you start thinking of your audiences
as just big chunks of people and

22
00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:31.769
there's this kind of vague idea
of the kind of person they are,

23
00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:37.257
then that lacks the clarity that you need
and it needs to be done better than that.

24
00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:42.107
However, the way that I would suggest
that you segment your audiences maybe

25
00:01:42.107 --> 00:01:46.678
a little bit different from how many
people think about segmentation.

26
00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:51.540
Because most people when they think
about segmentation are thinking about it

27
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.570
from a marketing perspective.

28
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.211
So marketing people tend to
segment around demographics or

29
00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:03.328
socioeconomic groups or
interest groups and that kind of thing.

30
00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:07.525
For us, it's fine to think in those terms,

31
00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:12.408
to picture a stay-at-home mum or
whatever else.

32
00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:17.942
But in terms of how you decide to split
out your audience, you wanna split them

33
00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:23.840
out based on different criteria to things
like demographics and stuff like that.

34
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.508
So for example,
different questions, right?

35
00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:33.759
If there's an audience that
has a certain set of questions

36
00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.903
that they come to your app with or
certain objections, or

37
00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:45.994
certain challenges that they face,
then that makes a good audience, right?

38
00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:48.524
To segment them in that regards.

39
00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:51.852
Tasks is another really good example,
right?

40
00:02:51.852 --> 00:02:56.935
If an audience wants to complete
different tasks to another audience,

41
00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:00.083
that's a good way of splitting it, right?

42
00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:06.095
Or they've got different needs, then you
wanna split it along those lines as well.

43
00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:11.927
So that task app example I gave from
earlier is a really good example of this.

44
00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:18.323
That project managers,
stay at home mums and a freelancer for

45
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:25.339
example, that would be an obvious
way of splitting your audience.

46
00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.237
Because freelancer, project managers and

47
00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:32.385
stay at home moms have very
different questions that they ask,

48
00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:37.572
very different tasks they wanna complete,
and very different needs, okay?

49
00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:42.593
Well, if you looked at it from
a purely demographic point of view,

50
00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:46.362
actually they could have
all ended up falling into

51
00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:50.594
the same demographic of
certain socioeconomic group.

52
00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:55.621
But it's their needs that define them
rather than their demographics is,

53
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:57.793
I guess, what I'm getting at.

54
00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:03.392
So looking at your audience in
those terms is very important.

55
00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:07.504
You might also wanna
consider the other little

56
00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:11.100
aspect of this is usage level of the app.

57
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.087
So, if someone is just
using the app occasionally,

58
00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:18.439
then they are gonna have
different needs and

59
00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:23.439
different requirements to somebody
who's using it regularly.

60
00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:27.878
Equally, somebody who's using it for the
first time is gonna have very different

61
00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:31.030
needs to somebody who's been using it for
donkeys years or

62
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.919
different perspective, right?

63
00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.798
So it's hard for me to give specific
advice about how you segment, but

64
00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:41.025
thinking around those needs,
those tasks and

65
00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:44.760
those questions will get
you in the right direction.

66
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.904
And then once that has been done,
then it's a matter of beginning to

67
00:04:49.904 --> 00:04:55.153
put together a bit of an empathy map or
a persona around those people.

68
00:04:55.153 --> 00:05:00.117
Now, I tend to avoid using the P word,
the persona word.

69
00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:04.431
And that has come about
because if you say persona,

70
00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:09.648
you can pretty much guarantee
someone in either the marketing

71
00:05:09.648 --> 00:05:14.060
department or
senior management will go, yeah,

72
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.999
we produced a persona last year,
we can use that, right?

73
00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.951
But the information that they will have
on their personas will be marketing

74
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.605
information and not the information
that you actually need, right?

75
00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:33.404
So you're better off creating,
calling it something like an empathy map.

76
00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:35.150
It's basically the same thing, but

77
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.652
it has different information on stuff
that we need as product designers.

78
00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:40.818
So it's things like questions and tasks,

79
00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:43.055
what tasks are the user
trying to complete?

80
00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:46.569
What questions or
objections they need answering.

81
00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:47.780
Pain points.

82
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.148
What pain points are users experiencing?

83
00:05:51.148 --> 00:05:51.985
Goals.

84
00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:55.400
What's users ultimate goal,
what they're trying to achieve?

85
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.385
Their journey.

86
00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:59.154
Where is the user on their journey and

87
00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:02.648
what if any interactions that they had so
far?

88
00:06:02.648 --> 00:06:07.706
What's influencing them in using the app,
whether it be people,

89
00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:13.687
things, places, whatever, and
how are they feeling about the experience.

90
00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:20.157
So I tend to take each of my segments,
create an empathy map around those.

91
00:06:20.157 --> 00:06:25.846
But obviously I need to do some user
research in order to understand

92
00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:30.637
what's in those, and so
that is a big part of it as well.

93
00:06:30.637 --> 00:06:36.571
But that is more covered in the the course
that I've done on user research and

94
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:37.415
testing.

95
00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:41.803
So once you've kind of
segmented your audience,

96
00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:45.875
you then need to think
about their use cases and

97
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.225
how they're gonna be using your app.

98
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:54.972
And the process that I go through with
that is I start by just gathering

99
00:06:54.972 --> 00:07:01.432
lots of tasks that I think that my
different audiences will need to complete.

100
00:07:01.432 --> 00:07:05.610
And there are loads of sources you
can go to to work out what these are.

101
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.398
You can look at existing
customer feedback,

102
00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:13.674
you can look at site behavior,

103
00:07:13.674 --> 00:07:18.844
you can talk to stakeholders
within both users.

104
00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:22.241
They're a type of stakeholder,
but also internal stakeholders,

105
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:25.826
especially people that are dealing
with customers on a regular basis.

106
00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:30.815
You can look at search analytics or
you can do competitive analysis,

107
00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:35.975
look at social media, there are all
these kinds of ways that you can kind

108
00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:40.806
of gather a list of things that
someone might wanna do with the app.

109
00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:41.939
Lots of those,

110
00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:46.827
however, require you to have an app
in order to be able to do those.

111
00:07:46.827 --> 00:07:47.466
Not all of them.

112
00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:51.428
You can still look at the competition,
for example.

113
00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:53.084
You can still look at social media.

114
00:07:53.084 --> 00:07:58.016
But if you are struggling to come
up with a big old list of tasks

115
00:07:58.016 --> 00:08:02.661
that your particular segment
might wanna do on your app,

116
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:06.754
then you can cheat and
ask Chat GPT instead [LAUGH].

117
00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:10.362
Cause it is remarkably good
at coming up with ideas and

118
00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:13.421
brainstorming just to
kind of get you going.

119
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:16.628
Is that the legitimate and
sensible way of doing it?

120
00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:17.847
Absolutely not.

121
00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:24.040
But we'll cut corners sometimes
in order to move things forward.

122
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.419
So yeah,
you basically here's an example I wrote as

123
00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:33.206
an employee of a particular
university on an HR website.

124
00:08:33.206 --> 00:08:35.765
What kind of things might I
wanna do on that website?

125
00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.651
And then it's suggested a load of
things that I might wanna do and

126
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.532
it did a really good job at it, actually.

127
00:08:40.532 --> 00:08:43.429
Cuz in that case I had
done the user research and

128
00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.081
it got a big chunk of the tasks
that I had on my list already.

129
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:51.002
So it does a pretty good job actually,
shockingly.

130
00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:55.223
Then once I've got that list of tasks,
I tend to like turning them into user

131
00:08:55.223 --> 00:08:58.517
story cards, which has been,
I think I stole from Agile.

132
00:08:58.517 --> 00:09:00.649
Is it Agile that uses user story cards?

133
00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:01.896
It doesn't.

134
00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:06.469
I just find it a really nice
way of kind of formatting these

135
00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:08.862
things that people wanna do.

136
00:09:08.862 --> 00:09:12.188
So I ended up with a big
pile of user story cards,

137
00:09:12.188 --> 00:09:17.522
which formatted like this as a,
whatever the segment is, stay at home mum.

138
00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:21.723
I want to easily organize
my grocery list so

139
00:09:21.723 --> 00:09:27.688
that I can get out of the supermarket
as quickly as possible.

140
00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:32.576
And I know when I'm done when I've
got all my food home and packed away,

141
00:09:32.576 --> 00:09:34.465
that's a user story card.

142
00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:38.616
It's not complicated to do,
but it's very useful.

143
00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:43.291
So you'll end up with this
stack ton of tasks that

144
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.967
somebody might wanna do and
you'll end up with so

145
00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:53.684
many that you are now presented
with a problem, all right?

146
00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:59.043
Of if you built an app that accommodated
all of these tasks, it would be unusable.

147
00:09:59.043 --> 00:10:03.963
Now any of you remember
before Microsoft Office

148
00:10:03.963 --> 00:10:08.153
introduced the ribbon design, right?

149
00:10:08.153 --> 00:10:12.351
We had these massive drop-down menus
of all these different functions.

150
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:14.206
Photoshop used to be like it as well.

151
00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:17.731
It was a nightmare,
in fact it still is if I'm honest,

152
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:20.733
of loads of palettes and
drop-downs and all.

153
00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:25.800
They've just got so much functionality
crammed into the thing and

154
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.523
no real hierarchy in that, right?

155
00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:32.083
Isn't that, well, if you look
at the Microsoft Office ribbon,

156
00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:35.514
it's taken the most used things
that you use most of the time and

157
00:10:35.514 --> 00:10:37.410
pulled them to the front, right?

158
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.466
That's good design, okay?
