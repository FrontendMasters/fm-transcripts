00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.479
So, I'd prefer to do a few crazy eight,
get people thinking,

2
00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.689
get people feeling a little bit engaged,
and

3
00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.087
then typically I'll move on
to low-fidelity prototyping,

4
00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:16.843
which is me then iterating on what
I did in the crazy eight session.

5
00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:20.719
I don't always use crazy eight,
there are other ways of doing it but

6
00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.897
that's one of them that I quite like.

7
00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:29.480
So with the low fidelity prototyping,
yeah, you can use paper prototyping.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.960
Like I said, I think it's best
suited to workshop exercises.

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.949
When you're trying to create
a large number of ideas quickly.

10
00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:43.010
It has got big bonuses to it, I am maybe a
little bit sneery about paper prototyping,

11
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.995
for a start I can't say, but
actually it's pretty good in other ways.

12
00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:54.379
For a start it's a low barrier, anybody
could do a pen and Paper prototype, right?

13
00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.724
No special skills are required
which is brilliant.

14
00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:02.447
It means that everybody in the room,
can feel engaged with it,

15
00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:04.497
also everybody can participate.

16
00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:08.398
The problem, sometimes the problem is,
like, say if you use,

17
00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:12.676
I know Figma above surname,
one of these prototyping tools, right?

18
00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.828
There's somebody sitting
in front of a laptop and

19
00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:16.682
ultimately they're in control, right?

20
00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:20.713
It's not an inclusive exercise,
while paper prototyping is very inclusive.

21
00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:25.290
It's obviously fast to create,
sketching out only takes a few seconds and

22
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.013
it's disposable because it's so
easy to create, people are not attached to

23
00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:34.681
their sketch, which can be a problem
with more high fidelity prototyping.

24
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:40.738
And of course it's cost effective, right,
cuz there's no special equipment required.

25
00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:43.582
So, there's, it's got its place but for

26
00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:47.301
me it's a bit earlier it's
in that workshop exercise.

27
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:52.895
Once I come out of the workshop,
I tend to move to Greyscale prototyping.

28
00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.387
So this is where you can see what
they look like on the screen,

29
00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.223
they're basically, we don't worry
too much about the design but

30
00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:05.038
we're more worried about the structure and
the organization of the information.

31
00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:09.334
Why I like greyscale prototyping is
it's still pretty fast to create,

32
00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:13.138
especially if you've got the right
tools and the right set up.

33
00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:17.943
So, there are various tools that
we'll come on to think in a minute.

34
00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:21.889
They can be, to be honest they can
almost be as quick as paper prototyping,

35
00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.979
especially when you wanna make changes
they're actually quicker, right?

36
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.056
Cuz you're not rubbing stuff out,
you're just dragging boxes around and

37
00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:32.200
things like that which is quite quick.

38
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.994
Focuses on the functionality don't
get caught up in aesthetics which can

39
00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:44.544
be a minefield, if you don't have already
established kind of brand guidelines.

40
00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:48.559
And they're ideal for
testing cuz they're realistic enough for

41
00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.698
people to understand them and
interact with them.

42
00:02:51.698 --> 00:02:55.797
And there's some great
prototyping tools out there.

43
00:02:55.797 --> 00:03:00.010
So, we've got basically two
options that are tools that

44
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.576
are dedicated to doing this
kinda greyscale prototyping, so

45
00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:08.555
balsamic is probably one of
the most well known ones.

46
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:13.099
Really low barrier of entry, which
means that you can get lots of people

47
00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.368
involved in prototyping,
very intuitive to use.

48
00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:23.944
But tend to be maybe a little
bit low lower far greyscale.

49
00:03:23.944 --> 00:03:29.332
Alternatively, there are loads
of kind of Figma templates

50
00:03:29.332 --> 00:03:33.761
that you can download that
let you do greyscale.

51
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:38.347
But another tool that I'm quite a fan of,
there's kinda middle ground between

52
00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:42.316
faffing around in Figma which is a lot
of work about summit which feels

53
00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:45.878
a little bit lightweight sometimes,
is a toggle whimsical,

54
00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:50.010
which probably never heard of,
I only stumbled across it by accident.

55
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.246
And whimsical lets you do both
user flows and sitemaps and

56
00:03:55.246 --> 00:04:00.156
then full wireframes but
it's very Dragon Droppy and

57
00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:06.069
I find it quite easy to churn out
greyscale wireframes via that.

58
00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.636
Yeah, so, it's pretty good, it's worth to
play with and see what you think yourself
