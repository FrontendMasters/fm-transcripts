1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.353
You've cleaned your results,
all the tasks that you want a user to do.

2
00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:09.839
We know which ones are the most
important to users, the top third or so.

3
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.200
You'll be able to see the sudden drop-off.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.258
So now we need to organize around these,
right?

5
00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:25.670
In our application, and actually in our
applications that can be quite tricky.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.712
I find that a lot of applications
don't put as much attention into their

7
00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:36.186
information architecture and navigation
as more traditional websites do.

8
00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.849
And so you have to be very careful and

9
00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:45.968
consider how you structure and
how you place information.

10
00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:49.369
So a classic example is, in a lot of apps,

11
00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:54.137
the settings section is where
functionality goes to die,

12
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.852
it just gets filled up
with all kinds of crap.

13
00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:00.140
So there's lot of thought
that needs to go into that.

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.865
And a lot of thought needs to
be done around things like your

15
00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:06.452
top-level navigation in particular,

16
00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:10.269
those immediately available
options that are available.

17
00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:15.120
And that's because if people start off
right, they get that first click correct,

18
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.137
then they're much more likely to be
able to navigate to the feature or

19
00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:21.237
piece of functionality they need.

20
00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:26.002
So spend a bit of time making sure
that those top tasks are instantly in

21
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.147
people's faces and visible.

22
00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:33.217
So there are all kinds of ways of
working on information architecture and

23
00:01:33.217 --> 00:01:37.786
I'll go into this in a lot more
detail in the course on research and

24
00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:40.213
testing so I will skim over it now.

25
00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:43.645
But certainly look at things
like using Open Card Sorting and

26
00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.539
Closed Card Sorting when
it comes to organizing and

27
00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.248
structuring the information
on your website.

28
00:01:49.248 --> 00:01:52.315
You also consider Tree Testing as well.

29
00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:56.973
There are some great tools out
there that make it really easy if

30
00:01:56.973 --> 00:02:01.093
you've never seen Tree Testing
before then, sorry,

31
00:02:01.093 --> 00:02:06.827
Card Sorting before is basically you
just ask users to take those top tasks,

32
00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.694
those main things people want to do and

33
00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:13.572
group them in ways that
make sense to them, right?

34
00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:17.046
So instead of just organizing
all your features and

35
00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:21.890
functionality in ways that make sense
to you, we get users to do that and

36
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.283
they kind of group it together in
a way that resonates with them.

37
00:02:26.283 --> 00:02:31.448
And you can, there's some great tools
out there, I tend to use one called

38
00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:37.045
UX metrics to do this kind of work cuz it
enables you to do card sorting remotely.

39
00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:40.612
I would encourage you
to checkout my course

40
00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:44.880
that covers this kind of
thing in a lot more detail.

41
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.923
But yeah, you can go in and
you can easily create a new card sort and

42
00:02:49.923 --> 00:02:54.692
you can basically give it a name,
you give it all the tasks that

43
00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:58.761
you wanna add into it,
that people are organizing.

44
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.814
And then they organize them in
whatever way makes sense to them,

45
00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.709
it only takes a few minutes to set up,
it's super easy to do.

46
00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.972
And then you'll get a lot of results back.

47
00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:14.084
And you can basically review where people
have assigned cards what they work,

48
00:03:14.084 --> 00:03:20.400
what they grouped them in, where have
they placed them, and that very broadly.

49
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.047
And this is a massive oversimplification
can be used as the basis for

50
00:03:26.047 --> 00:03:28.631
your top-level navigation.

51
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.957
Again, go check out the other course
to get into this in a lot more detail.

52
00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:37.931
So, and actually increasingly
I'm using Chat GPT to

53
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.695
help me do look at these results and
organize them.

54
00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:44.532
Because you'll find a lot of,

55
00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:48.987
obviously if people can organize things
into any buckets that make sense to

56
00:03:48.987 --> 00:03:53.387
them everybody's gonna word those
buckets in slightly different ways.

57
00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:58.845
One person might call it settings,
another one might call it admin,

58
00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:03.846
or slightly different wording and
different stuff like that.

59
00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:08.946
So Chat GPT is really good at helping
you find conceptually similar groups and

60
00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:13.890
combining those together rather than
you having to go manually through and

61
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.415
find things that are really similar.

62
00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:20.362
It can also total up any
votes from combined groups,

63
00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:25.577
which means that you can still see
which groups are the most popular.

64
00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:30.662
And you can even give it
constraints like only allow me

65
00:04:30.662 --> 00:04:36.771
to only have seven sections as
a maximum or something like that.

66
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:41.407
And yeah, you can assign different
functions then automatically to different

67
00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:43.149
groups, all using Chat GPT.

68
00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.138
I'll talk this all through in a lot
more detail in the other course.

69
00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:51.149
But it's that basis of
identify your top tasks,

70
00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:58.985
organize things around those top tasks
basically makes a huge difference.

71
00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:02.507
Just a little bit of advice when
you're creating your apps and

72
00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:05.159
organizing things fewer
options are better.

73
00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.387
We can only hold about four
things in our short-term memory,

74
00:05:09.387 --> 00:05:12.166
which sucks but that's humans for you.

75
00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:15.199
And that's why your
credit card has 16 digit

76
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.857
numbers split into four groups of four.

77
00:05:17.857 --> 00:05:21.459
So as anytime you have
more than four sections,

78
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:26.785
you're making people think harder and
people don't like thinking.

79
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.287
If you've got to have
more than four options,

80
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.632
maybe consider grouping those
different options together.

81
00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:39.126
So, for example, it would be common
to have your kinda main navigation,

82
00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:43.654
which would be a four
primary sections in your app.

83
00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:46.930
But also have secondary navigation
that has things like contact,

84
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.630
there are settings, admin,
that kind of thing in it.

85
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.199
So you're kinda grouping things.

86
00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.971
Keep your label short whenever possible,
one or two words maximum.

87
00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:03.607
Be very careful to ensure that there's
no ambiguity in the wordings being used.

88
00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:08.659
So classic examples of this is
the use of jargon, where people don't

89
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.075
know what the word is talking about,
but also even real words sometimes.

90
00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:18.765
The example I give on the user research
and testing course is I worked once on

91
00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:24.133
a university website, trying to attract
undergraduates to attend the university.

92
00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.703
And we did some usability testing
where we asked them to go and

93
00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:32.259
find certain course information for,
and how to apply and things like that.

94
00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:38.160
And as we ran the test, on several of the
tests, we found that these undergraduates

95
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.325
looking for course information ended
up in the alumni section, right?

96
00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:46.923
And after it happened,
I think the second or

97
00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:52.090
third time I said to the person,
why are you in alumni, right?

98
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.413
And the answer I got back was I didn't
know what the word alumni meant.

99
00:06:56.413 --> 00:07:00.681
So I thought maybe what I'm looking for
might be in there.

100
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:05.199
So actually words can be,
you can send people off on

101
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.729
completely the wrong route,
so avoid ambiguity.

102
00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:15.610
Also, options that are too similar
to one another can be a big problem.

103
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.476
So for example sometimes you go on
a website where it has sectors and

104
00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:24.949
industries, well, hang on a minute.

105
00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:29.686
What's the difference between those two,
and so you're left unsure of which to

106
00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:33.319
go into look for case studies or
whatever it is you're after.

107
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.567
And also don't throw too many clicks.

108
00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:43.400
So there's this kind of thing that goes
round that users don't like to click.

109
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.818
And that the research doesn't
really support that anymore.

110
00:07:46.818 --> 00:07:51.490
It certainly was a thing for a long, long
time back in the the pre-broadband days

111
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.458
where if you clicked,
you had to wait ten minutes.

112
00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:59.475
But these days users are pretty
happy clicking their way around, and

113
00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:04.320
so as long as they feel that they're
going in the right direction,

114
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.672
you don't have a huge problem.

115
00:08:06.672 --> 00:08:10.678
So once you've got your top-level
navigation in place, built around your top

116
00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:14.226
tasks, there'll be a whole load of
other tasks that people wanna do.

117
00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:17.491
And you're like, well,
how do they fit into all of this as well?

118
00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:21.831
So what I then tend to do is take those
secondary tasks that somebody might wanna

119
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:22.948
do on the website and

120
00:08:22.948 --> 00:08:26.923
see whether they fit in with
the navigation I've just made up, right?

121
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.769
Based on the top task analysis.

122
00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:32.247
So this is where I tend
to do a closed card sort.

123
00:08:32.247 --> 00:08:35.955
And a closed card sort is
very similar to an open card

124
00:08:35.955 --> 00:08:40.626
sort except that the sections
that I created are already there.

125
00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:45.397
And all people have got to do is put
those into the different buckets,

126
00:08:45.397 --> 00:08:48.863
whichever bucket they
feel is most appropriate.

127
00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:52.306
But notice I've added an extra
bucket called I'm not sure.

128
00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:55.426
So that if people drop in stuff
into the not sure section,

129
00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:59.731
they've got somewhere to put it if they
don't know what to do with it, right?

130
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:04.031
So this way you can now find out
whether all those tiny tasks or

131
00:09:04.031 --> 00:09:08.602
those little secondary things
fit into your navigation or not.

132
00:09:08.602 --> 00:09:11.618
Again, it's really,
really simple to set up.

133
00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.624
You click Create a Closed Card, so

134
00:09:14.624 --> 00:09:19.611
you add all the groups of
your top-level navigation in.

135
00:09:19.611 --> 00:09:24.398
So that people can organize into that and
then you just add all of your tasks in and

136
00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:27.334
people can just drag them
around as they want to.

137
00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:32.265
But then what you'll end up with is you'll
be able to see where all the cards have

138
00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:37.345
been assigned, which groups are in and
what you'll do is you'll get an agreement

139
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:42.300
score where it tells you how many people
agree that it should be in that section.

140
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.252
So this card for example, at the top
there have life insurance, right?

141
00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:49.952
Has been put in benefits,

142
00:09:49.952 --> 00:09:55.600
227 times 99% of people
putting it in benefits,

143
00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.387
if you get that kind of
result that's golden,

144
00:10:00.387 --> 00:10:03.967
that's just wonderful, right?

145
00:10:03.967 --> 00:10:05.859
So basically, most of the time,

146
00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.112
you're just assigning things
to the top group, right?

147
00:10:09.112 --> 00:10:12.106
The group where it fits.

148
00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:16.455
But sometimes you'll get low
agreement scores, right?

149
00:10:16.455 --> 00:10:20.623
So this one's got
an agreement score of 40%.

150
00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:26.634
And what's particularly interesting
about this one is 92 times it's been

151
00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:31.640
put in working at UF and
87 times it's been put into contacts.

152
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.029
So basically, both of those
sections are pretty much equal, so

153
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.887
they could be an either of those, right?

154
00:10:38.887 --> 00:10:39.908
So now what do you do?

155
00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:41.938
You're kinda stuck as to where to put it.

156
00:10:41.938 --> 00:10:44.598
Well, it's not that big a deal,

157
00:10:44.598 --> 00:10:49.253
you just cross a link from one
to the other, issue solved.

158
00:10:49.253 --> 00:10:55.506
But also you'll get some stuff like this
one that's been put into not sure, right?

159
00:10:55.506 --> 00:10:56.715
That's a bit worrying.

160
00:10:56.715 --> 00:11:00.703
Most people have put it into not sure,
that's worrying, right?

161
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.057
No, not really.

162
00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:07.974
Because if you look at it,
94 people have put it into not sure,

163
00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:11.261
88 have put it into working at UF,

164
00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:15.973
which means that if there
was no not sure category,

165
00:11:15.973 --> 00:11:20.273
which there isn't on a live website,
right?

166
00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:24.554
Most people would have settled for
go looking in working in UF.

167
00:11:24.554 --> 00:11:27.397
So you could probably in that case
just put it into working in UF and

168
00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:28.495
you'll be fine, yeah.

169
00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:30.879
&gt;&gt; Is that percentage just for
the first line?

170
00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:35.591
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, so
it's saying 41% have put it in,

171
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:38.854
I'm not sure, out of all the votes.

172
00:11:38.854 --> 00:11:44.097
&gt;&gt; It's curious that they don't now
the percentages for the other ones.

173
00:11:44.097 --> 00:11:46.225
&gt;&gt; It's mainly the top one you care about.

174
00:11:46.225 --> 00:11:49.130
I think it's a great example of you
probably, if you put percentages for

175
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.333
all of them it would have
just been a bit overwhelming.

176
00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:56.587
I actually I quite liked the fact that it
doesn't makes it cleaner personally but,

177
00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:57.563
so basically,

178
00:11:57.563 --> 00:12:02.681
assign cards in the not sure to whatever
the next highest winner is in most cases.

179
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.157
I mean, none of this is an exact
science when you're working on

180
00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:07.809
information architecture.

181
00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:11.689
A lot of the time, you just have to
make a judgment call about what to do,

182
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.737
what feels right.

183
00:12:12.737 --> 00:12:16.428
But push comes to shove,
my general rule of thumb is,

184
00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:22.271
if something has got an agreement score
of over about 50% I don't panic too much.

185
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:26.758
And most not sure options are added
to the second most common group.

186
00:12:26.758 --> 00:12:31.738
And also you can do a thing called
tree testing just to double

187
00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:34.837
check any of this afterwards later.

188
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.232
Sometimes if you've got an app
that's particularly complicated,

189
00:12:38.232 --> 00:12:40.757
you might have even lower
sections involved in it.

190
00:12:40.757 --> 00:12:45.248
So basically my rule of thumb
is if there's more than about

191
00:12:45.248 --> 00:12:46.958
what have I done there?

192
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:53.401
Yeah, if there's more than about seven-ish
tasks within any particular section,

193
00:12:53.401 --> 00:12:57.707
I'll probably look at dividing
it into sub-sections.

194
00:12:57.707 --> 00:13:01.832
So that you're not overwhelming people
with a big long list of tasks they're

195
00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:06.034
doing at any one time, and there's
a couple of options for dealing with that.

196
00:13:06.034 --> 00:13:09.934
You could do more card
sorting if you wanted to but

197
00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:13.741
most of the time I just
make an educated guess and

198
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:19.563
I won't read this whole thing but
I even get Chat GPT to help me with that.

199
00:13:19.563 --> 00:13:22.848
And I ask it to access
an information architecture and

200
00:13:22.848 --> 00:13:24.747
make some suggestions for me.

201
00:13:24.747 --> 00:13:28.351
You'll get the slide deck, you can pump
it in yourself and see what happens.

202
00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:32.391
But it's pretty good Chat GPT is
pretty good at organizing things that

203
00:13:32.391 --> 00:13:36.782
are conceptually similar and labeling
those things is good with language.

204
00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:39.073
It's a large language model.

205
00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:42.732
So I don't always use it as it is but
it's useful.
