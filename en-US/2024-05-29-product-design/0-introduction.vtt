00:00:00.064 --> 00:00:03.862
Thank you very much for joining me for
this course on the product design,

2
00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:07.660
where we're gonna also look at
prototyping the role of design systems,

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.173
all that kind of good stuff.

4
00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:13.706
And I think probably a good place to
start is for me to introduce myself

5
00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:18.259
a little bit, and why I've decided
to do this particular workshop.

6
00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.961
So my name is Paul Boag.

7
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:25.230
Now, the next bit is going to be
really hard for you to believe, but

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.764
trust me, it's true.

9
00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:30.004
I've been working in
the industry 30 years now.

10
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:36.440
I know I don't look like I would have been
born 30 years ago, but what can I say?

11
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.602
I've aged very well.

12
00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:41.233
So, I've spent 30 years
working in digital and

13
00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.877
primarily focusing around user
experience and that side of things.

14
00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:48.082
But when you've been working
in the industry this long,

15
00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.085
you have done development too, and

16
00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:53.983
you have done pretty much everything
you can imagine over that time.

17
00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:59.213
But I've also got extensive experience
in designing web apps, which is really

18
00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:04.616
the heart for product design is about,
and where we're gonna be focusing today.

19
00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:07.783
So, I've worked with all kinds
of different companies for

20
00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:09.505
all different kinds of things.

21
00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:12.437
I've worked on enterprise web apps before.

22
00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:15.943
I've worked on B2C, SaaS companies, and

23
00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:19.843
worked with across range
of different sectors.

24
00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:24.944
I'm everything you could possibly imagine,
some of my clients

25
00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:30.049
include people like Shopify,
Puma, UK government, UNICEF.

26
00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.655
So as you can see, pretty much quite
a wide range of different projects and

27
00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.671
different work over that time.

28
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:39.916
So, I'm hoping I tell you
this not to show off,

29
00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:45.113
although obviously I'm amazing, but
[LAUGH] primarily to say that what I'm

30
00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:50.087
gonna talk about today will apply
in almost all circumstances, right?

31
00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:55.797
So, whether you work on government
procurement applications or

32
00:01:55.797 --> 00:02:01.297
whether you work on the trendy
latest Silicon Valley start up,

33
00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:05.988
then hopefully there'll be
something here for you.

34
00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:08.021
So, what are we going to look at?

35
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:12.887
Well basically, this workshop breaks
down into kind of five different

36
00:02:12.887 --> 00:02:16.632
sections that we're gonna
work through over the day.

37
00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:21.606
We gonna start by looking at
Product Design Fundamentals, right?

38
00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:26.148
Answering basic questions like,
what is product design?

39
00:02:26.148 --> 00:02:29.103
Cuz you'd think that be
an easy question to answer,

40
00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:32.610
but no, it's,
people can't agree on anything these days.

41
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.806
So, we're gonna talk
about that a little bit.

42
00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:40.229
We're also gonna talk about the role of
Use Cases and understand your audience,

43
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:45.668
and understanding what they're trying
to achieve through your applications.

44
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:50.253
And for those of you who've seen my
course on user research and testing,

45
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:55.062
you might recognize the term top task,
where we talk a little bit about how to

46
00:02:55.062 --> 00:03:00.026
identify the main things that somebody
wants to do through your application,

47
00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:02.010
and how to build around those.

48
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.943
Then we gonna spend a bit of
time talking about Figma, and

49
00:03:04.943 --> 00:03:07.336
prototyping in Figma,
and the role of Figma.

50
00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:11.762
Increasingly Figma has become
the go-to tool when it comes to

51
00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:15.008
creating prototypes for SAS applications.

52
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:22.287
And prototyping is a crucial part of the
process of creating any kind of web app.

53
00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:23.627
So, we're gonna look at that.

54
00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:26.686
We're then gonna explore
testing our prototypes, and

55
00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:30.982
which is obviously fundamental to the
success of any kind of web application,

56
00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:35.036
putting in front of real people, and
getting their real reactions to it.

57
00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.195
And then finally,

58
00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:40.405
I'm gonna circle back down around
to the subject of design systems.

59
00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:44.492
Now, design systems are useful
in all kinds of scenarios, but

60
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:49.585
particularly when we're talking about
a web application, as you're adding

61
00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:54.909
new functionality and new things to your
application over time, having a good and

62
00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.027
easy way to prototype those things and
then build them is crucial for success.
