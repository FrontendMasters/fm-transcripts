WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:04.755
And then eventually we'll kind of
move on to more high fidelity.

2
00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:09.375
So this is really where I wanna start
kind of doing a little bit more in depth

3
00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.055
testing.

4
00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:13.124
I wanna kind of get into it and
a little bit more detail.

5
00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:17.643
And like I said, these eventually can
become functional specifications for

6
00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.670
your developer, which is great.

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.708
So your options there
are your clickable prototype,

8
00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:26.857
which is a kind of good enough prototype.

9
00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:31.856
I think a lot of people,
especially when they're designing apps,

10
00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:36.594
they kind of wanna do every kind
of interaction and animation and

11
00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:40.471
everything that goes into that prototype,
right?

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:42.734
And they try and create it all in Figma.

13
00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:48.505
Well, I understand that and
I don't disapprove of that.

14
00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:54.381
I think it is perfectly fine, but
sometimes it's kind of overkill and

15
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:59.573
it's better off to kind of just
do a basic clickable version.

16
00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:04.640
And then you can kind of brief
the developer on what fancy animations you

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.891
want and all of that kind of stuff rather
than try and recreate it in Figma.

18
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:15.029
In part because Figma's pretty weak
when it comes to clickable prototypes or

19
00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:17.805
interactive prototypes, should I say.

20
00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:18.839
It's buggy.

21
00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:22.607
Is it just me that finds it buggy?

22
00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:26.188
It's fine with basic,
go from this screen to this screen, but

23
00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:28.893
once you start having overlays and
modals, and

24
00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:32.491
things are animated and
stuff like that, it often gets messy.

25
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:36.814
And you can waste a lot of time faffing
around trying to get this to work when

26
00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:41.489
it would have been probably more sensible
to say to the developer putting note in

27
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.873
the Figma file saying,
I'd like it to do this, please.

28
00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:48.885
I don't know whether the developers would
agree, they might wanna actually see it,

29
00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:50.733
but that's my kind of feeling over it.

30
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:56.024
Quiet, hands go up, you beat, you won just
by a fraction of a second, go for it.

31
00:01:56.024 --> 00:01:58.081
&gt;&gt; Well,
what about just doing a special element?

32
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:00.218
So like if you need
a specific interaction,

33
00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:02.758
you don't need to include it on a page but
actually,

34
00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:05.961
if you're prototyping single element,
then it's less buggy.

35
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, is right.

36
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.128
Yeah, I mean, sometimes you can do that.

37
00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:15.839
And that's a kind of nice middle ground
if you can get away with just doing it in

38
00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:16.428
places.

39
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:19.285
Also, of course,
the other thing you can do is,

40
00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:23.888
if you show one example of an interaction
on one part of the app doesn't mean you

41
00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:26.574
have to recreate it absolutely everywhere.

42
00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:28.345
One example is often enough.

43
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:30.332
So there are kind of ways around it.

44
00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:32.843
But yeah, sorry.

45
00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:36.116
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about blocks and modules.

46
00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:37.075
&gt;&gt; Yes.

47
00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:39.120
&gt;&gt; Do you have a preference
of what to call them?

48
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.360
I hear a variety of different-
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna come on to that later.

49
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.032
So yeah, I'm gonna talk about some
of the different elements and

50
00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.088
when you use them because
that's a big part of it.

51
00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:51.058
So we're gonna talk about design systems.

52
00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:55.860
And part of problem with design
systems is you focus very much on what

53
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.673
these things look like,
not necessarily when you should use them.

54
00:03:00.673 --> 00:03:03.389
And that's just as important, but
we'll come to that in a minute.

55
00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.325
So why do I like clickable prototypes?

56
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:11.262
Well, it's a chance to start messing
around with the aesthetics when you start

57
00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:13.507
doing a high fidelity clickable prototype.

58
00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:18.276
And stakeholders can see how the brand
has been applied to the interface.

59
00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:23.026
And also you can use,
do some testing around aesthetics and

60
00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:25.312
the context that provides.

61
00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:30.247
Again, I talk about testing aesthetics
in the user research and testing one,

62
00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:32.728
so I won't get into that too much here.

63
00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:38.100
Then, of course, with a clickable
prototype you can do navigational testing,

64
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.472
so you can test whether users are able to
successfully navigate the interface and

65
00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:45.605
hierarchical testing as well,

66
00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:50.832
whether they can find the most important
page elements on an individual page.

67
00:03:50.832 --> 00:03:54.570
So I'm talking about the hierarchy
within an individual screen because

68
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.014
it's easy to miss pieces of
functionality and that kind of stuff.

69
00:03:58.014 --> 00:04:01.116
And I will touch a little bit
on prototyping in a minute,

70
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:05.811
but there are some great prototyping tools
out there that you might wanna check out.

71
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.779
Listen is one that I find is great for
certain tests, and

72
00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.623
I'll tell you about those later.

73
00:04:10.623 --> 00:04:16.550
Maze is another I really like that,
again, aren't too expensive.

74
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.949
So they work really well and they're great
for doing testing clickable prototypes.

75
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.229
If you wanna go full blown, great,
do a fully interactive prototype,

76
00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.333
and you've got the time and resources
to be able to do it by all means,

77
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:37.797
recreate as much of the finest experience
as you possibly can and want to.

78
00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:42.944
Including animations and the ability
to interact with interface elements,

79
00:04:42.944 --> 00:04:47.932
I'm less worried about the animations but
being able to show how different

80
00:04:47.932 --> 00:04:52.066
interactive elements work is
pretty useful in a lot of cases.

81
00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:55.313
So these create a much more
realistic experience and

82
00:04:55.313 --> 00:04:57.244
a basic clickable prototype.

83
00:04:57.244 --> 00:05:00.608
They act as a great specifications for
developers,

84
00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:03.132
don't require developers to question

85
00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:08.117
you all the time about what you meant by
this or how you want it meant it to work.

86
00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:11.773
And a really big one is
there a great sales tool,

87
00:05:11.773 --> 00:05:15.804
a really slick prototype,
really console people.

88
00:05:15.804 --> 00:05:17.632
And when stakeholders all over or

89
00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:21.624
even if you you're looking at potential
investors and stuff like that.

90
00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:26.424
Like I said, I don't think Figma
is particularly good at those

91
00:05:26.424 --> 00:05:28.883
rich interactive prototypes.

92
00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:32.640
There are loads of other tools
around where you can import your

93
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.988
Figma file directly into it and
then create the interactions in there.

94
00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:41.809
Just in mind, is one that I like to look
at I love the fact every time I mention

95
00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.507
a product that always gets written down.

96
00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:48.541
You ignore my advice, but you're
right down when I suggest a good app.

97
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:53.247
[LAUGH] So yeah, that's really

98
00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:57.778
my approach to prototyping.

99
00:05:57.778 --> 00:06:02.813
I pick the right type of prototype for
the right situation and go from there.

100
00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:04.995
&gt;&gt; So you're taking your Figma files?

101
00:06:04.995 --> 00:06:05.550
&gt;&gt; Yes.

102
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.644
&gt;&gt; Then putting it into there, you're not
creating it all from scratch just in mind?

103
00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:13.610
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't personally,
because I like Figma and

104
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.231
I know it, but I recognize its weaknesses.

105
00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:17.321
I think you can.

106
00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.782
I'd have to remember, but

107
00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:22.218
I think you can build, you you can't-
&gt;&gt; You're taking me to add all

108
00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:23.728
the different interactions.

109
00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:25.375
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's how I work.

110
00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:30.187
So I'd go Figma for the flat screens,
import into just in mind and

111
00:06:30.187 --> 00:06:32.912
finish all the interactions there.

112
00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:37.751
But you could build the whole thing in
just in mind if you wanted to, right?

113
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:42.019
It is your choice cuz one of
the big things for me, and

114
00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.512
it's like, why has Figma not put this in?

115
00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:47.526
You can't do data entry.

116
00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:50.447
You can't type into a text field, right?

117
00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:54.652
And even if that information isn't
being saved or doing anywhere,

118
00:06:54.652 --> 00:06:58.500
it's a big part of a user flow
in an application is data entry.

119
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.834
And you can't do it within
prototyping in Figma.
