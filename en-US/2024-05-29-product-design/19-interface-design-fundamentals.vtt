1
00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:04.033
I thought I'd talk about some
interface design fundamentals because

2
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:08.327
I know a lot of people that are watching
this course may be coming from more of

3
00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:10.256
the development side of things.

4
00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:14.871
But yeah, you think, okay,
do I really wanna open that can of worms?

5
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:19.942
Cuz how many years have you guys been
studying interface [LAUGH] Designer,

6
00:00:19.942 --> 00:00:23.293
it's like, okay,
we're gonna just put this,

7
00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:26.747
just drop this in as a part
of a four hour workshop.

8
00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:31.927
So it's I can't begin to cover everything
that's involved in interface design,

9
00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:35.775
but there's a few tips I thought
I'd throw out there of things

10
00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:38.228
that I particularly pay attention to.

11
00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:41.500
So consider this a starting point.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.630
And again, Steve's course on Figma for
Developers,

13
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.861
that probably has more of them in as
well so you might wanna check that out.

14
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:50.759
So there's those three
steps of simplicity.

15
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.849
I just wanna mention them again,
because I think they work really well.

16
00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:57.491
So going through everything.

17
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.882
So often, if I'm just,
I referred earlier to an existing app.

18
00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:06.229
But I also do this if I work on a screen
in an app and I've mocked it all up, and

19
00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.144
it's all in Figma, and
everything's in place.

20
00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:16.330
And before I then show anyone, I go back
through it and do these three steps again.

21
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.296
I look at every element on that and
say, can I remove that element?

22
00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:21.598
Can I hide it?

23
00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:23.187
Can I shrink it, right?

24
00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:25.588
So I almost use it as a double check for

25
00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:31.181
my own work cuz it's amazing how you sneak
in stuff without really thinking about it.

26
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:34.508
When you're in the flow of design,
you go it'd be nice to have an icon there.

27
00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:37.909
And then afterwards, you go,
why did I put an icon there?

28
00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.805
[LAUGH] What was the point of that?

29
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:40.693
So that's great.

30
00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:44.257
The other thing which I've mentioned
before is limiting the options.

31
00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:47.838
This whole thing of we can only hold
4 things in our short term memory.

32
00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:50.101
So limit the number of
options you show at one time.

33
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:54.479
So here's a list of options
from a site that I worked on.

34
00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.447
So you click on the Options button and
it shows that blooming big list.

35
00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:01.691
Notice all the icons.

36
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:06.882
And it's like [NOISE] that's quite
an intimidating list, isn't it?

37
00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:11.276
So what I did is I did a bit of a top task
analysis on it to find out which ones

38
00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:14.297
are those options people
actually cared about.

39
00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:18.648
And then I redesigned it as that, right?

40
00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:22.163
So the others are available,
you can hit load more and

41
00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:24.597
it'll bring in the rest of the list.

42
00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:27.148
The other thing that we played
with on this particular case,

43
00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:30.009
I don't know whether we did it on the end,
whether we settled on it.

44
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:34.540
But we were looking at if you previously
had selected one of the options under load

45
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.753
more, the next time you came back,
that option had been moved up, right?

46
00:02:38.753 --> 00:02:42.365
So that the most used ones
are sitting at the top.

47
00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:46.848
The only problem we found with that when
we did a bit of testing is that then

48
00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:49.566
people went the one that
had been removed and

49
00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:52.301
put it back in the show the load more or
less.

50
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:53.983
People were like, where's that gone?

51
00:02:53.983 --> 00:02:58.525
So it was like a kind of we I can't
remember what we ended up with, but

52
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:03.228
there's lots of ways I I think is
what I'm saying that you can kind of,

53
00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:07.579
reduce the amount of overload
people are seeing at any one time.

54
00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.240
So yeah, that's one a little
technique that I use quite a lot.

55
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.316
Yes, go for it.

56
00:03:14.316 --> 00:03:16.881
&gt;&gt; Is there a reason why it's
not in alphabetical order?

57
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:21.606
It's hold, duplicate, cancel is that
because those are the top three?

58
00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:26.750
&gt;&gt; It's because it was the order.

59
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.111
Yeah, it was based on the order
that they were most used.

60
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:36.023
So people normally hold, that's our number
one task, sometimes then they wanna

61
00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:41.237
duplicate it, sometimes they wanna cancel
it, sometimes they wanna create return.

62
00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:45.038
Now I'm not saying that's always
the only way of doing it.

63
00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:49.411
Alphabetical almost never
use because alphabetical is

64
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:54.534
a completely arbitrary and
not based on user behavior in any way.

65
00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:59.106
So in that case it's viewed in
order of usage but you could,

66
00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:02.762
You could say if it was a process,
for example,

67
00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:06.158
you would put it in
the order of the process.

68
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:09.286
So there are lots of different
ways of organizing it.

69
00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:15.128
Interestingly, now we're really
getting into psychology, but

70
00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:20.549
if you've got a longer list,
like the list on the left there,

71
00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.929
you don't always wanna
just go in order of usage,

72
00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:29.332
because we zoned out after three or
four options.

73
00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:32.616
So and then we pick up again
at the end of the list.

74
00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:37.106
So the least looked at stuff in that left
hand list is not the stuff at the bottom

75
00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:37.878
of the list.

76
00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.012
It's the stuff in the middle of the list.

77
00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:44.417
So there's all kinds of little weird
things like that that you could take into

78
00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:48.228
account, but that's a bit more
than we're trying to get at here.

79
00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:50.331
But yeah,
I don't tend to use alphabetical a lot.

80
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:54.082
I mean, obviously, on like tables and

81
00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:59.208
things like that and
where you're sorting via name.

82
00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:03.261
You're gonna use alphabetical there,
but not generally as much in menus.

83
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.033
Yeah.

84
00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:07.372
&gt;&gt; I noticed that you're using
some maybe microcopy techniques.

85
00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:10.487
You're also like, okay, single word.

86
00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:11.158
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

87
00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:11.760
&gt;&gt; Instead of.

88
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.543
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

89
00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:18.361
&gt;&gt; And also, I'm guessing that you've
tested this all out so that you can say

90
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:23.279
to the stakeholders who are like
panicked that you're shorting this list.

91
00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.159
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

92
00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.489
&gt;&gt; Based on our testing.

93
00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:30.229
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
I've got two things that I showed them.

94
00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.774
First of all, I showed them the top
task analysis that shows that

95
00:05:34.774 --> 00:05:38.478
those four items that
are listed there are counted,

96
00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:43.046
as I remember, for
something like 73% of all votes, right?

97
00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:45.449
Instantly, that's a good one.

98
00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.811
And then we also had some
usability testing where I said,

99
00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:53.714
find out how to open a concern,

100
00:05:53.714 --> 00:05:59.092
which is something you do with
why are you doing this app?

101
00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:03.388
And people found,
they went to the action, which was great.

102
00:06:03.388 --> 00:06:06.313
And then they looked down the list,
saw it wasn't there, but

103
00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:08.458
they saw the load more and
they clicked on it.

104
00:06:08.458 --> 00:06:12.817
So I had evidence that people were
actually looking under that submenu.

105
00:06:12.817 --> 00:06:16.816
So the combination of those
two was enough to swing them.

106
00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:17.908
But it might not have worked.

107
00:06:17.908 --> 00:06:19.396
It might have crashed and burn.

108
00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:20.990
[LAUGH] In which case,

109
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.398
that brings me on to another option
I use quite a lot is chunking, right?

110
00:06:26.398 --> 00:06:29.809
So as you can see from that menu there,
it's one massive long list.

111
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:32.979
This was their side navigation.

112
00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.512
And as you can see,
it had stacks of things in it.

113
00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:41.599
Now, ideally I would have liked to
reduce that quite considerably.

114
00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.141
But, we don't always get what we want.

115
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.803
So what I did instead is did
introduce some chunking.

116
00:06:48.803 --> 00:06:52.010
So I had, broke it up with sales and
logistics and

117
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.639
favorites and things like that to
make it a little bit more scannable.

118
00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.656
I'm not, and then some stuff I moved out
of the it's kind of secondary stuff.

119
00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:03.978
We've moved out into
a the lower part of the menu.

120
00:07:03.978 --> 00:07:08.899
I basically just visually broke it
up a bit to enable scanability.

121
00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:13.476
I'm not a 100% happy with that but
I don't wanna always show just stuff I'm

122
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:17.795
really proud of because otherwise,
it gives false opinions about stuff.

123
00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:20.585
But yeah, that idea chunking
things up works quite well.

124
00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:22.274
&gt;&gt; You also have dumped the icons.

125
00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:23.341
&gt;&gt; Yes.

126
00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:26.521
&gt;&gt; Is that search field searching for
a command?

127
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:31.430
&gt;&gt; That search is a universal search that
they had in a completely different part of

128
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.248
the interface, as is my name and
those options along the top.

129
00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:37.560
They had this and that's another thing.

130
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.267
A grouping is another I think I
don't even know if it's on this.

131
00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:45.258
But a lot of people end up with icons and
functionality all over the place.

132
00:07:45.258 --> 00:07:46.498
And it's like, well,

133
00:07:46.498 --> 00:07:50.478
where am I supposed to be looking on
the page to work out what I'm doing next?

134
00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:52.857
And I've just poured it all
together onto that side menu.

135
00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:56.973
So I've actually added almost more
into that side menu in some ways but

136
00:07:56.973 --> 00:07:59.985
I've dragged it out of
other places on the screen.

137
00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:03.616
I'm not claiming that's
perfect by any means.

138
00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.631
So yeah,
chunking is something I do quite a lot.

139
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:09.371
Then it's progressive disclosure.

140
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:16.698
So breaking complex interactions down
into steps to avoid overwhelming users.

141
00:08:16.698 --> 00:08:20.308
So what you're looking at on
the screen on the right-hand side,

142
00:08:20.308 --> 00:08:21.892
there is their filter list.

143
00:08:21.892 --> 00:08:25.655
So as you can see, there are so
many different filter options and

144
00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:30.048
then you expand them out and there's
even more options underneath that and

145
00:08:30.048 --> 00:08:31.665
it's a bit overwhelming.

146
00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:35.374
So what I did is I replaced
it with this add filter and

147
00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:40.467
then you can either search on a filter but
notice it's doing that thing

148
00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:45.922
again where I'm showing the top four and
then there's load more, right?

149
00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:50.125
So they could either search for it,
however they wanted to filter or

150
00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:52.568
they could look at the list and select.

151
00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:57.555
And then when they selected one of those,
the filter is added to the bar above and

152
00:08:57.555 --> 00:09:02.709
then there is the additional options that
are required for that specific filter.

153
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:06.644
So that's how I kind of tidied
that one up by disclosing it or

154
00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:11.148
gradually taking them through
the process rather than just going.

155
00:09:11.148 --> 00:09:16.664
Here's all the information you work it out
so that's something I use quite a lot.

156
00:09:16.664 --> 00:09:20.267
The other one I favor is good defaults.

157
00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:26.268
So on average users only changed
the defaults 5% of the time.

158
00:09:26.268 --> 00:09:33.436
That's a huge sweeping figure and
it will depend hugely on your situations.

159
00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:38.239
But it's really worth thinking carefully
about your defaults for things.

160
00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:43.122
So here's an example
from a flight site where,

161
00:09:43.122 --> 00:09:51.313
they've just automatically filled in
a date range that is an average for them.

162
00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:55.929
In terms of how far ahead it is and
how long people go away.

163
00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:02.377
And also, it's automatically filled in the
number of passengers that it's getting at.

164
00:10:02.377 --> 00:10:04.727
Maybe is not the best example, but

165
00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:09.024
any kind of situation where
you're entering a default value,

166
00:10:09.024 --> 00:10:14.537
whether it be a date, whether it be a
number of passengers, anything like that,

167
00:10:14.537 --> 00:10:19.017
make sure you think carefully
about what that default should be.

168
00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:22.257
Because it can save people a lot
of time if it's a good default and

169
00:10:22.257 --> 00:10:23.817
they don't need to change it,

170
00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:27.959
especially if it's a reoccurring task
that they're doing all the time, right?

171
00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:33.069
So, for example, if you were doing a task

172
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:39.202
app you can't put in things
like what the task is.

173
00:10:39.202 --> 00:10:44.077
But you might put be able to
automatically fill in a delivery,

174
00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:48.672
a due date that's a week ahead
because that's when people

175
00:10:48.672 --> 00:10:53.582
normally set it by a week ahead
by default, things like that.

176
00:10:53.582 --> 00:10:57.545
There's lots of options around that.

177
00:10:57.545 --> 00:11:01.257
Another one is prioritizing
critical content.

178
00:11:01.257 --> 00:11:05.878
So when you mock up screens.

179
00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:10.531
It can be very easy with
mocking up screens for

180
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:14.693
if you've got a lot of things going on for

181
00:11:14.693 --> 00:11:20.088
the primary actions to be
lost in the noise, right?

182
00:11:20.088 --> 00:11:24.737
And little things in the interface
can really draw attention and

183
00:11:24.737 --> 00:11:26.382
drag attention away.

184
00:11:26.382 --> 00:11:31.204
Now, there's lots of ways
that you can check that you

185
00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:35.384
haven't done that and
in the user research and

186
00:11:35.384 --> 00:11:40.527
testing course,
I think we looked at first click test and

187
00:11:40.527 --> 00:11:44.400
five-second tests and things like that.

188
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.275
One thing I would point out,

189
00:11:46.275 --> 00:11:50.193
an app that I absolutely love
is called Attention Insight.

190
00:11:50.193 --> 00:11:55.267
And Attention Insight is
an eye-tracking simulation software.

191
00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:59.593
The best way to think about it is it's
like a spell checker for designers, right?

192
00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:05.318
So when you check stuff with a spell
checker you don't always agree with it,

193
00:12:05.318 --> 00:12:07.745
especially a grammar checker.

194
00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:09.946
And so it doesn't always get it right,

195
00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:13.494
but it's quite nice to kind of
get a bit of feedback and advice.

196
00:12:13.494 --> 00:12:18.316
So what you do is you upload your screen
and it uses thousands of hours of

197
00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:23.079
eye tracking study to predict where
people will look on that screen.

198
00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:25.391
It's not perfect, but it's not bad.

199
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:27.312
So for example,
you'll end up with something like this.

200
00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:30.978
So this isn't an app unfortunately, but

201
00:12:30.978 --> 00:12:35.177
on the left hand side was
the first mockup I did.

202
00:12:35.177 --> 00:12:40.208
But you notice how by with the second
by changing the eyeliner the dog I

203
00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:45.699
draw more attention to the primary call
to action a weaker on the first one.

204
00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:48.539
So it's quite a good way
of refining your design and

205
00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:51.986
making sure that your attention
is going to the right places.

206
00:12:51.986 --> 00:12:55.987
So I'd quite like that, it's quite
a useful tool for keeping you focused.

207
00:12:55.987 --> 00:13:00.628
&gt;&gt; Does it tell you the order
in which the eye would tap into.

208
00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:02.824
&gt;&gt; There is a view that shows that.

209
00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:07.363
But actually, that doesn't matter
as much as you think it does.

210
00:13:07.363 --> 00:13:10.811
It's more where the eye
settles that matters.

211
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:15.727
I mean, the moment you put a dog on that
screen with any face, full stop, a human,

212
00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:16.885
a pet, anything.

213
00:13:16.885 --> 00:13:20.665
It's like a sink that pulls attention but

214
00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:25.957
you can kind of control where
attention goes by eyelines,

215
00:13:25.957 --> 00:13:30.286
by having arrows pointing
at things by layout.

216
00:13:30.286 --> 00:13:34.349
There's lots of different ways of
manipulating where people look on

217
00:13:34.349 --> 00:13:34.986
the page.

218
00:13:34.986 --> 00:13:38.461
But it's definitely worth running
through a thing like this.

219
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.337
Just as a sanity check, really.
