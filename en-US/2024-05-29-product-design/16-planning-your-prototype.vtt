1
00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:04.133
So those are your different options,
and it's important to know what

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.872
you're using and when you're using it and
why you're using it.

3
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:13.584
So it's worth just taking a pause
before you jump into prototyping.

4
00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:17.830
I think a lot of people jump into
prototyping maybe a bit too soon.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.684
A little bit of upfront planning
will help ensure that your time is

6
00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.152
used efficiently when you do prototype.

7
00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:28.822
So one of the things that I like to do
is a kind of before prototyping step,

8
00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:34.201
although you could argue it's a type of
prototype in its own right, is user flows.

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:39.160
I don't know whether this is anything
anybody has had a play with,

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.032
but I find it really great to just
kind of plan out how the different

11
00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:49.011
pages will work and what the flow
through the application will be.

12
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:54.555
For a start, I'm particularly seeking to
answer what the entry points into the app,

13
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.563
how people might arrive in it.

14
00:00:56.563 --> 00:00:59.759
Is it always through a login?

15
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.988
And do they always land at the same
dashboard, or could they come in for

16
00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:03.603
a deep link?

17
00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:07.858
All of those kinds of things are quite
useful to plan out beforehand.

18
00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:13.378
Then obviously, there's the key actions
and steps, what potential steps a user

19
00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:18.426
might go through to reach the different
goals that you've got on the site.

20
00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:22.149
Whether people are gonna be
skipping around the site and a lot.

21
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.259
Oftentimes I find with apps that they're
not very streamlined in that way.

22
00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.727
So to complete an overall goal, they have
to go into one section, then come out of

23
00:01:30.727 --> 00:01:35.217
that section and go into another section,
and there's no nice flow through it.

24
00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:40.510
So planning all of that out
beforehand helps me at least.

25
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.970
Then there's decision points so

26
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.537
identifying critical decision
moments in the flow.

27
00:01:49.537 --> 00:01:52.617
So for example, with an e-commerce site,

28
00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:57.627
there is obviously the decision of
whether to add something to basket.

29
00:01:57.627 --> 00:02:02.085
But there's also then the decision of
whether to actually proceed through

30
00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:06.272
checkout cuz a lot of people add things
to a basket and then abandon it.

31
00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:12.075
So knowing when those key moments
are in the app often is important.

32
00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:14.158
And error handling and feedback, right?

33
00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:19.481
So I try and think through,
where are things likely to go wrong.

34
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:23.745
How are they likely to go wrong and
how am I gonna respond to that?

35
00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:28.047
So user flow is basically
a kind of series of individual

36
00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:32.910
screens that kind of show the flow
through the application and

37
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.075
branching points where certain
decisions have been made, etc.

38
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:41.956
So yeah, I'm a fan of those.

39
00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:42.836
And then finally,

40
00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:45.975
the other thing that I do look at
with user flows is alternate paths.

41
00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:50.317
So sometimes people can come at
a piece of functionality from

42
00:02:50.317 --> 00:02:55.351
different directions and
will they have the relevant context, etc.

43
00:02:55.351 --> 00:03:00.134
So I kind of fiddle around with that
a little bit doesn't need to be perfect,

44
00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:04.499
but just to kind of get an initial
thinking before I go too far into it.

45
00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:09.373
Once I've got that, then I've
really it's a matter of deciding on

46
00:03:09.373 --> 00:03:13.146
the fidelity of the prototype
that I need to create.

47
00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:18.003
And that kind of depends very
much on where I am in the process

48
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:19.760
of the application.

49
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.120
Because I don't tend to just
create one prototype when I'm

50
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.812
building out an app I potentially
could make many prototypes.

51
00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:34.156
And I know that sounds
a little bit overkill but

52
00:03:34.156 --> 00:03:38.375
sometimes it's just easier to
do it that way and so I do it.

53
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:43.214
So for example, you might be doing
ideation right at the very beginning.

54
00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:46.196
So you might be running a workshop
where you've got stakeholders in and

55
00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:48.196
you're kind of trying to
create lots of ideas.

56
00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:50.691
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we did this or
that and the other?

57
00:03:50.691 --> 00:03:54.735
And that's where I see paper
prototypes as being really valuable.

58
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:58.112
It's just kinda sketching
out ideas in those meetings.

59
00:03:58.112 --> 00:04:02.613
I know a lot of people are huge
fans of paper prototyping.

60
00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:06.313
And they take on those paper
prototyping and they test with them.

61
00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:12.187
And to me that feels like madness
cuz they're very low fidelity.

62
00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:16.948
And so, it's quite hard for
users to picture what's going on, but

63
00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:22.052
also paper prototypes on easy to edit and
change and fiddle around with.

64
00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:25.405
So I see the main version for
me personally,

65
00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:31.023
paper prototypes are great for chucking
out lots of ideas to begin with and

66
00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:34.573
then I kinda lose interest
in them after that.

67
00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:40.731
So when we start narrowing down our ideas
to something that's a bit more solid.

68
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:43.827
Then I'll increase
the fidelity a little bit and

69
00:04:43.827 --> 00:04:46.781
I'll jump into some greyscale prototyping.

70
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:52.048
So where I'm not really worrying too much
about the design but I'm trying to get

71
00:04:52.048 --> 00:04:57.564
the main kind of elements in place and how
it all flows together and works together.

72
00:04:57.564 --> 00:05:03.518
And that's usually tangible enough to do
a little bit more kind of development and

73
00:05:03.518 --> 00:05:07.157
refine it, test with it and
explore it a bit more.

74
00:05:07.157 --> 00:05:12.567
So I spend quite a long time in
greyscale prototyping generally.

75
00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:17.744
Then as I start to iterate on things and
it's beginning to come together and

76
00:05:17.744 --> 00:05:23.101
I've got a stronger direction then I
start to create clickable prototypes.

77
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:26.647
Sometimes this can still
be the greyscales, right?

78
00:05:26.647 --> 00:05:31.723
So I'm just kind of joining those together
and making them click through from

79
00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:36.975
one to the other because I'm beginning to
have a bit more of a strong direction.

80
00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:40.832
And there tends to be more testing
that's going on at that stage.

81
00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:44.388
And then when we're trying
to finalize the approach so

82
00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:47.713
that the developers can go off and
do their thing and

83
00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:52.605
they've got something that is
effectively a functional specification.

84
00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:56.732
Cuz I'm not a fan of written
functional specifications

85
00:05:56.732 --> 00:06:00.873
personally because they're
open to interpretation.

86
00:06:00.873 --> 00:06:04.088
And people can disagree
over what was meant in

87
00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:06.889
a written functional specification.

88
00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.328
But a good prototype is much more concrete
and much more obvious what's gonna happen.

89
00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:16.784
So at that stage, I end up with
a much more interactive, richer,

90
00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:18.817
higher fidelity prototype.

91
00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:22.232
Now, I'm not saying I do
all of those steps on every

92
00:06:22.232 --> 00:06:25.495
single project because
there are constraints.

93
00:06:25.495 --> 00:06:31.046
But pick and choose which you feel is the
most relevant to you over those journeys,

94
00:06:31.046 --> 00:06:35.952
but at least having a clear idea of
where the strengths of different types

95
00:06:35.952 --> 00:06:38.704
of prototyping comes in is worthwhile.

96
00:06:38.704 --> 00:06:45.329
And often a kind of underappreciated
part of prototyping.

97
00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.757
And probably,
the bit that I almost like the most out of

98
00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:55.155
prototyping is engaging with
stakeholders during prototyping.

99
00:06:55.155 --> 00:07:00.052
A lot of designers [LAUGH] everybody
took a note at that point say I'm not

100
00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.717
sure I agree with that.

101
00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:03.434
I'll have to write that down.

102
00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:07.484
A lot of designers like to go away and
hide in the cupboard somewhere.

103
00:07:07.484 --> 00:07:14.054
And at most talk to some users and
then produce the design.

104
00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:19.013
But actually, I'm a huge fan of
collaborating with stakeholders to

105
00:07:19.013 --> 00:07:23.298
create a prototype and
I've got several reasons for this.

106
00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:26.528
One is that I think it
leads to better products.

107
00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:30.107
The more perspectives
you have in something,

108
00:07:30.107 --> 00:07:32.593
the better it tends to turn out.

109
00:07:32.593 --> 00:07:33.403
For example,

110
00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:37.529
having a developer's perspective
in prototyping is really valuable.

111
00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.672
But even a marketer's perspective is good
or somebody with business experience,

112
00:07:42.672 --> 00:07:47.310
all of these bring different perspectives
to the table that are all valid.

113
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.725
You just need to know how to manage those
different perspectives and balance them.

114
00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:57.390
But more importantly,
it leads to faster approval.

115
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.455
If a stakeholder helps create a prototype,
they're much more likely to approve it,

116
00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:02.196
aren't they?

117
00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:03.618
Let's be honest.

118
00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:06.096
How many times do you
reject your own work?

119
00:08:06.096 --> 00:08:10.123
Well, unless you got
big imposter syndrome.

120
00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:15.662
But, yeah, I mean most of us are more
likely to back our own work.

121
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:21.860
And taking that even further, more likely
to support it in front of other people.

122
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.703
So if you can get a senior executive,
for example,

123
00:08:26.703 --> 00:08:33.474
involved in a limited way in
prototyping then you're golden, right?

124
00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:38.906
Because that person will back it to
the hill and argue on your behalf for

125
00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:43.618
it and it's much more likely to
get improved and go forward.

126
00:08:43.618 --> 00:08:46.973
So of course the challenge is knowing,
well, how do you do that?

127
00:08:46.973 --> 00:08:51.964
How do you get people involved without it
ending up becoming designed by committee,

128
00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.365
which obviously nobody wants, right?

129
00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:58.334
Well, I tend to run workshops,

130
00:08:58.334 --> 00:09:03.336
wireframing workshops in particular.

131
00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:05.122
I mean,
there are lots of ways of doing it.

132
00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:09.220
This is one that kind of
works quite well for me.

133
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.247
So the only problem with it these days
is you have to get everybody in a room

134
00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:18.003
together, which is increasingly difficult
because nobody likes to put on grown-up

135
00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:20.133
clothes anymore and leave the house.

136
00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:25.869
But other than that, it can be it
can be quite a good little session.

137
00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:29.320
So what what do I tend to
focus on in these sessions?

138
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.800
Because you're only talking about few
hours maybe three hours if you're lucky,

139
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.351
an hour and a half if you're unlucky.

140
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:41.006
I basically tend to get them
focusing on the core journey.

141
00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:45.346
Let's look at some of the key screens and
functionality that

142
00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:50.042
are central to the kind of user
experience that we're creating.

143
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:53.962
If I know that there are certain
controversial screens that people

144
00:09:53.962 --> 00:09:57.746
are gonna be argumentative about and
are gonna be problematic.

145
00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:00.558
I sometimes include those just to, right,

146
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:04.284
let's get this out in the air
before I put any work into it.

147
00:10:04.284 --> 00:10:08.305
So I don't wanna spend hours mocking up
some page that I know everybody's gonna

148
00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:09.272
tear apart later.

149
00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:14.718
I prefer to have that conversation up
front and then we all know where we stand.

150
00:10:14.718 --> 00:10:18.076
And then sometimes I'll look at
the high effort screens, right?

151
00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.378
So pages that need a lot of work.

152
00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:24.054
And there are many different
stakeholders involved in.

153
00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:29.347
Again, let's just get it all sorted out
and not do it via endless email chains

154
00:10:29.347 --> 00:10:34.641
of people going, well, I'm worried
about this from a legal perspective and

155
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:37.913
just get them in a room,
get them working on it.

156
00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:44.741
So what do I actually get them
doing is probably a valid question.

157
00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:46.480
I'm a fan of Crazy Eights.

158
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.719
So I don't know whether anybody's
come across Crazy Eights.

159
00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:52.311
What's so

160
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:56.596
great about Crazy Eights is it makes
people feel like they've contributed.

161
00:10:56.596 --> 00:10:59.286
But actually, what they're producing is so

162
00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:02.966
low phi that actually it's open
to lots of interpretation and

163
00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:06.807
still gives you the freedom to do
what you wanna do as designers.

164
00:11:06.807 --> 00:11:11.038
So just very broadly normally,
I'm normally a bit kinder than the most

165
00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:14.648
Crazy Eight exercises and
most the kind of traditional one.

166
00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:18.888
I think you take an A4 sheet of paper,
you don't have A4, what's it?

167
00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:23.037
Letter, you're so imperialistic,
says the Englishman.

168
00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:28.423
[LAUGH] So you take your A4 bit
of paper and you fold it so

169
00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:32.514
you end up with eight boxes, like here.

170
00:11:32.514 --> 00:11:34.120
I'm actually usually a bit more generous.

171
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.354
I usually take a flipchart piece
of paper and fold it up, so

172
00:11:37.354 --> 00:11:39.732
they've got a bit more space to work with.

173
00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.693
But basically what you ask
is you ask each team so

174
00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:46.616
you split whoever's in the room
down into teams, each team and

175
00:11:46.616 --> 00:11:51.451
you give him eight minutes to generate
eight ideas on a single piece of paper.

176
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:59.691
Now what I love about this exercise is
that not only are you involving them.

177
00:11:59.691 --> 00:12:02.977
So that they feel they've contributed.

178
00:12:02.977 --> 00:12:04.512
But you're also educating them.

179
00:12:04.512 --> 00:12:07.667
You're also saying, look,
there's more than one way of doing this.

180
00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:12.035
Cuz everybody gets in their head how
they think it should be done, right?

181
00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:15.208
And of course, everybody's thinking
a slightly different thing.

182
00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:18.895
So by making them come up
with eight ideas, right?

183
00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:26.457
Of how we might do the checkout or
the homepage or the whatever it is, right?

184
00:12:26.457 --> 00:12:31.429
By making them generate eight ideas,
it forces them to think outside of their,

185
00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:34.114
what was in their head initially, right?

186
00:12:34.114 --> 00:12:36.632
So it's really worth it
from that point of view.

187
00:12:36.632 --> 00:12:41.511
Then essentially the group will pick four
of those ideas that they like the most,

188
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.959
and then they join up with another team.

189
00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:47.755
So that's two fours, so
that you end up with eight ideas, and

190
00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.799
you pick the best four again, and

191
00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:54.471
you repeat the above steps until you've
got four ideas remaining, right?

192
00:12:54.471 --> 00:12:58.169
So you end up merging team,
merging team, merging all team, and

193
00:12:58.169 --> 00:13:00.468
then you end up with the four best ideas.

194
00:13:00.468 --> 00:13:03.627
And again, you're ending that
exercise with four ideas,

195
00:13:03.627 --> 00:13:06.986
not one that you're then forced
to go away and do as a designer.

196
00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:12.112
So that's one exercise that
could be done very quickly and

197
00:13:12.112 --> 00:13:17.145
tends to be quite popular and
makes people feel engaged.

198
00:13:17.145 --> 00:13:18.964
It's not the only option.

199
00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:24.454
Another option is to design sprint,
anybody ever done a design sprint?

200
00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:25.332
Yeah, you have.

201
00:13:25.332 --> 00:13:26.399
&gt;&gt; Kind of a little bit, yeah.

202
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.888
&gt;&gt; You've done a mini design sprint.

203
00:13:27.888 --> 00:13:28.698
&gt;&gt; Like a practice.

204
00:13:28.698 --> 00:13:31.131
&gt;&gt; A practice design sprint.

205
00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:34.654
So just in case you don't know, let me
run through what a design sprint is.

206
00:13:34.654 --> 00:13:37.415
It's a technique that was
created by Google and

207
00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:40.737
involves a week of research,
prototyping and testing.

208
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:46.948
So it's an intensive week-long event and
five days.

209
00:13:46.948 --> 00:13:49.690
Day one is all about understanding.

210
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.838
So you map what you're trying to achieve,

211
00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:56.603
you choose a target audience,
that kind of stuff.

212
00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:59.706
Day two is you diverge,
you sketch various solutions.

213
00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:02.357
It's pretty much like we were
talking about a minute ago,

214
00:14:02.357 --> 00:14:04.368
you spend a day exploring different ideas.

215
00:14:04.368 --> 00:14:06.570
Day three is you converge, so

216
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:11.426
you decide on the best ideas that
were produced on the day before.

217
00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:18.452
Day four, you build some kind of prototype
that represents your chosen direction.

218
00:14:18.452 --> 00:14:21.505
And then day five, you test with that.

219
00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:24.512
So that's the idea.

220
00:14:24.512 --> 00:14:27.732
I'm not a fan, if I'm honest.

221
00:14:27.732 --> 00:14:31.581
I've included it because I knew if I
didn't include it, everybody would go,

222
00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:35.276
you've done a course on product design and
not mentioned design sprints.

223
00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:40.828
And the design sprint community
is very pro-design sprint.

224
00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:46.065
So I'll probably get in trouble again,
but you know, I'm beyond caring.

225
00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:50.899
Personally, it doesn't work very well for
me.

226
00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:53.883
I find it very hard to arrange.

227
00:14:53.883 --> 00:14:59.582
Getting all the stakeholders
in the room for

228
00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:02.514
a week is pretty hard.

229
00:15:02.514 --> 00:15:08.926
Unless a mature organization with quite
a well-established culture of UX, it's

230
00:15:08.926 --> 00:15:14.617
really hard to do, which is why Google
can do it because they do have that.

231
00:15:14.617 --> 00:15:18.693
But if your organization doesn't,
you're gonna probably struggle.

232
00:15:18.693 --> 00:15:21.577
I also just find it exhausting,
perhaps, I'm just old.

233
00:15:21.577 --> 00:15:25.719
I don't know, you're young and
you're nodding that makes me feel better.

234
00:15:25.719 --> 00:15:29.842
So it's really intense, both for you,

235
00:15:29.842 --> 00:15:34.582
the person running it and
also for attendees.

236
00:15:34.582 --> 00:15:40.241
So I'm not a fan of it from that point of
view and also it just feels rushed, right?

237
00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:45.405
Design sprints leave little room to
really consider what you're doing.

238
00:15:45.405 --> 00:15:50.245
And in some ways I can understand that cuz
it builds momentum and momentum's good and

239
00:15:50.245 --> 00:15:51.005
all of that.

240
00:15:51.005 --> 00:15:54.641
But if it leaves those
stakeholders feeling rushed,

241
00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:57.480
they're more likely to push back later.

242
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.006
So it's not a massive win in my point of
view, I'd prefer just to spend an hour and

243
00:16:03.006 --> 00:16:07.967
a half doing some initial sketches and
then kind of communicate with them

244
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:12.883
on an ongoing basis, rather than suck
a week of their time down, yeah.

245
00:16:12.883 --> 00:16:14.732
&gt;&gt; And also it's very expensive?

246
00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:18.506
&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] I've got
nothing to add to that.

247
00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:19.467
Yes, it is.
