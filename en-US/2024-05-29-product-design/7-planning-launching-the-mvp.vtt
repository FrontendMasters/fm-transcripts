WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.035
So, in particular, what I wanted to
move on to was this idea of well,

2
00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:12.590
okay, so we know that an MVP is valuable,
that it brings a lot to the table,

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.781
but how do we identify
what should be in our MVP?

4
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:21.356
And partly, that goes back to
the question that was asked about, well,

5
00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:24.206
hang on, if we've got an existing product,

6
00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:29.019
are you saying we go right back to only
one thing from that existing product?

7
00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.878
No, I'm not saying that.

8
00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:35.518
I'm saying, you need to define your MVP
within the context that you're working on.

9
00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:40.317
So what do you consider when
you're doing that process?

10
00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:45.037
Well, there's kind of different
ways you can approach this, but

11
00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:49.519
my personal preference is that
I look at the following things.

12
00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.649
The first is the user need, right?

13
00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.594
So, what's the absolute
core task that users need

14
00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:02.545
to complete in order to
achieve their goal, okay?

15
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:09.627
So depending on, if you've got an existing
product, you've got an existing user base,

16
00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:15.031
and so you need to accommodate all
of those existing requirements for

17
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.153
those different audiences
to achieve their goals.

18
00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:23.781
So as a result, your MVP is probably gonna
be a lot bigger than it would be if you

19
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:25.573
were starting from scratch.

20
00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:30.435
If you're starting from scratch,
then you might define just

21
00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:35.494
one small audience, right, and
focusing just on their needs.

22
00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:42.683
So user needs is one kind of obvious area
that you can use to define your MVP.

23
00:01:42.683 --> 00:01:46.351
The second one is your value proposition.

24
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:50.631
This is a little bit of a different
element here, because your value

25
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:55.214
proposition is about how you're
positioning yourself in the market and

26
00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:58.084
how you're selling yourself in the market.

27
00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:03.191
And there is often functionality
that has crept into an app over time

28
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:08.209
because people have requested it,
that isn't really in line with

29
00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.502
how you're trying to position yourself,
what kind of thing you're delivering.

30
00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:18.057
So let's take something like Figma,
for example.

31
00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:21.333
Figma, you could use for print design.

32
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.318
It's not designed for print design,

33
00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:26.055
it's not part of their value proposition,
right?

34
00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:30.860
They're a digital design tool, but
you could use it for print design, and

35
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.443
I suspect there are people that
maybe do a bit of print and

36
00:02:34.443 --> 00:02:37.513
a bit of digital that use Figma for
both, okay?

37
00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:41.006
And what will happen is over time
those people will start saying,

38
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:44.703
can I have this feature, which would
help with my print design work?

39
00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:50.451
Well, no, we don't want to include that,
even if it's a user-requested feature,

40
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.858
because it's not a part of who we are and
what we do.

41
00:02:53.858 --> 00:02:57.847
And then the final aspect to
it is time and effort, right?

42
00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:01.147
So as you're thinking about
your minimal viable product,

43
00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.857
which features can be
built relatively easily?

44
00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.979
Which features, if we've got an existing
product, can we carry across easily?

45
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.437
If it's really easy to carry
them across them, why not?

46
00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:15.570
Presuming it's still in line with our
value proposition and user needs.

47
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.020
But if something is more complicated and
it's gonna take more time,

48
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.302
then obviously you probably don't
wanna include it initially.

49
00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:27.477
So this idea of identifying
your MVP is really a useful

50
00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:35.189
starting point to bring clarity to the
chaos of what could be done with this app.

51
00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.350
And then, once you've kind of defined
what you want your MVP to do,

52
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.892
then what you wanna do is start
trialing it, trying it out.

53
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:48.558
And prototyping is always
a great place to start.

54
00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:50.860
I'm sure that doesn't blow your minds,

55
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.398
that I'm gonna suggest that you prototype
your MVP before you actually build it,

56
00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:58.835
cuz it's a lot cheaper than
building it straight all in code.

57
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:03.325
Prototyping obviously allows you to
test by running usability testing

58
00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:06.852
with a small number of users
on your initial prototype.

59
00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:12.566
But you can also prototype
in code as well,

60
00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:15.755
and that's okay to do.

61
00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:20.623
Sometimes it's actually as quick and
easy to throw something

62
00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:25.034
together in code than it is
to build it in Figma, right?

63
00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:28.205
Especially if it's got a lot
of interactive components,

64
00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:30.932
because Figma sucks at
interaction prototypes.

65
00:04:30.932 --> 00:04:36.574
It's full of bugs, annoys me,
sorry, I'm making you laugh for

66
00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:40.487
my, [LAUGH] so
I shouldn't say that out loud.

67
00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:45.356
So sometimes I will actually go, well,
let's just kind of throw this together

68
00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:50.018
in code, in which case you can even do
something like a soft launch, right?

69
00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:55.545
And you can actually expose that
initial prototype MVP build

70
00:04:55.545 --> 00:05:00.863
just to a small number of
people on an invite-only basis.

71
00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:05.643
And say, we know this spits rubbish and
it'll break and all the rest of it, but

72
00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:07.390
we'd love you to try it out.

73
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.977
And then eventually you get to
the point where your MVP becomes mature

74
00:05:12.977 --> 00:05:19.151
enough that you can actually launch it and
then you can start monitoring it.

75
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.494
But all of this is really a kind of
prototyping journey of developing this

76
00:05:23.494 --> 00:05:28.406
minimum viable product through stages,
a bit in Figma, an initial rough build,

77
00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:31.629
and then something that's
a little bit more mature.

78
00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.113
And each of those stages allows
you to gather user feedback and

79
00:05:35.113 --> 00:05:37.529
understand their needs a little bit more.

80
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.806
And of course, once the MVP is live,
then you're getting heat maps and

81
00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:46.532
session recordings and analytics, and
all these kinds of monitoring stuff.

82
00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:51.593
So gathering feedback on your MVP is so
incredibly important.

83
00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:56.047
And again, this is a another
problem with MVP, so I often see,

84
00:05:56.047 --> 00:06:00.935
is that people go yes, we're gonna
build a minimum viable product.

85
00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:02.314
And then they launch it, and

86
00:06:02.314 --> 00:06:05.369
then they just move on to the next
feature that they want to add.

87
00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.995
Well, hang on a minute,
pay attention, right?

88
00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:12.147
Pay attention to what you've
just put out into the world and

89
00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:15.059
what are people saying that
they want back out of this?

90
00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.990
Cuz they might not want any of the things
that you've got planned in the pipeline.

91
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.156
If you've got an MVP and then a backlog of
features, you're doing it wrong, right?

92
00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:29.851
Because, how do you know what that
backlog of features should be until

93
00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:32.008
the MVP is in the world, right?

94
00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:35.462
If you're making assumptions about what
your backlog of features should be,

95
00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:39.228
I mean, I'm not saying you shouldn't have
a collection of things that you've got in

96
00:06:39.228 --> 00:06:40.141
your head, right?

97
00:06:40.141 --> 00:06:43.801
But they shouldn't be all scheduled,
ready to go out after your MVP,

98
00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:48.164
because otherwise you've not listened to
anything that you've got from the MVP.

99
00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:51.424
So gathering MVP feedback
consists of listening,

100
00:06:51.424 --> 00:06:54.608
monitoring social media,
looking for reviews,

101
00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:59.018
reading every message that you get sent,
this is invaluable stuff.

102
00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:03.250
If people are talking to you,
pay attention to it.

103
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.843
Then you watch, I use session recorder
like a Microsoft Clarity or a Hotjar or

104
00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:11.815
something like that that allows
you to watch users using your app.

105
00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:17.851
And then you need to ask as well,
are you sending out surveys?

106
00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:20.489
Are you arranging interviews?

107
00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:24.677
Are you creating feature suggestion
polls with things like poll unit,

108
00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:29.164
where people can say, I'd love this
feature and then others can vote it up?

109
00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:34.618
I was talking to Mark,
who's the founder of FrontendMasters,

110
00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:39.971
and he was saying he spends a big
chunk of his time arranging back

111
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:45.330
to back user interviews of people
that are using the platform.

112
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.732
So he can talk to them and

113
00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:50.802
he can understand what it is that
they want added to the platform, and

114
00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:55.665
that's exactly how we should be operating,
especially after you launch an MVP.
