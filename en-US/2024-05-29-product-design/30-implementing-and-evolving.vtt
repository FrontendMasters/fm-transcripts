1
00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:04.005
So that's a little bit of
advice around design systems.

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.335
I do wanna just briefly,
as we come to the end here,

3
00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:11.835
talk about implementing and
evolving your design system over time.

4
00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:14.608
The one thing I would suggest is,

5
00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:20.066
I wanted to say a bit about turning
components into code, right?

6
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:25.404
A lot of organizations will do one or
the other, right?

7
00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:28.524
Either you'll have developers who
have all been all proactive, and

8
00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:31.500
they've created a design system
with components in their code.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.453
Or you have a design team that have
built a design system in Figma to

10
00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.444
make their lives easier.

11
00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:41.246
Or, oftentimes as well,
both have done that, but

12
00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:45.949
neither have talked to one another, and
so it's two completely different systems.

13
00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.199
The real power of design systems is
where you have a one-to-one match,

14
00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.516
a component in Figma with
associated code with it, right?

15
00:00:55.516 --> 00:01:00.467
So a developer can look at Figma and
go, that's a so-and-so component,

16
00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:03.463
let's grab the code for
that and whack it in.

17
00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.832
That's where you get the real benefits.

18
00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:09.162
So having a repository
that links those two so

19
00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:13.291
you can see how the two work
together is really helpful.

20
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:19.033
Now, there are no shortage of
options available to you here.

21
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:22.084
The one that I use is
one called ZeroHeight,

22
00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:26.720
which allows you to link your design
components to your code base.

23
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.404
That's my personal preference.

24
00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:32.215
However, I noticed Steven in one of his,
yeah, it's Steven,

25
00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:36.462
in one of his talks uses Storybook,
which I'd never heard of, right?

26
00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:40.186
So you might wanna take a look at that
as well, as Steve teaches you how

27
00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:44.504
to use Storybook, while I've taught you
nothing about how to use ZeroHeight.

28
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.627
So you might wanna go with his option.

29
00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:52.857
But these are really powerful and
absolutely essential.

30
00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:57.737
The other thing I would say is,
your design system's never done, right?

31
00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:02.366
So don't think of it as a static document,
but think of it as a living,

32
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.358
breathing thing that
will evolve over time.

33
00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.326
For a start,
you'll get user feedback, right?

34
00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:10.092
User feedback every now and

35
00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:13.933
again will highlight improvements
to your design system or

36
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:19.019
something gets revealed in in some
usability testing or something like that.

37
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.479
And you will need to do a second or

38
00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.501
third version of a design
component to get it right.

39
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:30.435
Also then of course, organizations love
to change their brand every 30 seconds.

40
00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:35.868
So every time they do that, we've gotta
update all of our components to fix that.

41
00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:38.370
However, most brand
updates in my experience,

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.884
consist of changing the colors, changing
the logo, and maybe changing some styling,

43
00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:44.972
like drop shadows and rounded corners.

44
00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:46.891
Well, we've set all of those things.

45
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.721
Your logo will be a component, right?

46
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:52.142
So that means you can just go in and
replace it, and

47
00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:54.689
it'll ripple through the whole lot,
everywhere.

48
00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.386
The colors are set as variables, so
you can replace it in the variables and

49
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.238
it'll ripple through everywhere.

50
00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:05.001
And the rounded corners and the shadows
are all set as styles, so again,

51
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:07.433
it'll ripple through everywhere.

52
00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:12.129
So actually rebranding an entire site
becomes quite straightforward if it's

53
00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.483
built with the design system in place.

54
00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:17.988
But then, of course,
there'll be new features and

55
00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:22.141
functionalities that you'll
wanna add as an organization.

56
00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:25.734
So how do we go about adding
these new components?

57
00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:29.376
We can't let it be wild west,
that anybody can just go along and

58
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.836
create a new component.

59
00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.543
Otherwise you'll have more and
more components being added and

60
00:03:33.543 --> 00:03:36.110
nobody will be looking after them and
it'll be a nightmare.

61
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.223
So I'm in a little bit of a process for
adding your new components is worthwhile.

62
00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:45.413
Little bit upfront research before you
agree to a new component is great.

63
00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:48.766
Doesn't need to be much, you just
need to ask a series of questions.

64
00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:51.853
Can we use an existing component, right?

65
00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:55.772
It's amazing how often people wanna
jump in and create a new component

66
00:03:55.772 --> 00:04:00.102
when actually, all you need to do is
restyle an existing component, right?

67
00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:07.889
So oftentimes, you can actually
just reuse an existing one but

68
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.845
add a layer of styling over the top of it.

69
00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:13.531
Other times it's,
can we revise an existing component?

70
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:18.345
So could we change this component
to meet this new need and

71
00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:24.183
then roll it out to every other
occurrence of that component as well.

72
00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:27.771
And the other one that you need to ask is,
if you've got people spread across

73
00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:31.431
the organization is, is anyone working
on anything like this at the moment?

74
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:35.294
[LAUGH] Cuz the number of times you've
got two designers working on the same

75
00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:38.907
component in different places and
nobody's talked to one another,

76
00:04:38.907 --> 00:04:40.044
I cannot express it.

77
00:04:40.044 --> 00:04:42.321
So just ask that question.

78
00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:46.326
Then it's a matter of
designing your new component,

79
00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:50.516
if there is a need for a one,
iterating it, testing it.

80
00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:53.379
Then it's handed across to development,
who code it up.

81
00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.673
You wanna document it, get it into
your ZeroHeight or Storybook system.

82
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:03.951
And then just Make sure everybody
that is aware of this component,

83
00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:08.945
has a chance to review it and
to approve it, just to have a little

84
00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:14.146
bit of structure in place for
ensuring that it's not a wild west.

85
00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:17.855
Talking about version control,
we were talking about verse earlier and

86
00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:21.098
you were asking about naming
conventions and stuff like that.

87
00:05:21.098 --> 00:05:28.235
A little bit of vice around that, having a
clear versioning strategy, fairly obvious,

88
00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:33.959
establish a clear and consistent
approach for how you're gonna do it.

89
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.946
Make sure you document any changes
that you're making as you go.

90
00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:42.274
I know it's boring writing documentation,
but it's so

91
00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:45.348
helpful when you get turnover of staff.

92
00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:51.055
And documentation should be more
than a comment in your code,

93
00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:53.921
developers, looking at you.

94
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:57.138
[LAUGH] You should have
a rollout strategy, so

95
00:05:57.138 --> 00:06:00.448
what's your process of
rolling out new ones?

96
00:06:00.448 --> 00:06:05.115
And will they replace
the previous one universally?

97
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.856
How are you gonna deal with that?

98
00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:10.768
A depreciation strategy
is worth having as well.

99
00:06:10.768 --> 00:06:13.676
So basically,
if you're gonna retire a component,

100
00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:15.626
what's it gonna be replaced with?

101
00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:18.251
What's your timeline for doing that?

102
00:06:18.251 --> 00:06:19.293
What's your alternative?

103
00:06:19.293 --> 00:06:22.941
How are you gonna communicate that
with the rest of the organization?

104
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:27.819
And then, access to previous
versions is quite important.

105
00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.584
You might think you'll never
need it again, you will.

106
00:06:30.584 --> 00:06:35.182
So make sure it's available somewhere,
archived away.

107
00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:39.477
Adoption and communication is quite
key when it comes to design systems.

108
00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:44.106
So you gotta sell your design system,
cuz you create this design system,

109
00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:47.031
if nobody uses it,
you've wasted your time.

110
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:51.902
So you wanna be communicating
the value of it, you wanna give people

111
00:06:51.902 --> 00:06:56.617
a sense of ownership and
the ability to influence its direction.

112
00:06:56.617 --> 00:07:00.865
There's nothing worse, designers, and
I think developers in my experience,

113
00:07:00.865 --> 00:07:02.365
but designers definitely,

114
00:07:02.365 --> 00:07:06.126
they will rebel majorly if you force
the design system on them, right?

115
00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:11.056
They throw a tantrum,
there's tears and it's horrible.

116
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.152
So got to bring them along with you,
right?

117
00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:16.093
Get them involved in the creation process.

118
00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:18.301
It's great to have champions,

119
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:23.960
some people that are gonna really champion
the design system and advocate for it.

120
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.370
And you also wanna consider training and
support, especially if you use

121
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.502
outside agencies and you need them
to work with your design system.

122
00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:35.832
So think about that and
how you're gonna do that.
