00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.710
Why does product design matter?

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.246
Why is this such an important area that
has become such a growth area, and so

3
00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:14.810
many people are starting to say, hey,
I'm a product designer now, right?

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.019
Well, it's because product design,
not dissimilar to UX design really,

5
00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.780
has a big impact on the success or
failure of any web app, right?

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.046
So, product design, for example,

7
00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:32.990
is incredibly important
in customer acquisition.

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.863
An easy-to-use web app that allows
people to solve a real pain point will

9
00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:40.095
grow organically.

10
00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:42.258
And before you think, yeah, but

11
00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:46.335
I work on web apps internally
within organizations, right?

12
00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:51.245
So therefore, everybody has to use it,
no they don't, right?

13
00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:57.027
People are the number of times if there's
a quicker and easier way that circumvents

14
00:00:57.027 --> 00:01:00.086
your bit of software because
your bit of software sucks.

15
00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:06.476
People will use that alternative approach,
okay, and I see this again and again.

16
00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:09.647
Intranets are the best
example of this ever,

17
00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:13.426
intranets is where content goes to die,
right?

18
00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:16.146
Because nobody likes their intranet.

19
00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:20.502
It's always some bit of software that
has been developed with little or

20
00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:22.691
no thought to the user experience.

21
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:28.066
So, product design can really help with
customer acquisition is also really

22
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.221
valuable when it comes to
customer retention, right?

23
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:35.041
So, keeping people using that app, right?

24
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:39.191
If people build up a procedural
knowledge of how to use it,

25
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:41.901
how to get something done in that app,

26
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:47.113
then they can be very hesitant and
reluctant to move to another app.

27
00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:52.143
And actually,
Figma is a great example of this, right?

28
00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:54.453
So, we've got, well,
we used to have Adobe XD,

29
00:01:54.453 --> 00:01:57.323
although I believe that's Rest
in Peace now, if I'm right.

30
00:01:57.323 --> 00:01:59.482
So, you used to have Adobe XD.

31
00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:04.708
Today we we've got sketch and we've got
Figma the probably the word the big three,

32
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:09.350
right, and don't get angry me yes,
there are other options available.

33
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.082
But those are tend to be the big three.

34
00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:15.063
But for
a longest time I used to use sketch and

35
00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:19.897
Figma became superior to sketch for
a long time and I kind of knew it was,

36
00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:24.789
that it had features that were better,
but I couldn't be asked.

37
00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.039
I couldn't be asked to learn a new
platform, a new bit of software.

38
00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.911
And that's because the product design
on Sketch was good enough, right,

39
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:34.849
it was great.

40
00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.529
It did what I wanted it to.

41
00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:41.442
Okay, I didn't have all the features
of Figma, but I knew how it worked, and

42
00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:46.733
I was comfortable with it that, so product
design kept me on Sketch for a long time,

43
00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:53.252
even though the other product was superior
in terms of functionality, interesting.

44
00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:56.318
And the other reason why
product design can be so

45
00:02:56.318 --> 00:02:58.732
invaluable is cuz of cost savings.

46
00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:03.570
Now, this is a little bit of a surprising
one because it kinda comes out

47
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.742
in lots of different ways.

48
00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:09.502
So certainly, the most obvious example
of this is if it's an internal app.

49
00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.255
And for those people that have
seen my user research and

50
00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:18.008
testing workshop,
I apologize because I'm gonna use

51
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:22.322
exactly the same analogy of
story that I used on that.

52
00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:28.162
But I remember a time my
long-suffering wife, right?

53
00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:32.473
I went out for
lunch with my long-suffering wife, and

54
00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:34.622
she knows what I'm like.

55
00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:38.753
And we went to a restaurant called
Pizza Express which is a chain restaurant

56
00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:39.352
in the UK.

57
00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:43.192
And the lady came to take our order and

58
00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:49.233
she was tapping away on a her basically
in house app to place the order.

59
00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:53.133
And I started to think it's
taken a long time, right?

60
00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.111
And I looked at my wife and
she knew exactly what I

61
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.686
was thinking rolled her eyes
that disgust at me that and so

62
00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:05.851
I started mentally counting how long it
was taking her to place this order, right?

63
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:10.699
And so, the minute the waitress went away,
my wife said to me,

64
00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:15.551
go on then get it outta your system,
and I said, right, okay.

65
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.438
If that took 10 seconds extra,
if I could squeeze off 10

66
00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:25.149
seconds from that,
the length of time it took to do that.

67
00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:31.551
And if they do 10 seconds per order,
average of 4 orders per table times by,

68
00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:38.049
let's guess a x number of sittings in
this particular restaurant per day.

69
00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:43.759
And then I got my phone out and looked
up on Wikipedia how many restaurants

70
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.416
they've got around the around the world or
at times that, that's how much per day.

71
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:55.066
10 seconds per day,
average salary value of a waiter your

72
00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:59.995
minimum wage I could save
Pizza Express 1.2 million a year in

73
00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:05.239
salary bills by improving this
app by 10 seconds, right?

74
00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:08.059
I've made that 1.2 million up,
it wasn't that high.

75
00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:13.319
But that is the power of product
design is being able to do that.

76
00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.749
But also there can be cost
savings in other ways.

77
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.245
Those first two things, the customer
acquisition, a customer, attention.

78
00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:23.915
Do you know the amount it costs
to acquire a new customer?

79
00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:25.759
Right, it's incredibly high, so

80
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.575
if we can keep the customers with good
product design that's far better.
