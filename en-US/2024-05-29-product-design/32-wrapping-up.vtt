00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.828
Doing everything in Figma sounds great.

2
00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:05.665
But, I'm thinking about
with all this work.

3
00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:09.756
Is there a way to make it agnostic so
it's not tied to figure?

4
00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.790
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be lovely?

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.980
&gt;&gt; Are you like?

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.637
&gt;&gt; Most of these platforms to be honest
have got reasonable export options so

7
00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:23.028
you can take them across
cross into other platforms.

8
00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:27.301
But, it's always a bit janky when you do,
it is it is difficult.

9
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.761
I haven't found a clean way of doing it.

10
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:34.833
And I've seen people move from sketch
to figma and figma to sketch and

11
00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:41.273
try and take their design systems across
and it it never worked particularly well.

12
00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:45.805
I would love to give you a magic solution
to that, cuz that will be lovely.

13
00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:50.203
But no,
I'm afraid nothing springs to mind, yeah.

14
00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:52.963
&gt;&gt; So, from a developer standpoint,
what we do is we check and

15
00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.133
call into a repository.

16
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:54.833
&gt;&gt; Yes.

17
00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.860
&gt;&gt; And then in that repository, before
anything goes into that repository or

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.673
main code base, there's a PR review.

19
00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.419
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, if I see code that's being

20
00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:05.017
replicated all over the place instead
of having it one central location.

21
00:01:05.017 --> 00:01:07.048
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You were explaining in an environment

22
00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:09.175
variable, and it changes everywhere else.

23
00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:10.105
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

24
00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:11.125
&gt;&gt; I won't let it pass.

25
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.125
&gt;&gt; No.
.

26
00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.955
&gt;&gt; Is there something like that
that the product designers

27
00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:16.347
can follow with Figma or a?

28
00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.490
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That sounds
a really good idea.

29
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.475
Let's do that, Figma, let's do that.

30
00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:24.850
&gt;&gt; Cuz, I've had designers UX
designers in particular come in.

31
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.255
And they're changing the color or
the hex code somewhere else where it's

32
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:33.315
well defined in an a variable and
they know that it's an invariant.

33
00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:35.905
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's, I know what you mean.

34
00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:40.942
It's worse than even that actually, is
that you can set something as a variable,

35
00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:45.032
a color as a variable, and
then you do something to the component.

36
00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:47.916
I can't even tell you
what I've done sometimes.

37
00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.642
And then suddenly it's a hex value again.

38
00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:52.762
I set that as a variable.

39
00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:57.132
So, it's quite compared to code,
it's all quite immature.

40
00:01:57.132 --> 00:01:59.645
You design systems within these tools and

41
00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:02.440
we are very much at
the mercy of the tools.

42
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.580
So no, there's not that level
of control over it anymore.

43
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.790
I'm hoping that that will come in time and
we are heading in the right direction.

44
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.732
But, now, from a design point of view,

45
00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:15.820
we're a bit backwards compared to
developers with this stuff, sorry.

46
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you everybody.

47
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.840
I really appreciate that.

48
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.328
I hope it turns out to be helpful and if
I can be helping the future, let me know.

49
00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:26.257
&gt;&gt; And someone said it feels like you
should be plugging some of your other

50
00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:27.628
workshops.

51
00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:30.808
&gt;&gt; I did you have not been
paying attention, right?

52
00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:33.777
So, I've got it written
down on a bit of paper.

53
00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:36.635
So, I have plugged Steve's
workshop on figma.

54
00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:41.121
And development is done another one
on design systems using Storyball,

55
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:45.761
which I'd never heard of, but
looks it's zero-high equivalent.

56
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:50.451
I promoted Ben's workshop on enterprise
design systems and management.

57
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:57.501
I've mentioned numerous times my workshop
on user research and testing, right?

58
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:00.543
Which would be a really good
one to go alongside this.

59
00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:02.663
I've done another one which is on.

60
00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:05.791
If you have a big idea,
like you've got side project or

61
00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:11.093
you're thinking I'm gonna build a SaaS app
and I'm gonna take the world by storm.

62
00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:15.393
I've got a really depressing workshop
on bringing you down to earth and

63
00:03:15.393 --> 00:03:17.480
ruining all your dreams, right?

64
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.642
Now, it's no it's a pragmatic guide
to what that process is like?

65
00:03:21.642 --> 00:03:24.653
What maybe you wanna do
before you sync a lot of

66
00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:29.263
hours into building something to
give it the best chance of success.

67
00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:30.893
So, that's the other one.

68
00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:32.543
So, that about wraps us up for the day.

69
00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:35.525
If we summarize what we've covered today,

70
00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:39.078
we've looked at the fundamentals
product design.

71
00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:43.578
We've looked at user research and
how to go about doing that?

72
00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:46.768
We've discussed prototyping and
testing our prototypes.

73
00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.551
And then finally we've
looked at design systems.

74
00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:53.401
And it's written on the screen and
I said it at the beginning, but

75
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:54.596
I will say it again.

76
00:03:54.596 --> 00:03:57.788
I sincerely want to help people with this,
right?

77
00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:01.696
So, drop me me an email
anytime to paul@bergwald.com.

78
00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:04.848
And I would love to answer your questions.

79
00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:11.208
And, because I know you do a course like
this and it all seems so, overwhelming.

80
00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:15.579
And it's when you actually
come to do the nitty gritty,

81
00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.909
all these questions come to mind.

82
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.509
Ask me, I don't mind answering.

83
00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.569
I've been doing this for 30 years.

84
00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.235
The community has given me so
much over these years.

85
00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:27.859
And if I can give back, then that's great.

86
00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:28.950
Thanks very much, everybody.

87
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.450
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
