1
00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:04.197
But let's talk about actually
creating the design system and

2
00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:07.690
how I go about building it
from a design point of view.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.522
I keep adding that because I know
obviously it's slightly different from

4
00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.891
developer point of view.

5
00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:15.597
I started my styles, right?

6
00:00:15.597 --> 00:00:20.494
So yeah, I maybe mockup some pages
to just get a feel of what I want

7
00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:22.413
the design to look like.

8
00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:26.556
But once I've got past that bit and
I'm ready to actually create the design

9
00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:29.404
system, the first thing I
do is work on the styles.

10
00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:35.022
And the first thing I work on in
the styles bit is I set a grid, right?

11
00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:39.803
So I take my design that I've got and
I work out what the underlying grid is.

12
00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:44.977
My advice with this based on
my years of experience is to

13
00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:51.161
add more columns than you think
you need when you create a grid.

14
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:55.096
Cuz you see things like bootstrap and
these various other frameworks and

15
00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:59.483
they all have 12 columns, it's
everything's 12 columns East States, but

16
00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:01.497
oftentimes you need more than that.

17
00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:04.728
So I take whatever you think you need and
double it,

18
00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:07.445
[LAUGH] because you won't regret it later.

19
00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.136
So I tend to create
a bit of a grid layout.

20
00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:17.052
And then I work through and
I start setting the padding for my layout.

21
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:21.441
And what I mean by that is so when you
create your grid, you're gonna obviously

22
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:26.244
have gutters between each of your columns,
and you're gonna decide what those are.

23
00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:28.879
But then within the components,
you're gonna have padding and

24
00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.450
margin that goes in your components.

25
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.399
So it's worth defining
all of those as well.

26
00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.557
Now, when l work in Figma,
I define all of those as variables.

27
00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:40.382
Which is a relatively new
function within In Figma and

28
00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:44.402
it's really worth doing that because
once they're defined as variables,

29
00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:47.917
if you suddenly decide you wanna
give everything a bit more space,

30
00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:51.980
you can just up the variable in one
place and it ripples through everywhere.

31
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.044
Also, that tends to be more in line
with how you develop things as well.

32
00:01:56.044 --> 00:02:01.152
You don't tend to hard code values in,
you'll set them as variables and

33
00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:05.605
then you can adjust them at least
if you're doing it properly.

34
00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.181
So I tend to do that next.

35
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:11.046
So I've got different paddings,

36
00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:16.194
I've got different values for
margins and that kinda thing.

37
00:02:16.194 --> 00:02:21.178
And don't forget of course that
Steve will cover this more in his

38
00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:23.217
in-depth dive on Figma.

39
00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:26.104
Then I tend to look at typography and

40
00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:31.020
I go through and I set my styles for
typography within Figma.

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.872
Unfortunately, you can't have
variables in typographic

42
00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:39.849
styles in Figma yet,
which is a bit annoying, so

43
00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.683
I can't set my font sizes as variables,
which annoys me, but anyway.

44
00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:51.534
So the ones I mainly set straight away is
I define all my five levels of headings.

45
00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:56.005
I tend to never use all of them,
but I like them to be there anyway.

46
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:01.113
I include variations for different
weightings for each of those sizes,

47
00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:05.551
and then I add additional styling for
things like underlines,

48
00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:09.588
strikethroughs, capital letters,
that kinda thing.

49
00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.589
So, we're including our headings,

50
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:16.904
we're including our paragraphs,
our block quotes,

51
00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:22.077
all of that kinda typographic
stuff then gets created as styles.

52
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:27.144
So you can see how really you're gonna
need to mock up a couple of pages first

53
00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:32.694
before you've got something to work with
cuz otherwise you've got no context for

54
00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:33.512
anything.

55
00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:37.232
Then I tend to pay attention to colours.

56
00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:40.350
So I do this in a bit, but
this might be a main thing.

57
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.744
All right, so
don't feel you have to carry this over.

58
00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:47.628
There are two ways of
defining colors in Figma.

59
00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:53.172
You can define them as variables, or
you can define them as styles, right?

60
00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:55.844
And I actually use both.

61
00:03:55.844 --> 00:04:03.523
So what I do is I define my
colors primarily as variables.

62
00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:08.563
So as you're seeing on the screen,
you're seeing here all of the colors for

63
00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:11.330
one project there defined as variables.

64
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.506
So there's primary 1, primary 2,
primary 3, primary 4, and then secondary.

65
00:04:17.506 --> 00:04:19.642
And they're all variables, right?

66
00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:23.707
So they're completely independent
of any particular element.

67
00:04:23.707 --> 00:04:28.894
But then in my styles,
I go in and define which of

68
00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:34.625
those variable colors I use for
specific use cases.

69
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:40.985
So for example, my borders,
right, that I go around every but

70
00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:47.232
my boxes are going to be secondary
color three, for example.

71
00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:50.906
Now what that means is that later on,

72
00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:57.068
if I want to universally change
a color across the whole site,

73
00:04:57.068 --> 00:05:01.584
I can change it at the variable level,
okay?

74
00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:06.372
If I, however, just wanna change
the border color everywhere across

75
00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.873
the whole site,
I can change it at the style level.

76
00:05:09.873 --> 00:05:11.329
Does that make sense?

77
00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:15.191
Cuz it's a bit of a mind bender, right?

78
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:20.662
You don't have to do it like that,
you could choose to pick just variables or

79
00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:24.507
pick style, but for
me that tends to separating out,

80
00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:29.719
I wanna change the color universally
from I wanna change the color as it is

81
00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.639
applied to a specific item like a border,
tends to work quite well for me, right?

82
00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.171
But whatever.

83
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.162
And Stephen his workshop might
suggest something totally different.

84
00:05:42.162 --> 00:05:49.746
That's the thing, there is no right or
wrong answer with all of this stuff.

85
00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:54.728
So, also then, the other element
with colors is if a component is

86
00:05:54.728 --> 00:05:59.077
put on a dark background
compared to a white background,

87
00:05:59.077 --> 00:06:02.541
the colors have got to be different,
right?

88
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:05.999
Now, fortunately, just this is
adding another level of complexity.

89
00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.807
I do apologize, it's not my fault
it's complicated, it's Figma's.

90
00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:15.381
They have introduced like this
modes thing that you can add.

91
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:20.038
So with each of your colors,
when you set it as a variable,

92
00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:25.548
you can say, this is the color for
light mode, and this is the color,

93
00:06:25.548 --> 00:06:31.182
the same color if it's put on a dark
background, a dark mode, right?

94
00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:35.462
So you can kind of see on this graphic,
it's not very good I apologize.

95
00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:40.385
It's so flipping small, but
you could have primary color one,

96
00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:43.864
right, so
that's the first one in the list.

97
00:06:43.864 --> 00:06:49.360
And if it's on a light background,
it has a dark version of that color and

98
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.513
if it's on a dark background,
it has a light version of that color.

99
00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:57.483
So it's adapting based on
the background it is and

100
00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:01.443
that will make life a lot easier once
you got a load of components and

101
00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:04.788
you're dragging them and
dropping them into columns.

102
00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:09.047
If that column has got a dark background
you can just say this is a dark

103
00:07:09.047 --> 00:07:13.632
background and that's an option in
Figma and Steve will teach you that.

104
00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:17.824
But once it's in there it'll automatically
adjust the colors appropriately,

105
00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:19.855
which will make your life a lot easier,

106
00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:22.578
otherwise your are constantly
overriding colors.

107
00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:26.814
So be aware of that one as well.

108
00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:30.554
Right, the other thing I
would look at is aesthetics,

109
00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:33.492
which basically boils down to two things.

110
00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:36.653
Rounded corners, so
I'll go into my variables and

111
00:07:36.653 --> 00:07:40.555
I'll set different size rounded
corners I wanna use, right?

112
00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:45.149
Typically, these are big,
medium, and small, right?

113
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:49.320
So it might be two pixels for
small, it might be five pixels for

114
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.303
medium, and
it might be ten pixels for big.

115
00:07:52.303 --> 00:07:55.907
And then if I ever wanna change those in
the future, I can just change it once,

116
00:07:55.907 --> 00:07:58.748
place, and it'll ripple through
the whole design system.

117
00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:01.450
So that's worth doing.

118
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.437
And then drop shadows is the other
one where I set that as a style.

119
00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:10.848
I have different style drop shadows
which you can set in your effects style.

120
00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:14.858
So the styles in some ways are the most
complicated bit of the whole thing.

121
00:08:14.858 --> 00:08:18.204
Cuz with these variables now and
these modes and

122
00:08:18.204 --> 00:08:20.972
stuff like that is a bit of mindbender.

123
00:08:20.972 --> 00:08:23.528
So once you've got your style sorted out,

124
00:08:23.528 --> 00:08:26.513
now you can pay attention
to your basic elements.

125
00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:31.354
Which basically boil down to
form elements, links, dividers,

126
00:08:31.354 --> 00:08:35.237
buttons, iconography,
tags, things like that.

127
00:08:35.237 --> 00:08:38.843
So I go through and I style up all
those different things, right?

128
00:08:38.843 --> 00:08:44.231
Every form element, every button,
every link, every divider,

129
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:49.059
all of those little micro
elements we now style up, right?

130
00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:52.561
So you can see a load of
them on the screen there.

131
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:56.341
But don't forget your states,
as I ranted about earlier.

132
00:08:56.341 --> 00:09:00.559
So for each of those elements,
we've now got a set of hover state and

133
00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.484
active state, a selected state,
an expanded state, right?

134
00:09:04.484 --> 00:09:07.886
And we got to do that for buttons, we got
to do it for links, we got to do it for

135
00:09:07.886 --> 00:09:10.163
form elements, we gotta do it for
a, what was it?

136
00:09:10.163 --> 00:09:11.000
What was the name of the equipment?

137
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.082
&gt;&gt; So we hide things.

138
00:09:12.082 --> 00:09:14.658
&gt;&gt; So we hide things, yeah.

139
00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:18.844
So we really need to kind of go
through every single one of those,

140
00:09:18.844 --> 00:09:21.798
making sure all the multiple
states to that.

141
00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:28.587
So there's quite a lot of work in that
stage building out all of those elements.

142
00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:33.008
Once you've done all of that, and
that's done, by the way those different

143
00:09:33.008 --> 00:09:37.311
states are done using components and
you can switch between components.

144
00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:42.065
I was gonna get into all of that but I'm
sure Steve will do a far better job about

145
00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:46.690
telling you how to build components well,
so we'll leave him doing that.

146
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.245
But once you've done
all of those elements,

147
00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:53.820
then you can build out your components and
the components you need will be totally

148
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.264
dependent on your project and
what it is that you're doing.

149
00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:00.433
But I mean,
here's just a random few that Kind of,

150
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:05.003
I pulled off of a recent project I was
working on, but there could be many,

151
00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:08.511
many more,
depending on what it is that you're doing.

152
00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:12.603
It can mess with your mind
working on components.

153
00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:18.533
So, it's all about abstraction, right?

154
00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:21.292
And this is where as developers,

155
00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:25.823
those of you who are watching
this who are developers,

156
00:10:25.823 --> 00:10:32.244
may well get pulled into a level of
abstraction that you regret later, okay?

157
00:10:32.244 --> 00:10:36.311
So let me explain what I mean.

158
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:38.977
When you build a component,
let's take, say, for example,

159
00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:40.502
a news listing component, right?

160
00:10:40.502 --> 00:10:42.382
You're gonna list news stories, right?

161
00:10:42.382 --> 00:10:46.654
So a news listing component probably
consists of a thumbnail image,

162
00:10:46.654 --> 00:10:50.423
a heading, a description,
a published date and an author.

163
00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:51.671
Sounds about right than it,

164
00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:54.803
that's the kind of thing you want
when you're listing out a new story.

165
00:10:54.803 --> 00:10:56.741
Great, that's wonderful, right?

166
00:10:56.741 --> 00:11:00.761
So we build a news component,
well, hang on a minute, right?

167
00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:03.017
What about an events component?

168
00:11:03.017 --> 00:11:04.890
Look how much overlap there is.

169
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:10.238
Image, heading, description, sort of
a published date as a start date and

170
00:11:10.238 --> 00:11:13.341
time, and you've got an end date and time.

171
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:14.628
Well, hang on a minute.

172
00:11:14.628 --> 00:11:20.763
We can combine these together into a
single event slash news component, right?

173
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:25.384
And we can just make them, the author we
can have as an optional one that turns on

174
00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:30.232
and off and the end date we can make as an
optional one that turns on and off, right?

175
00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:33.741
Makes a lot of sense that's
a smaller code base to look after.

176
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:38.579
You're you're sucking in
your breath there and

177
00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:43.417
you're right,
it looks really good on paper and

178
00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:47.547
it kind of makes sense in a lot of ways,
but

179
00:11:47.547 --> 00:11:54.058
it comes back to bite you because you go,
well, hang on a minute.

180
00:11:54.058 --> 00:11:57.751
At a later date you wanna do
something different with news, but

181
00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:59.921
you've now got so many conditions.

182
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:04.094
So you've got different conditions going
on for the news elements within the same

183
00:12:04.094 --> 00:12:07.858
component and the component becomes
more and more complicated, right?

184
00:12:07.858 --> 00:12:11.738
But then, you can have the opposite
problem as well when you end up creating

185
00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:15.618
a load of additional components that
aren't really needed cuz they're so

186
00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:17.232
similar to other components.

187
00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:22.525
So there is a happy medium somewhere in
there, and I wish I could give you a set

188
00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:27.517
of rules that say do this and
don't do that, but it's not that simple.

189
00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:32.279
But I would be very more careful
of ending up combining everything

190
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:35.232
together than having things separate.

191
00:12:35.232 --> 00:12:40.129
I think it's better to have things
separate than it is to have one

192
00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:45.027
component to rule them all,
which is you can easily get into that

193
00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:48.762
kind of mentality if you
go down the rabbit hole.

194
00:12:48.762 --> 00:12:52.571
So basically then it's all about
just building out the components,

195
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.668
building out the elements,
building out your styles.

196
00:12:55.668 --> 00:12:58.076
And Steve's tour of Figma and

197
00:12:58.076 --> 00:13:03.190
using Figma will teach you all of
that kind of stuff, I am sure.

198
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.992
But there are other elements to
design systems that are a little

199
00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:11.797
bit more opaque and not so
easy to think about, and

200
00:13:11.797 --> 00:13:17.593
this comes back to what you've been
patiently waiting for me to talk about,

201
00:13:17.593 --> 00:13:22.874
which is modals and usage of different
elements at different times.

202
00:13:22.874 --> 00:13:28.562
And this is a really big thing cuz it's
not just about having a component,

203
00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:31.058
okay, we've got a component.

204
00:13:31.058 --> 00:13:35.516
Equally critical is when you use that
component and when you don't, and

205
00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:38.967
actually these are three
great examples here, right?

206
00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:42.679
So we've got any three examples,

207
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:47.543
we've got a model, we've got a drawer, and

208
00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:53.434
then we've got an expandable
overlay thing, right?

209
00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:58.757
And when I was working on this app and
I was looking, they had these three

210
00:13:58.757 --> 00:14:04.194
components already, but it was random
as to what you got, [LAUGH] right?

211
00:14:04.194 --> 00:14:07.169
You clicked on a button, you didn't know
whether you were gonna get a drawer,

212
00:14:07.169 --> 00:14:09.151
you didn't know whether you
were gonna get a model,

213
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:11.877
you didn't know whether you were
gonna get a popover or anything else.

214
00:14:11.877 --> 00:14:12.915
It was just like,

215
00:14:12.915 --> 00:14:17.357
whatever the developer felt like at
that particular moment is what you got.

216
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:22.137
So having rules around the usage of
your components is worth having.

217
00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:27.188
So, for example, we use draws
when we wanna display additional

218
00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:33.361
information that adds to the information
that they were previously viewing,

219
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:38.615
right, without having to go off
to an entirely different screen.

220
00:14:38.615 --> 00:14:40.013
I'm not saying you do this,

221
00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:42.643
I'm just saying these
are the kinds of rules we made.

222
00:14:42.643 --> 00:14:47.014
And then we use modals,
where we want a user to confirm or

223
00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:52.139
act on something that's happened
before they proceed, right?

224
00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:57.712
And we use a pop up overlay,
which is the one on the left,

225
00:14:57.712 --> 00:15:04.719
when we want people to take a quick
optional action that's up to them.

226
00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:07.901
And our logic for
that is a draw provides a lot of space.

227
00:15:07.901 --> 00:15:10.791
So you've got a lot of space to
add a lot of content, a modal,

228
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:14.711
you can't interact with anything behind
the modal until you've taken the action

229
00:15:14.711 --> 00:15:15.935
that's in front of you.

230
00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:21.457
So that's why it's the right choice for
things where you need to act on it.

231
00:15:21.457 --> 00:15:24.688
While a pop up overlays for
optional actions that you could go on,

232
00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:28.057
I don't wanna do that and
carry on with what you were doing, right?

233
00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:30.330
That was our logic in
that particular case.

234
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.678
The logic doesn't matter, what matters
is that there is logic in place

235
00:15:34.678 --> 00:15:38.388
that you know when you're gonna
use one thing over another.

236
00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:42.843
So thinking that through is
really worthwhile as well.

237
00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:47.442
The other little kind of gotcha
that sometimes happens with design

238
00:15:47.442 --> 00:15:52.121
systems is you can get so bogged down
in the working on components and

239
00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:56.905
elements and this kind of stuff that
you forget to step back, right?

240
00:15:56.905 --> 00:16:01.622
And every now and again create
a page with these elements in rather

241
00:16:01.622 --> 00:16:05.997
than looking at them in isolation
because sometimes it can go

242
00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:09.875
horribly wrong when you put
them all on the same page.

243
00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:13.830
The biggest thing is it ends up looking
incredibly busy cuz there's just so

244
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.659
much going on cuz you've put too much
in each individual component, but

245
00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:20.887
you don't notice it until all
the components are together.

246
00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:24.560
So make entire pages from them.
