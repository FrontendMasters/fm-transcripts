00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.930
So welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.640
We are now moving on to
the subject of prototyping.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.540
Prototyping is absolutely essential
to the product design process.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.808
And so I wanna really dive into that and
look at it in this session.

5
00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:20.747
But I will say that Steve has done an
excellent course that is a deep dive into

6
00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:26.894
Figma and how developers can use Figma and
kind of teaching developers that.

7
00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:30.254
So you might wanna check that out
as well cuz it's very relevant and

8
00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.524
I'm not gonna get into
the logistics of how Figma works.

9
00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:36.842
Cuz of course Figma is not the only
tool for doing prototyping,

10
00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.864
there are lots of options available to us.

11
00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:44.104
So let's start off by talking
about the role of prototyping and

12
00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:47.831
how it fits into
the product design process.

13
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:50.798
And that begins by answering the question,
well,

14
00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:53.151
why do we even bother with prototyping?

15
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:59.831
And by prototyping, I'm talking about
doing stuff that isn't in code.

16
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:04.029
You can almost prototype in code and I
used to do that a lot more than I do now,

17
00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:07.430
actually just build things out
in code quickly and easily and

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.646
now I think there's a place for that, but
we're not gonna get into that right now.

19
00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:14.056
So why do we prototype?

20
00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.776
Well, we can test is the big one.

21
00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:21.857
Prototype provides us something tangible
that we can put in front of users and

22
00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.876
gain feedback, but also reduces risk.

23
00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.876
And this can be a big selling point
internally within organizations,

24
00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:30.367
especially if you work for

25
00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.756
larger organizations that
are often very risk adverse.

26
00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:38.692
Saying, look, if we create a prototype and
we test that prototype, then we can

27
00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:43.427
potentially avoid costly mistakes
further down the development process.

28
00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:47.835
Because for developers to change things
at a later date is a lot more time

29
00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:52.538
consuming and a lot more expensive,
because developers cost a lot more than

30
00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:56.967
designers cuz they're just more
talented and it's what I've heard.

31
00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:58.727
I don't know if anybody
else has heard that.

32
00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:02.825
Yeah, so already a question
&gt;&gt; Only Figma prototyping, is that enough?

33
00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.015
What about HTML prototyping?

34
00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:08.047
&gt;&gt; Well, this is what I'm saying,
yeah, that no,

35
00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:10.225
not just Figma prototyping at all.

36
00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:14.178
Figma is just one of the tools that
are available for us to prototype and

37
00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:15.695
I'll explore a load others.

38
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:19.152
The one that I'm not exploring
is HTML prototyping, but

39
00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:21.968
I've got nothing against HTML prototyping.

40
00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:26.979
In fact, I used to do a lot of HTML
prototyping, and I would argue that is yet

41
00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.994
another reason why it's good for
designers generally to know how to do some

42
00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:37.478
basic HTML, and CSS because it means
they can build out things in HTML.

43
00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:42.623
And actually, it used to be
quite a preference of mine to

44
00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:48.533
prototype in HTML because none of
the other prototyping tools of

45
00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:54.558
the time really supported
responsive design very well.

46
00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:56.361
Now it's a lot better, of course,

47
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:59.198
cuz Figma has got responsive
design built into it.

48
00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:01.153
Although, interestingly,

49
00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:06.344
most designers don't use it to its
full potential in Figma, right?

50
00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:10.244
They still have a desktop version and
a mobile version.

51
00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:14.287
And that doesn't really make use of a lot
of the power of prototyping in Figma, but

52
00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:15.994
we'll come on to that in a minute.

53
00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:21.347
Yes, yeah, you first
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wanted to share a story

54
00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:24.254
about prototyping that did
not use like a UI type.

55
00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:24.984
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

56
00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:29.197
&gt;&gt; Showcase, but as you may or
may not know, connecting to bots or

57
00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:31.434
AI is a two-way communication.

58
00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:35.514
It's not a typical HTTP put go get post.

59
00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:40.170
So it's two-way, and you have to do pings
and pongs, make sure it's always up and

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.459
running.

61
00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.999
So I had to do a prototype to
make that connection to a bot.

62
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.742
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And propose that solution to

63
00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:47.771
cybersecurity to make sure nothing

64
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.259
was interjecting in between that,
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

65
00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.629
&gt;&gt; Particular communication.

66
00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.086
So prototyping sometimes doesn't,
I think you're alluding to,

67
00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.770
doesn't always have to have like Figma for
an Adobe XD.

68
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.791
&gt;&gt; Absolutely no, and I think there's
kind of product design prototyping but

69
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:11.373
there's also a development prototyping or
proof of concepts and that kinda thing.

70
00:04:11.373 --> 00:04:15.798
Which are really important because
to make something work at scale and

71
00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:21.123
with all the security and stuff like that,
well, before you spend all the time doing

72
00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:26.388
that and that complexity, let's make sure
the fundamental thing can work first.

73
00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:29.588
So yeah, there's absolutely a role for
it there as well.

74
00:04:29.588 --> 00:04:30.865
You were gonna ask a question.

75
00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:32.568
&gt;&gt; I was just curious what changed for
you.

76
00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:38.412
&gt;&gt; Really improvements in the software.

77
00:04:38.412 --> 00:04:44.481
So once Figma started supporting
pretty much fully responsive design,

78
00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:50.979
then it made more, it was quicker for
me to do it in Figma than it was in HTML.

79
00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.800
Also, I'll be honest,

80
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.709
I suspect it also correlated with the
slowly declining coding skills on my part.

81
00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:02.310
I was quicker in Figma than I was in HTML.

82
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.718
But I mean, I'm a great fan of ways,
if you are good with HTML and CSS,

83
00:05:07.718 --> 00:05:13.610
it makes sense to prototype in the medium
that you're gonna be building in.

84
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.760
So there's a lot of value in HTML
prototyping, a lot of value in it.

85
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:24.062
So yeah, so the second reason to do
prototyping is reducing risk, but

86
00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:25.885
the third is communication.

87
00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:30.714
A prototype is a very powerful tool in
helping us communicate better with our

88
00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:36.455
colleagues and making sure everybody is in
agreement about what we're producing, etc.

89
00:05:36.455 --> 00:05:39.189
So what are different types
of prototyping are there?

90
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.717
I mean, we've just literally been
saying that we could use HTML,

91
00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:46.309
which I haven't gotten the list,
which is really annoying me now.

92
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.889
I wish I'd put HTML on the list,
but I haven't, I apologize.

93
00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.699
So there's basically kinda two types.

94
00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.935
There's low fidelity, so
things like paper prototyping,

95
00:05:56.935 --> 00:06:00.272
grayscale prototyping, that kind of stuff.

96
00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:05.106
And then there's high fidelity,
which are clickable prototypes or

97
00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:07.452
fully interactive prototypes.

98
00:06:07.452 --> 00:06:10.292
Well, not necessarily fully interactive,
but more interactive.

99
00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:14.342
So broadly speaking,
that's kind of how I split it.

100
00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:17.919
I guess you could claim that HTML
prototypes counts as a type of interactive

101
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.510
before clickable prototype, so

102
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.375
I did put it in there even if I
didn't realize it at the time.
