00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:02.076
And very finally, I would say,

2
00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:05.959
think about taking your design
system to the next level, right?

3
00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.719
So once you've got all that basic stuff
in, there's loads of other things that I

4
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.410
would consider design-system--adjacent or
even a part of a design system.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.766
So for example, design principles,
you're aware of design principles?

6
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:24.166
So this is the idea of having
certain principles in place that act

7
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.354
as a framework to help
make design decisions.

8
00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:32.047
So ensuring that everything
is approached in

9
00:00:32.047 --> 00:00:36.371
an objective, clear, concise manner.

10
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:42.516
So those ones on the screen that are a bit
hard to read are from the UK government,

11
00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:48.419
and they include principles like,
start with the user's needs, do less.

12
00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:53.476
Design with data,
do the hard work to make things simple.

13
00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.916
Kind of underlying principles about
how we're gonna approach design.

14
00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:59.389
What's our attitude towards this?

15
00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:05.312
To things like make it for everyone, so
it's accessible, those kinds of things.

16
00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:10.112
Having those principles in place sounds
a bit like airy fairy and a bit kind of,

17
00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:14.350
ooh, let's define our manifesto,
and all of that kind of rubbish.

18
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.213
But actually, they're really quite useful.

19
00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:22.244
You get consistent
decision-making across projects.

20
00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:26.940
It focuses you on the overall objectives
of what you're trying to do from a design

21
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.846
perspective.

22
00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:32.269
It ensures that you're more user-centric.

23
00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:36.562
But best of all, it gives you a big old
hammer to hit stakeholders with when they

24
00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.400
wanna do something stupid.

25
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.201
Well, we agreed on these
design principles, and

26
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.416
what you're saying is not one
of our design principles.

27
00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.675
Don't do it like that.

28
00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:51.833
The other thing you might wanna look at is
creating a digital playbook or a design

29
00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:55.557
playbook, which is a comprehensive
guide to all your best practices,

30
00:01:55.557 --> 00:01:58.184
your strategies,
your tools, your workflows.

31
00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.280
I create a lot of these for organizations.

32
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.223
So just like,
let's get it all down, right?

33
00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:08.094
Let's get it all written down as policies
and procedures of how we operate.

34
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:12.602
Again, it's really good for hitting
stakeholders around the head with, right?

35
00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:16.660
So, you have a greed set of
processes that you go through.

36
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.521
You always do usability testing, for
example, is a great process to put in.

37
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.389
It gives you a shared
repository of knowledge.

38
00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.444
So as people leave the organization and
new people come in,

39
00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:28.165
you've got it all written down.

40
00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:29.946
And it also improves collaboration.

41
00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:33.561
And it can empower people as well,
cuz it teaches them best practice and

42
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:35.198
what to do and things like that.

43
00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:38.321
And a part of that should
be content style guide,

44
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:41.378
that's a part of your design system,
really.

45
00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:44.760
Because content style guide is
gonna give you consistency,

46
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.350
it's gonna ensure quality,
is gonna make you more efficient.

47
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.031
So there's a lot, in your design system,

48
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.909
can be bigger than just a load
of components in figma and code.

49
00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.461
But that can come later, as I was saying
in the course that I ran previously.

50
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.080
Something is better than nothing.

51
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.068
Don't despise those small beginnings.

52
00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:06.995
Start with the basics and
build up from there.

53
00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:10.720
So just to wrap that talk
about design systems up,

54
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.278
a design system is an invaluable tool,
right?

55
00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:16.838
If it's planned carefully, right?

56
00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:21.058
Or it can be an enormous waste of money
and time, so be careful about that.

57
00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:25.657
When creating a design system, start with
your styles, move on to your elements, and

58
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.548
finally work on those components.

59
00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:34.006
But remember that design system is gonna
need a carefully considered rollout.

60
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.558
And that it's much more than
a set of UI elements, and

61
00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:38.332
you can build upon that long-term.
