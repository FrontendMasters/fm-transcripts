1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.191
So one of the things alongside
a minimal viable product that I've

2
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:12.344
increasingly started doing is
creating a future vision, right?

3
00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:19.235
So don't just prototype the minimal viable
product, prototype the maximum product?

4
00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:23.043
I don't know what the the kind of
opposite of that is the end goal.

5
00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:24.302
Where do we want to be?

6
00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:27.165
Where do we want to get to now we
don't need to build this in code.

7
00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:30.799
I'm just talking now about
kind of figma II type stuff.

8
00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:34.495
But it turned out to be
a really useful tool for

9
00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.705
us especially as product designers but

10
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:42.680
also for getting a unity of
vision across the organization.

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.167
So there's several reasons why I've
started doing this more and more.

12
00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.925
First is design consistency, right?

13
00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:57.181
So it allows that product designer to put
together a kind of a design system and

14
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.803
dot design language for
the whole application, even for

15
00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:07.404
bits that you're not intending to
launch yet or create yet, right?

16
00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:10.955
And this vision will change, right?

17
00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:15.662
I was complaining earlier about people
that had a backlog of features, right?

18
00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:17.499
When they haven't even
launched the MVP yet.

19
00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.154
And now I'm saying,
create a whole vision of everything.

20
00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:22.593
That's contradictory, isn't it?

21
00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.669
So I'm very aware that I'm doing that,
but I'm not saying we're gonna create

22
00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:32.896
this vision, but it's an opportunity for
us to look a little bit further ahead and

23
00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:37.407
maybe start to resolve some of those
more holistic design decisions.

24
00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:39.444
But also it helps for more.

25
00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:45.489
It allows to consider what features
might come into the app and

26
00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:50.961
start putting the foundations
in place today, right?

27
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:55.794
Because it could be from both
a development point of view and

28
00:01:55.794 --> 00:01:57.734
a design point of view.

29
00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:02.399
It can be very challenging
to retrofit a new feature

30
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.098
onto an existing application, right?

31
00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:09.248
It may mean changes to
the underlying database.

32
00:02:09.248 --> 00:02:13.121
It may mean changes to the code base and
how that operates.

33
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:17.003
It certainly means problems from
a design system point of view.

34
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:22.113
And so there's a lot of complexity but
if you've got a kind of these are the kind

35
00:02:22.113 --> 00:02:26.541
of features that we,might have,
and these might be how they look.

36
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:32.525
then at least you can bear those in mind
when you are creating the actual stuff for

37
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:37.185
the MVP and it also gives you a,
goal to work towards, right?

38
00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:40.399
A shared vision that
everybody can look at.

39
00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:45.495
Excites people about the potential,
it brings the team together, it helps

40
00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:51.242
flush out a lot of the disagreements early
on about where things might ultimately go.

41
00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:57.719
But within a less urgent way, because this
is never gonna be built as it is anyway.

42
00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.628
Now I know that all sounds very wasteful.

43
00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:05.553
But you're building this thing, creating
this thing that probably won't ever be.

44
00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:11.301
But increasingly if you get
the opportunity to do this,

45
00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:14.603
it helps solidify a direction,

46
00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:19.510
a vision and
prepare the ground for the future.

47
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.427
Yeah, go for it.

48
00:03:20.427 --> 00:03:25.343
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think this is actually really
a good idea for another reason, and

49
00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:29.800
that is to provide people with
a sense of it would increase morale.

50
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.543
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That it's like,

51
00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:36.696
these ideas are going somewhere that
you can envision something great.

52
00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.284
You have something to look forward to.

53
00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.299
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

54
00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.351
So the only danger here is that
this becomes a straitjacket, right?

55
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.326
You need to know you're not gonna build
this and you need to say that upfront.

56
00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:55.435
I'll tell you the other thing it does
is it gives people creative freedom.

57
00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:59.991
So stakeholders will start
suggesting things that they'll never

58
00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:02.440
have suggested normally, right?

59
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.346
So I did this for an insurance company.

60
00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:08.640
I don't know why I'm looking at you,
you're banking, but for

61
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.788
an insurance company, and we started
create this prototype and I said up front,

62
00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:14.436
we're never gonna build this.

63
00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:19.304
This is never gonna get built, but
we're envisaging what might be, let's,

64
00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:20.503
go for it, right?

65
00:04:20.503 --> 00:04:22.733
We were doing all these things and
of course,

66
00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:25.903
I was breaking compliance rules left,
right, and center, and

67
00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:29.617
the legal department would go, yes,
fine cuz he's never gonna get bill.

68
00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:33.505
It's amazing how many of those things
actually carried through, right?

69
00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:39.039
Once you kind of put your stake in the
ground, they got compromised down a bit.

70
00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.037
And the wording was true.

71
00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:45.036
But we got a lot further than I
expected we got because everybody

72
00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:48.630
got carried along with
the enthusiasm of it.

73
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.161
It's a weird thing.

74
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:54.502
It's quite hard to explain, but
it's worth giving a go on one project so

75
00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.794
you can see for yourself how it works.

76
00:04:56.794 --> 00:05:00.700
How do we go about creating
this vision for the future.

77
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.102
Well, we can do some research up front,
find out what our user needs are,

78
00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:11.857
what, are the stakeholders
different visions are for

79
00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:15.188
the project, all that kind of stuff.

80
00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:18.932
We can then brainstorm lots
of ideas what could go in it.

81
00:05:18.932 --> 00:05:23.739
We create a bit of a prototype
around those visions.

82
00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.982
This is all stuff that I'm
sure you're very aware of and

83
00:05:26.982 --> 00:05:29.949
you've heard a hundred times,
you can test that,

84
00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.540
see how people respond to it,
iterate around it a little bit.

85
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.355
And maybe even start turning
this into a bit of a backlog.

86
00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:41.449
But probably not the right word
because that means it sounds like it's

87
00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.135
prioritized.

88
00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:47.338
But break this down into projects
that could be potential projects.

89
00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:51.888
And then you share it with the rest
of the organization to get other

90
00:05:51.888 --> 00:05:53.965
people excited and on board.

91
00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:58.860
So those future visions can be a really
powerful tool that I don't think

92
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.836
there's a lot of people doing a lot of
that there's a big focus on MVPs and

93
00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:07.201
not as big a focus on where
are we heading, yeah?

94
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:11.751
&gt;&gt; Is this are you seeing
this as different from or

95
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.323
the same as a map like as a.

96
00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:14.906
&gt;&gt; Journey map.

97
00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:15.520
&gt;&gt; Journey map?

98
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a journey map is nothing yes,
it's different.

99
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.556
So when we talked about journey
mapping on the user research and

100
00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:29.985
testing thing, that is you can create
an aspirational journey map, right?

101
00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:33.473
Which looks at, well, what if this,

102
00:06:33.473 --> 00:06:38.716
it was a lot easier for the user and
that could act as this.

103
00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:40.777
If you wanted it to it's a lot quicker and

104
00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:44.972
a lot easier to create an aspirational
journey map than what I'm proposing here.

105
00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:49.124
What I'm proposing here is
we actually create a figma

106
00:06:49.124 --> 00:06:53.471
interactive prototype of what
the app might look like.

107
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:54.808
A few years down the road.

108
00:06:54.808 --> 00:06:59.192
&gt;&gt; Right, I meant a roadmap,
a product roadmap.

109
00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:01.001
Is that different from this?

110
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:05.926
&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, a product roadmap
is more set in stone, right?

111
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.668
This is more what could be.

112
00:07:09.668 --> 00:07:12.944
It sounds so pretentious and
so kind of wooll, and

113
00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:17.626
who let's all imagine the beautiful
future we could live in together.

114
00:07:17.626 --> 00:07:20.233
But it helps the UI designer,

115
00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:25.880
because they can start thinking
about the thing holistically.

116
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.565
So it kind of ticks that box, but

117
00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:33.641
it also helps enthuse stakeholders and
bring them on board.

118
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:37.695
It also means that you can
prototype without constraints.

119
00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:42.298
So a lot of ideas that would have been
killed dead by legal or compliance or

120
00:07:42.298 --> 00:07:44.646
whatever can kind of sneak through.

121
00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:48.107
And even with developers,
it helps them go, well,

122
00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:51.253
if we might be introducing
this feature later,

123
00:07:51.253 --> 00:07:56.144
I need to make sure that that's gonna
be easy to build when it comes along.

124
00:07:56.144 --> 00:08:01.921
So it is just a bit giving you a vision,
a direction to go on.

125
00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:06.431
So just to kind of wrap this all up,
what I'm basically saying is we're

126
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:11.484
starting with an MVP and we're continually
iterating upon that MVP over time.

127
00:08:11.484 --> 00:08:17.871
But we also need to remember to look
ahead, to have some kind of vision.

128
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:22.459
Now, how you express that vision, if
it's a prototype, if it's a journey map,

129
00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:27.134
if it's a road map, whatever works for
you, but having that vision of the future.

130
00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:32.535
I like prototyping personally,
because I think it is very tangible.

131
00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:37.961
And also, just never forget that product
design is fundamentally different

132
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:43.397
from web design and it's got a lot of
nuances and is a lot broader in some ways.

133
00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:48.734
And a lot of other considerations that
need to be brought into it, especially

134
00:08:48.734 --> 00:08:54.498
if there's not good product owners and
a good structure within the organisation.

135
00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:58.758
But then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna move into looking at kind of good

136
00:08:58.758 --> 00:09:03.086
some of those areas in a lot more detail
in particular we're gonna start off by

137
00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:04.369
looking at use cases.

138
00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:08.538
And how to really understand what users
are wanting to do with this app because

139
00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:12.466
that's the fundamental building block
upon which you grow from there.
