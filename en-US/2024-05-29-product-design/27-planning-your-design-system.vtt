1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.778
So those are the three
building blocks of it.

2
00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:08.251
How do you then plan your design system
because it's quite an intimidating thing

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.774
building a design system.

4
00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.649
It doesn't sound like
many of you have done it.

5
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.028
Some of you are trying to do it and
if you're trying to do it,

6
00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.591
you know that it's scary.

7
00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:22.286
So little bit of advice about how
to go about planning my first

8
00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:26.718
piece of advice is don't buy
in a design system, right?

9
00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:29.240
Is so tempting, right?

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.596
Because you can go out there and you can
find these design systems ready done all

11
00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:38.365
the elements, all the components you want
all the colors and styles and everything.

12
00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:42.343
It's all just there and I can just
go yeah, let's have that, right?

13
00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:45.033
Now I'm talking from
the design point of view,

14
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.936
I can't comment from
a development point of view.

15
00:00:47.936 --> 00:00:52.539
I know a lot of developers
use things like Bootstrap and

16
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.950
various other things and build on that.

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.167
I can't comment on whether
that is a good plan or not.

18
00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.624
My gut says it isn't.

19
00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:06.241
But who am I to judge when I'm not
a full-time developer anymore.

20
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.028
So why don't we wanna do it
from a design point of view?

21
00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:12.919
Well, reason number one,
they're over engineered, right?

22
00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:15.948
And that's not a criticism
of them they have to be,

23
00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:20.251
they have to build a design system
that they can sell to anybody, right?

24
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.353
So that means they need
every single element or

25
00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:26.621
component that you might ever need in it,
okay?

26
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:31.843
But your needs are probably for
only a small subset of all of that.

27
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:37.668
So you've got all this extra stuff in
there that you don't actually need there

28
00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:43.863
and it just gets in the way basically and
causes confusion and difficulty, right?

29
00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:47.719
And because it's got so much in and
it's so over-engineered for

30
00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.603
your needs,
it takes forever to learn, right?

31
00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:52.303
And get your head around how it's working.

32
00:01:52.303 --> 00:01:55.372
And of course the mental model of
the person that created it is different to

33
00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:57.613
your mental model and
how you're thinking about it.

34
00:01:57.613 --> 00:02:01.683
And you're going, blimming heck, I've got
to kind of pick through all of this and

35
00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:05.635
understand it and in the end, you get to a
point of going you know what I think it'd

36
00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:07.400
be quicker to build my own, right?

37
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.964
And you can tell here that I'm
saying this from personal,

38
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.174
horrible [LAUGH] experience
of going down this road.

39
00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:17.898
Also, they're gonna need
heavy customization, right?

40
00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:22.436
So then you've got to understand how all
of these components interlink with one

41
00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:26.769
another and how they reference one another
in order to be able to edit them and

42
00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:27.804
customize them.

43
00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.594
And that can be a challenge in its own,
right?

44
00:02:30.594 --> 00:02:37.151
And in my experience, they can often
really result in bloated code as well.

45
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:41.480
Because again, you've got these
components built into the system that you

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.940
don't need in your use case,
but they're in there anyway.

47
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.268
And this design system gets passed
across to the developer and

48
00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:52.748
if the developer isn't really on the ball
because he's too busy or whatever else,

49
00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:57.100
you could easily end up with all this
stuff being built, you don't really need.

50
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.419
All of that said there is a caveat, right?

51
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.066
Which is that I do sometimes
buy a design system just to

52
00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:09.829
speed up the creation of my
own design system, right?

53
00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.344
So for example,
instead of creating an input box,

54
00:03:13.344 --> 00:03:15.973
a radial box, all that kind of stuff.

55
00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:19.352
I literally got a design
system that I bought ages ago.

56
00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:23.517
I go in, grab the input box
shove it into my design system,

57
00:03:23.517 --> 00:03:27.087
customize it the way I want and
add it in like that.

58
00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:29.255
But I never would take one wholesale.

59
00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:33.927
And even that, sometimes it's like,
I'll just do it myself.

60
00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:40.405
So it's a false economy
at the end of the day.

61
00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:44.973
Personally, I feel like it is maybe other
people have managed to make it work,

62
00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:45.691
yeah
&gt;&gt; Well,

63
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:49.377
what about referencing the design
systems that are online?

64
00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:54.192
I mean that's one of the other
things there's a lot of

65
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:58.904
an open source right now
like IBM's carbon design

66
00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:04.558
&gt;&gt; Yeah, again I advise against

67
00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:08.859
using those, right?

68
00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.782
For all the reasons I've just listed.

69
00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:13.461
&gt;&gt; For selectively, in terms of
designing a component and looking for

70
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:17.664
some practices, would that be [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no sorry, I understand you.

71
00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:19.078
I didn't understand the question.

72
00:04:19.078 --> 00:04:23.332
Yeah, absolutely I often look
at other people and rip them of.

73
00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:24.038
What is it?

74
00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:26.386
We're building on
the shoulders of giants or

75
00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:30.784
some other way of justifying the fact that
I'm just copying somebody else's work.

76
00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:32.053
Yeah, no, I do that all the time.

77
00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:38.081
&gt;&gt; Well, one advice about design systems
I heard, don't try to design it yourself.

78
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:42.716
Learn from what is there because whatever
you're gonna try to come up with probably

79
00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:43.981
not gonna be the best.

80
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:46.035
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would agree with that regards.

81
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:51.754
I'm talking more about
actually building it, right?

82
00:04:51.754 --> 00:04:56.607
Actually creating the components and
the elements in something like Figma.

83
00:04:56.607 --> 00:05:01.399
That if you buy in a design system that
you can just plug straight into Figma

84
00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.813
that you're not gonna understand.

85
00:05:03.813 --> 00:05:05.809
I'm happy to learn from other people.

86
00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:09.298
I'm happy to copy from other
people where it's relevant, right?

87
00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:12.514
But it is making no and
then I build it myself.

88
00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:18.689
I recreate it in Figma myself so
that I understand what I've done.

89
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.856
And by doing it on almost a component
by component element by element basis.

90
00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:29.501
I can choose to what what to include,
what to edit, or

91
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:32.822
what to go, I don't need that at all.

92
00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:37.534
Well, when you buy something in,
you've got it all whether you like it or

93
00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:38.447
not, right?

94
00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:41.794
So that's my kind of logic, yeah.

95
00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:43.631
&gt;&gt; And I can speak from
an engineering perspective too.

96
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:46.724
There's actually an article
that Josh Comeau wrote for

97
00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:50.886
Smashing Magazine two years ago where
he said essentially the same thing.

98
00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:53.121
It overcomplicates
the engineering process.

99
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:56.795
And that's the case with
when I've used material UI.

100
00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:01.923
Initially it seems very easy to get
going but as the application scales and

101
00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:07.973
you need to remove elements, or you wanna
customize behavior it quickly breaks down.

102
00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:08.488
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

103
00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:12.211
&gt;&gt; And then you have to throw everything
out and start from scratch so

104
00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:12.872
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

105
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:17.946
that's certainly been my experience
working with engineers that it reaches it.

106
00:06:17.946 --> 00:06:22.075
But it's great for
getting started quick but

107
00:06:22.075 --> 00:06:25.996
it causes problems further down the line.

108
00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:30.376
And yeah, I'm not criticizing people that
buy in a solution to get going quick.

109
00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:32.589
I understand that desire.

110
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:35.229
But from the design perspective,

111
00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.513
I don't even think it allows
you to start quick really.

112
00:06:39.513 --> 00:06:40.997
Because you're spend so

113
00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:45.529
much time getting it into shape that
it probably won't work for you anyway.

114
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:49.983
The other thing I would say is
quite important is from a design

115
00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:52.789
perspective is get buy-in upfront.

116
00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.046
I need to clarify what I mean by that.

117
00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:58.701
It's a bit of a misleading title,
to be honest with this slide.

118
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.911
What I mean is collaborate, right?

119
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:04.990
In the creation of a design system,
don't just go and

120
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.356
kinda create a load of
components in Figma.

121
00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:12.705
But actually,
work alongside your developers on it and

122
00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:17.805
engage with them and your product
managers and people like that.

123
00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:22.739
Because they've all got to live with it,
right?

124
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:26.393
What works for you might not work
from a development point of view.

125
00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:29.555
And if it's gonna make handover
difficult between design and

126
00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.712
development, then you're losing half
the benefits of having a design system.

127
00:07:33.712 --> 00:07:38.448
So it's kind of ridiculous to create
a Figma design system without at least

128
00:07:38.448 --> 00:07:40.263
involving the developers.

129
00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:45.153
So now, it might be the developers
are ahead of you, which is really annoying

130
00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:49.911
when they are and they've already
created a kind of design system in code.

131
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:54.075
And in which case,
you really need to replicate that and

132
00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:58.160
use that as the basis from for
building your elements.

133
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.966
Because they will be better than you so
just suck it up.

134
00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:08.406
And then you obviously you can change the
appearance of those and stuff like that.

135
00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:13.458
But developers, developers do this
kind of stuff by default design

136
00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:19.765
system is essentially object orientated,
which has been around for like forever.

137
00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:23.970
So when you suddenly get these
designers pop up and go, yes,

138
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.206
I think we need a design system.

139
00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:29.419
And all the developers are sitting
there going, we've been doing that for

140
00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:30.241
donkey's years.

141
00:08:30.241 --> 00:08:35.669
So really listen to them and
get them involved in it as well.

142
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.101
And the other the other reason to get
buy-in upfront is just to sell the idea.

143
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:44.433
It's surely your executive and
your team can see the value of your

144
00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:48.312
design system and
how it's gonna help the organization.

145
00:08:48.312 --> 00:08:50.711
And talk through those cost savings and

146
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:53.916
the brand consistency in
the faster time to market.

147
00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:57.117
It really helps to get buy-in but

148
00:08:57.117 --> 00:09:02.388
oftentimes we will have
reluctant managers, right?

149
00:09:02.388 --> 00:09:06.443
And we'll hit this barrier of, well,
we don't have time to do a design system.

150
00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:09.190
We need to push out this next feature and

151
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.861
the never-ending kind of
thing that goes in there.

152
00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:16.137
So and it can be really frustrating.

153
00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:18.881
And it's like you're
just making everybody,

154
00:09:18.881 --> 00:09:22.456
you're slowing us all down by
not having this thing in place.

155
00:09:22.456 --> 00:09:26.406
So when that does happen and when I
really can't get anywhere with managers,

156
00:09:26.406 --> 00:09:27.389
I just go stealth.

157
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:32.004
[LAUGH] So
a manager doesn't know whether mocking

158
00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:36.737
up a design screen takes two hours or
three hours.

159
00:09:36.737 --> 00:09:41.100
So make it take three hours and
then spend the extra hour turning every

160
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.099
element that you create on that
page into a component, right?

161
00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:47.696
There's a lot of thoughts, right?

162
00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:52.075
We need to have a design system project,
right?

163
00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:54.895
Where we build our design
system from scratch but

164
00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:57.796
you can actually build it as you go along,
right?

165
00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:02.447
When you mockup a screen make sure you
turn, if you create a component make sure

166
00:10:02.447 --> 00:10:07.533
it's then added to a component library and
that's the beginning of a design system.

167
00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:11.879
It'll need to tidy up at some point but
that's further down the line, right?

168
00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:16.710
And if you keep adding more and
more of these components to the design

169
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.222
system over the time you get
a design system by default really.

170
00:10:21.222 --> 00:10:24.569
Just by spending a little bit longer
every time you mockup a screen.

171
00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:26.479
There's also a good argument to say,

172
00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:29.417
well actually maybe that's
the right way to do it anyway.

173
00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:33.622
Because if you do a design
system project you sit down and

174
00:10:33.622 --> 00:10:38.196
you have to come up with all
the components you need, right?

175
00:10:38.196 --> 00:10:42.128
And so, what you end up doing is auditing
the existing website that takes ages.

176
00:10:42.128 --> 00:10:46.605
You then build all those components and
then half of them you never use again.

177
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:49.947
Well, if you're only building
them as you require them,

178
00:10:49.947 --> 00:10:52.891
actually you're only
building the ones you need.

179
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:55.286
There's a little bit of
groundwork with your styling.

180
00:10:55.286 --> 00:10:58.965
That needs to be done separately and
your main elements.

181
00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:04.092
But why even the elements you can kinda
do as you go, I need an input element.

182
00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:07.705
Let's design an input element and
we'll put that cross in the design system.

183
00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:10.168
Keep that for next time I need it, right?

184
00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:15.709
So it's like squirreling away design
elements and when I want them later, yeah?

185
00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:17.269
So just don't tell anyone.

186
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:19.042
It's my advice, just do it.
