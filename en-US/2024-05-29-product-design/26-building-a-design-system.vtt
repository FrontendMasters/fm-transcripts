00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:03.032
Design systems, I mean,
they're brilliant anyway.

2
00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:04.031
They're useful to have.

3
00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:07.035
If you're working on any project for
any length of time,

4
00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:09.547
having a design system
is definitely worth it.

5
00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:13.050
But if you are working on a product,
an app,

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.070
whether you have a web app or
such, whatever you wanna call it,

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.714
having a design system I would
argue is almost essential to

8
00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:27.930
enabling you to produce consistent
high quality interactions,

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.285
but also just to making your life easier.

10
00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:34.428
So what is a design system?

11
00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:35.990
Why do we care?

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.273
What goes into them?

13
00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:42.256
Well, basically, a design system is to set
a guideline, standards, and components

14
00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:46.575
that unify your design and development
efforts across the organization.

15
00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:49.477
So it brings together design and
development.

16
00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:55.629
I see it as a kind of blueprint for
design and developments, collaboration.

17
00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.236
It's a shared point of interaction
with them that can streamline

18
00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:04.267
building of digital projects
products significantly.

19
00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.763
It's really worth the investment.

20
00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:14.137
So why do I consider a design system so
important and why should you create one?

21
00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:17.373
Well, consistency is a huge part of it.

22
00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:19.848
Ensuring that your design is uniform,

23
00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:24.957
the functionality behaves in the same way,
just enhances the user experience.

24
00:01:24.957 --> 00:01:28.095
And to be honest Brandon,
identity as well.

25
00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:30.743
I always think about the BBC
when I think of this cuz they

26
00:01:30.743 --> 00:01:33.926
have something called the global
experience language, right?

27
00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.076
Which is their design system.

28
00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:40.830
And the BBC is a fascinating
organization because it's trying to

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.297
appeal to such a broad range of people,
right?

30
00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:49.558
And so the thought of having one
design system that kind of underpins

31
00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:55.097
all of it feels a bit counterintuitive
in some ways because it's like,

32
00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:59.735
one minute you're on a website
aimed at toddlers, right?

33
00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:04.298
And the next minute you're on the Radio
4 website, which is aimed at old people.

34
00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:07.109
And then you're on the BBC Sports site,

35
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.507
which is aimed at rugby people or
whatever else.

36
00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:12.315
And so
there are all these different audiences.

37
00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:15.410
Yet you could easily be
moving between these sites.

38
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.171
So as a parent,
you might be going on to CBBs, right?

39
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.773
And then be BBC News and
then radio two, whatever.

40
00:02:23.773 --> 00:02:28.905
So it's like they've all got to
have their own visual identity.

41
00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:33.533
Yeah, if they work consistently that's
gonna make my life a lot easier as a user

42
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.133
moving between the sites.

43
00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:39.154
And so they've done this really
clever thing where all of

44
00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:42.854
the functionality is totally consistent,
right?

45
00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:47.119
A carousel looks is a carousel
works in the same way, same layout,

46
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:51.842
same everything on every site, but
it's styled with color typography,

47
00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:56.580
rounded corners that kind of stuff
differently for the different sites.

48
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.497
So it creates consistency
without uniformity,

49
00:03:00.497 --> 00:03:05.088
without forcing the same
brand identity on everything.

50
00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:09.776
So it's very valuable
from that point of view.

51
00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:12.910
Then there's efficiency and speed.

52
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.747
Really, this is big as well,
because this will seriously,

53
00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:21.659
if you get this right, you'll be able
to turn around prototype super quick.

54
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.265
And then those prototypes will be
able to go into production and

55
00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.864
turned into working
code much much quicker.

56
00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:32.846
Because there'll be a whole level of
kind of code that just doesn't need

57
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:37.501
recreating the HTML, the CSS,
the JavaScript, maybe even some of

58
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:42.580
the database site connection stuff
that's going on won't need coding.

59
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.119
Once you've done one, I dont't know,

60
00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:50.361
news component that pulls back news
stories, you've done them all, basically.

61
00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:52.782
It just makes the whole process so
much easier.

62
00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.509
It also encourages collaboration.

63
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.591
It improves teamwork,
creating a shared language and

64
00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:00.941
a shared set of resources
between development and design,

65
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:04.237
which can be a bit of a fractious
relationship sometimes.

66
00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:09.343
So totally worth doing from that point
of view ensures quality as well cuz each

67
00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:14.923
of those components, when you drop in that
component, you know that that component

68
00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:20.293
has been designed once properly with best
practice in terms of user experience.

69
00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:24.988
In terms of maybe accessibility, all of
those kinds of things are baked into it,

70
00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:27.004
responsiveness is baked into it.

71
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.577
And it obviously has a cost reduction.

72
00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:34.482
You cut your cost by reducing the need
to rework or duplicate effort, freeing

73
00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:39.699
resources for innovation rather than just
reinventing the wheel the whole time.

74
00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.495
Flipping brilliant,
I love designing systems, right?

75
00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:49.832
So if any of you actually got
to build a design system before?

76
00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:52.360
No, yeah, it's frustrating.

77
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.913
You've done some with prototyping,
you've done a little bit?

78
00:04:54.913 --> 00:04:56.080
&gt;&gt; We're trying.

79
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.260
&gt;&gt; You're trying at the minute
done a little bit, right?

80
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.733
Okay, so what am trying to do is
share with you the kinda basic

81
00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:05.640
principles more from the design side.

82
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.264
I'm not gonna pretend I understand
the code side, all right?

83
00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:11.224
I briefly touch on that later, but

84
00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:14.547
I do wanna primarily look at it
from a design point of view.

85
00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:18.103
Let's talk about the basic building
blocks that go into a design system.

86
00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:22.085
So you've decided you wanna build
a design system, where do you begin?

87
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:27.002
Now, first of all, I will say that
Steve that I mentioned earlier,

88
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:31.315
it has created a second course
on design systems that will go

89
00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:35.133
into a lot more of
the practicalities of doing this.

90
00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:38.536
And I'm gonna look kind of holistically
at the top level of it and

91
00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:40.245
he goes into a lot more details.

92
00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:42.789
So I'd recommend checking that one out.

93
00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.649
As another guy called Ben, who has got
a course on enterprise design system

94
00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:52.359
management, which I suspect looks at
it more from the developers side of

95
00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:55.391
things and
the management of design systems.

96
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.423
You might want to check
that one out as well.

97
00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:00.555
So my role here is to
kind of look top level,

98
00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:05.433
holistically at it,
if that sounds pretentious enough, right?

99
00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:09.342
So let's look at the basic building
blocks that go into a design system.

100
00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:12.981
So there are fundamentally three, right?

101
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:15.533
There are styles, right?

102
00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.760
By the way,
I'm gonna use some terminology here,

103
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.976
that the terminology argues,
everybody uses different things.

104
00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:27.114
So for example,
Brad Frost who is awesome guy, and

105
00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:33.670
he wrote an amazing book called atomic
design, which is around design systems.

106
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.268
He talks about molecules and atoms and

107
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:41.879
things like that and
he's far cleverer than me,

108
00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.618
his way of thinking about it does my idea,
right?

109
00:06:46.618 --> 00:06:51.756
So I've got some kind of simplified
version of it for today.

110
00:06:51.756 --> 00:06:56.781
So the first one is styles,
styles covers things like typography,

111
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:02.266
color layout, the basic kind of
foundational stuff in a design, right?

112
00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:06.683
So that's your absolute basics, okay?

113
00:07:06.683 --> 00:07:09.512
So thinking about it from
a Figma point of view,

114
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.851
it's all stuff you set in the styles menu,
basically.

115
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:15.500
Then up from that, there are elements.

116
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.482
Elements are your buttons, your forms,

117
00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:21.726
those kind of basic
building blocks of HTML.

118
00:07:21.726 --> 00:07:26.761
So if you think about HTML,
other than the basic ones

119
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:32.141
you have within HTML, P tags,
H tags, Italic strong,

120
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:37.650
those kinds of typographic ones,
they would be styles.

121
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.995
But then alongside those, you have a whole
load of elements like input elements,

122
00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:46.714
radio buttons, checkboxes,
those kinds of elements,

123
00:07:46.714 --> 00:07:50.062
they would be elements in a design system,
right?

124
00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:55.621
And then those come together you see are
multiple elements that make up components,

125
00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:56.177
right?

126
00:07:56.177 --> 00:08:00.303
So components are bigger
things like modals, Carousels,

127
00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:04.607
menus, and they're made up of
multiple elements together.

128
00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:07.410
Does that make sense?

129
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.436
I think that feels fairly logical,

130
00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:12.620
especially if you come from
a development background.

131
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.306
Now, you could get even more complicated,
and you could say, well, you could have

132
00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:21.276
components within components, and
they are thing in their own right.

133
00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:26.522
So for example, a header, we might
have a navigation component in it and

134
00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:30.911
a search component in it, so
is that a thing in its own right?

135
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:34.310
But no, I would just say that's
a component within a component.

136
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.076
Because primarily,
that's how Figma organizes it, right?

137
00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:40.946
That you can have nested
components in Figma, so

138
00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:43.752
that I kinda stick with
the same kinda wording.
