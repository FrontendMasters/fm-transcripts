[00:00:00]
>> Doing everything in Figma sounds great. But, I'm thinking about with all this work. Is there a way to make it agnostic so it's not tied to figure?
>> Wouldn't that be lovely?
>> Are you like?
>> Most of these platforms to be honest have got reasonable export options so you can take them across cross into other platforms.

[00:00:23]
But, it's always a bit janky when you do, it is it is difficult. I haven't found a clean way of doing it. And I've seen people move from sketch to figma and figma to sketch and try and take their design systems across and it it never worked particularly well.

[00:00:41]
I would love to give you a magic solution to that, cuz that will be lovely. But no, I'm afraid nothing springs to mind, yeah.
>> So, from a developer standpoint, what we do is we check and call into a repository.
>> Yes.
>> And then in that repository, before anything goes into that repository or main code base, there's a PR review.

[00:00:59]

>> Yeah.
>> So, if I see code that's being replicated all over the place instead of having it one central location.
>> Yeah.
>> You were explaining in an environment variable, and it changes everywhere else.
>> Yeah.
>> I won't let it pass.
>> No. .
>> Is there something like that that the product designers can follow with Figma or a?

[00:01:16]

>> [CROSSTALK] That sounds a really good idea. Let's do that, Figma, let's do that.
>> Cuz, I've had designers UX designers in particular come in. And they're changing the color or the hex code somewhere else where it's well defined in an a variable and they know that it's an invariant.

[00:01:33]

>> Yeah, it's, I know what you mean. It's worse than even that actually, is that you can set something as a variable, a color as a variable, and then you do something to the component. I can't even tell you what I've done sometimes. And then suddenly it's a hex value again.

[00:01:50]
I set that as a variable. So, it's quite compared to code, it's all quite immature. You design systems within these tools and we are very much at the mercy of the tools. So no, there's not that level of control over it anymore. I'm hoping that that will come in time and we are heading in the right direction.

[00:02:09]
But, now, from a design point of view, we're a bit backwards compared to developers with this stuff, sorry.
>> Thank you everybody. I really appreciate that. I hope it turns out to be helpful and if I can be helping the future, let me know.
>> And someone said it feels like you should be plugging some of your other workshops.

[00:02:27]

>> I did you have not been paying attention, right? So, I've got it written down on a bit of paper. So, I have plugged Steve's workshop on figma. And development is done another one on design systems using Storyball, which I'd never heard of, but looks it's zero-high equivalent.

[00:02:45]
I promoted Ben's workshop on enterprise design systems and management. I've mentioned numerous times my workshop on user research and testing, right? Which would be a really good one to go alongside this. I've done another one which is on. If you have a big idea, like you've got side project or you're thinking I'm gonna build a SaaS app and I'm gonna take the world by storm.

[00:03:11]
I've got a really depressing workshop on bringing you down to earth and ruining all your dreams, right? Now, it's no it's a pragmatic guide to what that process is like? What maybe you wanna do before you sync a lot of hours into building something to give it the best chance of success.

[00:03:29]
So, that's the other one. So, that about wraps us up for the day. If we summarize what we've covered today, we've looked at the fundamentals product design. We've looked at user research and how to go about doing that? We've discussed prototyping and testing our prototypes. And then finally we've looked at design systems.

[00:03:49]
And it's written on the screen and I said it at the beginning, but I will say it again. I sincerely want to help people with this, right? So, drop me me an email anytime to paul@bergwald.com. And I would love to answer your questions. And, because I know you do a course like this and it all seems so, overwhelming.

[00:04:11]
And it's when you actually come to do the nitty gritty, all these questions come to mind. Ask me, I don't mind answering. I've been doing this for 30 years. The community has given me so much over these years. And if I can give back, then that's great. Thanks very much, everybody.
