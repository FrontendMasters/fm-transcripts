WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.610
So when we've got this
massive functionality and

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.593
task that a user might want to complete
within an application, the most

3
00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:14.460
important thing is we need to know
which of those matter the most, right?

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.520
And this is where you get into top tasks,
right?

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.643
The main things that people wanna do.

6
00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:24.463
So why focus on top tasks?

7
00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:29.390
Well, it's crucial to make the primary
tasks that the user wants to

8
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.417
complete as accessible on your website or

9
00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:36.567
your web app as possible to
ensure that people can use it,

10
00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:40.988
especially if it's a thing
that they're doing regularly.

11
00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:45.128
And it's imperative that the secondary
stuff doesn't get in the way, right?

12
00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.718
Doesn't overwhelm you.

13
00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:48.074
And very broadly,

14
00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:54.175
typically 80% of your users will use about
20% of the tasks in your app, right,

15
00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:59.193
or features in your app, and
they'll just use those again and again.

16
00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:03.622
And so the last thing we wanna do is
the other 80% of the features to get in

17
00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:06.633
the way and make it hard for
them to find the stuff.

18
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:12.072
So once I know all of the things
that people can do on an app or

19
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.402
might want to do or
we could build or whatever,

20
00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:22.553
my next aim is to know, well,
which of these matter, right?

21
00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:24.353
Which of these matter the most?

22
00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:28.920
Now, never ever ask stakeholders that
because everybody will champion their own

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.863
idea and their own stuff.

24
00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:33.393
So I carry out something
called a top task analysis.

25
00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:38.052
And I talk about this on the user
research and testing course, but

26
00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:43.950
I do wanna touch on it here at least
a little bit, and it's a methodology.

27
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.470
I use my own homebrew version of it
just to speed things up a little bit.

28
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.396
But basically,

29
00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:53.641
it's a quick method of finding out what
people care about most on your apps.

30
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:58.303
And I'm running two of them right now
at the moment with my two projects I'm

31
00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:01.458
working on, and it's very simple.

32
00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:05.003
I use this app, which is called PollUnit.

33
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:09.726
And essentially all I'm
doing is I'm taking that

34
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:14.561
massive big list of tasks
that I've identified and

35
00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:19.172
I'm creating a poll with
all of them listed out,

36
00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:24.130
right, all of the different
tasks all listed down.

37
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.078
And I allow my target audience to either
suggest their own ideas to add to that

38
00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:34.616
list in case I miss something or to vote
on the ones that they care about the most.

39
00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:37.946
So it's a really simple process
to setting it up, right?

40
00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:40.304
I'm literally gonna talk you
through it on PollUnit so

41
00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.743
that you could do it
yourself if you wanted to.

42
00:02:42.743 --> 00:02:47.809
You go and create a new poll,
you collect ideas on it,

43
00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:54.913
you put in a bit of instructions
explaining what people are gonna be doing.

44
00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:59.323
So in this particular example,
it's saying when you're first joining

45
00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:03.951
the University of Florida, ask yourself
what tasks you wish to complete and

46
00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:06.281
what information you wanted to know.

47
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:11.244
And then I advise people to search for
a keyword relating to that task.

48
00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:14.192
If they find that somebody
had already added that or

49
00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:19.094
I'd added that, then they can just press
the heart button that votes it up.

50
00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.779
If it's not there,
they can add It themselves.

51
00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.573
And so basically then,
you enter all that advice in and

52
00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:31.185
then there's a few settings that you set
depending on your preference, whether

53
00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:36.260
you want people to be able to comment
on it and all of that kind of stuff.

54
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.249
And then you basically end up with this
thing where people can submit ideas and

55
00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.851
you can just add all of the ideas to
get it started of different tasks that

56
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.018
somebody might wanna complete.

57
00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:51.028
And then the users can go in,
they see the instructions,

58
00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:55.525
they find the one they're interested in,
they say yes I want that task.

59
00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:58.553
Makes sense, very broadly, get the idea?

60
00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:02.517
You can basically vote up and down tasks.

61
00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:07.050
So once that's been done, once you've
got a load of users looking at that and

62
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.885
voting on tasks that you want you
need to do a little bit of cleaning

63
00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:13.922
up afterwards cuz it tends
to be a little bit messy.

64
00:04:13.922 --> 00:04:18.947
So there'll be duplications where people
didn't bother searching, but just

65
00:04:18.947 --> 00:04:24.276
added the same idea again, or maybe they
worded it in a different way, or whatever.

66
00:04:24.276 --> 00:04:30.263
So you have to remove those duplications
because there'll be overlap.

67
00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:34.961
And then you need to simplify the wording
a little bit because sometimes

68
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.171
people say things in very
long convoluted ways,

69
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.164
and you can just reduce it down to two or
three words.

70
00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:46.472
And as I go through this in more
detail in the user research and

71
00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:51.795
testing course, you can actually even
use ChatGPT to help clean this up for

72
00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:56.294
you so that you don't spend hours
going through a big old list.

73
00:04:56.294 --> 00:05:01.017
But once you've got that list,
what you'll find is that,

74
00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:06.211
say if you had a list of 100 tasks
that someone might want to do,

75
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:12.043
probably most of the votes will
sit in the top 30 of those, right?

76
00:05:12.043 --> 00:05:14.065
And then there'll be a long
tail of other stuff.

77
00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:15.149
Yeah, we got a question.

78
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:22.993
&gt;&gt; What's your thoughts on platforms
that allow users to vote on features?

79
00:05:22.993 --> 00:05:27.887
&gt;&gt; Well, that's exactly what this is,
basically, is just we're doing

80
00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:32.514
it up front rather than for
new features later on down the line.

81
00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:34.944
But yeah, I mean, that's a great idea.

82
00:05:34.944 --> 00:05:38.985
In fact, I actually suggested it to
you yesterday when we were chatting,

83
00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:41.670
wouldn't I,
that it's a way that you can do it.

84
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.134
I'm a great fan of it because it
means that you can see what people

85
00:05:45.134 --> 00:05:46.437
really care about.

86
00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:49.167
And that's primarily what
PollUnit was set up for.

87
00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:53.285
I'm just using it in a slightly
different way to kind of preempt this

88
00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:55.857
before I actually start building stuff.

89
00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:57.376
But yeah, the principle is great,.

90
00:05:57.376 --> 00:06:02.133
&gt;&gt; But there is a double edged sword there
where it could be used against you where,

91
00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:07.247
say, a particular feature has all the
upvotes, but it's not implemented because,

92
00:06:07.247 --> 00:06:11.445
say, yeah, it's not a priority for
the company or something.

93
00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:16.445
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I would say there is an
obligation that falls onto the company to

94
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:20.894
clearly articulate why you're
not doing that feature, right?

95
00:06:20.894 --> 00:06:26.730
There's often good reasons if a feature
is too complicated to implement or

96
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.187
is not in line with the vision
of the app or whatever else.

97
00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:35.570
And I think you're better off
having that conversation with your

98
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.883
userbase than you are just
ignoring the problem, personally.

99
00:06:39.883 --> 00:06:43.159
You were gonna ask,
I saw a hand over here somewhere.

100
00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.573
Yeah, go for it.

101
00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:47.063
&gt;&gt; Is this essentially
the same as a Kano analysis?

102
00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:52.444
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not dissimilar.

103
00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:57.996
The trouble is people throw a lot of
different names around for things.

104
00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:03.130
But top task, I don't know a huge
amount about a Kano analysis,

105
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.975
so it's a little bit hard for
me to say definitively.

106
00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:13.750
But top task analysis was created
by a guy called Gerry McGovern.

107
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.545
It's been around for years.

108
00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:19.072
No doubt other people have taken it and
changed it and

109
00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:21.729
done their own things with it as have I.

110
00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.082
I'm not doing it exactly like he does.

111
00:07:25.082 --> 00:07:29.570
I'm a great believer in making
something as lightweight and

112
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.421
quick to do as possible.

113
00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:37.520
And I was saying this when we were
recording the other course as well,

114
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.464
was that oftentimes we talk
a lot about best practice and

115
00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:47.009
there are all these official
ways of doing things.

116
00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:51.833
And it puts this pressure on people
that they have to do it the right way.

117
00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:55.033
I mean, I know you guys have
just been doing a course, right?

118
00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:57.803
And you've been taught
the right way to do things.

119
00:07:57.803 --> 00:08:01.811
But in the real world,
when you're actually working on projects,

120
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.641
sometimes you have to do
it the quick way [LAUGH].

121
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:09.326
And so doing just a quick poll where
people vote is probably quicker

122
00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:13.272
than what you were talking about,
but I might be wrong.

123
00:08:13.272 --> 00:08:15.380
You had a question as well, did you?

124
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.372
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and one thing on the line of the
Kano survey is that it can find tasks and

125
00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:23.897
features that users don't
know that they will want.

126
00:08:23.897 --> 00:08:27.975
How do you discover those
in that top task analysis?

127
00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:32.059
&gt;&gt; You don't,
it's not a part of what it's doing.

128
00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.709
And that's actually a great
example then of how

129
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:42.457
sometimes you just want to
pare it down and get it done.

130
00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:48.520
I would argue let's not worry about
what users don't know that they need and

131
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.887
let's just sort out what
they know they need, right?

132
00:08:52.887 --> 00:09:00.537
And a lot of organizations are so,
Don't do the basics.

133
00:09:00.537 --> 00:09:01.229
Do you know?

134
00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:04.342
Don't meet people's fundamental needs.

135
00:09:04.342 --> 00:09:07.010
I'm going off on a rant now.

136
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.398
The number of times you go, yes,

137
00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:13.070
we want to personalize
the experience on the website.

138
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.862
Well, hang on a minute,
it's not even usable yet and

139
00:09:15.862 --> 00:09:18.739
you're worrying about personalization.

140
00:09:18.739 --> 00:09:23.491
So I would argue, look, first of all,
you deliver what they know they need and

141
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:27.308
they are asking for and
then worry about the other stuff later.

142
00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:33.255
But I might just be turning into a grumpy
old man, so take it or leave it, yeah?

143
00:09:33.255 --> 00:09:38.183
&gt;&gt; Yeah, rather than doing polls,
I actually was privileged at

144
00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:42.746
my last client to listen in on
to disputes, it was a bank.

145
00:09:42.746 --> 00:09:45.425
They allowed me to listen to disputes that

146
00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:49.262
customers would call in as well
as customer service calls.

147
00:09:49.262 --> 00:09:54.327
And then I also had the ability to partner
with legal to figure out the latest and

148
00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:57.169
greatest laws that
are being implemented to

149
00:09:57.169 --> 00:10:00.109
make sure that our app
is abiding by that law.

150
00:10:00.109 --> 00:10:02.608
But when I was gathering the top tasks,

151
00:10:02.608 --> 00:10:07.303
I would use those as a justification
to say, hey, one of the problems that

152
00:10:07.303 --> 00:10:11.318
banking mobile apps have is that
hackers would call in and say,

153
00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:15.977
hey share your screen and I'll show
you how to make a better investment.

154
00:10:15.977 --> 00:10:16.647
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

155
00:10:16.647 --> 00:10:21.685
&gt;&gt; And the problem with that is that if
you're starting to share your mobile app

156
00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:26.896
onto a screen so someone else can see
it visibly, that's a whole big problem.

157
00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:31.387
So what we've done in our app is
we can detect if you're sharing,

158
00:10:31.387 --> 00:10:34.412
we block it, you can't even share at all.

159
00:10:34.412 --> 00:10:37.643
You can't see anything
on the mobile device and

160
00:10:37.643 --> 00:10:39.917
also on the [COUGH] screen itself.

161
00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:43.688
But those things are justifiable.

162
00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:46.547
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
now that's very interesting, mind,

163
00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:50.946
because there is an example going back
to what you were saying that users

164
00:10:50.946 --> 00:10:55.737
wouldn't realize they needed that feature,
but they did need it.

165
00:10:55.737 --> 00:10:59.969
So perhaps I'm talking
rubbish then [LAUGH].

166
00:10:59.969 --> 00:11:02.444
So that's a very good use case.

167
00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:03.734
That's very true.

168
00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:04.784
Yeah, interesting.

169
00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:06.216
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I liked the polling thing but

170
00:11:06.216 --> 00:11:08.760
sometimes you just got to see
the sources inside of [INAUDIBLE].

171
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.190
&gt;&gt; You do, as I was saying on
the course about user research and

172
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.184
testing, you do what you can, right?

173
00:11:18.184 --> 00:11:22.360
If you get to do all that stuff,
power to you, I think that's amazing, and

174
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.553
I think it's a great opportunity you had.

175
00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:29.463
If you don't have that opportunity,
run in a poll, right?

176
00:11:29.463 --> 00:11:33.414
And to be honest, I would argue that
even if you did have that opportunity,

177
00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:35.453
I would still run the poll, right?

178
00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:39.794
So I would take all the things that
you learned from that opportunity,

179
00:11:39.794 --> 00:11:43.181
where all these different
places of potential tasks,

180
00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:47.399
everything you did was a place
to learn about potential tasks.

181
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:51.872
And once you know those tasks,
then you can kind of feed them into the,

182
00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:54.939
now it's gonna make me go
through this animation.

183
00:11:54.939 --> 00:12:00.869
Then you can feed it back into the actual
survey into the top task analysis.
