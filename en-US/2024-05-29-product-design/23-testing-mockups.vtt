00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:04.589
Mockups are another one that
I test when you produce more

2
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.015
kinda high fidelity mockups
of individual screens and

3
00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.873
that kind of stuff sometimes
I will test those.

4
00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:18.687
Really what I'm after is basically
shutting up stakeholders at this point.

5
00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:24.454
Stakeholders tend to be a right pain
in the ass when you show them a design,

6
00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:29.485
especially if it's a design with new or
different branding in.

7
00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:35.611
So stakeholders often disagree as to
what the best visual approach is,

8
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:41.034
so I use a bit of testing basically
to break that disagreement.

9
00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:46.793
Cuz you'll get one person say, I'd prefer
if it was green and another person would

10
00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:51.891
say, yeah, but it can't be this shade
of green because I don't like that

11
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:57.176
shade of green because it looks horrible
and it just devolves into rubbish.

12
00:00:57.176 --> 00:01:00.974
So the way I get around this
problem is right the front

13
00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:05.564
of a project I tend to get into
agree on a list of brand keywords.

14
00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:09.726
So these are words that represent
the brand that they wanna communicate.

15
00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:12.606
So do you wanna be conservative or
liberal?

16
00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.869
Do you wanna be friendly or formal?

17
00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.198
Do you wanna be, whatever.

18
00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:23.239
And actually there's an excellent brand
deck the physical card deck you can get or

19
00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:27.619
an online tool, you can do it either,
which has got loads of words on and

20
00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.563
they can say whether which
words they wanna be.

21
00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:35.610
All right, so you get all of that out
of the way let them decide what it is.

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.917
And then essentially once I've
produced the design that hopefully

23
00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:45.397
represents their words,
I'll run it through a survey.

24
00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:48.956
And it's officially called
a semantic differential survey,

25
00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:53.061
which I love because it sounds really
pretentious and like it's fancy.

26
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.944
So it must be good
personaly if it's fancy.

27
00:01:55.944 --> 00:02:01.289
So but actually, it's a very simple thing,
so you upload the design to it and

28
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.896
you could say something like on
a scale between formal and casual,

29
00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:08.462
how would you describe this design?

30
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:11.762
And then they can vote which
way they think it is and

31
00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:15.070
hopefully it ties up with
whatever you've said.

32
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.014
And the fact that the CEO doesn't like
the color suddenly becomes less important

33
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.805
because we know the design
is the appropriate keywords.

34
00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:23.177
I mean,
there are other ways of doing it as well.

35
00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:26.867
I quite like this way where
I'll take all the words and

36
00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.572
dump them into a list and
also words other people use.

37
00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:35.762
So you'll get situations like,
they'll see the design and

38
00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:40.352
they'll go, it's a bit uninspiring, right?

39
00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:43.969
Let's shove the word uninspiring in there,
or it's a bit bland,

40
00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.656
Shove the word bland in there.

41
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:49.687
And let's see whether anybody agrees
where the real users agree, right?

42
00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:53.842
And of course they don't cuz we're
not incompetent at our jobs.

43
00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:56.792
So, they select the right words,
not the wrong words.

44
00:02:56.792 --> 00:03:00.855
And now you suddenly told
the CEO to go and show them but

45
00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:05.295
without being quite so
rude about it and having some data.

46
00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:08.694
Sometimes, of course,
the other option is I do a comparison,

47
00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:11.710
especially if it's a very
competitive marketplace and

48
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.676
everybody keeps banging on
about their competitors.

49
00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:16.177
Have you ever heard that?

50
00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:18.252
We'd like it to be like so and so.

51
00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:20.757
They do it really well, right?

52
00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:24.853
Okay, yeah, let's just copy
the competition cuz you always win

53
00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:28.593
in a marketplace by copying
the competition, don't you?

54
00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:31.929
So I've got to the cynical and
bitter part of the day, haven't I?

55
00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:33.516
I've just noticed.

56
00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:38.434
[LAUGH] So essentially what I will
do in situations like that is we'll

57
00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:41.283
show them our version of the website and

58
00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:45.600
we'll show them the competitors
version of the website and

59
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.372
you'll say, which which do you
consider the most trustworthy?

60
00:03:50.372 --> 00:03:55.244
Or which do you consider the most friendly
or whatever words you wanna communicate.

61
00:03:55.244 --> 00:03:59.964
And hopefully they're picking my
design over the competition and

62
00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:01.991
you kind of prove the point.

63
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.421
And again, these kinds of tests
are super easy to set up.

64
00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:07.517
And the results basically speak for
themselves.

65
00:04:07.517 --> 00:04:08.522
So setting them up,

66
00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:12.198
you basically just upload the different
versions you ask your question.

67
00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:16.688
They get to see the different versions,
you just click on the one they like, and

68
00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:21.258
then you end up results like that at the
end that tells you this version is better.

69
00:04:21.258 --> 00:04:27.007
And then as I said it earlier, if you
wanna get super fancy with mockups and

70
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:33.443
really wow your stakeholders and shut
them up with the whole, did they see it?

71
00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:35.089
You make the logo bigger?

72
00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:37.824
Why?
Cuz I'm worried people won't see it.

73
00:04:37.824 --> 00:04:38.913
Well, they will.

74
00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:40.775
Yeah, but I'm worried they won't, right?

75
00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:42.038
Okay, fair enough.

76
00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:47.056
So, in that kind of situation,
I'll either do a five

77
00:04:47.056 --> 00:04:52.083
second test and
hope that people mentioned the logo.

78
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.674
Or alternatively,
maybe even sometimes I do eye tracking.

79
00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:59.901
There you can actually do eye tracking
now with just a webcam using a service

80
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:00.582
like rely.

81
00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:04.672
It's a bit of a faff, and
often times I don't bother, and

82
00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:09.935
instead I use that eye tracking
simulation software I mentioned earlier,

83
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:12.713
which was called Attention Insights.

84
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:17.348
And it's enough just to kind of prove,
look at that big red

85
00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:21.993
blob over the top of the logo,
we don't need to make it bigger.

86
00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:25.350
So that kind of works pretty
well in most situations.

87
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.415
So that's how I deal with mockups.

88
00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:30.660
Mockups are less of an issue in
product design, so hopefully,

89
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.594
you won't spend too much of your time
faffing around with that kinda thing.
