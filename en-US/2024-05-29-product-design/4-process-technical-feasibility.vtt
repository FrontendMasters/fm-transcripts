WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
As designers, we do have this habit of
going, well, that's the techies problem.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.253
[LAUGH] But actually, we need to
work in harmony with developers and

3
00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:13.290
side by side with them.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.507
So we need to understand
technical feasibility and

5
00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:18.384
whether our idea was scaled.

6
00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:23.606
Is there anyone here old
enough to remember dig.com?

7
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:27.793
Yeah, it was shoot it's really
funny how something could be so

8
00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:31.587
huge at one point and
then nobody knows about it anymore.

9
00:00:31.587 --> 00:00:36.830
It really was, it was like Facebook level
huge back in the day, and I happened

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.923
to be friends with the lead designer
there and the lead developer, right?

11
00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:44.824
Daniel Burka and Joe Stump.

12
00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:47.529
And they told me this or
Daniel told me this story.

13
00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:51.415
The whole premise of Digg was
that you had, it was a bit,

14
00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:53.667
I guess it was a bit like Reddit.

15
00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:58.339
That you could post stories basically,
things in the news that's up and

16
00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.644
then people can dig it, vote it up.

17
00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:05.691
Okay, and so there was this little
badge where you could vote things up or

18
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:10.923
down, and Daniel was messing around
designing a new version of the badge.

19
00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:18.498
And luckily he showed it to Joe before
he showed it to the big bosses, right?

20
00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:23.400
Because Joe took one look at it and
said, if you design it like that,

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.442
I'm gonna have to add at
least ten new servers, right,

22
00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:33.295
simply because of the demand that it would
put on the code base doing it like that.

23
00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:36.720
So understanding the technology and
the feasibility and

24
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.365
the scalability of things is so important.

25
00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:44.080
I'm not saying you need to be an expert
developer, but you do need to a,

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.289
at least talk to your developer.

27
00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.819
And if I'm gonna throw something
controversial into the thing,

28
00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.462
I would say you need to know how
to write HTML, CSS as well, right?

29
00:01:57.462 --> 00:01:58.904
I will get in trouble for that,

30
00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.854
I suspect, because a lot of people
disagree with me over that.

31
00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:04.194
But I think it's fundamental.

32
00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:08.824
And when we come on later to talk about
prototyping in Figma and design systems,

33
00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:12.693
you will see just how important it
is to understand how code works,

34
00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:16.865
at least a basic level, if you wanna
call yourself a product designer.

35
00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:21.841
Or, I would argue, a web designer or
a user interface designer.

36
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:27.339
Anyway, you can shout
at me when you want to.

37
00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.885
All the hands that went up then.

38
00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.894
[LAUGH] Yeah, you go for it first.

39
00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:35.646
&gt;&gt; How important do you think
Javascript is to product designers and-

40
00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:39.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a Javascript is a bit trickier.

41
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.071
I don't include that as a requirement.

42
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:48.177
The reason I don't, and
this will become more obvious

43
00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:53.627
when we start looking at Figma and
and prototyping later.

44
00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:58.381
But the big thing that you need to
understand as a designer is the idea of

45
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:00.243
the CSS box model, right?

46
00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:03.872
So, it's how pages are constructed and
put together.

47
00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:07.609
That's the fundamental
because you make life so

48
00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.629
much easier if you just
design things well in Figma.

49
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.680
But when it comes to interaction,
then A, it starts getting

50
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.545
more complicated and there is only so
much that you can do.

51
00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:26.358
And B, probably the way that you
would do it would have to be

52
00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:30.006
completely thrown out by a grownup anyway.

53
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:32.083
So I wouldn't include that as much.

54
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.181
I mean,
I know I'd have write a bit of Javascript.

55
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:39.123
I certainly know how to write using
various Javascript libraries, but

56
00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:40.777
it's not a necessity.

57
00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.315
It's not as big a deal.

58
00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:43.622
Yeah, you had a question.

59
00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:48.750
&gt;&gt; When it comes to HTML and CSS,
are you saying that it'd be good for

60
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.504
product designers to become fluent in it,
to be able to say,

61
00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.570
okay, I can write my own?

62
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.052
Or are you saying it's important to
conceptually understand how it works and

63
00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:02.915
why some things are done?

64
00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:06.859
&gt;&gt; Both, so what I mean by that
is you've got to start somewhere.

65
00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.574
As I said in my user research and testing
course, something's better than nothing.

66
00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:17.988
So to begin with, just get your head
around conceptually how it works,

67
00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:20.164
but I wouldn't stop there.

68
00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:24.809
I would say, you need to, if you've
got a page in front of you in Figma,

69
00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:29.704
I think it would be healthy and good
that you could build that page, right?

70
00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:33.383
You won't build it as well as
the developer will, right?

71
00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:38.088
But you should at least be
able to have a go, right?

72
00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:41.137
And get to roughly the right result.

73
00:04:41.137 --> 00:04:46.685
That would be my recommendation, but
I don't wanna shame anybody from it.

74
00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:51.095
I don't wanna make people to feel
inadequate if they've not got that

75
00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:52.015
capability.

76
00:04:52.015 --> 00:04:57.050
And conceptually understanding it
is a really good starting point,

77
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.232
but we should always be pushing to expand
our understanding and knowledge, right?

78
00:05:03.232 --> 00:05:05.874
And I was saying you need to
learn a bit about psychology,

79
00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:07.757
you need to learn a bit about marketing.

80
00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:11.238
Well, you need to learn a little
bit about development as well.

81
00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:15.961
So just push yourself, I guess is what
I'm saying more than anything else.

82
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.631
The other thing that is crucial,
I think, to product design,

83
00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:25.037
and we're gonna unpack all of
these things more later, but

84
00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:28.137
is this idea of just simplicity, right?

85
00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:34.155
But having a mechanism by which
you can take anything and

86
00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:36.980
make it simpler, right?

87
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.815
Having a process for
doing that is so invaluable, right?

88
00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:51.630
I regularly get called in to sort
out [LAUGH] web apps, right?

89
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.595
And I was doing one quite
recently actually for

90
00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:58.652
a warehouse management software.

91
00:05:58.652 --> 00:05:59.949
And it had been,

92
00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.799
created by very talented team of
developers that have done an amazing job.

93
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.629
But they've been asked to add more and
more and more to it new pieces of

94
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.204
fat every time a client asked for a piece
of functionality, they just added it in.

95
00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:18.081
And it's not a job to kind of
sort out the user experience.

96
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.760
So eventually they got me involved.

97
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.615
And the route that I use when I'm faced
by that is is really, really simple.

98
00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:33.524
It's not rocket science, is this is
a starting point event or you do reach

99
00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:37.450
a point where you need to kind of rethink
the whole structure of the thing.

100
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.184
But what I was basically doing there
was going through screen by screen and

101
00:06:44.184 --> 00:06:50.276
on each screen I would look at every
single element on that screen.

102
00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:54.466
Every menu item, every icon,
every input field,

103
00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:57.878
absolutely everything on that screen and

104
00:06:57.878 --> 00:07:01.790
I ask myself three questions in order,
right?

105
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.535
Question number one, is can I remove this?

106
00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:08.734
What happens if I just remove it,
delete it as getting rid of it, right?

107
00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:11.590
And sometimes it's amazing
how much you can do that.

108
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.603
So for example, icons, right,
that app was riddled with icons,

109
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.297
every option had an icon next to it.

110
00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:25.568
And then you reach a point where it's
like, how does this icon help, right?

111
00:07:25.568 --> 00:07:27.678
Because it was all English speaking.

112
00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:30.033
It wasn't meant to be multilingual.

113
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.791
So it's like, what's this adding to it?

114
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:35.401
What would happen if I deleted it?

115
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.048
And the answer was, well, nothing.

116
00:07:38.048 --> 00:07:42.387
At which point you go, well,
let's delete it then, right?

117
00:07:42.387 --> 00:07:45.930
But obviously, there are some
things you can't delete, right?

118
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.080
For example, the main menu that was
going down the left hand side, right?

119
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.873
Loads of different options,

120
00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:57.617
all of which were apparently essential
set aside whether they all were or not.

121
00:07:57.617 --> 00:08:02.694
So as I worked down that menu,
my next question was, well,

122
00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:07.377
can I hide some of these
elements in this menu, right?

123
00:08:07.377 --> 00:08:12.021
Instead of they had like 30, I think
something like 30 elements all down a side

124
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:16.460
menu and it was like, my eyes are bleeding
looking at this list and I said well,

125
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.115
which ones of these are used the most,
right?

126
00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:23.376
To which the answer was well, people
really are only looking at those four.

127
00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:25.790
All right, well,
why are all the others there then?

128
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.590
So I put all the rest under a kind of dot
dot dot thing or hiding things away, or

129
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.165
should we be doing that?

130
00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:37.826
Well, if 80% of people are looking at
those four, then let's make it easy for

131
00:08:37.826 --> 00:08:42.492
those 80% of people before we
worry about the 20% looking for

132
00:08:42.492 --> 00:08:44.760
other obscure things, right?

133
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.763
And sure,
there were other ways of solving it.

134
00:08:46.763 --> 00:08:51.629
We could have had different permissions
that had different things in the menu, but

135
00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:55.469
that was the quick and
easy way of just hiding some stuff, right?

136
00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:57.204
And then, but
sometimes you can't hide things.

137
00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:02.939
So the biggest, the great example of that
is, we need to show our privacy policy and

138
00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:06.911
our cookie notifications for
compliance reasons, right?

139
00:09:06.911 --> 00:09:08.989
It was you,
you work in banking, don't you?

140
00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:09.863
As I remember, yeah.

141
00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:11.335
Banking's terrible for this.

142
00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:14.614
You have loads of compliance
things all over the place, right?

143
00:09:14.614 --> 00:09:15.158
No, no,

144
00:09:15.158 --> 00:09:19.928
you couldn't hide that because you need to
tell people that their house is at risk.

145
00:09:19.928 --> 00:09:25.291
But what you can do is you can shrink it
you can visually de-emphasize it, right?

146
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:31.612
So that it doesn't dominate the design and
it's not adding confusion, and clutter.

147
00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:36.699
I mean, this isn't rocket science,
is it, but you have to go through

148
00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:41.541
every element on every screen doing
this saying, can I remove it?

149
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.138
No, can I hide it?

150
00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:44.768
No, can I shrink it?

151
00:09:44.768 --> 00:09:47.654
Yes, for every element.
