WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.510
Then of course, there's usability, right?

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.030
How easy is this thing to use?

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.280
Is it easy to learn?

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.880
Is it quick to complete tasks?

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.174
The common tasks that we most want to do?

6
00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:15.490
Is it quick and easy to do that?

7
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.084
Is it forgiving of mistakes?

8
00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:21.003
This is one that's often overlooked,
right?

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.449
And then what happens is, you see,
designers, I love designers.

10
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.333
I'm a designer, right?

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:30.687
But let's make a sweeping generalization
about designers now that is absolutely not

12
00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:33.573
true, but there is a grain of truth in it.

13
00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:36.953
And that sweeping generalization
is we are big picture people.

14
00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:40.735
We think holistically about systems,
right?

15
00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:50.125
We are terrible at thinking about
edge cases where things go wrong.

16
00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:51.585
And so what happens?

17
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:57.268
The developers in the room have to code
up all of these error messages and

18
00:00:57.268 --> 00:01:02.564
if this goes wrong then and
they write error messages.

19
00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:06.890
And I'm sorry, no offense,
you're rubbish at it.

20
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.053
Right, 404 error.

21
00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:12.580
Whoa, what's that, right?

22
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.465
Or they try and be funny.

23
00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:20.247
The page you're looking for
cannot be found, or.

24
00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:24.511
All these kinds of rubbish kind
of star wars references, and

25
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.110
this is not the page you're looking for
and, no, terrible, but

26
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.873
it's because we as designers
haven't done our job of

27
00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:37.247
actually looking at how we're
gonna deal with these things.

28
00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:44.162
Accessibility is another big part
of what we do as product designers.

29
00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:48.976
There's user accessibility,
does it meet the needs of the user?

30
00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.997
For example,
a user that's got special needs,

31
00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:56.212
whether those needs are permanent,
situational, or temporary.

32
00:01:56.212 --> 00:02:01.760
And I don't know whether you're aware of
this distinction between accessibility and

33
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.058
inclusive design.

34
00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:08.140
But I tend to talk about
inclusive design a lot more than

35
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.554
accessibility because when you talk about,
if you say for

36
00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:17.974
example, we've got to make our website so

37
00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:22.524
it can be used for
people that are blind, right?

38
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.524
Or have got vision problems.

39
00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:28.769
Then the company owner goes, well,
we don't have employees that

40
00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.825
have got visual disability, so
we don't need to worry about that.

41
00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:35.369
And it gets written off, right?

42
00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.869
And nobody does it.

43
00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.345
But what if you say, okay,

44
00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:44.963
we need to make our web app accessible for
anybody over 50.

45
00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:46.455
Yeah, we got people like that.

46
00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:51.497
Also people that have got vision problems,
right?

47
00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:59.157
Or what about people may be
that get eye fatigue a lot.

48
00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:02.145
So that's what I mean by inclusive design.

49
00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:05.511
There are people with permanent
disabilities, may be for example,

50
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:07.618
they're an amputee, right?

51
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:10.378
Or they might have
a situational disability.

52
00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:13.214
They're holding a toddler, so
they haven't got used to that arm, or

53
00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:16.828
they might have a temporary
disability they've broken their arm.

54
00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:21.536
Effectively, they're all suffering from
the same problem [LAUGH] which is they

55
00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:23.572
can't use this arm, right?

56
00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:28.370
So it's really important that we
think about these things as we're

57
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.673
building apps because it's not just
about the guy with the amputated arm,

58
00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:36.979
it's also the person
holding their toddler.

59
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.725
It was a bit waffly, apologies for that.

60
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:44.398
And then there's device accessibility,
which we've talked about before,

61
00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:48.784
where you need to think about the size,
the platform, the input method,

62
00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:54.275
the operating system, all of these
things that are relevant to the device.

63
00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.975
There's a lot of accessibility
needs that we need to consider.

64
00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:00.627
And then interactivity, especially,

65
00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:04.639
this is where product, we really kind
of focus in on product design and

66
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.467
some of the things that web apps have that
maybe a traditional website doesn't, and

67
00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:13.897
we need to be giving careful consideration
to a whole range of interactions.

68
00:04:13.897 --> 00:04:20.681
Sliders, drag and drop, tag management,
QR codes, modules, draws, tool tips.

69
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:26.010
There's loads of this kind of stuff,
all of which you need to be considered.

70
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.305
I know I'm beginning,

71
00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:31.320
this is just a long list of things that
are probably overwhelming you, but

72
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.490
it's showing the breadth and the depth
of what product design is all about.

73
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.808
Security, logins, account management,
communications, right?

74
00:04:42.808 --> 00:04:48.438
How do we reassure users that their
security and privacy are under control.

75
00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:51.618
How do we give them a sense of control
over those kinds of things, right?

76
00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:56.409
That's another aspect that we
need to be thinking about.

77
00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.550
How much time do we as
designers spend thinking about,

78
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.692
logins, probably very little.

79
00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:07.283
But yeah,
it's fundamental to the experience.

80
00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:10.879
And it's a great example of the thing
that we're doing again and again and

81
00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.213
again and again.

82
00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:16.433
So that's one of those things that
can really begin to annoy you.

83
00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:20.933
Like those pointless check boxes, right?

84
00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:22.393
You know the ones?

85
00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:26.773
Username, password, remember me,
does it ever remember you?

86
00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:31.873
Have you ever been to a site where it
actually remembers you next time you come?

87
00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.982
Why are those checkboxes there?

88
00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:37.889
[LAUGH] I don't get them.

89
00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.143
It's ridiculous.

90
00:05:39.143 --> 00:05:41.761
Anyway, that's, again, off the point.

91
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:46.029
And then, of course,
there's all the branding stuff as well.

92
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.947
We need to ensure that our branding
is consistent across our web apps.

93
00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:53.989
We need to make them recognizable and
memorable and

94
00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:57.941
we need to make an emotional connection,
right?

95
00:05:58.951 --> 00:06:03.553
So it's like,
Mailchimp was a great example of this,

96
00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:08.557
of a user interface that was
incredibly compelling because

97
00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:13.912
it had character,
it had fun to it, it was engaging.

98
00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:17.114
And yet over the years,
it's become more and

99
00:06:17.114 --> 00:06:21.170
more corporate, and
it's lost a lot of that character.

100
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.070
Now, I'm not necessarily
saying that's wrong, right?

101
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.427
It may be that they've made a conscious
move towards the corporate market,

102
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:36.040
but we as product designers need
to be worrying about this stuff.

103
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.727
You've reached the end of the list, right?

104
00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:42.585
The list of things that you've got to
think about as a product designer.

105
00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:46.895
Wow, that was quite an overwhelming
list and I'm sorry about that.

106
00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:52.325
But I wanted you to see the nuances and
the complexity of this,

107
00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:57.653
that it is so much more than
creating an interface in Figma and

108
00:06:57.653 --> 00:07:02.619
that there's deeper
considerations going on here.

109
00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:08.170
The product designer is
as much about shaping

110
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.996
the product as the interface, right?

111
00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:14.402
Do you see what I'm getting at there?

112
00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:19.159
That a UI's design job is
they've given functionality and

113
00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.830
they create the user interface.

114
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.238
A product designer is
shaping the whole product,

115
00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:30.189
everything from the branding to
the functionality, to the interface,

116
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:34.588
to the experience as a whole,
it's all part of one big picture.
