1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.089
Which brings me on to testing live apps.

2
00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.140
Once your app is up and running,
really, now's the moment, people.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.992
This is the moment where
actually testing is so, so

4
00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:18.467
important because you'll never get
your app right first time, right?

5
00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:22.691
Setting aside MVPs and all the rest of it,
you'll make a mess of it, you'll

6
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:27.130
do something wrong, there'll be things
that can be improved without a doubt.

7
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.856
So this is the point where
you've really got a kick in and

8
00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:32.730
start really paying attention
to what's going on.

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.860
That's so much easier if you've
got the right tools for the job.

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.874
I highly recommend Microsoft clarity, and

11
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:45.972
installing that,
you probably never even heard of it,

12
00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:50.556
but it's a free version of Hotjar, right?

13
00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:53.984
Very low impact on performance,
which I like, and

14
00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:58.786
it gives me everything I need to
monitor users on a live app, right?

15
00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:02.851
And by the way, it works with native apps
as well, which obviously is important.

16
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.063
So what do I do?

17
00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:11.073
Okay, so once I've got Microsoft clarity
up and running, what I'm basically doing

18
00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:16.241
straightaway is I'm diving into clarity
and I'm looking for certain things, right?

19
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.049
I'm paying attention to certain analytics,
exit points.

20
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.684
Where are people abandoning the app, okay?

21
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:28.546
That's actually almost more useful when
you're talking about an informational

22
00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.654
website, cuz on apps it's
a bit more complicated.

23
00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:36.343
But you will be able to see that maybe
people drop out from certain places

24
00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:38.854
where they're getting frustrated.

25
00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:42.740
But where you've got the real good
metrics are things like misclicks, where

26
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.417
people are clicking on something that's
not clickable or isn't currently active.

27
00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:51.989
So oftentimes a button that's disabled or
they think they can click through to get

28
00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.493
more information on a link or on a piece
of text where it's not really clickable,

29
00:01:56.493 --> 00:02:00.985
or all things like that,
you'll suddenly see all of those, right?

30
00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:02.430
Rage clicks is another one.

31
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.762
[LAUGH] Where people just lose their shit
and start going, no, no, no, no, you've

32
00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:12.433
got a big issue when you start seeing
a lot of those on a particular screen.

33
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:16.351
And then there's excessive scrolling,
where people are going, if you roll that

34
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:19.867
up, and they just shoot up and down
a page when they're kind of, you reach

35
00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:23.930
a certain point when you've done that,
so you've looked for what you're seeing.

36
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.390
You're not seeing it, so
then you start going like that, right?

37
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.940
Everybody does it,
it's a weird thing that we do.

38
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.012
So it's a good indication that you've
got something wrong at that point.

39
00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:35.740
And then the final one is quick backs.

40
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.641
So they go to a screen and
then go immediately back,

41
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:43.093
which means that obviously, they didn't
find what they were looking for, or

42
00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:47.149
they didn't look like what they
expected it to, or there's an issue.

43
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.386
So I start with that.

44
00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:55.259
And I look at those problem areas,
and you can get them as heat maps and

45
00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.786
so you can look at those pages.

46
00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.992
Sometimes it is obvious, right?

47
00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:03.684
Yeah, they tried to click on something
that's not clickable that really should

48
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.866
have been a clickable thing, we'll make
it clickable thing job done, right, yeah.

49
00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:12.224
&gt;&gt; Well, this catch on unhandled
exception errors or it just-

50
00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.676
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it will actually.

51
00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:18.692
I didn't mention that cuz I'm not focusing
so much on kind of debugging and things

52
00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:24.333
like that, but we should pick up that
kind of thing as well, error messaging.

53
00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:28.473
I haven't used it, so I can't 100%
promise that, but I think it does.

54
00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.402
So yeah, there's sometimes you look at it
and go, all right, so people are having

55
00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:38.103
problems at this point, but I'm not
entirely sure what's going on here.

56
00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:42.502
So you can get additional clarification,
heat maps, work really well, so

57
00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:45.043
you can now dig in and
go, okay, well let's

58
00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:50.748
have a look at the scrolling on that page,
let's look at what people are clicking on.

59
00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:57.028
The heat map sometimes help, but the one
that really helps is session recordings.

60
00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:00.838
So I watched back session recording,
so let's say a particular screen,

61
00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:03.547
it's got loads of rage clicks going on it.

62
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:08.123
So what I will do is,
I'll filter my sessions by all of

63
00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:12.607
those that go to that screen and
do rage clicks.

64
00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:15.436
And then I'll watch sit and
watch those videos back and

65
00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:18.831
see what people are doing, right,
and where it's going wrong.

66
00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:22.499
Now, if I get really
sudden 90% of the time,

67
00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:26.115
you'll then go, yeah, but doing that.

68
00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:27.520
[LAUGH] Yeah, we messed up.

69
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.820
So, and you're like, okay,
I know how to fix this, right?

70
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.230
The other 10% of the time, you guys, I
still have no clue what's happening there.

71
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.560
So that's when I would run some
facilitated usability testing, right?

72
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.753
Because then I can actually talk to that
person and work out what's happening

73
00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:47.832
there, cuz obviously you can't talk
to people over session recordings.

74
00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:51.284
But most of the time you'll have
an idea of what's gone wrong.

75
00:04:51.284 --> 00:04:54.744
So then we've got fixed what's gone wrong,
right?

76
00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:59.746
And there's two ways of
kind of testing those fixes

77
00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:04.877
depending on the size of the fix,
one is AB testing.

78
00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:09.250
AB testing used to be so easy,
there used to be Google Optimize, and

79
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.342
you could just shove it on your site and
you could do AB testing.

80
00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:16.803
These days they've closed
down Google Optimize,

81
00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:20.355
which is such a shame because it was free.

82
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:25.416
And now there are lots of
expensive things like convert,

83
00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:30.266
which cost like 300 plus
dollars a month to run, but

84
00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:37.387
the AB testing is great, because
basically, it gives you a WYSIWYG editor.

85
00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:41.879
So if it's just little changes like I need
to change the color of the button, or

86
00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.775
I need to move this image, or
I need a bit of explanation text added.

87
00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:48.774
You could do all of that
through a WYSIWYG editor and

88
00:05:48.774 --> 00:05:53.052
just run it with a percentage of users
to see whether it improved things.

89
00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.422
And if it did,
then you can roll it out to everybody.

90
00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:02.990
There are alternatives Crazy Egg
is a much cheaper platform,

91
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.851
not quite as powerful,
but does do AB testing.

92
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:11.146
So if you wanna give it a go by
all means that's one way to do it.

93
00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:14.496
We get into AB testing a bit
more in the other course.

94
00:06:14.496 --> 00:06:20.076
The other option is testing
big solute solutions.

95
00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:21.982
So what do I mean by that?

96
00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:25.430
Well, sometimes it's not a matter
of just changing a bit of text or

97
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.332
changing a color on a button.

98
00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:29.052
Sometimes it's, yeah,

99
00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:32.702
we're gonna have to change the whole
way that filters work here.

100
00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:37.052
Or this really needs a wizard
bit used doing it for you.

101
00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:41.831
And that kind of thing you can't easily
do with AB testing, cuz with AB testing,

102
00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:43.670
you have to build it.

103
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.329
And if you don't know whether your
solution is gonna be a good one, you don't

104
00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:51.890
wanna spend all that money, building that
thing for it to then not work, right?

105
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.195
So in those situations,
it's back to prototyping again.

106
00:06:55.195 --> 00:07:00.537
We wireframe it up,
we do some testing with some facilitated

107
00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:06.000
usability testing,
see whether it seems to work for people.

108
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.151
And if it does, then we build it and
then we roll it out.

109
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:11.647
So that's kind of how I handled testing,

110
00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:16.496
I went through that really fast because I
wanted ample time for the last part, but

111
00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:19.780
there is an entire course
on that if you so wish.

112
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.487
Just to kind of wrap that up, testing is
absolutely essential to product design.

113
00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:30.288
If you're working in a company and they're
trying that you're doing product design

114
00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:34.647
and you don't get to test, then you're
not doing product design, right?

115
00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:38.357
I don't know what you're doing,
but you're not doing that.

116
00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:43.097
Testing should be done, in my opinion,
at least often and early, right?

117
00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:47.096
Lots of little rounds of testing,
testing very, very specific things that

118
00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:51.996
you're worried about or concerned about,
not just doing it for the sake of it.

119
00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:56.183
And I would argue it can be carried out
throughout the development cycle from

120
00:07:56.183 --> 00:07:59.256
initial wireframing to
post launch iteration.

121
00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:03.414
There's never a time when you
won't be unsure about something,

122
00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:09.304
you won't disagree about something, you
won't need clarification over something.

123
00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:12.001
So as long as those things are happening,

124
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:15.016
there's an opportunity
to run a little test.

125
00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:19.755
Are there any questions about testing,
cuz I have gone through that so

126
00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:21.209
ridiculously fast?

127
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:26.299
And I recognize not everybody has
seen the other course, so I'm happy

128
00:08:26.299 --> 00:08:30.214
to deal with any questions here, yeah,
&gt;&gt; Just a quick comment.

129
00:08:30.214 --> 00:08:31.774
In my last client,

130
00:08:31.774 --> 00:08:37.291
doing mobile is a little bit harder
in terms of deployment cycles.

131
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:37.791
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

132
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.251
&gt;&gt; Because we have to
go through the stores.

133
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:43.530
So Google or Apple are gonna say,
hey, you did something wrong,

134
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.166
then that brings us back to,
we got to go fix it.

135
00:08:46.166 --> 00:08:49.821
So the way we did our testing was,
whenever there was a new feature,

136
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.899
the UX UI team would come to us and
say, here's the flow,

137
00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.717
this is what we're playing for.

138
00:08:54.717 --> 00:08:56.995
And then that's when we get all our input,
and

139
00:08:56.995 --> 00:09:01.237
we break it down to small stories to
incrementally get to that final feature.

140
00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:07.073
But before story got into a PR review,
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

141
00:09:07.073 --> 00:09:09.813
&gt;&gt; The developer that worked
on that story would showcase.

142
00:09:09.813 --> 00:09:11.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So we would do what we call

143
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.623
an amigo review.

144
00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:14.659
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then we would get stakeholders,

145
00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:17.644
UI UX teams, all you know,
we didn't add enough padding here or

146
00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:19.153
something some,
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

147
00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:24.512
&gt;&gt; So every time we did a story,
we did very early amigo testing.

148
00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:26.709
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Got feedback from everybody, and

149
00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:30.733
that helped a lot because by the time we
finally did push to the store everyone had

150
00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:31.807
their input.

151
00:09:31.807 --> 00:09:36.674
So it came down to story, developers
showed their work, got the feedback,

152
00:09:36.674 --> 00:09:40.857
and then went through PR review,
and then it went through QA, and

153
00:09:40.857 --> 00:09:44.637
then we went through
the product owners approval.

154
00:09:44.637 --> 00:09:48.177
&gt;&gt; Where's the user in that?

155
00:09:48.177 --> 00:09:51.338
And that's the shortcut,
everything else sounded great, right?

156
00:09:51.338 --> 00:09:53.608
You were engaging with stakeholders,

157
00:09:53.608 --> 00:09:57.596
you had a good working relationship
between UX and development, but

158
00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:01.427
there is no interaction with
the user in that process, right?

159
00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:04.502
And that's the fundamental problem there.

160
00:10:04.502 --> 00:10:09.132
And I understand that you have
this barrier this of the store.

161
00:10:09.132 --> 00:10:13.220
But that doesn't mean that, when the UX
team, perhaps the UX team are doing it and

162
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.030
you're just not aware, cuz you've
been working on the development side.

163
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.531
But when the UX team is
creating that prototype,

164
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:24.319
that prototype needs to be put in front of
users to make sure that that's working.

165
00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:27.506
&gt;&gt; I have to step back,
I'm sorry, we did have users.

166
00:10:27.506 --> 00:10:29.178
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So we-

167
00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:30.754
&gt;&gt; Cuz it's such a thorough process.

168
00:10:30.754 --> 00:10:33.569
So I was like,
how can there not be users logged in that?

169
00:10:33.569 --> 00:10:36.341
&gt;&gt; Before we were finally
released to the general audience?

170
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:36.919
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

171
00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:41.620
&gt;&gt; There's tools called
Google Play store and TestFlight.

172
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

173
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.338
&gt;&gt; That's where you could say, hey,
this is going really into production, but

174
00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:48.285
into a limit number of production.

175
00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:53.101
&gt;&gt; And that's fine, and has its value,
but you've fallen into that

176
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:58.003
trap of all the testing being at
the end when it's most expensive and

177
00:10:58.003 --> 00:11:00.805
most difficult to change it.

178
00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:06.124
I would say that your UX team at
the beginning, when they mock it up and

179
00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:10.095
prototype it,
they should pass it via some users.

180
00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:12.443
It's not gonna be a final app or
anything like that.

181
00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:16.494
But in Figma for crying out launch,
there's an associated

182
00:11:16.494 --> 00:11:21.366
mobile app which allows you to display
prototypes and tests with them.

183
00:11:22.377 --> 00:11:25.736
Lookback I think works on mobile as well,
so you can record the screen and

184
00:11:25.736 --> 00:11:27.047
do that kind of things.

185
00:11:27.047 --> 00:11:30.217
Or you could get people in,
there's lots of ways of doing it.

186
00:11:30.217 --> 00:11:33.794
Or you could just do, even if all you
did was a little bit of testing on some

187
00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:37.907
mock-up screens that were related to it,
that's better than nothing.

188
00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:42.821
So I would try and push some testing
towards the beginning of the process,

189
00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:45.924
so that there's more
flexibility to change.

190
00:11:45.924 --> 00:11:51.014
Cuz let's be honest, once it's gone
through QA, once all the stakeholders

191
00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:55.954
have approved it, once the developer
has built it, there's no way.

192
00:11:55.954 --> 00:11:59.900
Even if it's then sent out to test
flight and everybody hates it,

193
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.711
it's gone through so many rounds of
getting internal approval that you're not

194
00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:07.830
gonna change it at that late date,
it's too late.

195
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.984
So that's why testing earlier
is always better, in my opinion,

196
00:12:11.984 --> 00:12:13.655
I keep adding my opinion.

197
00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:18.372
&gt;&gt; I guess you're right, we really didn't
incorporate the users at the early phases.

198
00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:22.287
&gt;&gt; If so, and that's the trouble,
that's a big problem, whenever I need

199
00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:26.497
to learn this actually, because I've
fallen into this several times.

200
00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:31.927
I talk about testing, and in my head,
I'm always talking about user testing.

201
00:12:31.927 --> 00:12:34.725
But of course, if you're a developer,
you're not talking about,

202
00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:37.586
you're talking about quality and
bug testing and that kind of stuff.

203
00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:41.339
So different people use the same
language to mean different things,

204
00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:43.685
and actually that's really dangerous.

205
00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:49.397
So, yeah, user testing, testing with
users is the bit that's often missing,

206
00:12:49.397 --> 00:12:56.053
cuz people will go, yeah, we do testing,
but they're thinking of QA testing, right?

207
00:12:56.053 --> 00:12:59.903
The reason that I rushed through that
section is cuz I didn't wanna spend

208
00:12:59.903 --> 00:13:04.082
a little bit more time on our next
session, which is building design systems.
