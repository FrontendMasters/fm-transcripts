00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.906
So when it comes to testing
with those initial wireframes,

2
00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:06.900
those grayscale wireframes
that we talked about.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.840
I don't tend to bother testing with
those low fidelity gray scales,

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.650
the ones where you don't have real
copy in there and that kind of thing.

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.874
It just is not really kind of worth it in
my opinion, because there's not enough in

6
00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:25.611
the interface for users to really
understand what they're looking at,

7
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:29.674
which is the same reason why I don't tend
to do testing with paper prototypes.

8
00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:32.764
There's just not enough information
in there to make it worthwhile.

9
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:38.576
So I only test really with grayscale
wireframes, which you've got

10
00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:43.051
real content in and navigational
elements and that kind of stuff.

11
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:48.430
If I've just got a wireframe that's
not particularly interactive, maybe

12
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.909
just individual screens or whatever, that
oftentimes I'll do a first click test.

13
00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.099
So I show them the static comp.

14
00:00:57.099 --> 00:01:00.294
And I say where would you
click to create a new task or

15
00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:04.300
whatever it is that you want
people to do on the app?

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.980
And it records where they've clicked,
right?

17
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.075
So you can see whether people
are clicking in the right place.

18
00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:12.630
First-click tests are great.

19
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.743
As I said earlier,
if people get their first click right,

20
00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:20.254
then they've got a good chance of
successfully completing the task.

21
00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:24.604
I tend to use listen for this test,
it's super easy to set up.

22
00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:29.456
You're essentially just kind of uploading
an image, setting the task and away it

23
00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:34.484
goes, and then it shows you whatever it
is that you're testing as an end user.

24
00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:36.896
It says,
where would you click to sign up for

25
00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.320
Frontend Masters in this particular case.

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.010
And then people click on the screen
wherever they would sign up and

27
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.765
then you get your results back and
you can see where people have been

28
00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:51.927
clicking on the screen and whether
they've been clicking in the right place.

29
00:01:51.927 --> 00:01:55.786
Great, we now know that people
know how to sign up for

30
00:01:55.786 --> 00:02:00.892
Frontend Masters, and
that takes I know 5-10 minutes to set up.

31
00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:06.058
And then if you send it out
using their recruitment tools,

32
00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:09.972
you'll get results back in an hour.

33
00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:11.352
Really lightweight, really quick.

34
00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:17.748
The other one that I sometimes do
with wireframes is I do a five

35
00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:24.776
second test which involves showing
the users a design for only five seconds.

36
00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:25.966
I normally make it a bit longer.

37
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:30.571
I make it eight seconds because I do,
after which you ask people to

38
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:34.591
recall any specific details
they remember of the page and

39
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:40.166
what was going on and whether they
understood it and that kind of thing.

40
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:45.158
So, it helps you to know whether
they get what they're looking at and

41
00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:47.842
they understand it pretty quickly.

42
00:02:47.842 --> 00:02:52.559
So what you're looking to understand,
the kind of wireframing stage,

43
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.591
well, basically, did they get it?

44
00:02:55.591 --> 00:03:00.381
Did they understand what the screen was
about and what you were trying to do?

45
00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:04.497
Did they see particular elements,
if there's a top task or something,

46
00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:07.735
you're worried that people
aren't likely to see this,

47
00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:10.642
these kinds of tests will show you that.

48
00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:14.873
And then what stood out the most, what
things are grabbing people's attention and

49
00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:16.089
is it the right things.

50
00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.942
And five second tests equally,
really simple to set up.

51
00:03:18.942 --> 00:03:23.293
You upload your graphic,
you ask them to put in the question,

52
00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:26.665
which is essentially what did you see?

53
00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.399
It shows them a blank page
with the instructions and

54
00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:33.065
then when they click on the button,
it shows them the design.

55
00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:38.265
And five seconds later, they're asked to
then fill in what it was that they saw.

56
00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:43.429
And what you get back at the end of that
is a word cloud like this, which has got

57
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:48.872
basically is saying all the things,
you know, all the words that people used.

58
00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:52.642
So for example, this particular
example was a direct mail site.

59
00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:55.262
So great, they've realized
it was a direct mail site.

60
00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:58.529
I was a little bit worried about
the fact that it had the word something

61
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.872
written there, [LAUGH] which I
didn't feel was very encouraging.

62
00:04:01.872 --> 00:04:05.422
But I could drill into the results and
see what people were saying.

63
00:04:05.422 --> 00:04:10.202
And actually they were saying something to
do with direct mail or variations of that.

64
00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:13.374
So it wasn't,
they were just going on, something.

65
00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:16.512
[LAUGH] So I was fairly safe on that.

66
00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:19.982
I mean, these days also you could
download the whole of that,

67
00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:24.123
all those individual answers,
throw them into a large language model and

68
00:04:24.123 --> 00:04:26.016
it would go through and tell you.

69
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.954
You could question it,
you could say, how many people said,

70
00:04:29.954 --> 00:04:34.578
what percentage of people mentioned
direct mail, and what other things

71
00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:39.085
other than direct mail do people
think it was, and that kind of thing.

72
00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:42.384
So that's quite useful to be able
to just question it like that.

73
00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:45.653
So that's why for instance that's
the main test I do on those,

74
00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:48.798
I don't tend to do a lot of you
know usability testing in the in

75
00:04:48.798 --> 00:04:51.661
the traditional sense because
it just takes too long.
