1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's talk about some of the principles,
so what does product design encapsulate?

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.336
And there are gonna be a lot
of things on this list that

3
00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:17.585
you're gonna go, well,
that's not design, right?

4
00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:22.152
But it is, a lot of the things
that you need to be aware of and

5
00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:27.375
you need to understand and
are core principles of product design,

6
00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:32.319
are not things that you would
maybe associate with design, but

7
00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:36.082
are incredibly valuable to learn.

8
00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:39.990
And I'll just go off in a minor
rant before I get into this list.

9
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:48.580
One of the big problems that I have
with people today who work in design,

10
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.916
is they spend so
much time learning about design.

11
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.811
[LAUGH] I know that sounds ridiculous.

12
00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:00.908
They spend so much time learning
about the latest technique or

13
00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:05.790
the latest plugin, or the latest bit
of software, or whether this year,

14
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.282
it's skeuomorphic or new skeuomorphic,
or not skeuomorphic, or

15
00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:14.346
whether all of these trends and
stuff but trends come and go.

16
00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:19.950
What you really need if you wanna
become an amazing product designer,

17
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.558
you need to look at psychology,
marketing, business,

18
00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:27.801
these kinds of areas are just
as important to be aware of.

19
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:31.749
And so as we go through these list of
principles, you'll see that come out,

20
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.759
that these are the kinds of things you
need to be paying attention to if you want

21
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.551
to get good at product design.

22
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.360
And the first is market awareness, right?

23
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.623
Knowing what's going on in
the market that you're working

24
00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:53.058
within is incredibly important, so
who are your competitors, right?

25
00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:55.247
Who else is operating in the marketplace?

26
00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:56.301
What did they do well?

27
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:58.072
What do they do poorly?

28
00:01:58.072 --> 00:01:59.452
How do they price?

29
00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:04.259
All of these things are worth
understanding as a product designer,

30
00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:04.856
right?

31
00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:08.592
If they're doing something well,
copy it, [LAUGH] right?

32
00:02:08.592 --> 00:02:10.772
If they're doing something badly,
improve upon it.

33
00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:17.795
But also, if you wanna get people to
migrate from your competitors to you,

34
00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:22.843
then it's worth having similarities
in the way that it works.

35
00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:26.062
So to reduce the amount of
procedural knowledge or

36
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:30.903
increase the amount of procedural
knowledge, they can transfer across.

37
00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:34.765
So being aware of the competition
is really important, but

38
00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.447
then also you wanna be aware of the market
trends, what's happening in the market?

39
00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:42.539
How are users expectations
changing is a big one.

40
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.943
And you see this is how people disrupt
a market, right, and come into an area.

41
00:02:47.943 --> 00:02:50.289
Banking is a huge one.

42
00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.802
I don't whether it is over here,
but certainly, in the UK,

43
00:02:54.802 --> 00:03:00.200
all of the major high street banks have
been majorly replaced by new up and

44
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.595
coming banks who went, well, everybody
just wants to bank on their phone.

45
00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:10.468
So they created a mobile-first
user experience,

46
00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:14.703
product design-orientated
approach to banking, and

47
00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:18.585
they've swept and
dominated the market, right?

48
00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:26.406
So knowing how users' expectations
are changing, what dynamics are going

49
00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:31.434
in the market, helps you to understand
your role as a product designer and

50
00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:36.077
where you need to place the emphasis
in the work that you're doing.

51
00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:39.472
And then there's positioning, right,

52
00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:44.484
what differentiates your
product from your competitors?

53
00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:47.324
How clear is that difference to people?

54
00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:51.145
And when you get into the app,
are they instantly gonna go, well,

55
00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:52.304
this is just better?

56
00:03:52.304 --> 00:03:57.778
Are they gonna see those killer apps,
those killer features up front?

57
00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:03.755
So being aware of that market is
a hugely important aspect or marketing.

58
00:04:03.755 --> 00:04:07.162
That's a dirty thing that marketers do,
right?

59
00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:11.355
But you can't have that attitude if you
wanna be working in product design,

60
00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.187
you've obviously gotta be user centric,
right?

61
00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.435
That almost needs to go without saying,
but

62
00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:19.976
I've included it anyway because it
would be really bad not to say it.

63
00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:23.653
So in particular, we need to be hyper
aware of what users' goals are.

64
00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:26.311
What does our web app allow people to do?

65
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.686
What does it allow them to achieve?

66
00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:36.186
Not what functionality has it got, but
how does it help in their lives, right?

67
00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:40.369
So for example, a banking app, yeah,
it lets you check your balances and

68
00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:43.511
it lets you, no, no,
those are features, right?

69
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.881
That's your deposit checks,
now that's a feature.

70
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.341
How does it help?

71
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:50.855
It helps people be in
control of their money.

72
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:55.805
Having a kinda picture of that overall
goal of what people are wanting from your

73
00:04:55.805 --> 00:05:00.005
app, how it's gonna make their
lives better is so essential, and

74
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:02.646
keeping that in your mind the whole time.

75
00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:05.864
I mean, to be honest,
that's kinda helpful in any UX design,

76
00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:09.653
but it's particularly prominent
when you're talking about products.

77
00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.170
Pain points as well.

78
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.582
What problem or pain point is
your app helping you to solve?

79
00:05:17.582 --> 00:05:18.922
And then finally, needs.

80
00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:22.123
This is a big question.

81
00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:26.227
Is there a legitimate need for
the product that you're working on and

82
00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:28.853
the functionality you're creating?

83
00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:33.074
The number of features that I've
seen created just because, well,

84
00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:35.943
the competition have them, right?

85
00:05:35.943 --> 00:05:38.819
That is such a terrible reason to
create a new piece of functionality,

86
00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.233
cuz it makes the assumption that they know
what they're doing over there which they

87
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:44.001
probably don't.

88
00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:47.171
Or where, yeah, I had this great idea,

89
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:51.161
that's the other one
that I absolutely love.

90
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:54.969
Yeah, some senior manager comes along and
says, I've had this great idea, but

91
00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.441
that's not a reason to implement it just
because you think it's a great idea.

92
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:03.732
So being aware of real users
needs is obviously crucial.

93
00:06:04.972 --> 00:06:09.534
So it's about being user-centric as well,
but it's also about having

94
00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:13.818
an awareness of your different
user groups and their role, right?

95
00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:16.272
Cuz different groups will
have different objectives.

96
00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:19.656
So take something like task app, right?

97
00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:24.216
A task app can be a used by
a huge number of different people

98
00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:28.425
in all kinds of different ways, right?

99
00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:33.433
As a business executive,
I might use a task app to

100
00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:39.435
organize my tasks and
my overview of what's going on.

101
00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:43.454
If I'm a project manager, I might have
hundreds of tasks organized into complex

102
00:06:43.454 --> 00:06:45.541
projects and that kinda stuff.

103
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:48.860
If I'm a stay-at-home mum,
I might use my task list for

104
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.805
groceries and things like that.

105
00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:56.591
It's a huge range of different groups that
could be using an individual product.

106
00:06:56.591 --> 00:07:02.401
And so understanding those groups and
what they're trying to achieve and

107
00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:07.086
where they're going, and
to some degree, focusing on one

108
00:07:07.086 --> 00:07:12.702
group over another is fundamental
to the success of a product.

109
00:07:12.702 --> 00:07:17.645
And then there's the fact we need to be
a kinda almost coming out of that comes

110
00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:22.202
the fact that we need to be task
orientated, having a clear picture and

111
00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:26.059
understanding of what tasks
the user needs to complete.

112
00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:30.969
And that will vary quite massively
depending on the user group, right?

113
00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:34.492
So as a project manager,
I'm gonna want nested projects,

114
00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:39.212
I'm gonna want reoccurring tasks,
I'm gonna want all kinds of functionality

115
00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:42.182
that the stay at home mom
probably doesn't want.

116
00:07:42.182 --> 00:07:46.742
But on the other hand, she would love
it if her task list of groceries

117
00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:51.622
was automatically organized via
aisle in the supermarket, which now,

118
00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:55.630
actually, Apple does in their
reminder list apparently.

119
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.472
I've never tried it cuz obviously, I'm not
that organized in my grocery shopping.

120
00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:04.043
But understanding the needs there, and

121
00:08:04.043 --> 00:08:10.133
how the tasks will help them complete
that need is really important,

122
00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:15.080
and what tasks are more crucial
to success than others?

123
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.529
Not all tasks are equal, right?

124
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:24.083
Figma, I'm using auto layout and
create auto layout,

125
00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:29.992
hundreds of times a day, but
something like outline text,

126
00:08:29.992 --> 00:08:34.765
can't say I use that that much, right?

127
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:38.725
So not everything is equal and
understanding that hierarchy of what's

128
00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:41.963
important to users and
what's not is crucial to success.

129
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:47.863
And it's not which ones are most crucial,
it's also which ones you use the most.

130
00:08:47.863 --> 00:08:50.576
There's a subtle difference there,
isn't there?

131
00:08:50.576 --> 00:08:55.656
So for example, actually, that one
that I just gave, you could argue,

132
00:08:55.656 --> 00:09:01.758
no, auto layout is more important than
outline text, I'm sticking to that, right?

133
00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:04.907
But it might be that there is
a thing that I use all the time

134
00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:08.726
within an application that although
use all the time, it wouldn't

135
00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:13.229
be the end of the world wouldn't stop me
completing my task if it wasn't there.

136
00:09:13.229 --> 00:09:18.281
So there's lots of nuances here that
you need to kinda juggle in your head.

137
00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:21.670
And then of course, there's functionality,
you need to think about functionality.

138
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.598
What functionality will be required in
order to allow users to achieve their

139
00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:29.217
goals and to address their pain points?

140
00:09:29.217 --> 00:09:32.512
So you've got goals and pain points, and

141
00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:37.693
then tasks that they wanna do to
help them achieve their goal, and

142
00:09:37.693 --> 00:09:43.062
then we need functionality that
enables them to act on those tasks,

143
00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:45.248
so it's like a hierarchy.
