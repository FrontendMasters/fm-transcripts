1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.184
Prototypes on the other
hand are a big part of it.

2
00:00:03.184 --> 00:00:08.431
So testing both in prototypes and
the beta build, this is the time where

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:14.552
you probably wanna do a little bit more in
depth testing in terms of more qualitative

4
00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:20.512
testing cuz we've done a lot of surveying
so far and a lot of data-driven stuff.

5
00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:25.072
But at some point,
we wanna just sanity check it with real

6
00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:28.598
people in a more
qualitative point of view.

7
00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.471
So this is where I tend to
introduce unfacilitated testing.

8
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:35.229
I'm a great fan of unfacilitated
testing cuz it's quick,

9
00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.643
but you get real people looking at it.

10
00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:42.046
So instead of you sitting in every test
session having to talk people through it

11
00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:46.315
and all the rest of it, essentially all
you're doing is giving them a task,

12
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:50.317
a series of tasks to do, asking them
to speak out loud while they do it and

13
00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.547
they're recorded doing the process.

14
00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:57.017
So again, a tool like Lyssna or
Maze do a great job at this,

15
00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:01.398
and it's pretty simple to set
up if I'm honest with you,

16
00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:06.237
it's just a matter of going in and
setting each question saying

17
00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:10.374
where the correct location
is that they need to go to.

18
00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:13.852
And then they're taught through it.

19
00:01:13.852 --> 00:01:18.453
So as you can see an example one
running on my own website here,

20
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.716
where they're given the task and
what the task is, etc.

21
00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.587
And then they just click and
complete the task.

22
00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:29.273
And you get results back
at the end of the day,

23
00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:34.419
which was working well,
which wasn't working so well, etc.

24
00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:38.608
So that is I'm facilitated
testing worked really well.

25
00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:41.605
But the downside of Lyssna in particular,

26
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:47.265
is that it gives you a load of statistics
about how well someone completed it, but

27
00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:53.198
doesn't let you watch back the sessions,
which strikes me as a really weird thing.

28
00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:55.055
So, I like to watch the sessions back.

29
00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.272
So there's an alternative tool,
which is called Lookback.

30
00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:05.941
And you can use Lookback both for
unfacilitated and facilitated testing.

31
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:07.977
And I highly recommend it.

32
00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:12.120
You can do facilitated testing
where you moderate it and

33
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.951
you take people through the process.

34
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:16.825
I mean, you could do that in Zoom.

35
00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:24.012
But I prefer Lookback cuz it's got
certain things that Zoom doesn't have.

36
00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:27.892
So for example, you can add annotations
while someone's talking and

37
00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:32.114
say that was a good bit, let's highlight
that or let's make a note on that.

38
00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:36.594
Also after the event is easy to edit
those down and take out high lights and

39
00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:39.543
low lights and
kind of show it off to the people.

40
00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:44.174
And it does a complete transcript which is
useful because you can search through it

41
00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:44.855
and stuff.

42
00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:48.636
It's not massively
expensive tool to get for

43
00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:52.529
just a month when you
wanna do a bit of testing.

44
00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.708
So it's worth having a go with
these tools trying them out.

45
00:02:55.708 --> 00:03:00.683
It can feel a bit intimidating to be
honest with you doing this kind of

46
00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:04.609
testing, but my advice is,
the first time you do it,

47
00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.782
just don't tell anyone you're doing it.

48
00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:09.781
And just kinda do it under the radar.

49
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.735
That way, if you make a complete
hash of it and it's a nightmare,

50
00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:13.990
nobody ever needs to know.

51
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.587
[LAUGH] If you've not done it before,
but have a play with these things.

52
00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:24.445
I think testing can become
such a formal thing.

53
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:27.925
And like so,
you're very grown up proper discipline.

54
00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:32.103
And so we've kind of lost that stuff or
go see what happens,

55
00:03:32.103 --> 00:03:34.620
what's the worst that can happen?

56
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.589
And of course that's how I learned
everything in my career cuz I'm like you

57
00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.994
guys, I didn't get proper training
cuz I predated all of that.

58
00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:46.679
And I think we've lost that a little bit
that kind of why now it's all I must

59
00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.247
do it properly,
I must do best practice and all of that.

60
00:03:50.247 --> 00:03:55.016
And with my generation, it was like, well,
let's give it a go and see what happens,

61
00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:58.813
and then you learn from doing that so,
give it a go see what happens.

62
00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:04.101
Little bit tips for facilitated usability
testing, if you ever choose to do that.

63
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:06.022
And again,
I go into this a lot more detail.

64
00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:09.064
And now I'm going through this very fast,
but

65
00:04:09.064 --> 00:04:11.880
I've got a whole separate course on this.

66
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.961
Be very clear,
a lot of people do testing, and

67
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:20.732
this doesn't just apply to facilitated
usability testing, but testing generally,

68
00:04:20.732 --> 00:04:25.411
they do testing because that's
what you're supposed to do, right?

69
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:31.012
Rather than testing to
answer a specific question,

70
00:04:31.012 --> 00:04:34.968
or to achieve a specific objective.

71
00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:38.856
So, this is why I do lots of little
tests throughout my process,

72
00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:41.664
because something will pop into my head,

73
00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:45.700
I wonder whether people are gonna
spot that thing I just mocked up.

74
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.540
All right, let's do a bit of testing and
find out, or,

75
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.393
which of these two options
is more important to people?

76
00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:53.550
Let's run a quick survey to find out.

77
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.256
There's always a very clear objective in
the testing that I'm doing rather than,

78
00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:04.161
it's about that time we better do
some testing, why are we doing this?

79
00:05:04.161 --> 00:05:11.742
Try and make your tasks as realistic as
possible, rather than some abstract stuff.

80
00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:14.542
Sometimes I can't think
of a good example now,

81
00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:19.372
but often tasks are like a bit obscure, or
why would anybody be doing that anyway,

82
00:05:19.372 --> 00:05:23.023
you shouldn't be focusing on
testing those kinds of things.

83
00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:25.426
Prepare a script, I find helps a lot,

84
00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:30.234
especially if you've not done facilitated
usability testing before, and

85
00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:35.058
I talked through what should go in that
script a lot more in the other course.

86
00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:37.268
But you've gotta be flexible, right?

87
00:05:37.268 --> 00:05:41.367
People will do something really
weird to partway through, and

88
00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:45.792
don't just move on to the next question,
dig down on that, right?

89
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:49.953
Or they'll make a comment like,
I don't know, yeah,

90
00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:53.065
I don't get quite what's going on here.

91
00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:56.393
Well, what do you mean,
what is it here that you don't know,

92
00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:59.608
what's going on with or
what's confusing you about that?

93
00:05:59.608 --> 00:06:04.223
Ask lots of follow up questions, so
see your script as a starting point,

94
00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:05.899
not as a straight jacket.

95
00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:10.323
Work hard to relax people, if you do
facilitated testing, and actually that's

96
00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:14.748
one of the drawbacks, although I love
facilitated testing because it means I get

97
00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:18.146
to ask a lot of follow up questions,
I get to know people a bit.

98
00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:25.625
It's more, It provides better
kind of connection and empathy.

99
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:28.756
Its drawback is that people
feel awkward doing it.

100
00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:33.413
They're worried about offending,
they're worried about being watched,

101
00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:36.145
they feel like they're
going to do it wrong.

102
00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:40.126
So you've got to work really
hard to relax people.

103
00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:43.016
And whether you're doing facilitated or
unfacilitator,

104
00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:44.872
get people to think out loud, right?

105
00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:48.543
You really have to hammer that home with
unfacilitated because you don't get to

106
00:06:48.543 --> 00:06:49.104
follow up.

107
00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:53.557
You got to say it very upfront,
we need you to speak out loud.

108
00:06:53.557 --> 00:06:57.082
We need you to say what you're looking
at and what you're thinking and

109
00:06:57.082 --> 00:07:00.562
you're what you're intending to do
next and all that kind of stuff.

110
00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:04.329
But at least we've facilitated,
if they go quiet, you can say, so

111
00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:05.663
what are you thinking?

112
00:07:05.663 --> 00:07:06.529
What's going through your head?

113
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.164
What are you looking at,
that kind of thing?

114
00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:13.563
Try and remain neutral, and
this applies to all testing.

115
00:07:13.563 --> 00:07:17.168
So wording questions and tasks is so

116
00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:21.984
easy to introduce bias in it or
give away stuff.

117
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:28.877
If somebody's got to go into,
I don't know.

118
00:07:28.877 --> 00:07:33.768
The DIY category of an e-commerce site,
right?

119
00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:35.835
I don't know why that was
the first thing to pop in my head.

120
00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:37.245
I hate the other way.

121
00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:41.037
But yeah,
if you gotta go into the DIY category,

122
00:07:41.037 --> 00:07:44.830
you don't word the question
along the lines of,

123
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.009
go and buy a DIY product cuz
that's just too leading.

124
00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:56.729
You say something like, you're planning
to build some shelves in your bedroom and

125
00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:03.141
you need some tools to help you deal
with that, where would you look?

126
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:03.986
You see the difference.

127
00:08:03.986 --> 00:08:10.945
One's much more of a scenario, a story
that avoids those those leading biases.

128
00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:16.857
Oftentimes, again,
ChatGPT is pretty good for this right?

129
00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:21.673
I often will take my questions or
tasks drop into ChatGPT and

130
00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:25.813
say, help me ensure this is neutral and
I'll say,

131
00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:32.360
I'm using this as a question in a survey,
or I'm using it in usability testing,

132
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.341
ensure this question is
as neutral as possible.

133
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:41.292
If they've got any questions, I tend to
answer those at the end of sessions rather

134
00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:46.462
than during the session because I don't
wanna feed them additional information, so

135
00:08:46.462 --> 00:08:51.658
I apologize by not answering the questions
that they have, cuz am I doing this right?

136
00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:53.081
Does this mean this?

137
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:58.137
And that kind of thing, and you don't
wanna be answering those but you do wanna

138
00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:03.208
pick them up in the end, and make a show
of showing your gratitude afterwards.

139
00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:06.182
And maybe even giving them something,
an Amazon voucher or

140
00:09:06.182 --> 00:09:10.225
stuff like that really helps if you're
gonna do that kind of in-person stuff and

141
00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:11.771
debrief quickly afterwards,

142
00:09:11.771 --> 00:09:15.895
it's amazing how quickly you'll forget
everything that you've just learned.

143
00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:19.422
I'm very aware that I've
just thrown a lot at you and

144
00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:23.911
this is what we go into much more
in the use of research and testing,

145
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:27.703
which is called budget friendly and
lack of resources.

146
00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:31.275
That's the whole thing with that.

147
00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:34.910
If you really short on time,
drop facilitated testing.

148
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.909
It takes forever to do, right?

149
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:40.740
So that one goes out
the window straight away.

150
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.679
I would focus unfacilitated
usability testing can work

151
00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:50.732
really well, but
you don't need to test so many people.

152
00:09:50.732 --> 00:09:54.490
Three, do you know that if you
test with just three people,

153
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.392
you will find about 75% of the possible
issues, which ain't bad, is it?

154
00:09:59.392 --> 00:10:02.260
If you got to sit,
that turns into about 90% and

155
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.823
anything more than that you're
wasting your money, right?

156
00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:12.481
So with usability testing just tests with
three people unfacilitated remote testing.

157
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:16.454
With some of the others, you don't
need to use all these techniques.

158
00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:19.780
Just pick whichever one that seems
most appropriate in a situation.

159
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:25.846
So if you have stakeholders moaning about
whether people will spot something,

160
00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:30.023
do a five second test to see
if they remember the thing.

161
00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:33.426
If they think that the look and
feel is terrible,

162
00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:36.921
then do a semantic differential survey,
right?

163
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:41.751
So it depends on the issues
you're coming up against as

164
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:45.115
to which testing methodology to use.

165
00:10:45.115 --> 00:10:48.197
And that's what we kind of get
to it on the other course.

166
00:10:48.197 --> 00:10:50.435
But hopefully that helps a little bit.

167
00:10:50.435 --> 00:10:55.947
So usability testing is great
as a just general sanity check,

168
00:10:55.947 --> 00:11:01.571
but then the rest of them is
specific to circumstances, okay?

169
00:11:01.571 --> 00:11:04.705
Which to pick [LAUGH] is actually
the next slide really, so

170
00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.396
I'm almost kind of getting
into the same thing.

171
00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:11.649
I mean, when it comes to unfacilitated
testing, if you're gonna consider that,

172
00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:12.754
it's easier to run.

173
00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:15.805
You can do it with more
people if you want to,

174
00:11:15.805 --> 00:11:19.609
because you don't have to
sit through every session.

175
00:11:19.609 --> 00:11:24.514
Tend to get results faster, because you
don't have to arrange people to come

176
00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:29.053
in and all the rest of it or syncing
calendars and all that kind of stuff.

177
00:11:29.053 --> 00:11:34.693
So I find it better thought is
it working kind of testing?

178
00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.425
Does this work, does it not?

179
00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:37.529
Do people understand it?

180
00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:38.887
Do they not?

181
00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:43.311
Well, facilitated allows
more guided interactions.

182
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:48.089
So this is particularly good if your
prototype is a bit rubbish, [LAUGH] right?

183
00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:52.987
Bits of it will break and doesn't work
very well and people are likely to get

184
00:11:52.987 --> 00:11:57.732
lost or confused because you know
you haven't covered everything yet,

185
00:11:57.732 --> 00:12:02.344
then facilitated testing works
better because you can guide people.

186
00:12:02.344 --> 00:12:03.406
It's more adaptable.

187
00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:05.531
You can ask follow up
questions go off on tangents.

188
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:09.035
You'll learn a lot more about
your users through doing this.

189
00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:13.582
It's easier to get clarification
over things people say, and

190
00:12:13.582 --> 00:12:18.407
it's easier to observe non verbal
cues as well with facilitated.

191
00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:21.789
You don't spot them in
the same way watching a video,

192
00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:24.506
I don't really know why, but you don't.

193
00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:29.277
So I tend to think that I prefer
facilitated when I wanna know why

194
00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:32.077
something's not working, right?

195
00:12:32.077 --> 00:12:36.928
So, yeah, the time I use
facilitated the most is when I

196
00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:41.674
do post-launch optimization and
say, I know people

197
00:12:41.674 --> 00:12:46.854
are failing to complete
a particular task on the website.

198
00:12:46.854 --> 00:12:49.596
So I know it's broken already, right?

199
00:12:49.596 --> 00:12:53.366
Because I've got data that shows me that,
but I have no clue why.

200
00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:56.447
Then I'll do some facilitated testing.
