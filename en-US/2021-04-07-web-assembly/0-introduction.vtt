1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.192
Thank you so much for joining me today.

2
00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:07.244
I am so excited to talk about
web assembly, low level stuff,

3
00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:09.957
assembly scripts, all the good stuff.

4
00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:14.340
If I get stuff, I mean really,
really technical things.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.176
Before we get to that, I should introduce
myself a bit more, like I said,

6
00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:21.610
my name is Jem Young, that's me.

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.876
That is a real picture of me.

8
00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:28.173
The lighting is photoshopped,
obviously, and the lasers.

9
00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:30.168
Yeah, I think those are photoshop too,
but everything else is real.

10
00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:35.060
I'm actually wearing this Raman outfit,
yeah, just a fun picture of me.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.605
It's actually a Halloween costume that
I've never gotten a chance to wear.

12
00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.266
So I just use this as my
profile picture everywhere.

13
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:46.482
Currently, I work as a senior
software engineer at Netflix,

14
00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:49.246
where I work on growth infrastructure.

15
00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:56.122
So pretty much I support UI engineers,
our future growth organization.

16
00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.980
A lot of the long term
architecture projects.

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.190
That's kind of the way I
think about engineering.

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.858
But really, I think about all engineering
is what problem are we gonna solve and

19
00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:09.729
how are we gonna solve it.

20
00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.952
A lot of those problems don't
necessarily involve coding surprisingly,

21
00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:18.509
a lot of problems are just operational or
a lot of problems are we're not thinking

22
00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.347
about the issue, we're trying to
solve in the right frame of mind.

23
00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:27.240
Anyways, that's, my engineering philosophy
we'll learn a lot more about my

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.700
philosophy over the course of
this intro to WebAssembly.

25
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.545
If you wanna find me on LinkedIn, I am on
Twitter at, or I'm on Twitter @Jim young.

26
00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:41.230
I'm on LinkedIn too,
I'm not on there much.

27
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.032
I'm really thinking about becoming a
thought leader on LinkedIn, I don't know.

28
00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:48.764
We'll see how that goes, it seems to
be a popular thing in Silicon Valley.

29
00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:55.524
I live right now in Oakland, California,
which it's I like it here, I like you.

30
00:01:55.524 --> 00:02:00.600
But I'm still in Silicon Valley, so you're
gonna hear lots of Silicon Valley memes,

31
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.588
me poking fun of my fellow
engineers who live here,

32
00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:07.427
as I often do on a podcast that I'm
on called front end happy hour.

33
00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:12.201
And that's a podcast where we talk about
all things front ends, overtricks,

34
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.237
just kind of a fun conversation.

35
00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:19.094
And I like to think the podcast reflects
my own personal style about how

36
00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:24.045
to teach to just the informal casual,
we're just a couple of friends.

37
00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:26.789
I don't have a beer right now or
drink, but

38
00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:31.224
just having a talk and we have
a conversation and we go back and forth.

39
00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:35.755
So if you have questions feel free,
post in the chat,

40
00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:40.680
send me questions to find a masters,
I love questions.

41
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.507
I try to get to them all.

42
00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:45.941
I guarantee there will be things
you asked me and I won't know and

43
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:48.369
you're gonna watch me
Google like a madman.

44
00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:52.332
That's part of being a senior engineers
and knowing how to Google things properly.

45
00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:56.289
That's a secret,
that's a Silicon Valley insider secret for

46
00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.862
my book coming out soon.

47
00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:00.621
I do teach two other courses
on front end masters,

48
00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:03.325
the first one is called full stack for
front end.

49
00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:08.349
That's a two day course where
we cover literally everything.

50
00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.318
We cover everything from a bit
of containers, we do AWS,

51
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:17.200
we do digitalocean, we do a lot of stuff.

52
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.957
And I know a lot of people
taking that course.

53
00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:22.541
And there's people in the chat
that told me, hey, yeah,

54
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.604
that course actually helped me get a job,
which, honestly that's why I do this.

55
00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:31.324
These things to make real impact
in people's lives that yeah,

56
00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:33.230
that really makes me feel good.

57
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.968
I won't get emotional, it's a little
too early maybe later in the day.

58
00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:41.257
I also teach a course called
interviewing for front end engineers.

59
00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:46.204
We have a lot of fun that course too,
mostly because interviews are terrible.

60
00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:48.870
I hate them,
probably more than anybody else.

61
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.461
So I wanna make a course for front
engineers about what are the types of

62
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:59.016
things you should expect, but also, what
is the best way to conduct an interview?

63
00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:02.953
How do we give an interview so
that we're empathetic and

64
00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:06.826
we really treat each other
with respect and we do that?

65
00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:11.285
So I love those courses too, so
I'm very excited about introduction to

66
00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:15.537
Web Assembly, hopefully it'll be
a new canon in my front of masters

67
00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:25.390
Webassembly, it's a difficult topic,
I'm not gonna lie.

68
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.910
I know I shouldn't say that as a professor
or a teacher, I should say, it's easy, and

69
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.522
it's fun and it's intuitive and
you're gonna get it right off the bat.

70
00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:39.110
And we're gonna build these awesome cool
things, but I'm not gonna lie to you.

71
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.425
This is a technical course,
this is a deeply technical course.

72
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:47.865
But,I promise when you come out the other
side, you will be a better engineer.

73
00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:51.716
Even if you don't remember that
much from this course at all,

74
00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:55.430
you will learn Cconcepts and
ways to apply those concepts.

75
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.242
It will make you a better engineer,
no matter what language you write.

76
00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:02.493
I like to think of it as we're doctors.

77
00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:06.674
We're doctors, we work on people, we have
some tools that help us diagnose when

78
00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:09.382
there's issues and
failures and things like that.

79
00:05:09.382 --> 00:05:13.920
But really,
we just know surface level things.

80
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.831
Now imagine if we were doctors,
we could dive in into someone,

81
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:25.753
we can dive into the literal DNA
of what makes us up, what we do.

82
00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:27.185
That's what we're gonna do today.

83
00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:30.842
We're gonna dive way down,
we're gonna dive down to binary,

84
00:05:30.842 --> 00:05:33.400
and then we're gonna talk about assembly.

85
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.618
And then we're gonna talk
about high level programming,

86
00:05:36.618 --> 00:05:38.924
and normally it's the other way around.

87
00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:40.016
We write JavaScript.

88
00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:43.555
JavaScript is the high level language that
gets compiled down to machine code which

89
00:05:43.555 --> 00:05:44.980
gets compiled down into binary.

90
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.990
That's how we all know and love
programming and being in front engineer,

91
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.156
and going the other way, it's really
gonna change our perspective on things.

92
00:05:56.156 --> 00:06:00.712
Honestly, you're probably gonna see me
nerd out about this stuff and it's gonna

93
00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:05.283
be these low level micro architectures,
CPU instructions, that sort of thing.

94
00:06:05.283 --> 00:06:10.725
And you're gonna be like, [SOUND] Jem,
when do we get into the coding?

95
00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:15.417
We'll get there, but first we're gonna
lay a foundation of knowledge, so

96
00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:20.475
that we all understand the same things,
because I'm gonna say some pretty well,

97
00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:24.899
say very low level concepts, and
I really need you to understand them.

98
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.515
Otherwise, all the code we write
later today won't make any sense.
