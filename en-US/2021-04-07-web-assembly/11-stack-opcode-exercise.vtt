00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.111
Let's write some more Web Assembly,
for this one without cheating,

2
00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:04.390
you can cheat if you want.

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.950
I mean, I'm not your dad, or your teacher,
wait, I am your teacher don't cheat.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.591
But if you want it to, or if you need
a shortcut, you can click here but

5
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:19.571
create a minus 1 function that takes
a 32 bit integer and subtracts 1.

6
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:24.690
So all the nodding when I was saying,
yeah, we get the stack and all that.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.752
Let's see if you really do get it,
so I'll give you 5 minutes on that.

8
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:36.795
And the thing to note,
remember if we're subtracting 1,

9
00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.974
we can just use a constant and
we can declare i32.const that 1.

10
00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.575
Okay, so again, I really encourage
you to write this by hand and

11
00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:46.319
not copy paste and skip ahead.

12
00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.647
It will resonate deeper
when you do it yourself.
