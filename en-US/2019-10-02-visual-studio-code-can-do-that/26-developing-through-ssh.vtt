00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.670
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Remote
development comes in three flavors.

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.006
It's brand new, and it's really exciting.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.830
The first one SSL, or SSH, excuse me.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.040
So this allows you to develop
on a server that you're not on.

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.701
Now, why would you do this?

6
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:18.356
Some people, and there's somebody behind
this camera right now, watching this,

7
00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:20.610
that knows exactly what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.685
They have to develop in
a secure environment.

9
00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:26.114
Snd the way they do that
is they SSH into a server,

10
00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:29.442
they remote desktop into a server,
and that's how they develop.

11
00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:32.756
But there is a use case for
that, we have secure scenarios.

12
00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:36.255
So the first thing I want to show you,
it's not your exercises.

13
00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:40.190
But the first thing I want to show you is
remote development on a remote server.

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.608
So what I'm gonna do is, I'm going to
open up the command palatte with Cmd or

15
00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:45.855
Ctrl+Shift+P.

16
00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.549
And I'm just gonna say remote development.

17
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.093
And you can see here we've
got Remote-Containers and

18
00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:53.820
we've got Remote-SSH.

19
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.452
So what I wanna do is connect to a host.

20
00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.460
Now, I've created a virtual
machine that's running in Azure.

21
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.324
That is running one of my side
projects called the URL list.

22
00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:08.100
So to connect to that I'm
gonna stay connected to host.

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.653
And I've already added a host in here.

24
00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:14.940
If we say, configure SSH Hosts,
that's gonna give us a file.

25
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.715
And you can see here that
I've added that host here.

26
00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:19.580
And this is the host name.

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.838
The other way I can get to this is by
clicking this little icon in the left hand

28
00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:26.620
corner and saying connect to host.

29
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.330
And then let's connect to
the urlist-dev-machine.

30
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.082
This is gonna reload Visual Studio Code,
and you can see setting up SSH host.

31
00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:37.080
And we can look at the details here.

32
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.529
And what it's doing right now is it is
installing a little server on that server.

33
00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:49.223
And then it is installing any of
the extensions that I'm going to need on

34
00:01:49.223 --> 00:01:53.212
that other side in order to
properly work with this project,

35
00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:58.410
like it's in my local VS Code, even
though it absolutely isn't, all right?

36
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.146
So now we are connected you can see
that here, so what are we wanna do?

37
00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:03.560
We wanna open the project.

38
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.550
How do we do that?
Well, we say open folder and

39
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.140
look were we are.

40
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.820
We are on the server.

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.370
It looks like we are on my machine but
we are not.

42
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.842
We are remotely developing on the server.

43
00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:16.802
So now I can go down to dev,
and I can go to my file here or

44
00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:21.212
my folder here and
then I'm gonna load in this back end C#.

45
00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:24.330
So this project is written in C#.

46
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.800
And I'm gonna load in this folder here.

47
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.690
I'm gonna say okay.

48
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.861
And it's going to open
the dictionary application.

49
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.090
I have no idea why.

50
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.180
All right, so
this is my application is now loaded.

51
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.700
And this is an Azure Functions Project.

52
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.474
I don't have any of that installed.

53
00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:48.220
But I don't need to because it's
all installed on the server.

54
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.432
So I'm gonna say yes here and
it's gonna add in all the configuration.

55
00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:58.630
And now what I want to do is I
want to run this application.

56
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.831
So in order to do that, what I need to
do first is if you're a C# developer,

57
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.991
you know this,
I need to do something called a restore.

58
00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:07.930
If you are not a C# developer
don't worry about it.

59
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.993
Just know you need to pull
down dependencies for

60
00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:12.067
the project to make sure
that you've got them.

61
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:16.626
So if we look over here, actually I
already have on this remote machine,

62
00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:20.320
I've already got the extension for
C# installed.

63
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.842
It's on the machine already.

64
00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:25.520
So what I'm gonna do is just
Cmd+Shift+P and I'm gonna say, restore.

65
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.570
And that's gonna do a .NET Restore Project
here and do a .NET Restore.

66
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.794
And it will begin to do a restore
using the .NET framework.

67
00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:39.220
And it's gonna pull down all of
the dependencies that we need to run this.

68
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.510
Now where is it pulling it down,
to my machine?

69
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.920
No, the server.

70
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.788
It's look like we're on my machine,
we are not on my machine.

71
00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.760
All right, so it didn't need any,
it's done here.

72
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.930
So now we can run this thing.

73
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.010
So let's do that.

74
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.080
So I'm going to come here.

75
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.010
And just for

76
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.780
a little bit of context here I created
an application called the URL list.

77
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.442
And what it does is it allows
you to manage lists of URLs.

78
00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:07.370
So for instance, I'm going to log in here.

79
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.855
If I wanted to create a list of all
my favorite VS Code extensions,

80
00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:13.690
I could do that by creating a list.

81
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.080
And here's some of them.

82
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.687
So I've added some VS Code extensions,
one VS Code extension right here.

83
00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:21.760
But I've got some other lists
that have more stuff on them.

84
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.700
And then you can view it by just
sending someone a simple URL.

85
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.640
It's a simple idea.

86
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.550
But it's a Vue application
with a server list API.

87
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.610
What we're doing on this remote server,
we're running this API in development.

88
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.472
All light, so
let's go back here to VS Code.

89
00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:42.120
And all of this is
pre-configured on the server.

90
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.523
I'm just going to hit
the green button here and

91
00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:48.500
it's going to fire up our application.

92
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.090
And it is gonna fire up our project.

93
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.360
Now these are all the different
end points that I can call.

94
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.407
All right so I'm gonna just call
this get here, get links right here.

95
00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:07.302
So I'm gonna click on this right here.

96
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.404
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: It's not working.

97
00:05:11.404 --> 00:05:12.770
Why isn't it working?

98
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.050
Why does that not work?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

99
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.351
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Cuz it's on my computer.

100
00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:20.000
This is localhost.

101
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.990
This application is not
running on my computer.

102
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.220
It's running on another computer.

103
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.273
So what do we do?

104
00:05:28.273 --> 00:05:30.430
We come back over here.

105
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.388
We look at our remote development
extension in the activity bar, and

106
00:05:33.388 --> 00:05:34.460
we wanna forward a port.

107
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.320
So I'm going to click forward report.

108
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.830
And I believe it was 7071 and
then name it functions.

109
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.884
And it's gonna set up port forwarding.

110
00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:56.120
And now, watch this, even though this is
not my machine, it thinks that it is.

111
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.661
In fact, if I do,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Hit the API,

112
00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:04.739
and there it is.

113
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.570
So even though this is not my local host,
my machine now thinks that it is.

114
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.330
So I can interact with this machine,
like it's local.

115
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.910
I can debug it.

116
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.360
I can run it locally.

117
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.510
And all of that is happening
on a another server.

118
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.920
That is a pretty magical thing.

119
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.662
However, it is a pretty specific use case.

120
00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:26.710
Most of us do not develop on servers,
we develop locally.

121
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.870
So I want to introduce
a different scenario for you.

122
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.470
The other one is containers.

123
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.850
So let's go ahead and
disconnect from this.

124
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.440
I'm gonna close this instance of VS Code.

125
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:46.340
I have here in my project in my start
folder a Azure functions project.

126
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.380
I'm gonna go ahead and remove this so
we can start from scratch.

127
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.648
Then let's reopen this as a workspace.

128
00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:55.170
See, open workspace.

129
00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:00.819
Ask me which one,

130
00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:06.470
let's go to dev.

131
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.830
That's the right one, and
then let's open remote development, start.

132
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.392
And here is our workspace file.

133
00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:13.968
There we go.
