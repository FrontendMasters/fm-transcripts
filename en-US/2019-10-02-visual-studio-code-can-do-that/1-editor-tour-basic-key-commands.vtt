00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.860
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: I wanna talk about
some terminology before we get started,

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.570
because I'm gonna throw around
a lot of terminology today, and

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.700
it can be a little confusing.

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.070
So let's just start with
the parts of the editor.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.070
On the left hand side here we have
something called the activity bar.

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.040
The activity bar opens the side bar.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.770
This is called the side bar.

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.110
And these different buttons here,
put different things in the sidebar.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.830
The four main ones are the file explorer,
the search,

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.820
the source control, the debug,
there's five and the extensions.

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.160
Down here below that any
extensions that you install

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.550
That have activity bar buttons
will be installed here.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.300
So sometimes when you install
an extension like Docker,

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.460
it puts a whole Docker view
over here on the side.

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970
So we have the activity bar and
we've got the sidebar.

16
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.790
Up at the top here we have the tabs and
the editor space.

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.510
So this is the main editor space or
where you write your code.

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.160
And then down here at the bottom.

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.620
This is called the status bar.

20
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.580
And you can click on these
items down here, and

21
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.830
some of them have different menus and will
pop those menus up when you click on them.

22
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.250
The last thing you need to know is that
we have an item, called the panel.

23
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.870
And the panel is this thing right here
that is at the bottom that contains

24
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.320
problems, output, debug console,
but most importantly, the terminal.

25
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.780
So our essential keyboard shortcuts for
working inside of this space are command

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.240
or Ctrl+B, to expand and collapse
the sidebar which you're gonna do a lot.

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.490
Another one is the command palette
which is Command or Control Shift P,

28
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.850
and that opens this thing right here.

29
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.420
Another one is the file switcher,

30
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.730
which is just command P,
which allows you to switch between files.

31
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.410
And then another one is the terminal or
the panel if you want to show the terminal

32
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.810
it's control, On both machines back
tick will show and hide the terminal.

33
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.440
You can also use command J which shows and
hides the bottom but, if

34
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.940
you wanna get directly to the terminal you
wanna use the back tick control Bactec.

35
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.900
So those are the main VS code,
keyboard shortcuts that you need to know.

36
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.860
And I'm gonna go ahead and
open our first exercise here.

37
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.480
Let's let's go to exercise one.

38
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.440
Actually, let's open you know when I'm
gonna open the whole thing in insiders.

39
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.785
So Insiders, just like regular VS Code,

40
00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:43.247
has a path command that you can put in,
and that will open us up here.
