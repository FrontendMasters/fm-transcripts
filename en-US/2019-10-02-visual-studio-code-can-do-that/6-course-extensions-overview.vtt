00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.300
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: One last
thing on visual stuff, and

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.900
then I'm gonna let y'all work a little
bit on customizing your own editor.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.190
There is an extension that is made by
a fellow named John Papa called Peacock.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.120
It's a very interesting extension so

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.180
I wanna talk about it,
simple but interesting.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.210
I've included it, if you open,
if you go and search for

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.120
peacock, you can see peacock,
enter a color.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.095
So I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

9
00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.527
The only hex color I can
ever remember is this

10
00:00:30.527 --> 00:00:34.428
one,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Which is blue.

11
00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:39.690
Let's see, FF, I think Salmon is like

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.010
FA 707A, something like that.

13
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.090
Yeah, there we go.

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.010
Nice salmon colors.

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.013
I can remember two colors.

16
00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:53.107
All right, so
you can see what's happened here is that

17
00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:56.320
it's changed the title bar to that color.

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.595
The reason why this is helpful if
we go to VS code settings here,

19
00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:04.240
you'll see it's been added here,
peacock color.

20
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.910
The reason why this is helpful is because

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.960
you might have multiple instances
of VS code open at the same time.

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.367
So if we were to open another instance
of VS code like this one here.

23
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.346
So they're both themed now but
you can set the title bar colors on

24
00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:24.211
individual instances, and so if you're
working with maybe an API project and

25
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:28.951
a front end project at the same time,
you can set one to green and one to blue.

26
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.040
And then you can immediately by looking at
the title bar know which project you're

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.320
looking at.

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.380
So it's a very helpful extension.

29
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.450
It will also theme the activity bar and
the status bar.

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.819
It does a lot of other stuff.

31
00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.161
I just theme the top bar because
that's enough for me to know.

32
00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:46.908
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: One final note here,

33
00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:50.450
I have included an extension
called bracket pair colorizer.

34
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.970
You'll see it.

35
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.540
Actually let me turn off this.

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.750
I don't want to a salmon title bar here.

37
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.250
So let me take this off.

38
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.484
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Put this back,
all right.

39
00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:05.790
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: See these
brackets how they're yellow and

40
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.330
you can barely see them.

41
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.980
It's because it's in a light theme.

42
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.550
I've given you the bracket pair colorizer
extension cuz some people really like it.

43
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.430
It works well with dark themes.

44
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.780
So I'm gonna switch to a dark theme.

45
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.570
Let's see here, color theme and
let's switch over to night owl.

46
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.480
All right, so
what the bracket-pair colorizer does is it

47
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.310
changes the colors of matching brackets.

48
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.492
So now I can look at this line and
see, well, this ends here, and

49
00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:39.463
it's easier for me to see that
just by looking at the colors.

50
00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:42.509
But if you have a light theme,
it's not so great as you just saw,

51
00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:46.347
so I don't use the bracket-pair colorizer,
but if you're using a dark theme,

52
00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:47.832
you should take a look at that.

53
00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:51.760
So I'm actually going to go ahead and
disable the bracket period colorizer.

54
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.630
So with that, what you should do, if you
haven't been doing it along with me for

55
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.895
the next few minutes, is go through and
the exercise is here,

56
00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:03.890
install the themes and go ahead and
get your editor customized.

57
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.825
You may decide that you don't wanna do
all of the customizations that I did, but

58
00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:12.372
if you do, just remember,
you're wrong, I'm right.

59
00:03:12.372 --> 00:03:14.065
You should have done the customizations.

60
00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:15.736
If you wanna keep your sidebar on
the left, keep it on the left.

61
00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:17.217
A lot of people feel comfortable there.
