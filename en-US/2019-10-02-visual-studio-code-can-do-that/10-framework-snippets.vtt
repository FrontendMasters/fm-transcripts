00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.912
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Well,
if you're a React, an Angular or

2
00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:06.410
a view developer,
you have some snippet options.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.760
And I've included some for you here,
in the extension pack that I gave you.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.250
I'm gonna add a file here
that's just called App.js.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.770
And what I wanna do is
create some react in here.

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.760
I do react so
that you know that I'm very, very smart.

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.913
So what I'm going to do here is instead of
importing react manually, I can just do.

8
00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:28.585
Let's see here, I can just do imrcimp.

9
00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:33.140
There we go.

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.510
And get an import module from module here.

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.630
The snippets that I've included for
react are called simple react snippets.

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.610
There we are right there.

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.840
I know this fella, he's all right.

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.380
So you can go ahead and see here down
here, instructions on how to do that.

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.060
So for instance, if we wanted to
do get react we can just do IMR.

16
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.920
And then that gives us import react and

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.510
then we could do CCC which
is a class component.

18
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.190
And I don't know we maybe we have
an artist here, you get the idea.

19
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.590
Just quicker for scaffolding out
application files here with react.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.090
We have the same thing for view.

21
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.160
So let's do a new file and
call it app.view and I've included some

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.534
snippets from Sarah Drowsner that allow
you to do something like a v-base, or

23
00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:28.330
even vt-base, which gives you a TypeScript
and now you have a TypeScript based

24
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.370
view component file here,
boilerplate that you don't have to do.

25
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.190
And then let's do one more.

26
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.736
Let's do.

27
00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:43.020
Let's do app.component.js,
which would be an Angular file.

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.830
And look,
I told you material icons was cool.

29
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.690
Look, it just knows.

30
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.790
It's like, yeah,
it's probably an Angular file.

31
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.745
Nobody else would name their
JavaScript files that.

32
00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:51.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Now,

33
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.300
you can do a dash, or
I think it's a, what is it?

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.620
A let's see here.

35
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.150
Let's just look for a component.

36
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.250
Let's see here.

37
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.510
Did I include Angular snippets?

38
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.240
Let's look here.

39
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.900
I should have given you John Papa's
amazing Angular snippets.

40
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.730
Yet right here.

41
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.440
There they are.

42
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.390
Let's see here.

43
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.856
Component I don't know
where my components are.

44
00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:19.620
I'll have to look at this later, but

45
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.900
you should get like an a dash component,
and that will, there it is.

46
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.320
And then it will scaffold out.

47
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.920
It was just in it like
you want a component.

48
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.400
Surely that's what you want.

49
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.350
No, but thank you for trying.

50
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.790
And you should be able to scaffold
out an Angular component here.

51
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.610
Alright, by the way, sometimes VS code
does get into a state where you're like

52
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.760
well this should be working but
this isn't working.

53
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.100
A quick tip on that is to
open the command palette and

54
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.530
say reload window, like this,
and it would just reload VS code,

55
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.360
and a lot of times that will
solve a lot of problems.

56
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720
If things aren't acting like
you think that they should,

57
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.600
you should check that out.

58
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have a key binding for
that or you just use the pallete?

59
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.300
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: I just use the pallete.

60
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.740
Do you have a key binding for it?

61
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let's see it, is it,

62
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.550
yeah, I guess we could keyboard
shortcuts is reload window in here.

63
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.220
Yeah, we could.

64
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.790
Yeah.

65
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.730
Command R there is one.

66
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.390
Look at that.

67
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.490
All right.
Let's do it.

68
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.585
It didn't work, it's not working.

69
00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:15.784
[SOUND] Yeah, there we go.
