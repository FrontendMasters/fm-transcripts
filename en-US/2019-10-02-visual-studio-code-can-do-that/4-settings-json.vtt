00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.170
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: You can also do
customizations to your editors, so

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.030
you can customize the theme
that you've already got.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.940
If you were to go into your
settings file here, so

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm gonna do that,
command or control-comma.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.351
And then what I wanna do is I want
to actually look at the JSON,

6
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:26.750
let's see here, I wanna look at the,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: JSON

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.470
inside of my settings.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.710
So the settings UI, let's see if I can
figure out how to get this to work here.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.280
I want the settings UI to be JSON
instead of the actual UI here.

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.180
So if we back off this a little bit we can
see here what we want is settings JSON.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.920
Configure editor settings to be
overridden for Edit and settings.JSON.

12
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.900
So here's our settings.JSON file.

13
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.800
This is the file that is
underneath that settings UI.

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.160
And you can see that as I've been
adding things here, they're showing up.

15
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.000
So here's our font ligatures set.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.070
Here's our zoom level.

17
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.980
Here's my theme.

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.230
We can do things like theming
the title bar up there.

19
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.240
So we can do.

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.102
In fact, let's switch back over here and
I'll show you in this instance,

21
00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:20.080
workbench.color customizations
is what it looks like.

22
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.270
And what then what you can do in here is
you can change the different colors of

23
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.160
the editor part.

24
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.630
So you can change just the status bar,
just the title bar, or

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.180
just the activity bar.

26
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.700
Here, you can see I've got the active
background set for tabs and

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.450
some other things like that.

28
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.590
So you can change colors here as well,
you could change this to 3, 3, 3,

29
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.530
3 and it will change
the colors of the tabs up top.

30
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.070
It put a little line underneath
the settings.JSON tab there.

31
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.570
You can also change things like the title.

32
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.630
So you can see I have window title here,
and then I've got a little ASCII art.

33
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.400
So you do a lot,
you can mess around with your settings and

34
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.380
figure out the things that you can change
inside of VS code to make it more yours.
