00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.760
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right, so
you haven't container now what do you

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.950
do with the container?

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.890
You deploy that container, where to?

4
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.420
To a registry.

5
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.230
So let's go back to Docker here.

6
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.670
And I've got two
registries connected here.

7
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.140
One of them is Docker Hub.

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.510
So let me expand this and
hopefully I'm logged in and

9
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.050
here's my registry in Docker hub and

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.550
if I wanna get this image into Docker hub
I'm gonna right-click it and say push.

11
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.340
I need to do this.

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.820
Okay, the other thing I need to do is I
need to tag this, so let's go ahead and

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.900
tag this right here.

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.170
So I'm gonna say tag.

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.460
And then I need, in order for
it to know which repository to go to,

16
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.030
I have to tell it.

17
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.240
So I have a username in Docker and
so do you if you installed it,

18
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.590
you have a username.

19
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.210
And if you just prefix your
image with your Docker username,

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.850
you're specifying that you want this
image to go to Docker hub by default.

21
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.500
So we tag it.

22
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.023
There it is, let's push latest so I will
say push, preparing and now it's pushing.

23
00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:11.523
See?

24
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:14.210
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: It's
pushing everything up.

25
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.030
All right, so I'm gonna refresh this, and
we should see our front end master is

26
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.800
image now in my repository in
Docker Hub and there it is.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.440
It's published and in fact, watch this.

28
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.336
What is it hub.docker.com.

29
00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.990
All right, here we go.

30
00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:41.090
Now Frontend Masters is actually available
and anybody can pull this down and

31
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.060
run it on their own machine or
run it in their cloud provider of choice.
