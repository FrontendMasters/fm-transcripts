00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.740
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let's talk
about some refactoring stuff.

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.250
Remember when we changed this current
color variable using multiple cursors?

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.300
Don't ever do that.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.890
That's a really bad way to try to
rename variables in VS code and

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.290
the reason is because how do
you know you got them all?

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.200
In fact, how do you know that

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.646
there aren't ones in other files that are
referencing the one that you just changed?

8
00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:31.960
Instead, there is a rename refactor
that you can use inside of VS code.

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.750
So we've got current color.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.550
Let me zoom out a little bit so
we can get both of them here.

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.070
So instead, let's rename if we wanted
to rename the color input here,

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.928
what we should do instead is we should
use the rename refactor and that is f2.

13
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:50.020
So if you press F2 you get this
little thing that drops down and

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.250
then we can say,
let's say this is lamp input instead.

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.250
Okay, press enter,

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.070
and it's going to rename all of
the instances that we've got here.

17
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.122
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In the same file?

18
00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:05.853
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Yeah, well, bear with me
here, so, let's talk about this scenario

19
00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:09.335
though, where you have multiple files,
because we don't, but

20
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.842
let's create a scenario where we do and
see what that looks like.

21
00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:17.844
So, in this case,
let's say we have class app, and

22
00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:24.688
right now, instead of us initializing
it instead, let's export it.

23
00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.061
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Okay?

24
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:32.440
And then let's say we have another
file over here called main.js.

25
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.444
And inside of that,
we're gonna import from the app file,

26
00:01:38.444 --> 00:01:44.343
so we've imported app, and
now we can say newapp.init.

27
00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:46.958
Okay, so let's say we're actually
doing the initialization of

28
00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.620
this file in another file.

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.630
So now what we have is a reference
to this file from the app file, so

30
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.030
let's go up here to the top and
actually rename this.

31
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.430
So let's say we wanted to
rename this to application.

32
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.244
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna grab this here,

33
00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:04.462
I'm gonna highlight it, and
then I'm gonna press F2.

34
00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:06.860
And I'm gonna rename it to application.

35
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.840
And I'm gonna press Enter.

36
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.030
And when I did that, you'll notice
that the main file changed as well.

37
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.040
So if I get over here see how
it got renamed over here.

38
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.070
So it knows if I use the rename refactor
to go find the other instances and

39
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.515
rename them, and I bet you now that I have
changed this, I bet to you it will let us

40
00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:32.700
peak the references here, peak references,
yeah now it sees both of them.

41
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.380
So normally when you have something
like this you can peek references and

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.530
you can see all the different places that
it's used inside of your application.

43
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.590
There's a lot of refactoring
tools in vs code.

44
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.770
I'm just showing you the ones that
I think you'll use the most often.

45
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.790
Another one is extract method.

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.190
So a lot of times you'll find yourself as
a developer where you've written some code

47
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.090
and then you're like,
I need to use that code again.

48
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.580
And I've now written it twice.

49
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.280
So when that happens, what do we do?

50
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.940
We put it in a method that we can
then call from somewhere else,

51
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.180
because don't repeat yourself.

52
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.350
So for instance, maybe we had this
code here on this adamant, actually,

53
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.140
let's do it on.

54
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.029
Let's do it on here.

55
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.030
We wanna take this code right here and
we're gonna put this in its own method.

56
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.240
So we could copy it out,
create the method, paste it inside, but

57
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.850
a better thing to do is to
highlight it like this.

58
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.590
And then you see a little light bulb over
there on the side, what is telling you is

59
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.760
there's some things you can do here,
and if we press Command or

60
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.690
Control period,
It asks us do you want to extract this

61
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.020
to a method in the inside of this class
application, so it sees the class scope.

62
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.840
And it's offering to extract the method,
we'll say extract method.

63
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.680
And I'm going to call it update color.

64
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.840
Press Enter.

65
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.013
And now we've got an update color and

66
00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:53.456
look it even was smart enough
to bring along the variable.

67
00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:57.878
So these are the refactoring tools that
are available to you inside of VS code

68
00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:01.677
that allow you to be a lot more
productive than if you were trying to

69
00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:03.770
change all these things manually.

70
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.179
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So control period then?

71
00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.960
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Command or
control period brings up the light bulb.

72
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.170
If there are any light bulb commands,

73
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.020
you'll see the little light
bulb out there, to the side.
