00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:02.740
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right,
let's open up the command palette and

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.018
look at something else when
it comes to finding things.

3
00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:07.020
I had you turn off the breadcrumbs.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.385
Mark made me turn them back on,
but I had you turn them off.

5
00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:12.120
And I'm gonna turn them off as
soon as this workshop is over.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.639
Mark, I just want you to know that and

7
00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.560
that's because I don't
think you need them.

8
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.620
I think that you can
find stuff in other ways.

9
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.010
So we looked at the find and replace.

10
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.080
The other thing that you can do is use
something called the symbol browser.

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.365
If we open up the command palette,
you see this little

12
00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:35.400
caret that's up in
the left hand side here?

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.250
If you take this out,
you get the file switcher.

14
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.710
And this allows you to move between files,
right?

15
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.120
So these are all the other files
that I've got that I can jump to.

16
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.240
So maybe we wanted to
go to the start file.

17
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.191
Now here's something that
you're gonna do a lot.

18
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:58.210
You're gonna jump between the index
file and the app.js file a lot.

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.272
In VS code, you can move to
the most recent file you are in.

20
00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:07.200
And you're gonna remember this
keyboard shortcut, I promise you.

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.746
It's command PP, all right?

22
00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:14.620
Command PP takes you to
the last file that you were at.

23
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.600
We toggle between two files a lot.

24
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.320
So you're gonna want to remember that one.

25
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.770
If you keep pressing p,
it just sort of moves down the list here.

26
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.120
But command pp is probably
the one that you're looking for.

27
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.310
You can also use the arrow key.

28
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.980
So we have this user interface element,

29
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.910
the command palette and when we press
Command Shift P, we get a carrot.

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.500
If we take it out,
we get to the file switcher.

31
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.770
If we just do Control or Command P,
then we get directly to the file switcher,

32
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.470
but it's the same UI element.

33
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.340
And so you can add in other
modifiers here to do other things

34
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.170
with this particular UI
element to browse your code.

35
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.558
So for instance, if we use an at sign,

36
00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:02.830
it will list out all of the different
items that are in our HTML file.

37
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.549
This is called the symbol browser.

38
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.730
And if you go down here, you can see if
it's got an ID, it will include that.

39
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.340
So if you're trying to get to that circle
bulb that I'm changing with JavaScript,

40
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.230
we can jump directly there
with the symbol browser.

41
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.910
The other thing is,
you can use a colon after the symbol,

42
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.770
the at symbol here and
that will segment things off into groups.

43
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.840
And so now we've got our classes.

44
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.121
And here's our fields.

45
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:33.900
We'll look at code in a minute.

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.310
It works a little bit
better with code here.

47
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.049
The other thing that you can
do is you can use the pound

48
00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.020
sign to search for
a certain set of symbols.

49
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.970
So maybe we're searching for app and
then we get directly to the app here.

50
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.210
And you can see,
we're searching across, so

51
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.570
now we're actually searching
across files for symbols.

52
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.044
So just sort of work with this.

53
00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.806
Work with the at sign, with the colon,
with the pound sign, and

54
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.441
you can really navigate through your code
pretty easily using the command palette,

55
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.919
which is a construct you're
gonna be using a lot anyway.

56
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.530
Let me go over to the app.js file here for
a second and

57
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.900
show you it works a little bit
better in code than it does in HTML.

58
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.330
So let's open that again and
now we can see, here's all our symbols.

59
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.690
If I do the colon now we've got classes,
functions,

60
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.020
methods, and
variables That we can jump around in here.

61
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.850
And just a very simple way to
navigate through our code.

62
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.930
So if we knew that we wanted to go to the
event listener for the go button in HTML,

63
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.180
there it is right there,
we can jump directly to it.

64
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.766
So between the file switcher here,
right command PP,

65
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:48.340
That's the one and
the symbol browser at sign and

66
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.170
the colon, you can move really
fast throughout your project.

67
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.251
One other keyboard shortcut that I wanna
give you here or set of them is you

68
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:05.630
will find yourself moving between
the sidebar and the editor a lot.

69
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.350
You can use a keyboard
shortcut to mitigate that.

70
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.620
One of them is Cmd+0 and
the other is Cmd+1.

71
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.650
So here's what you do.

72
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.100
Cmd+0 puts your focus in the sidebar,
okay?

73
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.930
And you can move down with
the arrow key and select a file.

74
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.750
Now, I should point out that if
you're on a Mac and you hit enter,

75
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.770
it will try and rename the file which is
probably not what you were expecting, but

76
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.700
that's how all browsers work in or
file browsers work on Mac.

77
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.510
If you hit enter, you go to rename.

78
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.090
It doesn't open the file.

79
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.330
On Windows, enter just opens
the file like you would expect.

80
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.790
So if you're on a Mac and
you actually want to open the file,

81
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.550
you have to press command down and
that will open the file.

82
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.840
So it's a little bit of a quirk there for
Mac people, for Windows people,

83
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.670
it's gonna work the way that you would
think that it should probably work.

84
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.920
And then, so you're in the sidebar,

85
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.990
if you select, it's gonna put your
cursor back into the editor anyway.

86
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.372
But if you wanna go back to the editor,
you press Cmd+1 and

87
00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:15.024
your cursor is back on the editor side,
okay?

88
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:18.030
So Cmd+0 to get to the sidebar.

89
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.500
Cmd+1 to get back to the editor.

90
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.955
That, again, just stops you from having to
move your mouse to select the contents of

91
00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:25.728
the sidebar.

92
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.480
&gt;&gt; Student: How do you
get to the terminal?

93
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.770
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: The terminal is control

94
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.733
backtick,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Which is

95
00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:40.680
above the Tab key.

96
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.150
Yeah, the tilde, there we go, yeah.
