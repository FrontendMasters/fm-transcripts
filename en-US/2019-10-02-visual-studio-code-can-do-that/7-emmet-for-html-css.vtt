00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: We're gonna get into
some of my favorite productivity tricks

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.950
next, and I would like to
introduce you to this lamp.

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.550
We are going to be building an application
today, throughout all our exercises,

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.770
that allows you to control
the color of the lamp.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.581
We open this index file here, and, man,

6
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:22.732
my comments are dark,
they just look like text now.

7
00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:29.039
So, one of the main productivity tricks
that you need to know about inside of.

8
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.016
Let me just turn this off for a second,

9
00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:35.565
inside of VS Code is
something called Emmet.

10
00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:37.900
Emmet used to be called Zen Coding.

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.450
If you've already heard of Emmet,
I'm gonna show you some things maybe you

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.450
didn't know that Emmet could do,
it can do a couple of really cool things.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.790
If you haven't heard of Emmet,
it's just a way to write HTML faster,

14
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.950
because we write a lot of HTML, and it's
a little bit clumsy if you do it by hand.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.525
So we're sort of used to doing this, where
you have a div, and you type div, and then

16
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.794
you close the bracket, and then VS Code
knows, and it gives you a closing div.

17
00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:07.378
There's nothing wrong with this, except
that opening and closing brackets sort of,

18
00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:09.250
what are these called?

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.610
What's this?
Is it a carrot?

20
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.020
The carrots, are the carrots?

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.180
Nobody knows.

22
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.137
We'll call it a carrot.

23
00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:19.810
Opening and closing carrots is
clunky because it's a shift action.

24
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.790
So what you can do instead is, with Emmet
you can just type div and hit Tab, and

25
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.100
it gives you a div here.

26
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.767
You can do that for any HTML,
if you wanted an anchor, anchor, and

27
00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:34.039
then you can see it's an abbreviation,
Tab, now.

28
00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:41.080
You can also do IDs and classes.

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.410
So you can do div,
maybe it as a class of main, or

30
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.880
an id of main, and it has a class of body.

31
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.230
Or, that's not a good class, that's
a terrible class name, let's do app.

32
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.905
And if we expand this, we get a div
with an id of main, and a class of app.

33
00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:02.440
We can also use this to
go down into elements.

34
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.250
We could do a div, and inside of that is
another div, and inside of that is another

35
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.030
div, and inside of that is an anchor,
and that's what we'll get here.

36
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.250
Now, you can also just
leave out the div part,

37
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.840
because Emmet is aware of
the context that you're in.

38
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.750
So, if you do this main.application, you
will get a div with main and application.

39
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.960
When I mean that it's aware, I mean
that if we do an unordered list, and

40
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.700
then inside of that we want a, say, three
list items with the class of list item.

41
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.580
We can just do, list item,
and I think we can do

42
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.750
times 3, and then hit Tab,
and that's what we get.

43
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.760
So, you see, I didn't actually have
to specify that was a list item,

44
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.130
I just specified the class, and VS Code,
or Emmet rather, knows that because you're

45
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.630
inside a list item, or an unordered
list rather, you want a list item.

46
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.170
So what we're gonna do here is
just start to build out a page.

47
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.660
Now, you can build out Boilerplate HTML
by just hitting exclamation point and

48
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.920
Tab, and then you get a whole HTML page.

49
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.638
And you can Tab between
the tab stops here, and

50
00:03:12.638 --> 00:03:18.373
we'll title this application, and
we are gonna call it, I Love Lamp.

51
00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:21.110
And now what I wanna do is just
start building out this application

52
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.720
a little bit.

53
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.180
So, what I'm gonna do is just create
some of this markup that we see here.

54
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.080
And the way that I use Emmet is,
I use it in spurts.

55
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.598
So, I will do something like,
we have a class of .has-text-centered,

56
00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:38.412
like this, if I can spell,
and then I hit Tab.

57
00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:43.337
And then I go inside of that, I have
an image, and I need to set the source,

58
00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:46.160
like this, okay, and I'm done.

59
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.870
And then I come down to the bottom,
and I just sort of repeat that, and

60
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.440
inside there's columns.

61
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.030
So, this is how I normally use Emmet,
is just in short sections.

62
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.520
Now, you can use Emmet to create a lot of
HTML at one time, if you want to do that.

63
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.350
So for instance, let's create now
this second one down here, on step 2.

64
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.132
And we're gonna put this inside
the column's class here.

65
00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:13.280
So I'm gonna go ahead and save this.

66
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.338
And right here we've got two sections,
we have two column elements,

67
00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:22.290
and then, inside of those
column elements we have things.

68
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.204
We have two blocks that
occurred at the same level,

69
00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:25.504
we can create all this with Emmet.

70
00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:30.475
So what we're gonna do here is,
we're gonna say we have a div that has

71
00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:35.120
a class of column, and it is 10,
these are CSS classes.

72
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.980
And then inside of that,
there's an input that has an id of

73
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.870
colorInput, and it has a class of input,
and it is large.

74
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.710
Now, we need to go back up a level,
cuz we went down a level, so

75
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.950
we need to go back up a level.

76
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.360
So we can do that with
this character here.

77
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.900
Or, what we can do is group.

78
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.790
So what I'm gonna do instead is,
I'm gonna group these things together.

79
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.208
So what this does is, says,
this is a section, and then I'm gonna say,

80
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.580
at the same level,
I'm gonna have a new section.

81
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.480
And I'm gonna put all of this stuff
down here, inside that new section.

82
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.647
So that's a column.

83
00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:15.055
And then inside of that there is
an anchor with an id of goButton,

84
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:20.180
and it has a class of button,
it is primary, and it is large.

85
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.530
Large, there we go.

86
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.542
And then, when I come to the end here, you
can see that Emmet sort of goes away, so

87
00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.400
if I hit Tab, nothing happens.

88
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.210
Sometimes what you need to do is
Ctrl+Spacebar to sort of bring Emmet back

89
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.450
and say, I need you, I'm still here,
and then you can see that it's back,

90
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.130
and you hit Enter, and
then it does all your expansions here.

91
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.770
Just go ahead and pull all this out, we're
good to go, so we put our HTML in here.

92
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.250
Now, one of the things that Visual Studio
Code will do for you as you're typing,

93
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.700
not just HTML, but also code is,

94
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.360
it will format it for you, so it will
move things around and make it all nice.

95
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.140
Now, by default that's not happening,
because I haven't formatted this document.

96
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.080
So, to do that, what I can do is say,
Cmd+Shift+P, and save format document, and

97
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.790
I'm gonna hit Enter, and then it's gonna
format all of my HTML nice and pretty.

98
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.840
And when I say pretty, I do mean pretty.

99
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.760
So I've included a formatter for
you, not just for HTML, but also for

100
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.020
CSS and JavaScript called Prettier.

101
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.678
And you can see that it's running
down here, at the bottom,

102
00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:34.380
says Prettier right there.

103
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.430
Now, obviously you don't want to have
to format your document every time, so

104
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.660
what you want VS Code to
do is format on save.

105
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.650
And you can turn that on by toggling,
I've include this toggle right here,

106
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.810
which is an extension, and
it's called Toggle Format on Save.

107
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.593
And if I hit that, it's now on, and

108
00:06:51.593 --> 00:06:55.712
you can see down there at the bottom it
says, you can't see it, it went away.

109
00:06:55.712 --> 00:06:58.632
So it said,
Format on Save is on very quickly there.

110
00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:01.430
So now every time I save, it'll format.

111
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.420
This is a very handy extension, cuz a lot
of times you'll be in a document, or

112
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.200
a piece of code that you
haven't worked in before, and

113
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.620
your settings could be different
than their format settings.

114
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.308
And so, if Prettier is turned on, and
VS Code is formatting everything you write

115
00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:17.547
in, it's gonna reformat
that whole code file.

116
00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:19.587
And then when you go to
check it into GitHub,

117
00:07:19.587 --> 00:07:22.910
it's gonna tell you every single
line in that file has changed.

118
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.590
You're gonna check in, and someone's gonna
call you very angry because you have

119
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.990
injected two spaces into
their four space world,

120
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.992
and they're not gonna like that very much.

121
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.450
So, what you wanna be able to do is,
quickly toggle off that formatting, and

122
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.300
that's what the formatting toggle does for
you,

123
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.190
and that's included in
the extension bundle there.

124
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.807
I'm gonna go ahead and

125
00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:45.660
run this application
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So let's do that.

126
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.016
I'm gonna open up the integrated terminal
here, and we'll just say, npm start.

127
00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:55.850
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
now we're running, and let's see here.

128
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.103
Let's go back to our browser,
and we'll say, localhost,

129
00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:07.330
localhost:3000, I think, yeah,
there it goes, it's open.

130
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.640
All right, so, it's looking pretty good,
looks amazing.

131
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.650
No, it's terrible.

132
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.750
We need a CSS file.

133
00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:15.964
Just come back here and
include one of those.

134
00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:20.856
I'm gonna come up here and, somebody
once tweeted, I think it was me, and

135
00:08:20.856 --> 00:08:26.110
it was like, ten years later and I'm
still Googling how to include a CSS file.

136
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.510
So, if you feel that way,
it's okay, I do too.

137
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.440
Every time I have to include one
I forget what the syntax is.

138
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.141
Fortunately with VS Code we
can just say the link, and

139
00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:37.310
then it will fill that our for us.

140
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.690
I've included a CSS framework
in here called Bulma.

141
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.380
Anybody in here familiar with
the Bulma CSS framework?

142
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.041
Couple of folks.

143
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:50.743
If you haven't seen Bulma,
let me come back over here,

144
00:08:50.743 --> 00:08:54.410
you can check it out
if you go to Bulma.io.

145
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.820
This is the Bulma CSS framework, and
it is a really nice CSS framework,

146
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.860
I'm a big fan, it's quite simple,
it looks really good.

147
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.830
That's the one that we're
gonna be using today.

148
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.550
I particularly like its grid system, and
how easy it is to use, very declarative.

149
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.650
So that's the CSS
framework we'll be using.

150
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.690
I'm a fan, you should check
that out if you haven't yet.

151
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.330
All right, so
what else do we need to do here?

152
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.150
We need to add some styles to this page,
that looks good.

153
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.080
So I'm going to add a style tag here.

154
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.940
Now, normally we would have
an external CSS file, but for

155
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.520
the sake of simplicity
we'll put it all in line.

156
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.900
And what I wanna do is
add a style to the HTML.

157
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.480
And, what I wanna show you here is that
Emmet works inside of CSS the same way

158
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.010
that it works inside of HTML.

159
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.800
So for instance, I wanna add a background
image, what I can do is say, bgi,

160
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.950
and hit Tab, and
that gives me the URL, and

161
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.540
then I'm just gonna say background.jpeg,
there we go.

162
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.700
And then you can see,

163
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.480
see how there's a preview in the left
hand side here, of the image.

164
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.460
That's an extension that I've given you,
called image preview.

165
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.380
And what's nice about that is that you
know that you've got the right path

166
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.250
because the image is showing up
as an icon on the left hand side,

167
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.060
that's why I like this extension.

168
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.690
Otherwise you have no way of knowing
if you just entered the correct path or

169
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.260
if it's wrong.

170
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.600
Now, this background image,
we want it to repeat.

171
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.610
So we're gonna say bgr,
repeat, no repeat, is fine.

172
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.810
We want the size to be cover.

173
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.470
We want a height of 100%.

174
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.767
So we could type that height 100%, or
we could just type h, hit Tab, and

175
00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:34.958
then type 100%, or even better,
we could say h, 100p, Tab, height: 100%.

176
00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:40.478
Same thing with min-height,
we can do mh and get min-height,

177
00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:45.010
or we can do mh, and we want 1,400 pixels.

178
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.440
And because we want pixels, we don't need
anything else, we'll just hit Tab, and

179
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.480
we have pixels.

180
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.400
So let's add a little bit more here.

181
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.070
Let's add our style to the body, and

182
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.870
we'll add one for
the app wrapper that we don't have yet.

183
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.277
So in the body what I wanna do is
have a background color, and again,

184
00:11:05.277 --> 00:11:08.015
I'm just just typing, see,
I didn't even have to,

185
00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:12.090
I'm just basically typing
the characters that are in that string.

186
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.650
And I'm gonna, what we're gonna do here
is, create a mask for the background

187
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.300
image that's gonna fade it, and give
it this nice, sort of soft, faded look.

188
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.818
And, then we want a height of 100%.

189
00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:26.590
Almost got it.

190
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.300
Let's try that again.

191
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.660
Height, 100p, Tab, there we go.

192
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:37.160
And then for our app, what we want is,
we're gonna go to max-width of 800 pixels.

193
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:39.890
Oops, we got min-width.

194
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.050
Let's try that again.

195
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.474
Let's do max with maw800,

196
00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:49.400
there we go, max-width.

197
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.460
All right, now, I've created this app
container here, but what we need to do is,

198
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.070
we need to get this code, and we need
to wrap this inside of another element.

199
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.280
This is something that you'll do a lot.

200
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.075
And the way that you normally do this is,
you'll do this, you'll come up here,

201
00:12:05.075 --> 00:12:09.290
and you'll go, okay, I need all of
this down to here, do I have it all?

202
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.490
Is that the right closing div?

203
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.150
Okay.

204
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.230
And then you'll cut it.

205
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.800
And then you'll create a div,
like this, and

206
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.960
then you'll paste it in, like that, okay?

207
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.810
There is a better way to do this.

208
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:29.550
And it has a piece of functionality
called balance inward, balance outward.

209
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.980
And what it does is, it balances your
selection to the closing tags, or

210
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.570
at the tag level.

211
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.840
So what we're gonna do here is, just open
the command palette and say, Emmet, and

212
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.349
then we're gonna do
balance outward like this.

213
00:12:42.349 --> 00:12:47.130
And as I do that, you can see it balances
out and it gets the next complete tag.

214
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.926
If we repeat that,
it will just keep on going until, and see,

215
00:12:50.926 --> 00:12:55.817
now we've got the bottom, but then the
next level tag there is the one above it,

216
00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.460
so if we run it again,
now we have all of it.

217
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.270
So we've done it three times.

218
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.950
Now, what I do is,
I map this to a keyboard shortcut.

219
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.640
So if we look at keyboard shortcuts,
and we look for balance.

220
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.506
Balance inward, I map it to Cmd+Shift,
yeah, Cmd+Shift+Up and

221
00:13:15.506 --> 00:13:19.420
Cmd+Shift+Down, balance inward,
balance outward.

222
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.090
Balance outward is the one
you'll use the most.

223
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.810
And so, what we can do is,

224
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.700
we could just put our cursor
anywhere inside of this thing, and

225
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.990
now I can just say Cmd+Shift+Down, and I
can do it until I've got the whole thing.

226
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:36.280
And now I wanna wrap this with
a div that has an id of app,

227
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.846
so to do that, we can also use Emmet.

228
00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:43.310
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna open the command palette, and

229
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.198
I'm gonna say,
Wrap with Abbreviation, here, and

230
00:13:46.198 --> 00:13:50.319
then I can enter an Emmet abbreviation
up here, and boom, we're wrapped.

231
00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:52.947
And because we've got a formatter,
I hit save, and

232
00:13:52.947 --> 00:13:55.930
everything gets popped
into the right place.

233
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.300
Now guess what?

234
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.260
I wrap this to a keyboard shortcut too.

235
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.330
So let's look at keyboard shortcuts.

236
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.860
And what I do is,
I do Wrap with Abbreviation, and

237
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.690
you can see it is mapped
to Option+Shift+W.

238
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:14.720
Now, be careful because
Cmd+W closes the window,

239
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.370
and I believe Cmd+Shift+W force closes
the window, so that is a very close key

240
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.820
combination, but it allows me to quickly
and easily wrap things with abbreviations.

241
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.240
For instance, if we wanted to provide
a link to the Bulma site here, and

242
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.470
we were writing, let's just say,
so now it's on the clipboard.

243
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.920
So, and I've got, and I wanna do, link to
the Bulma framework, I can highlight it,

244
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.430
rapid abbreviation, hit A,
Ctrl+V, boom, I got an anchor in.

245
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:45.550
So, once you learn these sorts
of quick keyboard shortcuts and

246
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.170
maneuvers that you make all the time,
then you can automate them.

247
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.430
So pay attention to the code that you're
writing and the things that you're doing.

248
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.230
If you find yourself doing that a lot,
automate it away with some keyboard

249
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.930
shortcuts, and remember that Emmet
can do most of these things for you.

250
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.940
Here's another thing that Emmet can do.

251
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.280
A lot of times we'll come up here and
we'll say, this right here,

252
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.770
actually this section, this needs to be
a section element, it should not be a div.

253
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.020
I messed that up,
I needed it to be a section.

254
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.050
So, yes, it needs to be section
with the class of section.

255
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.800
And so, what we'll do is,
we'll come here and we'll say section, but

256
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.980
then you'll notice that
we now have a problem,

257
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.970
because we have to come down and
rename the other div.

258
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.110
So, there are two different
ways to handle this situation.

259
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.470
There is an auto rename extension, so

260
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:40.540
if you look for auto rename,
Auto Rename Tag,

261
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.540
and you see, I've got it installed,
but I don't have it enabled.

262
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.580
And the reason for

263
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.860
that is that I've noticed that it
doesn't work correctly all the time.

264
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.930
Sometimes it renames the wrong tags, which
I think is why it might have three stars.

265
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.970
But it also has over two
million downloads, so

266
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.970
there's a lot of people using this.

267
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.751
The other thing you can do,
the one that I like a little bit more,

268
00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:05.200
is to just say, Emmet, and
Update Tag here, right here.

269
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.626
And we're gonna say section,
and then it updates it.

270
00:16:10.626 --> 00:16:13.830
I typed sectjoin or something.

271
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:18.060
Anyway, it's just easier because you
don't have to be right on the tag,

272
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.540
you can be anywhere in there,
and update tag, and then section,

273
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.490
if you can spell section right.

274
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.770
So that's a very,
very useful tool as well to use in Emmet.

275
00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:31.950
All right,
we are almost done with this application.

276
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.647
I just wanna add a few more things.

277
00:16:37.004 --> 00:16:40.965
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Here on the logo,
we have an image, but

278
00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:46.380
we haven't specified
the size of this image.

279
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.940
And we wanna specify
the size of images because.

280
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.563
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Because,

281
00:16:53.563 --> 00:16:57.641
the browser when it loads the page,
it doesn't know how big this image is,

282
00:16:57.641 --> 00:17:02.220
and therefore it doesn't know how much
room to reserve on the page for it.

283
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.040
And the effect of that is that the page
will jump around when the image arrives

284
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.771
from the server, there will be no image
there, image will arrive, page jumps,

285
00:17:11.771 --> 00:17:13.120
we don't want that.

286
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.660
So what we wanna do is tell the browser
how much room it needs to reserve for

287
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.609
this image.

288
00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:22.360
In order to do that, we have to add a
width and height attribute to this image.

289
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.060
There are a couple ways to do this.

290
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.620
One of them is to just come over,
find the image,

291
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.500
look down here at the bottom,
see the size, come back, and

292
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.470
then say width, forgot what it was, I
guess I should go back, look at it again.

293
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.020
There's an easier way.

294
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.920
If you just put your cursor
here in the tag and say Emmet,

295
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:50.310
Update Image Size, it will automatically
pull in the size of that image so

296
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.720
that you don't have to do it yourself.

297
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.990
Now here's what's crazy,
this works on remote images too.

298
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.140
So if you have a URL to an image,
this will still work.

299
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.960
It also works on background images.

300
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.800
So if we say Update Image Size,
it now puts the width and

301
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.370
the height of this image in the CSS.

302
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.510
We don't actually want this, so
I'm gonna go ahead and take this out.

303
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.200
But that is Update Image Size, and
you'll use that one quite a lot.

304
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.780
So let's check on our application,
let's see what it look like now.

305
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.435
I Love Lamp.

306
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.419
Looking pretty good,
a little rough, but getting better,

307
00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:28.580
we'll get there here in just a second.

308
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.970
I also need to add some text to
my button here, so let's do that.

309
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.690
Where is my button?

310
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.366
We'll just call this go,
