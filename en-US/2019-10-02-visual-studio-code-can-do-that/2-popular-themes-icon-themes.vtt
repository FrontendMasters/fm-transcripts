00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:02.884
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So let's talk
about customizing the editor, first,

2
00:00:02.884 --> 00:00:04.652
I want to talk to you about themes.

3
00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:11.330
There is a very exciting theme
happening amongst developers,

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.492
and it's a trend towards dark themes.

5
00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:18.365
You may have heard the dark
themes are better for your eyes,

6
00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:19.584
has anybody heard that?

7
00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:20.495
Nobody's heard that?

8
00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:21.910
Okay, good because it's not true.

9
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.542
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not true?

10
00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:23.311
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: It's not true.

11
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:28.582
Dark themes are anesthetic, so
they look nice, and they're trendy.

12
00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:31.896
Which is why we're getting dark mode
added to just about everything.

13
00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:36.761
But the truth of the matter is if you want
a theme that's best for your eyes for

14
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:38.446
reading comprehension.

15
00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:42.280
Dark text on a light background, is best.

16
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.520
Now there is some
conjecture about whether or

17
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.010
not a dark theme is better for
your eyes late at night.

18
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.300
But no screen is good for
your eyes late at night,

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.120
go to bed, work on the code in the AM.

20
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.000
But what I'm gonna do is show you some
of my favorite light themes because I'm

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.370
the last person alive using a light theme.

22
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.480
So we're gonna look at my
favorite light themes, and

23
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.102
then we're going to look at
some dark themes if you must.

24
00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:09.460
And then we're gonna
look at some fun themes.

25
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.061
So let's look at some of
my favorite light themes.

26
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:18.250
To change themes, and I've included most
of these themes in this extension pack.

27
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.650
You're gonna command palette,
which is command or control-shift-P.

28
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.635
And Preferences, Color Theme, and
one of my favorites is called HopLight.

29
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:31.816
This is HopLight, and
let me open a code file here so

30
00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:35.564
we can see what that might look like.

31
00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:40.783
So you can see all of the code here and
the different colors.

32
00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:45.027
And this probably looks pretty washed-out
on that screen, but there you go.

33
00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:50.214
I like this view a lot, I think that
HopLight has some really nice colors,

34
00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.484
it's my favorite light theme.

35
00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:57.370
Another one that I use a lot is called
Night Owl Light, this one here,

36
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.415
this one also looks really, really good.

37
00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:03.477
It's got very soft colors,
I'm a big fan of this.

38
00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:06.140
Let's do another theme,
another one is one called Noctis, and

39
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.422
we're going to talk about Noctis and
dark themes too.

40
00:02:08.422 --> 00:02:12.662
But you can have your VS code look
like a post-it note, if you want to.

41
00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:17.310
If you are a big fan of soft
purples this is a good one.

42
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.529
I think Hibernus is quite interesting,
so some good light themes in there.

43
00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:27.413
And then there's one called Men, so
there's a Men Dark and Men Light.

44
00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:31.344
This is Men light,
this is extremely minimalist.

45
00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:34.481
So if you watched that documentary on
Netflix, the minimalist documentary.

46
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:36.759
Anybody see that minimalist
documentary on Netflix?

47
00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.485
Nobody saw it?

48
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:38.301
It's quite good.

49
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:41.282
My wife came to me afterwards and said,
hey, why do we have so many spoons?

50
00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:44.086
I'm like cuz there's five people in
the house, we need these spoons,

51
00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:45.265
don't get rid of the spoons.

52
00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:49.900
But if you're minimalist and you only
wanna own one spoon this theme is for

53
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.711
you, this is the Men theme.

54
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:55.079
Okay, let's look at some dark themes.

55
00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.484
We got a couple, probably the most
popular is called Night Owl,

56
00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:03.095
let's see here, there we go.

57
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:06.936
This is a high contrast theme,
so it's extremely accessible.

58
00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.349
It probably looks really
good on the projector and

59
00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.919
right about now my argument about
light themes isn't holding up so well.

60
00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.521
But this theme was made by Sarah Drasner,
it looks amazing.

61
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.542
If I was gonna use dark theme,
this would be the one.

62
00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:25.103
The other theme that you might
wanna look at is called Cobalt2, so

63
00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:27.690
we'll look at that one.

64
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.190
There is some idea that a very
bright yellow text on a dark blue

65
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.880
background is also best for
reading comprehension.

66
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.162
Although there's no WIRED magazine
article to validate that, so

67
00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:41.634
I cannot I can't say
whether that's true or not.

68
00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:46.080
We'll need a very mainstream tech article
in order to know for sure if that's true.

69
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.210
But this one does a good job of
implementing that theme without it looking

70
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.920
too gaudy.

71
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.774
Because bright yellow text
usually looks pretty gaudy.

72
00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:56.620
And then we had Noctis
which we already looked at.

73
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.370
And there's another one called Dracula,
which I don't think I installed, but

74
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.207
let's go ahead.

75
00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:04.451
You can install new themes, just so
everybody could see how I did that.

76
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.639
Let's go back, Preferences, Color Theme,
and then if you are looking for

77
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.788
one that's not there, or
you scroll down to the bottom.

78
00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:15.571
There's Install Additional Color Themes,

79
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:20.553
and just look for Dracula Official,
we'll install that.

80
00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:24.152
And then we've got two,
Dracula, and Dracula Soft.

81
00:04:24.152 --> 00:04:29.152
But there we go, it's a popular theme,
it's got two million plus downloads,

82
00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:30.806
so it's doing all right.

83
00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:33.752
So those are some of my favorite
themes for dark and light.

84
00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:39.725
However, you are an individual and
you need to stand out.

85
00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:45.207
So if you would like to stand out,
I have some options for you.

86
00:04:45.207 --> 00:04:51.155
The first one is some people really
like Slack, they like it a lot.

87
00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:54.151
There is a theme for Slack.

88
00:04:55.874 --> 00:04:59.805
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So if you can't get
enough Slack, you can put Slack right in

89
00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:03.673
your VS Code, and
then it's like you never have to leave.

90
00:05:03.673 --> 00:05:06.896
You can just not be productive for
the rest of your life.

91
00:05:06.896 --> 00:05:11.729
Now there's another theme for
people who miss the old days,

92
00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.303
anybody ever use Windows 95?

93
00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:16.799
Okay, listen, I got one for
you, check this out.

94
00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:20.088
There's one called Windows 95.

95
00:05:20.088 --> 00:05:24.400
That's a good one,
Winter Is Coming is a good one, too.

96
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.331
So there's one called win95
that you can check out, oops.

97
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:32.816
So let's install this one,
there you go, so

98
00:05:32.816 --> 00:05:37.968
all of VS code can look like Windows
95 if you wanna roll that way.

99
00:05:37.968 --> 00:05:40.425
Hey, listen, I'm not here to
tell you how to live your life.

100
00:05:40.425 --> 00:05:44.374
And then there's another
one called Hot Dog, yeah,

101
00:05:44.374 --> 00:05:47.458
very good one, so let's look at Hot Dog.

102
00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:48.385
Is it Hot Dog?

103
00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:52.338
I think it's HotDogStand, yeah,
there we go, so we'll install that and

104
00:05:52.338 --> 00:05:53.612
that'sHotDogStand.

105
00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:56.976
Obviously, you want your editor to
look like that, who doesn't want that?

106
00:05:56.976 --> 00:06:01.161
Everybody wants that, and
then Mark sent me one last night,

107
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.060
what was it called, Mark?

108
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.691
&gt;&gt; Mark: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Synth?

109
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.402
&gt;&gt; Mark: Wave.

110
00:06:06.402 --> 00:06:10.473
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Synthwave, that's right,
which kinda looks like the 80s and

111
00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:12.925
I'm not gonna lie, I kinda like this.

112
00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:15.096
I don't hate it, I'm kind of a fan.

113
00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:16.403
What did code files look like?

114
00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:18.515
Let's take a look.

115
00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:22.012
It's not too bad, so
that's Synthwave theme as well.

116
00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:26.583
So you have those options there for
changing your themes.

117
00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:28.940
Now when we talk about themes, and

118
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.913
let's get back to a light theme since
we want to actually be productive.

119
00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:35.700
Let's see, where is Hop Light?

120
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.597
Hop Light, there we go.

121
00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:43.404
We have color themes in VS code,
and we also have icon themes.

122
00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:47.010
Icon themes control the icons that
are on the left-hand side here.

123
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.084
Out of the box,
you get icons that look like like this,

124
00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:55.570
you can change these by
installing new icon themes.

125
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.000
So I've given you two in the Extension
Pack, one is called Material Icons.

126
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.594
So let's look at that we can just search
for Icon, Preferences, File Icon,

127
00:07:04.594 --> 00:07:07.222
Theme, and switch over to Material icons.

128
00:07:07.222 --> 00:07:09.940
And then you can see that our
icons have changed quite a bit.

129
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.470
I like this one a lot because it changes
folder colors depending on the types of

130
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.100
files that are in the folder,
the name of the folder.

131
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.824
See how it says routes and it's got
a green folder with a little arrow on it?

132
00:07:20.824 --> 00:07:26.660
It's just very good for quickly providing
cognition around what's in your project.

133
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.951
Another really cool thing about this is,
let's do a new file here,

134
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.238
it's called this index.

135
00:07:31.238 --> 00:07:33.621
Anybody ever used Jade or Pug?

136
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.472
It's a templateing language
that goes with Express.

137
00:07:36.472 --> 00:07:40.320
So if you do have Pug,
look, look, y'all, come on,

138
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.519
I mean seriously,
how can you not love this?

139
00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:45.912
So you get a pug file
right in your editor.

140
00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:48.686
Listen, it's the little things.

141
00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:55.692
There is also the fact that Material
icons is really made for VS code.

142
00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:58.330
So it recognizes things like
multiple workspaces, and

143
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.145
you'll see this later on if
you're using multiple icons.

144
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:04.929
It will actually denote multiple
workspaces with circles instead of

145
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:05.522
folders.

146
00:08:05.522 --> 00:08:07.352
Otherwise everything looks like a folder,
and

147
00:08:07.352 --> 00:08:09.927
you can't tell that you're in
multiple projects in a workspace.

148
00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:14.833
So I would highly recommend Material
icons, so would like 20 million people.

149
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:17.080
I don't even know how
many downloads it has.

150
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.010
Now again though,

151
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.685
if you are the kind of person who thinks
that you should only have one spoon.

152
00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:26.472
Then there is a file icon theme for
you, and it's called Chalice icons.

153
00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:30.893
So let's look for
that Chalice, Chalice icons?

154
00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:31.870
How do you spell Chalice?

155
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.717
There we go, so let's install this and

156
00:08:34.717 --> 00:08:39.219
go to Chalice and then we'll go back and
look at our Explorer.

157
00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:42.414
And you can see it is extremely
minimalist, so just folders and

158
00:08:42.414 --> 00:08:43.509
very minimal icons.

159
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:47.842
But some people like this, and that's
fine Chalice icon themes is for you.

160
00:08:47.842 --> 00:08:51.370
So between color themes and
icon themes, we've got you good to go.
