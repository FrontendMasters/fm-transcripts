00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.380
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Something else
that we can do with launch configs,

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.340
other ways you can use them.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.700
Here we have an index file and
our index file

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.410
has a variable at the top
that contains our API.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.450
Now, normally when you
write an application,

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.350
you don't hard code things like these.

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.480
Because you may need to change them later.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.260
So what do we do?

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.080
We put them in application settings.

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280
In the case of node,
that's environment variables.

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.965
Now node environment
variables are cool but

12
00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.860
they're a little bit
tricky to work with and

13
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.470
VS Code makes it a little bit easier
to pass those into the node process.

14
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.270
Because basically what you have
to do is you have to call node,

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.090
run your application and
pass in the appropriate variables.

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.991
In this case let's go ahead and
pull this line out.

17
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.807
And let's say that we're gonna
put it in a variable called,

18
00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:57.431
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: API base.

19
00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:01.561
Okay, so we're gonna pass in a variable
to this application called API_BASE.

20
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.520
Let me make sure my Typescript
watch is still running over here.

21
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.113
It is, good.

22
00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:09.514
Excuse me.

23
00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.141
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So if you're not
familiar with node environment variables,

24
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.465
just know that when you create them or
when you pass them in,

25
00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:17.010
they're on the process.env object.

26
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.200
And then whichever variables
you create will be there.

27
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.520
So now we need to pass this in.

28
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.280
How do we do that?

29
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.810
We can do it with the debugger.

30
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.090
So I'm gonna come back to the launch.

31
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.640
And I'm gonna say, env, and here I
can pass in any environment variable.

32
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.430
So we said, API_BASE,
I think is what we called it.

33
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.468
And put the value in, [SOUND] oops.

34
00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.939
One too many quotes.

35
00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:47.610
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
an unnecessary [LAUGH] semi-colon.

36
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.360
And now we've got the environment
variable for API_BASE.

37
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.060
So if we go back here and
we add a break point here.

38
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.250
In fact, we can just add one right here.

39
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.910
And let's go ahead and

40
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.770
run this, making sure that we
have the right one selected here.

41
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.540
I'm gonna go ahead and
run it, it's gonna start.

42
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.460
Let's enter a color, purple,
and then it's gonna break.

43
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.120
And then we can look at and inspect,
come out of the debug console.

44
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.500
And we can say process.env.API_BASE,
and you see it's there, see it's there?

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.800
And if we select it, we can see the value.

46
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.770
So now we're passing in this environment
variable into the process, okay.

47
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.850
You probably don't want to
pass environment variables

48
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.580
one at a time though in
a launch configuration,

49
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.370
because oftentimes we don't share
launch configurations in GitHub.

50
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.220
Sometimes we do.

51
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.740
Oftentimes we don't because
everybody's machine is different.

52
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.300
And so what you can do instead and

53
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.320
what you'll find most often
is what's called an env file.

54
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.222
I've given you an extension to help
with the env files as larg config files.

55
00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:58.160
I'm gonna add one, and
usually they look like this.

56
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.370
Usually it's like development.env and

57
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.234
then you'll have one called prod.env,
maybe one called local.env.

58
00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:08.600
Or you might just have one called .env.

59
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.170
By the way,
material icons knows about env files.

60
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.530
I don't know.
I guess that's supposed to be

61
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.190
a configuration.

62
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.773
It looks like Flappy Bird but
that's an env file.

63
00:03:18.773 --> 00:03:20.414
&gt;&gt; Student: It's a bunch of sliders.

64
00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:21.294
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that what it is?

65
00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:21.803
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

66
00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.825
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Doesn't look like
Flappy Bird, looks like Flappy Bird.

67
00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:25.132
I've played that game.

68
00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:26.873
All right-
&gt;&gt; Student: Equalizer.

69
00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.640
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: An equalizer,
yeah, all right, so

70
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.020
here we can say just like we did
before in our launch config.

71
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.460
Let's come back and take this out now,
let me toggle my terminal down,

72
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.880
make some more real estate.

73
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.280
So let's get this, let's take this out and

74
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.790
our syntax is a little different,
so we don't need quotes here.

75
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.901
And you can see it's trying to tell me and
we actually don't need the streams either.

76
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:50.280
So we can just put it in just like that.

77
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.777
So now we need to tell VS code to use
this file to load environment variables.

78
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.121
So we could put multiple environment
variables in here, right?

79
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:05.541
We can put in anything we want, like,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Okay and

80
00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:10.819
then let's go back to our launch config
and instead of env, what we wanna do here,

81
00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.886
let's make some more real estate is say,
which one of these do you think it is?

82
00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:19.179
I'll let y'all guess,
see if you can guess the right setting.

83
00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:20.347
&gt;&gt; Student: Env file.

84
00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:21.873
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Env file, you got it.

85
00:04:21.873 --> 00:04:24.897
And look, it knows.

86
00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:28.520
Okay, Visual Studio Code is trying so
hard to help you out.

87
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.460
It has automatically
picked up our env file.

88
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.923
So we'll click Save here.

89
00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:37.038
And then let's come back and
we still have a breakpoint?

90
00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:38.261
Let's put a breakpoint.

91
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.773
Let's put a breakpoint here.

92
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:44.593
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Pink's a color.

93
00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:45.484
That's a good one.

94
00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:50.521
And we're broken and now if we take
a look at our debug console and

95
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:55.560
process process, process.env,
dot, there's API space and

96
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.640
look, there's favorite band, Owl City.

97
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.330
So this is how you can pass environment
variables into your launch configurations

98
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.360
very easily.

99
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.040
This is what you use launch configurations
for, is to configure the way

100
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.050
that you debug apps and
pass in the right arguments to them.

101
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.690
You can do a lot of other stuff
with launch configurations.

102
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.250
We're not gonna go over all of
it because there is a ton of it.

103
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.820
But just know that if there's
something you're trying to do,

104
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.720
you can probably do it.

105
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.390
The inverse of that is that it
makes launch configurations

106
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.500
rather complex because you can do so much.
