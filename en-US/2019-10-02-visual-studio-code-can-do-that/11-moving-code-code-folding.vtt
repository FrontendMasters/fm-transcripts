00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.170
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Well, we already talked
about prettier inside of JavaScript files.

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.120
We also need to talk about some
very essential keyboard shortcuts.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.880
I'm gonna come back here to the GitBook.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.470
And I'm putting keyboard shortcuts in
pretty much every single one of these

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.620
exercises here.

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.221
So for the first three, you're gonna get
five, three to five keyboard shortcuts.

7
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:30.198
I think there's like 15 total that I
give you throughout the whole amount of

8
00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:31.420
exercises.

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.250
And those are the 15 that I
feel like are most important.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.180
You don't need to know
all 400 plus keyboard

11
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.450
keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code,
that is too many.

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.935
I know that Vim people insist that that
the editor is better because they only

13
00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:48.486
have to use the keyboard.

14
00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:50.045
And how do you know if somebody uses Vim?

15
00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:53.330
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Don't worry,
they'll tell you, right?

16
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.480
So you don't have to be like that, but

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.030
you do want to use your
keyboard as much as you can.

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.240
You're going to wanna reach for

19
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.020
your mouse to do a lot of
things in Visual Studio Code.

20
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.830
When you reach for

21
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.090
your mouse, just ask yourself,
could I do this with a keyboard shortcut?

22
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.423
Do I remember Burke doing this
with a keyboard shortcut?

23
00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:16.050
And then stop, go look up what that is,
and then do it.

24
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.540
It's gonna make you slower initially,
it will, but

25
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.520
your brain is really good at optimizing.

26
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.625
And it's gonna figure out, it's a lot
easier for me to just use this keyboard

27
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:31.051
shortcut, and then you'll be astonished at
how quickly your brain catches onto that.

28
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.968
Human beings are remarkable creatures,
your brain is always looking for

29
00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:35.530
the easiest way to get something done.

30
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.204
And if that's a keyboard shortcut,
that's what you're gonna use.

31
00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:45.076
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right, so
let's open up our index file

32
00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:48.687
here in our exercise three, and

33
00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:54.330
I have added a SVG element
down here at the bottom.

34
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.080
You don't have to worry
about that just yet, but

35
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.780
that's the only thing that I've
added to our projects before,

36
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.810
along with the requisite JavaScript
to make this thing actually work.

37
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.150
One of the things that I use most often
in VSCode is the ability to move lines.

38
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.360
Now, when we're moving a line, like let's
say we wanna move this title line up above

39
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.563
the link line, normally, we highlight
the line, cut it, and then paste it in.

40
00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:22.840
By the way, you can still do that.

41
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.970
By the way, if you didn't notice,
you don't have

42
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.220
to highlight a line to cut it in VSCode,
you can just cut it with the cursor.

43
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.196
You don't have to highlight it,
that's just the default behavior.

44
00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:39.987
Same thing for copy,
if you Ctrl+C on a line,

45
00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:43.423
it gets the whole line on
the clipboard and you move on, so

46
00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:46.600
you don't need to highlight and
then copy or paste.

47
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.660
There's also an easier way to
move things around in VSCode, and

48
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.130
that's to use the oOption key on the line.

49
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.660
So if you're on the line,
you can move lines around simply by

50
00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.620
holding down the Option key and pressing
up or down, and you can move lines around.

51
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.740
If you grab a chunk of lines like this,

52
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.590
then you can move them all around in one
block with the Option up and down arrow.

53
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.250
You will move that one a lot.

54
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.350
You'll use that one a lot,
you will move lines a lot.

55
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.280
Another thing that you'll do
is you'll duplicate lines,

56
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.690
and a lot of times we copy and
paste to do this.

57
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.090
You don't need to copy and
paste in VSCode to duplicate.

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.830
What you can do instead, is you can
use Option+Shift and press down or

59
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.960
up, and it would duplicate
whichever line you're on exactly.

60
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.110
So I can do down, or I can do up,
you can't tell the difference, but

61
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.400
it's duplicating them up and down.

62
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.450
Let's go ahead and pull this out.

63
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.520
You will duplicate lines a lot,
it's another thing you do a lot,

64
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.340
that's another keyboard shortcut that
you really, really need to know,

65
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.930
it makes your life a lot easier.

66
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.890
Another thing that you'll
do is you'll delete lines.

67
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.330
And again, a lot of times we need do that
we grab a line, highlight it, delete it.

68
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.225
Instead of doing that,
learn the keyboard shortcut, Cmd or

69
00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:14.450
Ctrl+Shift+K, that deletes lines.

70
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.214
Again, you're saving yourselves
keyboard strokes here by

71
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:21.459
not having to highlight lines and
then delete them or

72
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.567
put them on your clipboard in some other
fashion, Cmd+Shift+K is your friend.

73
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.353
So that's moving,
duplicating, and deleting,

74
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:31.800
memorize those keyboard shortcuts.

75
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.220
The next time you try to do that with
copy and paste or highlight and delete,

76
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.070
stop yourself, go back and
use the proper shortcut.

77
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.520
Let's scroll down here to the bottom and
take a look at this SVG element.

78
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.280
Now, I made this SVG element myself.

79
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.190
And the reason why you know that's the
case is because it's really, really ugly,

80
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.465
there's a lot of it.

81
00:04:54.465 --> 00:05:00.146
When I said I made myself,
what I did was I opened up Sketch,

82
00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:04.136
I made a light bulb,
and I saved it as SVG.

83
00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:07.958
So I've pasted that in here, and the
reason I've done that is it allows us to

84
00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.247
change the bulb color
with the application.

85
00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:13.790
So if I go to the app here,
it's currently broken, see this bulb?

86
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.540
This is the SVG by the way, and
then it puts the color at the bottom.

87
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.170
But because there's different elements
here, whenever I change the color,

88
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.930
I can actually change the color of
just this SVG circle up at the top,

89
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.620
because it has its own separate
element inside the HTML.

90
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.250
The problem with that is that
it makes this look really bad.

91
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.830
So this file is now way longer than it
needs to be and it's hard to look at.

92
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.850
So to make this easier on your eyes,
you can fold the code.

93
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.077
So if you come here on this line and
open the command palette with Cmd or

94
00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:54.170
Ctrl+Shift+P, and say fold,
and then just select fold.

95
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.040
And that will fold all of that SVG so
that you don't have to look at it anymore.

96
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.021
Now notice, I'll save this,
if we reload the window,

97
00:06:10.728 --> 00:06:12.931
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Still folded, okay?

98
00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:16.514
So folding persists however, if you
close the window completely, go out and

99
00:06:16.514 --> 00:06:20.265
then go to a different project and come
back, it will be expanded again, you'll

100
00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:24.150
have to fold it again but it's pretty good
about persisting through your session.

101
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.350
Folding works not just inside of HTML but

102
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.200
it also works inside
of code files as well.

103
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.718
So let's fold this back again.

104
00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:39.340
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So
let's go over to our app file here.

105
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.430
And let's say,
we wanted to fold this constructor here.

106
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.770
What we can do is come over to this side,

107
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.660
you might see these arrows here,
you can do it this way.

108
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.200
And you can also fold like this.

109
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.050
The other thing is there's
a keyboard shortcut,

110
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.860
I don't use this a lot cuz I
don't fold code too often.

111
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.150
Usually, I fold it and
then I forget about it, I don't unfold it.

112
00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:07.605
But it is Cmd, and then Option,
and then the bracket here,

113
00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:10.635
the left parentheses if you will.

114
00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:14.648
So we should be able to fold like that and
we can fold, and you see that VSCode

115
00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:19.015
recognizes it knows, so it can fold at
the method level, it knows how to do that.

116
00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:22.310
It can fold here at the constructor
level and knows how to do that.

117
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.640
So it recognizes the code structure and
can fold at the proper levels.

118
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the code have to
be formatted for it to recognize it?

119
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.040
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: No, it does not
have to be formatted for our eyes,

120
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.830
it does have to be correct.

121
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.230
So like if you got extra braces in all
over VSCode, it will know what to do.

122
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.560
You can also specify your
own foldable regions.

123
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.660
So you don't have to fold based on
the regions that VSCode specifies,

124
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.190
you can specify a region
that you wanna fold.

125
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.650
So let's say, what we want to do
here is we just want to fold and

126
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.110
hide all of the interior or
internal methods in this class.

127
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.470
To do that,
we have to use something called a regions.

128
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.083
If you have used Visual Studio
before your familiar with regions,

129
00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:10.353
this is a concept that makes sense to you.

130
00:08:10.353 --> 00:08:14.040
What we're gonna do here is come and
we're going to put a comment.

131
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.570
So I'm gonna put a comment here and

132
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.930
then I'm gonna do a hash tag,
hash tag, pound sign?

133
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.107
Hashtag.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Octothorpe.

134
00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:22.400
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: What is it?

135
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.026
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Octothorpe.

136
00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:25.353
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Octothorpe,
nobody knows what that is.

137
00:08:25.353 --> 00:08:26.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And

138
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.240
we're gonna say, region.

139
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.830
And then we're gonna give it a name.

140
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.787
So we'll just call this one, let's
just call this region, Class Methods.

141
00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:40.662
Let's come down to the bottom here,
right before the end of the class,

142
00:08:40.662 --> 00:08:42.459
and we'll do end region.

143
00:08:44.898 --> 00:08:48.529
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And if we come back
up here, out to the side, you can see,

144
00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.630
we've got an arrow now.

145
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.584
And I can collapse this, and now,
I've got a region that I defined,

146
00:08:55.584 --> 00:08:57.475
and I folded all the code.

147
00:08:57.475 --> 00:09:01.681
Even better, I can add a description
here to make this more descriptive for

148
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.373
people and
let them know why I folded this code.

149
00:09:04.373 --> 00:09:10.780
Now, interestingly enough,
this also works in HTML.

150
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.241
So you can add a comment here,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: I think it works

151
00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:21.913
in HTML, verbose svg, written by Burke.

152
00:09:21.913 --> 00:09:27.770
And then let's come down, here below that
the closing we should just fold this,

153
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.650
be a lot easier, wouldn't it?

154
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.230
Let's do that,
let's see here Cmd+Option, there we go.

155
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.232
And then below that, let's add a line,
and by the way, you can use the keyboard

156
00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:44.802
shortcut Cmd and then the slash,
is this a forward slash or a back slash?

157
00:09:44.802 --> 00:09:48.520
What's the one that goes this way?

158
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Forward.
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Forward slash, Cmd+/,

159
00:09:51.687 --> 00:09:55.240
Ctrl+/, adds a comment line automatically.

160
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.935
It will also comment outlines like this,

161
00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:02.328
your cursor can be anywhere in the line,
and it will come in and out.

162
00:10:02.328 --> 00:10:04.802
And then we can do endregion.

163
00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:12.190
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let's see here, hashtag,
octothorpe, sounds made up, endregion.

164
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.720
And then we can actually
fold it by region here.

165
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.148
So regions work inside of HTML and

166
00:10:17.148 --> 00:10:22.450
they also work in your JavaScript to
allow you to create custom regions.

167
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.013
All right, that's code folding, and if you
have somebody like me writing your SVG,

168
00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:29.242
you're definitely gonna wanna know
about code folding and region folding.
