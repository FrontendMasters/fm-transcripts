00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: The other
way to work with MongoDB

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.390
is with something called
MongoDB Scrapbooks.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.420
This is part of the Cosmos DB extension.

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.600
So I'm gonna Cmd+Shift+P and
then I'm just gonna look for

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.750
scrapbook, and choose New Mongo Scrapbook.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.983
And now I'm connected to lamp.

7
00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:27.202
If I type DB and
hit a dot it gives me and prompts me with

8
00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:33.030
all the things that I can do
from here with the MongoDB API.

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.070
It sees that I have a colors collection so

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850
it puts that at the top
collections are at the top.

11
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.770
So I'm gonna choose colors, and
then we can run a find command.

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.190
If you're not familiar with MongoDB,
it's okay.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.830
It's just a different API for
getting data out of the database.

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.810
So I'm gonna hit dot,
and then we can do find.

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.040
See, these are all the different
things we can do on this instance.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.360
I'm gonna say find and then like this,

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230
this is all you have to do to
retrieve records for MongoDB.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.710
Then we wanna execute this.

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.230
So we can do execute here like this.

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.740
And then here's all of
our records on this side.

21
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.590
The other option is to do Command Shift
and then the double quotes button.

22
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.500
And that is the keyboard shortcut for
the same thing.

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.290
Now, if we come to this side over here and
we change this, and

24
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.734
click Save, what happens?

25
00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:29.150
We've changed again
directly from the editor.

26
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.790
So you can see here that you can query and
alter your data directly from VS Code.

27
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.860
You don't need to drop down into
the Mongo shell to do that, and

28
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.750
you don't need another
tool to do it either.

29
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.870
Now in this same container
where I've given you MongoDB,

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.070
I've also given you
something called SQL Lite.

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.640
If you're not familiar with SQL light,

32
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.440
it is a file based database
that supports SQL.

33
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.400
And it's frequently used
in mobile applications.

34
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.030
So a lot of the mobile apps that you
have on iOS and Android use SQL light.

35
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.580
It's a very, very good alternative.

36
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.770
If you want to have a lightweight
file based database.
