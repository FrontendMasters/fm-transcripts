00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.580
Today we're gonna be talking about
the complete intro to Real time.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.379
So that we're gonna be talking about
like Websockets, Polling, HTTP/2 PUSH,

3
00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.750
a lot of other really fun stuff that
I'm really excited to get started on.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.708
What you see in front of you on your
screen right now is the course website.

5
00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.050
Just go ahead and hop over there.

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.586
I actually have a link here for you,
you can just type, bit.ly/intro-realtime.

7
00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:29.838
Make that a bit bigger for
you so you can see it.

8
00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:31.284
This one right here.

9
00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:36.394
You can also just type this in, but
this just seems hard to type that much.

10
00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:40.007
And that should take you to
this lovely website here.

11
00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:45.064
So just you know,
these are my actual teaching notes.

12
00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.057
That's what I have here on this laptop.

13
00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:48.318
What I'm glancing over there,

14
00:00:48.318 --> 00:00:50.517
I'm literally just looking
at the same website as you.

15
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.861
So if you feel like you get behind or
you want to go review something or

16
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:57.796
you want to share something with your
colleague at work or something like that,

17
00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:58.870
go ahead and do that.

18
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.280
This is all open source and available and
so, because it's open source,

19
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.207
if you see any spelling mistakes,
please open a pull request.

20
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.472
So without getting much more into it, the
one thing I noticed during these videos,

21
00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:13.898
I'll be in various
different sections of this.

22
00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:16.118
That's what this thing
up here at the top is.

23
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:19.359
So you can see the name of the section and
the name of the chapter that we're in.

24
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.285
So we're in the introduction, right.

25
00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:24.086
So you can kind of see where
I am at all times as well.

26
00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:27.397
So let's go ahead and
get into the introduction here.

27
00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:33.516
So we're gonna be talking about real
time today, and when I say real time,

28
00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:36.333
what I just mean,
is you have some sort of server state and

29
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:40.000
some sort of client state, and
you want them to be the same, right?

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.329
Whether that's, a chat client,
which is what we're gonna be doing today,

31
00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.830
sending messages back and forth.

32
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.260
And if I send a message,
I want everyone to see it, right?

33
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.769
So that'd be me sending
a message to the server and

34
00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:51.630
then the server broadcasting that.

35
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.780
That could be like the status of
your order on DoorDash, right?

36
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.363
You wanna be able to see,
at what point are they so

37
00:01:57.363 --> 00:02:00.140
a lot of like GPS mapping
stuff applies here.

38
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
Just anything that needs to happen
faster than every couple of seconds.

39
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.181
You want it be kind of happening
as things are updating here.

40
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:13.370
We're gonna start from like
the lowest level abstraction.

41
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.447
If you've watched any
of my courses before,

42
00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:19.291
you're kind of used to me taking this
approach, this first principles approach.

43
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.497
We're gonna be building
Polling by hands or

44
00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:24.250
we're gonna actually just
be doing a lot of requests.

45
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.130
Then we're gonna, move up the stack
here and try HTTP/2 PUSH,

46
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.514
and eventually WebSockets and Socket.IO.

47
00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:37.380
So yeah, that's kind of the gist of
what you're gonna be learning today.

48
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.695
It's a lot of really fun stuff,

49
00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:41.958
we'll be learning a lot of low level stuff
that you actually want to do when you go

50
00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.590
back to your day job or
whatever cool projects you're working on.

51
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.500
However, they will teach you
how to be better programmers.

52
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.870
They'll teach you how to use
your abstractions better.

53
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.838
Yeah, I find these things super
useful to know like the lower level

54
00:02:56.838 --> 00:03:00.930
principles that I can build
better things on top of it.

55
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.570
So who are you,
if you're watching this course?

56
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.176
Hopefully, you know JavaScript, that's
kind of my base level requirement here is

57
00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:09.960
that you have some JavaScript knowledge.

58
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.882
If you don't feel comfortable with that,
yeah,

59
00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:16.153
you can take this course next but
you should just go in and

60
00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:21.040
check out the Boot Camp from Frontend
Masters, they'll definitely help you out.

61
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.350
There's also an Intro to Web Dev v2,
both of which I helped to teach.

62
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.700
If this is your first exposure to Node.js,
this might have some questions for you.

63
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.085
There's a course on Frontend Masters
from Scott Moss that's really awesome

64
00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:36.820
on that as well.

65
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.080
One more I didn't call out on here.

66
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.164
If this is your first
exposure to the command line,

67
00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:44.690
there's a couple portions that
might be a little odd for you.

68
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.770
And there's a course that I taught
on the command line as well.

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.340
But that was probably less required.

70
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.780
So yeah,
lots of good stuff on Frontend Masters.

71
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.110
It all kind of builds up to
into one complete picture.

72
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.520
Who am I?

73
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.402
I'm Brian.

74
00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:06.491
I hope we've established that by now,
I might say it a couple more times.

75
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:11.209
[LAUGH] I'm the product manager
of developer products at Stripe.

76
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.795
Which means that if you ever need
something or payment processing kind of

77
00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:18.290
stuff and you need tools to do that,
that's the stuff I do.

78
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.040
So I manage the VS code extension,
I manage the command line.

79
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.440
A bunch of other stuff too.

80
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.717
Previously, I've been at Reddit,
Netflix, LinkedIn, Microsoft,

81
00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:32.270
I've done a lot of these things
actually out in production.

82
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.361
So I'm not just making things up, right?

83
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.654
These are actually the things that I've
learned during my time at these various

84
00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:39.944
different companies.

85
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.355
In particular at Reddit and Netflix,
I actually did a lot of real time.

86
00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:48.369
We did real time chat at Reddit, and a lot
of these things that I'm teaching here,

87
00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:50.045
I actually learned back
when I was at Reddit.

88
00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:53.875
Currently in Seattle.

89
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:58.961
I have a very cute dog, that I have
a very large picture of her up here.

90
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.359
And feel free to catch up
with me on social media.

91
00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:05.296
I had to put my links in here,
I'm very bad at responding to DMs.

92
00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:11.712
But yeah, if you see something amiss with
the course please just open an issue here.

93
00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:14.793
I left a link here so you can just go,
you can either just leave an issue open

94
00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.680
a pull request, that's always,
super helpful to me.

95
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.430
&gt;&gt; So I don't need to know about
Express and writing API's and

96
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.640
node, to learn the Realtime aspects or
are you doing API's?

97
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.832
&gt;&gt; That's a valid question.

98
00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:32.859
Do you need to know API's to
follow this course very well?

99
00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:35.880
It will definitely help for sure.

100
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.940
I think you would be
fine not having done it.

101
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.520
That being said, these things go together.

102
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.104
So, if you're gonna take this course, you
should probably immediately take the API

103
00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:49.460
one from Scott on here as well, cuz
they're just gonna go together super well.
