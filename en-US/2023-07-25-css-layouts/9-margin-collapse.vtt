00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.239
All right, now,
our space between our images is

2
00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:09.931
pretty good,
right here in this section of it.

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.355
But maybe we'd like to have a little bit
more space in between our tour dates and

4
00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.120
this first image.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.149
So, the last thing that we can add here,
and we can just add it right here,

6
00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.866
still inside of our base styling is for
main.

7
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:30.670
And I'm gonna set that to
a margin-bottom of 4rem.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.366
That sounds like a lot.

9
00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:38.755
But that space there, here it is.

10
00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.970
Now, let me ask you this.

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.810
We know that on the top of those images,
we added 2 rems of space, right?

12
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.942
And on the bottom of main,
we added 4 rems of space.

13
00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:56.224
What is the distance
between the words Colkirk,

14
00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:59.783
Washington, and the top of that image?

15
00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:01.883
&gt;&gt; Six rem.

16
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:04.464
&gt;&gt; Four rem.

17
00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.093
&gt;&gt; I hear six and I hear four.

18
00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:07.716
The answer is four.

19
00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:10.283
Yeah, two plus four equals four.

20
00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:14.840
The reason why is that vertical margin,
not horizontal,

21
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.030
vertical margin collapses and
the larger size wins.

22
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.950
So if you have four and
two, it collapses to four.

23
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.330
If you have two and two,
it collapses to two, okay?

24
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.879
Something else they don't
tell you in boot camp.

25
00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:35.771
[LAUGH] Vertical margins collapse,
all right?

26
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:38.740
So that is something to
keep in mind as well.

27
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.270
&gt;&gt; Is it similar with padding too, or?

28
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.780
&gt;&gt; Padding is always additive.

29
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.423
&gt;&gt; Okay.

30
00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:46.248
&gt;&gt; So only the margins collapse,
padding does not.

31
00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:48.516
Why does margin collapse?

32
00:01:53.626 --> 00:02:02.034
Okay, so let's have a paragraph, oops.

33
00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:11.940
Arial, font-size 2rem.

34
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.498
Okay, so here's a paragraph, right?

35
00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:19.531
Yay, super exciting

36
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:25.677
Here's the second paragraph.

37
00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:27.514
Here's the third paragraph.

38
00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.884
Okay, and
they all look evenly spaced, right?

39
00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:34.967
We have even spacing
from the top of the page,

40
00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:38.549
even spacing in between these paragraphs,
right?

41
00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.996
In my CSS, let's put in our paragraph and

42
00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:51.760
let's make the background-color yellow,
okay?

43
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.294
So you see we have white space in
between each of these paragraphs, okay?

44
00:02:56.294 --> 00:02:58.470
Where is this coming from?

45
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.990
What is that white space?

46
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.985
Why isn't this one solid wall of yellow?

47
00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:04.714
&gt;&gt; Default formatting of p.

48
00:03:04.714 --> 00:03:07.155
&gt;&gt; The default formatting of p,
which is what?

49
00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:09.870
&gt;&gt; Margin top and bottom.

50
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.290
&gt;&gt; Margin on the top and
the bottom is one rem, okay?

51
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.810
Margin top and bottom is one rem, or one.

52
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.530
In this case,
they're the same thing, okay?

53
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.890
So that's what's going on here.

54
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.909
So if I said margin 0, then our
paragraphs all merge together, right?

55
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.023
Okay, so let's say padding is 1rem.

56
00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:40.056
Let's see, top and bottom, 1rem 0.

57
00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:46.164
So I've just added 1rem of padding
to the top and the bottom.

58
00:03:46.164 --> 00:03:49.660
Anybody wanna make a comment on that?

59
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.003
How does the spacing look?

60
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:52.058
The yellow should help you.

61
00:03:56.418 --> 00:04:03.877
&gt;&gt; There is two rem between each,
like, I don't know how to explain it.

62
00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:05.654
&gt;&gt; Yeah, two rem.

63
00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:07.949
Right, there's two rem in
between each paragraph.

64
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.277
What about up here?

65
00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:10.772
&gt;&gt; One.

66
00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:12.610
&gt;&gt; 1rem, yeah?

67
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.310
Okay, so now all the designers
are very upset, okay?

68
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.560
So it's better if we have our
margin set to 1rem 0, right?

69
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.710
Which it is by default.

70
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.221
Because now we have one rem of margin and
one rem of margin,

71
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:33.850
they collapse to one rem, right?

72
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.388
And we wind up with even spacing for

73
00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:37.522
all of the paragraphs that
are here on the page.

74
00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:39.360
Makes sense?

75
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.100
So in this case,
margins collapsing is a great thing.

76
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.377
This is absolutely
something we wanna do for

77
00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:48.600
a series of paragraphs here to get
the same spacing between them.

78
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.967
So use padding or margin because
margins collapse horizontally.

79
00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.053
Depends on what you're going for.

80
00:04:56.053 --> 00:04:57.328
So we have choices.

81
00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:00.300
Make sense?

82
00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.833
More things they don't teach
you in boot camp, right?
