1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.892
All right, so
we've got our buttons styled.

2
00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:05.640
Now we need to style our tour text.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.024
So our tour text looks like this.

4
00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:12.594
So it's got this curly Q kinda
thing going on here for the date.

5
00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:15.147
That's the Pacifico font.

6
00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:19.359
It's got the serif font here for The IVY.

7
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.299
And it's got a sans serif font here for
Oakheart, California.

8
00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:28.200
And we can do this without
actually changing our HTML.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.712
How cool is that?

10
00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:35.416
So, how are we going to
go about doing this?

11
00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:38.202
Anybody have any ideas?

12
00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.808
Maybe the first thing
we should do is this.

13
00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:46.264
Let us notice,
we're in the main element here.

14
00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:51.011
We have a paragraph, we have a span class
of date, and we have a span class of club.

15
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:55.123
So maybe we should style date and club
first, cuz those are easy ones, right?

16
00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:02.410
Okay, so what should I do here for date?

17
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.706
&gt;&gt; font-family: var(--cursive).

18
00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:08.096
&gt;&gt; family: var(--cursive).

19
00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:15.182
And for the club, is there anything
we need to do for the club?

20
00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:17.475
No, we're good.

21
00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:22.373
Okay, so there are ways that
we can style the Oakheart,

22
00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:26.647
California part of this here,
the actual city,

23
00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:29.892
that should be in the san serif font.

24
00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:33.043
And because people ask for
wild and wonderful selectors,

25
00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:36.459
I'm gonna show you my favorite
way of doing this first, okay?

26
00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:43.347
So if we look at, pull up just that much
HTML here, here is one thing we could do.

27
00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:48.364
We could say our paragraph,

28
00:01:48.364 --> 00:01:51.503
has(.club).

29
00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:54.198
Anybody seen this has selector before?

30
00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:58.959
This is the selector that goes and
looks at parents.

31
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.722
So here we're saying if the paragraph
has a club class in it,

32
00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:09.581
then the font family should be sans serif,
sorry,

33
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.529
var(--sans-serif;).

34
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.592
Did that work?

35
00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:22.447
I might have to move this up.

36
00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.264
I think I actually have to move this up.

37
00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:28.051
I have to move this up here first.

38
00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:31.388
That worked.

39
00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:33.205
No, that didn't work either.

40
00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:37.611
Maybe it's because I put
the serif on the body.

41
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:39.686
Maybe that's why it's
not working right now.

42
00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:41.780
But this is one possible
way of doing this.

43
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.278
We could make this selector
a little bit more specific.

44
00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:48.320
But basically, we're saying if
the paragraph has a class of club in it,

45
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.655
we can change the font to be sans-serif.

46
00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:55.931
Another way to do this would be,
we could say main p, cool.

47
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:58.071
I made a mistake somewhere there,
here it is.

48
00:02:58.071 --> 00:02:59.981
[LAUGH] Nobody found it.

49
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:02.257
I put a semicolon inside
of my parenthesis.

50
00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:04.480
There we go.

51
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.242
All right, so let's try that again,
p: has(.club).

52
00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:15.731
Okay, great.

53
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:20.600
So if the paragraph has a class of
club inside of it, make it san-serif.

54
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.948
So we're making the paragraph san-serif.

55
00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:27.896
And then what we would do is
we would change club to add

56
00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:31.499
font-family: var(--sarif).

57
00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:39.555
So now, we have our three
font families going on here.

58
00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:40.642
Make sense?

59
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.021
&gt;&gt; p:has is not working for me,
it's not changing anything.

60
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.662
&gt;&gt; What browser are you using?

61
00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:48.381
&gt;&gt; Firefox?

62
00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:52.442
&gt;&gt; That's the reason why [LAUGH].

63
00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:55.562
Yeah, hopefully has will be
supported by Firefox soon, but

64
00:03:55.562 --> 00:03:58.673
unfortunately it's not
supported by Firefox yet.

65
00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:00.619
I know, it's so sad.

66
00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.140
Yeah, so not really something you
would wanna do in production,

67
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.901
but we are excited about
has coming to the browser.

68
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:12.131
So we're still waiting on Firefox, okay.

69
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:13.923
Any other questions on this?

70
00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:16.034
We've got our font styled.

71
00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:19.354
And the last part of this
is getting this set up so

72
00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:24.343
that we have our tour date on one side and
we have our button on the other.

73
00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:26.111
You have an idea of how to do that?

74
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.419
&gt;&gt; I had a question before that.

75
00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.083
&gt;&gt; Sure.

76
00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:30.985
&gt;&gt; So you said you wouldn't
wanna do has for production.

77
00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:32.475
So would you wanna do the main p?

78
00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:34.101
&gt;&gt; You could do the main p, yeah.

79
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:40.433
So if we did main, which is less cool,
but it works, [LAUGH] main p.

80
00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:42.944
I think absolutely nothing will change.

81
00:04:42.944 --> 00:04:44.278
Except, our buttons change.

82
00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:46.401
So you'll add a serif to the buttons.

83
00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:46.932
&gt;&gt; Cool.

84
00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:51.979
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so p:has(.club) here

85
00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.850
would leave the buttons alone.
