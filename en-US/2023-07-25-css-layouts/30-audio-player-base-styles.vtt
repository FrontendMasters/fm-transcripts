WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.542
Okay, so that's our first part here.

2
00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:06.515
We've evaluated this,
we've modified our HTML.

3
00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:11.215
So the next thing that I like to do
is I like to simplify the CSS and

4
00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:16.186
add our standard styles,
because of course, the person who built

5
00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:21.092
this audio player wrote a lot of
CSS that we actually don't need.

6
00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:22.362
True?

7
00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:25.396
So tell me, what do we not need?

8
00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:30.041
&gt;&gt; The border.

9
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:30.655
&gt;&gt; Pardon?

10
00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:31.626
&gt;&gt; The border.

11
00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:35.523
&gt;&gt; The border,
we definitely don't need the border.

12
00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.780
What else don't we need?

13
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.788
&gt;&gt; The button styles.

14
00:00:39.788 --> 00:00:42.805
&gt;&gt; Some of these button styles,
we definitely don't need those.

15
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:47.278
During just sort of scroll through here.

16
00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:50.312
If you're not sure about it,
you can leave it, right?

17
00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:52.324
But some of this stuff,
we can definitely delete.

18
00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:56.944
So for example, body,
we already have a body style, right?

19
00:00:56.944 --> 00:01:01.212
It's coming from our base,
so we can delete that.

20
00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:04.792
If you're scared, just comment it out.

21
00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:10.063
There's nothing wrong with that, okay?

22
00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:13.471
Button styling,
I'm gonna leave that for now.

23
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.649
We may come back to that.

24
00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.708
But there's a paragraph down here,
we definitely don't need that.

25
00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:25.677
Okay, and it's gonna start falling apart.

26
00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:28.598
Don't panic, don't panic, never panic.

27
00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:34.731
Okay, and the other thing that we're
going to need now is our base styles.

28
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.711
So the base styles that we've been
building all along with magenta lime,

29
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:40.841
let's go grab those and bring them in.

30
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:45.501
So if we take a look at
our ending CodePen here,

31
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:49.933
I'm just gonna open
that up in another tab.

32
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:56.036
And what we wanna copy from this
is just the base styles here.

33
00:01:56.036 --> 00:02:03.317
Copy that, and drop that on into our
audio file right up here at the top.

34
00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:07.257
So that it will play a lot of styling
to this page immediately, right?

35
00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:11.653
Because that's how we wrote all that
flexible CSS to just apply to stuff.

36
00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:14.184
Look how much work that
already just saved us.

37
00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:16.041
Amazing, isn't it?

38
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:21.382
Okay, as for the rest of these styles,
we can set up a layer.

39
00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:26.899
I'm gonna call it audio,
because that's what it is.

40
00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.978
And we'll wrap that layer around
everything else that's here to keep our

41
00:02:30.978 --> 00:02:32.111
styles organized.

42
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:39.347
So let's make a few modifications
here to some of these styles now, and

43
00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:44.515
we'll start with the, Button here.

44
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:47.504
We're gonna delete the width and
the height and this float left.

45
00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:50.575
We don't do floats really
with layouts anymore.

46
00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:52.929
[LAUGH] Just get rid of the width,
the height, and

47
00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.600
the float down here on the bottom.

48
00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.389
That's gonna make those a little
bit bigger, but that's okay.

49
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.364
We'll deal with that in a little while.

50
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.277
Now, take a look at the audio player
container that's here and the before.

51
00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:15.642
So one of the things that
you'll see going on here,

52
00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:18.157
here's a background color of white.

53
00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:21.576
Yeah, we definitely don't want that,
so let's get rid of that.

54
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:26.316
Now, we have a cool rainbow.

55
00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:30.487
So awesome, but so
not what we want, right?

56
00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:32.373
Where is that?

57
00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:33.406
&gt;&gt; Linear gradient.

58
00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:35.397
&gt;&gt; That's this linear
gradient thing going on?

59
00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.315
Yeah, so we get rid of that.

60
00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:42.775
Hey, not so bad?

61
00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:45.192
Not so bad, getting better and better.

62
00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:47.810
So let's leave the rest of this just for
the moment.

63
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.114
One of the things you might notice that
we have right now is the font, right?

64
00:03:52.114 --> 00:03:53.847
The font is totally wrong.

65
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:54.899
Why is that?

66
00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:56.076
Anybody have a guess?

67
00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:04.535
We put in our base styles,
we've called for those fonts, right?

68
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:07.042
What might be missing?

69
00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:08.406
&gt;&gt; A variable.

70
00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:11.247
&gt;&gt; We've got the variable,
we've got the variable.

71
00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:13.605
It's right here in the base, yeah?

72
00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:16.767
So we've called for it.

73
00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:21.600
We should at least see the default
body font here, but that's not it.

74
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.503
What's going on?

75
00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:29.177
&gt;&gt; Do we need to go to the Settings &gt; CSS,
and then [INAUDIBLE].

76
00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:32.024
&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, the settings, right?

77
00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:34.401
We have to actually link to those files.

78
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:42.508
So if you go into your Audio player here&gt;
go into Settings&gt; we'll go into CSS,

79
00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:48.080
there's a long URL right here,
we can just copy that.

80
00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:55.663
And we can paste that into
our Audio player under CSS,

81
00:04:58.223 --> 00:05:00.670
Under External Stylesheets.

82
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.493
Here we go.

83
00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:06.244
Okay, getting closer, okay?

84
00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:11.386
So now, let's go on and start writing
some more styles that we've got here.

85
00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:15.826
We can continue to modify these styles
as we go with whatever it is that we

86
00:05:15.826 --> 00:05:16.943
wanna have here.

87
00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:20.248
But for now,
let's just continue to modify this.

88
00:05:20.248 --> 00:05:25.175
So what we wanna do is,
if we take a look at our HTML again,

89
00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:30.926
we need to set up our grid such that
we've got the name of the track,

90
00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:35.688
the button, and the Track 7,
right, all on one row.

91
00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:42.204
And we said we wanted to put the player
and the volume all on one row.

92
00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:47.680
So let's take a look at that and see
if we can make that kinda stuff happen.

93
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.217
So what would be my selector for this?

94
00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:56.979
I'm gonna set our styling.

95
00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.919
Let's put it here at
the top of the audio file.

96
00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.081
So what's my selector for this?

97
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:06.170
&gt;&gt; Name-play?

98
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.777
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so my class of name-play.

99
00:06:08.777 --> 00:06:13.193
So what I might do here is say

100
00:06:13.193 --> 00:06:20.499
audio-player-container.name-play.

101
00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:28.922
And we can set this up
to display as a grid.

102
00:06:34.548 --> 00:06:38.703
We, very big, okay?

103
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:43.734
Then we wanna have some grid
template columns, right?

104
00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:50.376
Grid-template-columns, now do
we want those all the same size?

105
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:53.220
1fr 1fr 1fr,

106
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:01.622
Anybody have any opinions?

107
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:06.584
&gt;&gt; We want the play area to take up 2fr,
and then maybe 1fr and

108
00:07:06.584 --> 00:07:08.583
1fr on the other side.

109
00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:09.337
&gt;&gt; We could do it.

110
00:07:09.337 --> 00:07:11.755
That would make a very
big fat play button, and

111
00:07:11.755 --> 00:07:14.494
we'd have little skinny text on the sides,
right?

112
00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:19.223
We actually want bigger text and
smaller button, right?

113
00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:23.803
Yeah, so what if we did
instead something like 2fr and

114
00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:28.582
2fr, that'll sort of squeeze
it down a little bit, and

115
00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:34.177
then maybe even we can squeeze
it down even further as 0.75 fr.

116
00:07:37.683 --> 00:07:44.674
Okay, That's

117
00:07:44.674 --> 00:07:48.094
a reasonable first pass at this.

118
00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.948
And then we could say something like,

119
00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:56.532
we could give it a little bit of a gap,
1rem.

120
00:07:56.532 --> 00:08:03.173
We could give it a little margin, 1rem.

121
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.439
Okay, so we're sort of getting
things in the right spots.

122
00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:10.988
These aren't completely styled yet.

123
00:08:10.988 --> 00:08:19.583
One other thing we could add here would
be a font-family: var(---cursive).

124
00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.529
Okay, that's cool.

125
00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:36.099
Okay, easier than you thought, right?

126
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.084
Okay, so how about the rest of this?

127
00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.144
Now, we have controls down here.

128
00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:44.504
Yeah, we need to get our play slider and
our volume next to each other.

129
00:08:44.504 --> 00:08:47.089
So what would be our selectors for that?

130
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.476
&gt;&gt; Controls.

131
00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:58.436
&gt;&gt; .controls, okay?

132
00:08:58.436 --> 00:09:01.125
Good, and
what are we gonna put in here for that?

133
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:02.920
Should we use grid again?

134
00:09:05.418 --> 00:09:06.826
Sure, why not?

135
00:09:06.826 --> 00:09:09.417
Do we want those even?

136
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:10.085
&gt;&gt; No.

137
00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:11.870
&gt;&gt; Probably not, right?

138
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.518
Probably want this one
bigger than that one?

139
00:09:14.518 --> 00:09:18.454
Maybe two-thirds, one-third, yeah?

140
00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:27.179
Okay, so our grid-template-columns
will be something like 2fr, 1fr.

141
00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:35.065
Okay, Well, those look a little bit funky.

142
00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:37.666
What's going on here,
why does it look a little bit funky?

143
00:09:41.798 --> 00:09:42.902
&gt;&gt; They're not aligned.

144
00:09:42.902 --> 00:09:46.254
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're not in line, why is that?

145
00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:50.943
&gt;&gt; Looks like the volume sliders
sitting on top of the Mute button.

146
00:09:50.943 --> 00:09:54.474
&gt;&gt; It does, yeah, so
we have this big 0 margin going on here.

147
00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:58.695
Maybe there's something with that,
we could try taking that out.

148
00:09:58.695 --> 00:09:59.863
See if that helps.

149
00:09:59.863 --> 00:10:03.911
Could be that my window
isn't big enough yet.

150
00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:08.611
Maybe not, and
we can just keep on going for the moment,

151
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.525
because we'll have some
more tweaking to do.

152
00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:17.900
So sometimes, the stuff doesn't present
itself to be obvious from the beginning.

153
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.162
But generally speaking, we're trying to
hack this to get things into the right

154
00:10:22.162 --> 00:10:26.184
spots broadly speaking, and then we'll
clean it up and make it prettier.

155
00:10:26.184 --> 00:10:30.890
Okay, so we've got that our
controls sort of generally next

156
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.776
to each other now with the volume itself,
right?

157
00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:37.115
We actually have three
children on that volume.

158
00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:40.986
We have an output, we have an input,
and we have a button, okay?

159
00:10:40.986 --> 00:10:42.717
So that's what's going on over here.

160
00:10:42.717 --> 00:10:45.173
That's why this isn't quite lining up.

161
00:10:45.173 --> 00:10:50.449
So maybe we need to add another
layer here of displaying grid.

162
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:55.409
So after our controls here,

163
00:10:55.409 --> 00:11:04.302
let's add audio-player-container .volume.

164
00:11:04.302 --> 00:11:09.394
We'll lay that as grid too.

165
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:22.688
And we can say our grid-template-columns

166
00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:28.421
are 0.15fr 1fr 0.15.

167
00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:39.197
That made it really tiny, okay?

168
00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:45.218
So now, we have our number, we have our
slider, we have our volume down over here.

169
00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:48.924
And back here on our controls,
let's add a couple more things.

170
00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:52.791
Let's add a gap of 1rem, and

171
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:56.668
let's add a margin of 1rem.

172
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:10.535
Now, for our volume, These things
aren't quite all on the same line.

173
00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:12.913
We'd probably like them
to be on the same line.

174
00:12:12.913 --> 00:12:16.978
Anybody have any idea how I could get them
to be all kind of all on the same line?

175
00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:20.457
&gt;&gt; Align content.

176
00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:24.345
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
we've got a couple of properties here.

177
00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:31.198
We've got justify-content: center; and
we've got aligne-items.

178
00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:40.495
Center, and that's gonna help bring
this into a straight line, right?

179
00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:44.903
Once it's there, now we can play
around with the volume size.

180
00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:48.958
We're gonna get there even though
it's ridiculously tiny right now.

181
00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.520
I totally see that.

182
00:12:55.563 --> 00:12:58.152
Then let's do the same thing for
our play slider.

183
00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:01.839
So we've got the volume there,
we've got the play-slider next to it.

184
00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:05.973
Let's do that exact same kind of
thing here for this play-slider.

185
00:13:05.973 --> 00:13:15.608
So our audio-player-container
.play-slider.

186
00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:19.965
So this is here in our HTML,
we have our time,

187
00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:24.562
our slider, and
the other time on the end of it.

188
00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:28.121
Let's use grid to bring that
all into the same line as well.

189
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:35.668
And to do that, we're gonna display, grid,

190
00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:42.161
grid-template-columns: 0.5fr 1fr 0.5fr,

191
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:48.525
and we'll do the same thing again for
the same reason.

192
00:13:48.525 --> 00:13:53.897
We'll justify-content: center; and
we'll align,

193
00:13:55.597 --> 00:14:01.056
-items: center; to bring
everything into line.

194
00:14:01.056 --> 00:14:03.490
See how much nicer that all looks?

195
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.421
We're getting closer, and closer,
and closer to a good layout.

196
00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:11.040
We have just gone through here and
put grids inside of grids inside of grids,

197
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.916
haven't we?

198
00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:13.244
To get everything to lay out.

199
00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:14.528
So that's totally legal.

200
00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:17.889
You can put grids inside
of grids all day long.

201
00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:19.917
So just try to think of that.

202
00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:21.982
Everywhere you go inside of your HTML,

203
00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:24.931
we need these things to group
together in the same line.

204
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:27.785
So we'll group them together, and
we'll lay that out with a grid.

205
00:14:27.785 --> 00:14:29.217
Now, that group of things and

206
00:14:29.217 --> 00:14:32.208
that group of things have to lay
out together in the same line.

207
00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:34.647
So we lay that out with grid, make sense?

208
00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:37.576
We just keep going until
we run out of elements.

209
00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.560
[LAUGH] Laying everything out.
