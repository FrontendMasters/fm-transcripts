1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.720
All right,
we are moving on to the next chapter.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.400
Chapter 3,
we're going on to our easy design.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.100
So, we are going to start here
with our beginning CodePen.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.367
I'm gonna open that on up in another tab,
fork it to your account,

5
00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:17.310
get your windows all set and ready to go.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.250
So as a reminder, these are the designs
that we are going to be putting together.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.130
So here's the tablet dimension,
the desktop dimension and

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.500
then down here underneath
here is the mobile dimension.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.070
Now which one of these
should we start with?

10
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.900
Three different designs
within one code base.

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.692
Which one do we start with?

12
00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:40.072
&gt;&gt; Mobile.
&gt;&gt; Mobile, why?

13
00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:48.020
Because mobile first,
it's kind of in the name, right?

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.440
Mobile first,
we start with our mobile design.

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.321
The original thinking on this was we start
with mobile because that is the smallest

16
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.090
screen we have to work with.

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.326
It is the least amount of information.

18
00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.966
It is only the necessary things
should be there on mobile, and

19
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:08.596
then as we get more screen real estate,
we can spread out our elements, okay?

20
00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:12.490
So mobile first is often the way
that we go about doing this.

21
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.061
You do it in the UX world in
terms of planning your content,

22
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.200
planning your images,
planning exactly what will be there.

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.644
In the code world, we do it from the
perspective of writing media queries and

24
00:01:22.644 --> 00:01:25.080
such, writing our code.

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490
Okay, so we're going to start
with this mobile design.

26
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.630
Now, we have lots of ways that we
could start HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.047
Which one are we going to start with?

28
00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.277
&gt;&gt; HTML.

29
00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:41.089
&gt;&gt; HTML, why?

30
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.770
&gt;&gt; Because without HTML,
you've got nothing else.

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.080
&gt;&gt; Fairly said, without HTML,
you've got nothing else.

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.440
It is everything on your webpage.

33
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.870
You can have a web page that is just HTML.

34
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.620
That is not true of CSS,
that is not true of JavaScript.

35
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.980
You've gotta have some HTML.

36
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.060
So the first thing that we do is
we mark this up as best we can.

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.781
We try to fold in our semantics.

38
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:11.019
We try to get things in the right order
then we'll go on to style it, makes sense?

39
00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.768
Fabulous, okay, so we're going
to start by marking up the HTML.

40
00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:19.816
So we have an opening header.

41
00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:21.055
We have an opening image.

42
00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:22.705
We have a tour list.

43
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.287
We have images and reviews.

44
00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:26.093
And we have a footer.

45
00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:30.619
And I have a whole bunch of
different CodePen links here that

46
00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.526
you're gonna refer to.

47
00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:36.960
One of the things about CodePen as you as
you all know, you have a free account.

48
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.819
But if you want to include images,
you have to pay for your account.

49
00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.350
No worries, I have paid for the account.

50
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.010
So if you use these URLs, you can get
the images in your CodePen, okay?

51
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.181
So no need to worry about that.

52
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:53.994
And let's go ahead and get started.

53
00:02:53.994 --> 00:02:58.570
So if you open up our opening CodePen
here, fork it to your account.

54
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.530
The first thing that we wanna do here
inside of our web page to get started.

55
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.820
Anybody have a suggestion for
how we can start this?

56
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.659
The body element is never
shown inside of the CodePen.

57
00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.440
It is there.

58
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.330
It is present.

59
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.070
It's understood to be there.

60
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.010
So we're past the body element.

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.652
How might we start our web page?

62
00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:19.110
&gt;&gt; h1.

63
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.070
&gt;&gt; Probably there's an h1
in there somewhere, right?

64
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.380
We can also start it with our wrapper,
right.

65
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.490
So let's start it with a div
with a class of wrapper.

66
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.330
Always a great way to start a web page.

67
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.960
So that is going to put a wrapper
around our entire page.

68
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.082
Inside of that we're gonna
put all of our content.

69
00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:42.420
Nothing will show up here on the screen.

70
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.290
And there's no CSS at this point.

71
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:54.290
Okay, so we know by looking
at our design we have what?

72
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.563
What's the next thing on the page?

73
00:03:56.563 --> 00:03:57.546
&gt;&gt; Logo.

74
00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:58.400
&gt;&gt; A logo.

75
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.500
So we need to add a logo to the page,
right?

76
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.010
What would that logo be
contained in in terms of HTML?

77
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.150
&gt;&gt; Header.

78
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.960
&gt;&gt; A header element, right?

79
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.160
We have a header element.

80
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.790
Let's use it, header / header.

81
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.150
Inside of that,
we are going to put our logo.

82
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.956
And that will be, we go back and
look at our web page.

83
00:04:23.956 --> 00:04:29.540
We do have a URL here for our logo.

84
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.900
So let's just copy that URL.

85
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.880
Okay, and I think it might actually
be in your comments as well here.

86
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.420
I could have just referred to that.

87
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.050
It's right up here with the alt tag,
and the image tag, and

88
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.830
everything right here at the top
[LAUGH] of your CodePen.

89
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.280
There it is, that's what we want.

90
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.272
So we can grab that and let's copy that
and paste it here into your header.

91
00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:02.766
Wow, look at that,
we finally have something fun.

92
00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:07.130
It's a little bit big, why is it big?

93
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.950
&gt;&gt; That's the size of the image.

94
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.840
&gt;&gt; It could be the size of the image,
absolutely, but this is an SVG.

95
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.708
So SVGs can take on any size.

96
00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:19.933
Where does this one come from?

97
00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:23.160
&gt;&gt; The width of the view by default?

98
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely is, right?

99
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.200
Gets honking big, gets honking small.

100
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.390
Really ridiculous, right?

101
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.640
Where does that style come from?

102
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.740
&gt;&gt; From the image.

103
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.510
&gt;&gt; Right there.

104
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.740
Image, the width is 100%.

105
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.850
The max width is 100%.

106
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.190
It's doing exactly what we told it to do,
gosh darn it.

107
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.390
Don't you hate it when that happens?

108
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.590
Okay, so that's why it's really big.

109
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.290
But we are working in our HTML and
we are going to ignore it.

110
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.960
Okay, we will get around to styling it but
we're going to ignore it for now.

111
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.786
The next thing that is inside
of our image, our thing here.

112
00:06:02.786 --> 00:06:06.000
So we have, there's our logo.

113
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.720
The next thing we have is
the men of Magenta Lime, right?

114
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.660
So we need to include
them on the web page.

115
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.083
How should we go about doing that?

116
00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:21.170
&gt;&gt; Could you open a section tag?

117
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.460
&gt;&gt; You could do a section tag, absolutely.

118
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.296
This is a section of the page.

119
00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:27.560
We know we have an image here, right?

120
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.810
So after the header, we're going
to have some kind of image, right?

121
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.610
Is that enough?

122
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.710
Just the image like that?

123
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.010
We could put something around it.

124
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.130
So somebody has suggested a section.

125
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.390
That's one way of doing it.

126
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.910
You could use just a generic div.

127
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.261
And I'm going to give
it a class of banner.

128
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.234
What have I forgotten here?

129
00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:57.830
&gt;&gt; Alt text.

130
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.372
&gt;&gt; Alt text, yes, three men of

131
00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:08.060
Magenta Lime wearing blindfolds.

132
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.570
You could describe it more
detail than that if you wish.

133
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:18.390
Here in the drop down, we do have
the options here to Format HTML, okay?

134
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.838
So that'll help you with your indentation.

135
00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:23.618
If you are debugging and
looking for problems,

136
00:07:23.618 --> 00:07:27.530
there is an option in here
to Analyze HTML as well.

137
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.820
And it will flag arrows for you.

138
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.218
Okay, super helpful.

139
00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:43.768
Okay, the next thing that we need
to add then is our tour dates.

140
00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:46.690
So we see here that we've
got our tour dates, right?

141
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.767
We have the word tour, and then we have
a whole bunch of dates and locations and

142
00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:51.660
stuff, right?

143
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.660
And, did I give you that text?

144
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.960
I did not give you that text.

145
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.980
All right, so
I did not give you that text.

146
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.665
Let us just copy that
from the ending CodePen.

147
00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:11.506
So if you'll go down here under marking
up the HTML, there's a link for

148
00:08:11.506 --> 00:08:15.397
the ending CodePen just to save
a little bit of time here.

149
00:08:15.397 --> 00:08:19.267
Let's go into this HTML and let's copy.

150
00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:25.810
We're gonna copy from line eight and
we're gonna copy down to line 38.

151
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.020
So lines eight to 38 in
the finished code pen.

152
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.685
And that finished code pen is right here
under 3A, marking up the HTML, okay?

153
00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:43.585
So just copy that, and we're gonna
paste that here into our web page.

154
00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:51.526
So your page should look something like
this once you've copied and pasted, yeah?

155
00:08:51.526 --> 00:08:56.084
All right, let's look at the markup and
talk about it.

156
00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:58.280
All right, why did I use the main?

157
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.376
Why did I use main here?

158
00:09:06.137 --> 00:09:07.410
What does main mean?

159
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.690
&gt;&gt; Is it just one of those context tags,
like section?

160
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda like section,
or article, or something else.

161
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.280
In this case, main means this is
the main focus of the web page, okay?

162
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.870
This is the most important
thing on the web page.

163
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.290
There's no lie here on this web page
[LAUGH] so it's gonna be the tour dates.

164
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.220
I guess that's the only reason why you're
coming to this website is to find out when

165
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.804
Magenta Lime is near you, okay?

166
00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:37.850
So that's why we use main.

167
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.250
Then I used h1 for the tour, right?

168
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.749
Why did I use h1?

169
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:49.550
&gt;&gt; It's the most important section so
I guess the most important header

170
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.758
&gt;&gt; Most important section.

171
00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:52.450
Most important header, right?

172
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.159
We didn't use it anywhere
else on the site.

173
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.529
So it's fine to use it here under main,
okay?

174
00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:01.180
And then let's look at the next part.

175
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.710
So we have a date, right?

176
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:10.330
We have a location but yet I marked it
up with a paragraph with line breaks.

177
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.400
Anybody want to think about that?

178
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.855
Anybody wanna ask me questions
about why I did that?

179
00:10:15.855 --> 00:10:19.770
&gt;&gt; About an address tag.

180
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.580
&gt;&gt; An address tag?
I'm so glad you said that.

181
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.910
Yes, an address tag would be
another way to mark this up.

182
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.230
However, the address tag is used for
two situations only.

183
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.810
One is, the author of an article.

184
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.720
What is their contact information?

185
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.800
Or, what is the contact for
the entire website?

186
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.620
That is the only time that
you use the address tag.

187
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.100
Strange but true.

188
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.120
So actually, this does not qualify for
the address tag.

189
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.345
I mean, I thought about this for weeks
before I finally left it just like this.

190
00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:52.600
I was very obsessed with thinking
about how I wanted to do this.

191
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.970
So eventually we just went with this
paragraph with the line breaks.

192
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.538
But I think there are probably
better ways to mark this up.

193
00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:02.038
And I think that you could probably
think of some better approaches to this.

194
00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:04.880
But we're gonna go with this for
this course, make sense?

195
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.390
Good enough for now, okay?

196
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.550
&gt;&gt; Can you still, the mockup has
different styling on each line of each.

197
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.540
&gt;&gt; It does, doesn't it?

198
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.430
The markup has different styling
on each line, doesn't it?

199
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.000
We're not worried about that just yet.

200
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.990
Right now we're just
thinking about the markup.

201
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.625
What is the markup and
how are we going to do it.

202
00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:33.184
Okay, then we have a series of
alternating images and reviews.

203
00:11:33.184 --> 00:11:37.485
And since we're copying from this
finished version of the CodePen,

204
00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:40.060
let's just continue to do that.

205
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:46.060
So I am at line 39 in the finished
CodePen, it's an aside element.

206
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.290
And we can go through and
let's just copy what's here.

207
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.132
This is gonna go all
the way through to line 76.

208
00:11:55.132 --> 00:12:01.363
So from aside to aside, by the way,
here's another thing, another pro tip for

209
00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:07.000
CodePen, kind of probably the same
thing as VS Code and others.

210
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.050
If you start at line 39, notice there's
a little caret over here on the side.

211
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.910
If you collapse that.

212
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.465
You can just highlight that
little bit right there and

213
00:12:18.465 --> 00:12:23.090
not have to worry about where
you're scrolling down to, okay?

214
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.422
Copy that and
then we can come over here to our code and

215
00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:32.553
we'll paste it in and
it will have copied everything for you.

216
00:12:32.553 --> 00:12:35.908
Your page should look really wacky now.

217
00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:40.984
There's an image and
then it says just wow and

218
00:12:40.984 --> 00:12:44.730
then whoo, we got stars, okay?

219
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.740
That's cool.

220
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.930
We're just really not worried
about how it looks at the moment.

221
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.730
Let's go through the markup for
this, okay?

222
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.820
So we started with an aside.

223
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.210
Why did I use aside here on line 51?

224
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:05.313
Aside is being used as something that
is related to the main content but

225
00:13:05.313 --> 00:13:07.890
is in support of the main content?

226
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.190
&gt;&gt; Correct,
it's in support of the main content.

227
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.554
So pictures of the concert and
people saying,

228
00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:15.140
this was the most amazing
thing I ever saw.

229
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.440
That is definitely in support
of the tour dates, isn't it?

230
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.080
So that's why we picked an aside here.

231
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.250
Okay, then the next thing we have
a div with a class of image group and

232
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:32.640
if you fold that up here you'll see
that that winds up being a container.

233
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.240
See we have three of these.

234
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.380
Okay, so there's three of
these image group containers.

235
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.279
Any time I use a div, there's no
semantic value to it whatsoever.

236
00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:46.360
It is a grouping element.

237
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.180
So we're just trying to group some
things together here on the page.

238
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:56.610
It will ultimately be used for
styling purposes or layout purposes.

239
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.150
That is the reason that that div exist.

240
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:04.255
Okay, so inside of that, We

241
00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:09.067
have an image, right, with alt text.

242
00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:12.690
And then after that, here's one
that's probably new to a lot of you.

243
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.320
We have a figure.

244
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.152
So the purpose of a figure is it's
going to associate basically something,

245
00:14:20.152 --> 00:14:25.437
whatever that something happens to be, in
this case it happens to be a block quote,

246
00:14:25.437 --> 00:14:30.720
we'll talk about that in a moment,
and it associates it with a caption.

247
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.243
So you can use this with a photo where
you want to have text underneath,

248
00:14:34.243 --> 00:14:36.080
that is the most common way we do it.

249
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.840
We say figure, inside of the figure,
there's an image.

250
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.250
There's a figure caption right?

251
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.031
Here's my picture underneath it says,
picture of a camel [LAUGH] right, or

252
00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:48.300
whatever it says.

253
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.720
Here we've taken this one level more.

254
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.882
This is a great way to think about how
to markup a quote that somebody said.

255
00:14:55.882 --> 00:14:58.610
In this case, we have a blockquote, right?

256
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.010
This person said, just wow.

257
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.370
They probably also said,
what is it, four stars?

258
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.240
Four stars.

259
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.950
We're just displaying it graphically.

260
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.700
Those images are part of that quote.

261
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.950
So we have, there's our four stars.

262
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.680
Each image is one of those, right?

263
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.300
Each of those has a class of star.

264
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.720
Now there's one other
notable thing about this.

265
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.310
Have you taken a look at the alt text for
those stars?

266
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.106
What did I do here with the alt text for
the stars?

267
00:15:33.106 --> 00:15:34.749
&gt;&gt; Star star star?

268
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:39.750
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Those are classes.

269
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.320
Yeah, Andrew.
&gt;&gt; Put it on the first image only.

270
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.597
&gt;&gt; I put it only on the first image.

271
00:15:44.597 --> 00:15:48.324
See there it says four star rating.

272
00:15:48.324 --> 00:15:51.390
And for all of the other images,
it just says alt quote quote.

273
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.500
In other words, an empty image, right?

274
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.268
Why did I do that instead
of star star star star?

275
00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:04.260
&gt;&gt; Someone who is using alt text
doesn't need to see that four times.

276
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.180
&gt;&gt; Exactly,
this is a better user experience.

277
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.240
If you're listening to the web page.

278
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.765
To hear it say four start rating
is gonna give you a better user

279
00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:18.230
experience than just wow,
star, star, star, star.

280
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.750
Nobody wants to hear that.

281
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.418
Nobody, right?

282
00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:23.139
So instead we'll just put the alt
text on the first one and

283
00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:25.190
we'll let the other three be decorative.

284
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.448
Okay, so that's what's going on there.

285
00:16:29.448 --> 00:16:33.119
So that all goes inside of our
blockquote just like that.

286
00:16:33.119 --> 00:16:35.180
Then we have our figure caption.

287
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.692
Figure caption has the fig caption tag.

288
00:16:37.692 --> 00:16:42.090
And inside of that,
you'll see I have one called cite.

289
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.152
Guess what cite does?

290
00:16:47.183 --> 00:16:50.180
&gt;&gt; It makes a citation,
&gt;&gt; It's a citation.

291
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.040
Yeah, who said it?

292
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.290
Who's the person that said the thing?

293
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.699
So the blockquote gives
you the quote itself.

294
00:16:57.699 --> 00:17:00.297
The citation gives us who said it.

295
00:17:00.297 --> 00:17:06.311
And we associate those two things together
with figcaption inside of the figure,

296
00:17:06.311 --> 00:17:07.280
make sense?

297
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:14.034
Okay, so this is probably some of the most
semantic markup that you would have for

298
00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:19.531
something like this,
using a figure this way All right,

299
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:21.744
and so
then we have that a couple of times.

300
00:17:21.744 --> 00:17:25.483
So basically what we have is in the end,
we have a picture.

301
00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:31.439
In this case like here this picture with
a quote associated with that picture.

302
00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:39.345
Okay, and then the last thing
we need to do is add a footer.

303
00:17:39.345 --> 00:17:40.946
So let's copy that footer.

304
00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:46.719
In our final state,
this is lines 77 to 80.

305
00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:51.275
We can just copy that and
paste that into our design.

306
00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:52.260
So there it is.

307
00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:57.404
And that is exactly what
you would expect it is.

308
00:17:57.404 --> 00:18:01.875
It is just a contact link
in a copyright statement.

309
00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:03.622
So that's always our first step.

310
00:18:03.622 --> 00:18:08.905
Anytime you're doing this professionally,
anytime you're working on a new webpage,

311
00:18:08.905 --> 00:18:13.285
the very first thing that you ought to
do is work on your HTML for that page.

312
00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:18.550
And in parallel, you can work on sort of
that basic styling just like we just did.

313
00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.380
We did a little separate webpage, we're
never actually gonna publish that and

314
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.073
make it live.

315
00:18:23.073 --> 00:18:26.010
But it sets up our base styling for
the site.

316
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.630
Put those two things together and
you get what you get.

317
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.349
It's not the right thing, but

318
00:18:30.349 --> 00:18:34.531
we're a lot closer than we would be if
we were looking at ugly HTML, right?

319
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:37.876
Okay, so
that is where you wanna start from.
