1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:06.270
All right, and we're on to
the tour layer here, @layer tour.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.619
So here, for our tour,

3
00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:18.240
we know that the tour dates here are what?

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.321
Tell me a little bit about their styling.

5
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.365
&gt;&gt; Different colors, different sizes.

6
00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.415
&gt;&gt; Different colors, different sizes, and?

7
00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:30.216
&gt;&gt; Centred.
&gt;&gt; Centered, okay, so let's aim to do that

8
00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:40.458
My CodePen, okay, so here in the tour
then, we refer back to our HTML.

9
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:43.451
We have our header, we have our banner,
and then we have main.

10
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.358
Inside of main,
we have an h1 for our tour, and

11
00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.624
then we have a series of paragraphs.

12
00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:53.104
Okay, so basically, everything
on this page is really centered,

13
00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.786
right, at least at mobile dimensions.

14
00:00:55.786 --> 00:01:01.733
So one of the things that we could do is
we could go back to base, go back to body.

15
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:06.519
My body is around line 33,
and to this, we could simply

16
00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:11.598
add a text-align, center.

17
00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:14.074
And because text-align is inherited,

18
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.582
everything inside of this
page will be centered, okay?

19
00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:22.107
So there it is, we've already centered
everything with that one item,

20
00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:25.134
And that was in base.

21
00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:31.168
Which means that inside of header with the
header image, you could technically just

22
00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:35.564
get rid of that text-align center if you
want, it's already going to be centered.

23
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.681
Okay, the next thing,
the text for the h1 is too big.

24
00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:53.881
That's the way it's supposed to be, that`s
the way we`ve programmed the webpage,

25
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:57.109
but the designer wanted this
to be the size of an h3.

26
00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.651
So what could we do?

27
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:02.697
Anybody have any suggestions,
what could we do?

28
00:02:02.697 --> 00:02:04.164
&gt;&gt; Change the HTML.

29
00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:07.122
&gt;&gt; We could change the HTML, yeah.

30
00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.080
That's what a lot of people would do,

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.720
we'd just change this h1 to an h3,
phew, done, right?

32
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.420
What does your accessibility person do?

33
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.870
They have a minor fit,
okay, you cannot do that.

34
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.309
So you gotta stick with the h1.

35
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.346
What's next, what could we do instead?

36
00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.025
&gt;&gt; Change the h1 variable.

37
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:32.160
&gt;&gt; Change the h1 variable,
that's a great idea.

38
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.971
So we could say our variable is actually
going to be as big as the h3, right?

39
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:43.511
We also have, remember we have all these
individual declarations here, h1, h2.

40
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.914
Those are just for those HTML elements.

41
00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:50.985
What if we did this, hi, .h1?

42
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:53.135
What does that mean?

43
00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:54.392
&gt;&gt; Class of h1.

44
00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:58.760
&gt;&gt; Right, we now have the h1 element
itself and anything with a class of h1.

45
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.790
So now we can take that size and
apply it anywhere we want, right?

46
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.946
So let's do that real quick.

47
00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:09.061
Again, this is something you'll
see in Bootstrap, they do this.

48
00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:14.339
We can do h2, h2, h3, .h3,

49
00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:20.172
h4, .h4, very, very easy to do.

50
00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:26.050
H6, .h6.

51
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:34.103
And with that one change, now we have
all of these classes available to us.

52
00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:40.027
What we can do to our h1 here
is add to this a class of h3.

53
00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:47.934
Now, your designer is happy because
the tour is the right size, and

54
00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:52.751
your accessibility person is happy
because it's still in inch one.

55
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.142
We have this very simple markup here,
right, for our tour dates.

56
00:03:57.142 --> 00:04:01.422
We've got a paragraph, right, with these
line breaks, but we have three different

57
00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:04.882
colors for these tour dates and
we have some different sizes as well.

58
00:04:04.882 --> 00:04:09.788
So we have a color for
the date, we have a color for

59
00:04:09.788 --> 00:04:13.498
the club name, and we have a color for

60
00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:17.833
the the location, Oakheart California.

61
00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:18.723
All right,

62
00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:24.156
anybody have any suggestions how we
can get three colors in on this page?

63
00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:27.433
&gt;&gt; Could you do a span and
then add different classes?

64
00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.356
&gt;&gt; You could do a span and
add different classes.

65
00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:32.568
What do people think of that?

66
00:04:32.568 --> 00:04:34.240
Seems like a good approach?

67
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.568
Yeah, because span is meaningless.

68
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.983
The whole point of span is to hold
a class name, doesn't do anything else.

69
00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:47.696
So let's do it, span class="date",

70
00:04:52.247 --> 00:04:55.598
/span.

71
00:04:55.598 --> 00:05:04.158
And then we're gonna put a span to
the class of club, around our club name.

72
00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:14.993
And then the name of the place in
this case, Oakheart California,

73
00:05:14.993 --> 00:05:19.157
Lawndale California, I am going
to leave those the way they are.

74
00:05:19.157 --> 00:05:23.410
In our comp, those are white,
the text is white already.

75
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.022
So basically what we're gonna do,
is we're gonna let that

76
00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:33.003
white color control the color of
the names of the locations, and

77
00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:39.253
we'll have overrides for the date and
the club name, makes sense?

78
00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:43.166
Okay, cool, so
I've only done the first one, obviously,

79
00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:47.617
you'd have to continue to do that for
all of the other locations, but

80
00:05:47.617 --> 00:05:50.326
it's the same thing over and over again.

81
00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:56.344
So for our date, scroll back here.

82
00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:00.183
Go back to our tour here.

83
00:06:00.183 --> 00:06:04.109
We have a date, and for our date,

84
00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:08.596
in the comp, that is the tan color, so

85
00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:12.967
we can say color is var(--tan).

86
00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:23.301
And sure enough,
that date has turned a tan color, okay?

87
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:25.516
Then we have our club,

88
00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:33.737
color: var(--lime).

89
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:41.657
And the font size is slightly larger, so

90
00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:47.458
we can add to this a font
size of var(--h5).

91
00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:49.799
So there we go.

92
00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:53.263
So it works on the very first
one where we've applied this,

93
00:06:53.263 --> 00:06:55.214
where we've applied that HTML.

94
00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:58.136
The other ones,
the formatting doesn't take place.

95
00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:01.439
That's because we haven't put in
the HTML that's required in order for

96
00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:02.750
it to display, make sense?
