1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.912
All right, so let us start with the album.

2
00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:11.650
[COUGH] Okay, so here's our CSS.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.370
We have, or sorry, here's our HTML.

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.200
We have a section with a class of album.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.440
We have an h2 and h1 and our links.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.846
So let's style that up now.

7
00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.287
We can add ourselves another layer,

8
00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:29.504
I am just gonna stick it here
after the tour at layer, and

9
00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:34.840
we'll call this album because
that's what it is right?

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.610
So inside of this, we can say we need to
have a border around everything, right?

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.710
We need to have this border,
this big old border here.

12
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.759
So what should I put in to get
that big old border there?

13
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:02.371
This big old border right here,
what am I gonna do?

14
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:07.152
&gt;&gt; Border two pixels
solid I think that's-.

15
00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:08.389
&gt;&gt; What's my selector.

16
00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:09.119
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

17
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.676
&gt;&gt; That album.

18
00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:13.150
&gt;&gt; That album, yep.

19
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.970
And then what you were saying?

20
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.858
&gt;&gt; So border two pixels solid and I guess.

21
00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:22.077
&gt;&gt; Cyan.

22
00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:25.020
Yeah, okay.

23
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.000
Cool, there it is.

24
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.060
Very attractive.

25
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.317
Okay, what's next?

26
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.540
Notice that that thing is stretching
all the way across the page.

27
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.120
Look at that, do we want that?

28
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.099
No, how can we fix that problem?

29
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.909
&gt;&gt; Max with.

30
00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.954
&gt;&gt; With we can do a max with 500 pixels.

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.270
Okay great now it doesn't go
all the way across the pitch.

32
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.112
All right but I do want to have it
centered, so how do I get it centered?

33
00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:04.851
&gt;&gt; Margin.

34
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.945
&gt;&gt; Margin, margin what?

35
00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:10.657
&gt;&gt; 0 auto.

36
00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:16.027
&gt;&gt; 0 auto,
Margin 0 auto will center it and

37
00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:21.800
that's nice, but I'd actually like some
space on the top and the bottom, okay?

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.410
So we can make that happen.

39
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.027
We could say something like 2rem,
auto, like that, and that'll

40
00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:33.240
give us a little bit of space on top and
a little bit of space on the bottom.

41
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.964
Nice.

42
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.050
Okay, what should be my next thing here?

43
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.670
Are you happy with the text all smashed
up against the edges of the box?

44
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.283
No, what should I do?

45
00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:49.260
Yeah, yeah says Andrew.

46
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.950
What should I do to fix it?

47
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.491
&gt;&gt; Padding.
&gt;&gt; We should definitely add some padding,

48
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:57.990
1rem.

49
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.270
Sure, one other thing.

50
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.619
What is that?

51
00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:03.171
Here.

52
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:05.789
&gt;&gt; Text align center
&gt;&gt; Text align center.

53
00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:15.513
Yeah, textalign center right there Great.

54
00:03:15.513 --> 00:03:17.890
We're getting closer.

55
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.780
All right, so the next thing,
let's style the words new album.

56
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.950
That would be, the selector would be what?

57
00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:34.480
&gt;&gt; .albumh2.
&gt;&gt; .albumh2, excellent.

58
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.294
And so how are we gonna style that?

59
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.262
&gt;&gt; Get rid of the margin?

60
00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:41.983
&gt;&gt; Get rid of the margin.

61
00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:47.150
So remember, all your headings
have margin on them by default.

62
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.070
That's where those big
spaces are coming from.

63
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.040
You could find you could figure
that out if you put a border on it,

64
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.120
you'd see the space in between the two
borders and you say that's margin.

65
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.290
So always there's margin on the headers,
we'll turn that off.

66
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.645
What else do I need to do?

67
00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:08.506
&gt;&gt; Change the font family.

68
00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:10.308
&gt;&gt; Change the font family.

69
00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:11.640
So our font family will be what?

70
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.417
&gt;&gt; Bar cursive.

71
00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:13.354
&gt;&gt; Bar cursive.

72
00:04:16.864 --> 00:04:17.654
Great, okay.

73
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.378
What else?

74
00:04:20.378 --> 00:04:26.022
&gt;&gt; Maybe I can figure.

75
00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:26.622
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

76
00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:32.730
if I zoom this out to 100% I don't
know if I can make it the right size.

77
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.159
You'll just have to take my word for it.

78
00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:41.700
It should be much smaller
font size can be VAR H6.

79
00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:49.719
Sweet.

80
00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.880
We're almost there, aren't we?

81
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.170
Now all we have to do is style.

82
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.160
It was all a dream.

83
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.477
What's my selector for that?

84
00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:03.900
&gt;&gt; Album h1
&gt;&gt; Album h1?

85
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.136
Great suggestions for
making It Was All A Dream.

86
00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:10.335
Look like this.

87
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.330
&gt;&gt; Color.

88
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.391
&gt;&gt; We're adding a color

89
00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:24.179
bar line okay
&gt;&gt; Text transform.

90
00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:25.134
&gt;&gt; Text transform.

91
00:05:25.134 --> 00:05:27.869
&gt;&gt; Uppercase.

92
00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:28.740
Uppercase.

93
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.810
Why would we ever use text transform?

94
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.970
We can just type it in HTML and uppercase.

95
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.594
Why would we do this?

96
00:05:37.594 --> 00:05:41.778
&gt;&gt; If you're getting data
dynamically inserted.

97
00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:46.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we get dynamic
data inserted in the page.

98
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.168
If we have a client,
who's ever had a clueless client before?

99
00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:50.974
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

100
00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:53.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, wait, people forget.

101
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.228
So yeah,
you should absolutely do things like this.

102
00:05:56.228 --> 00:05:58.379
If it really is important
that it's uppercase,

103
00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.840
don't leave it to people
to type it in uppercase.

104
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.524
What else?

105
00:06:03.974 --> 00:06:05.230
&gt;&gt; Maybe font weight.

106
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.021
&gt;&gt; Font weight?

107
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.616
300, They may or may not change it
might be or that already, okay?

108
00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:15.830
And anything else?

109
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.855
&gt;&gt; Font size,
&gt;&gt; Font size.

110
00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:20.950
You'll have to take my word for it.

111
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:28.690
This is a var(--h4) That puts
it all on one line like that.

112
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.686
There's one other thing here.

113
00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:33.171
&gt;&gt; Less margin top.

114
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.784
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
do you see how we have a space there?

115
00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:38.884
Between new album and It Was All a Dream.

116
00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:40.418
Where is that coming from?

117
00:06:40.418 --> 00:06:44.099
&gt;&gt; The h1.

118
00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:51.060
&gt;&gt; The h1, we turned it off for the h2 but
the h1 still has its margin on doesn't it?

119
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.222
So we'll set that to margin I
actually have it set to 1rem0 so

120
00:06:56.222 --> 00:06:58.918
to give us a little bit of space.

121
00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:04.161
If you set it to 0 the text would touch
each other because we turned it off for

122
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:08.254
the h2 but we do actually need
a little bit of space there.

123
00:07:08.254 --> 00:07:09.800
So we'll say 1rem0.

124
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.387
Hey, look at that.

125
00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:14.208
Doesn't that look awesome?

126
00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:15.364
Cool.
