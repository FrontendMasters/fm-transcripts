1
00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:03.868
Now, we are moving on to
the more challenging and

2
00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:08.434
more interesting layout, and
that is our tablet layout.

3
00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:13.113
Okay, so
how are we going to make this happen?

4
00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.832
Anybody have any suggestions?

5
00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.480
&gt;&gt; Grid again.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.622
&gt;&gt; Maybe grid again.

7
00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:27.936
We got three rows there, but
my first row has two items in it,

8
00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:30.484
my second row has three items in it.

9
00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:32.544
How do we make that work with grid?

10
00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:38.839
&gt;&gt; We have a container that contains
the images and then use flex for

11
00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.479
that container, and then that would
take up the second row completely.

12
00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:44.805
&gt;&gt; That might be an idea.

13
00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:47.760
We could do something like Flexbox,

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.633
where we have these three images
here in the row kinda thing.

15
00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.210
Might work, definitely might work.

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.459
Not sure how we're gonna get that
border on the outside there, though.

17
00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.153
So one of the things that we can do,

18
00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:12.355
[SOUND] I put together this high
quality graphic here for you.

19
00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:16.106
So rather than thinking of this
as two columns or three columns,

20
00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:18.611
what if we think about
this as six columns?

21
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.836
So we actually have six columns
going across the page here.

22
00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:27.545
So our reviews on the top,
they are gonna occupy three columns each,

23
00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:32.566
our images will occupy two columns each,
and in my last row,

24
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:37.114
our two reviews will
accommodate three reviews each.

25
00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:39.238
Kinda make sense?

26
00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:43.965
Okay, this is also useful for
counting grid lines, because we're gonna

27
00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:48.401
need to assign each one of these
elements to the right space, right?

28
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:52.668
Okay, so let's just do a quick count here.

29
00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:56.871
So for that Just WOW review that's
up there in the upper left corner,

30
00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:01.522
what would be our grid column numbers,
the starting and the ending number?

31
00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:02.924
We start with what?

32
00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:03.554
&gt;&gt; One.

33
00:02:03.554 --> 00:02:06.195
&gt;&gt; One, and we end with what?

34
00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.195
&gt;&gt; Four.

35
00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.854
&gt;&gt; Four, one, two, three, four.

36
00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:13.023
So that fourth line is
roughly there in the middle.

37
00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:18.261
Remember, we start with the yellow on the
outside, we're going to the middle here,

38
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.626
and we count like humans, so
we start with number one.

39
00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:26.117
And then that second quote there,
what are its numbers?

40
00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:27.796
It's gonna start with number what?

41
00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:28.361
&gt;&gt; Four.

42
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:31.485
&gt;&gt; Number four, and end with what?

43
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:31.987
&gt;&gt; Seven.

44
00:02:31.987 --> 00:02:33.849
&gt;&gt; Number seven, right?

45
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.327
Six columns, but
there are seven lines, make sense?

46
00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:45.132
Okay, so that's where those kinda
numbers are gonna come from.

47
00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:52.385
All right, so now, all we have
to do is just write that, yeah?

48
00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:57.454
Okay, so
I'm gonna put in a media query at media,

49
00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:02.538
and I'm gonna say
a min-width of 700 pixels.

50
00:03:06.132 --> 00:03:09.531
Why 700 instead of 800?

51
00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:11.788
I just thought that but
this looked better,

52
00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:13.810
that's pretty much all there is to it.

53
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.177
I thought it looked better.

54
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:22.254
So what is the first thing that we should
do here in our media query for the tablet?

55
00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:25.004
What's the very first
thing that we should do?

56
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.560
&gt;&gt; Change the size of
the reviews container.

57
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.839
&gt;&gt; We could change the size
of the reviews container.

58
00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:35.544
So what would you recommend, Jason?

59
00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:40.374
&gt;&gt; Given that we want those
three images to extend beyond,

60
00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:44.793
it should be a certain amount
below whatever the max

61
00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:48.670
size of those three
images side by side is.

62
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if we put those three images
side by side, actually the images,

63
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.301
we wanna have them stick
out of the grid container.

64
00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:58.001
So here's one of the issues with that.

65
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.112
Actually, before we even get there,
maybe we should show the images so

66
00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:03.835
we can see what we're doing.

67
00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:08.331
Anybody have an idea of
how we might do that?

68
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.116
featured-img, how do we show our images?

69
00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:12.294
&gt;&gt; Display block.

70
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:18.696
&gt;&gt; We could display, block for sure.

71
00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:26.438
Okay, or you can display them
inline block, that would be another

72
00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:31.500
way to do this What's going on here?

73
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.881
Why does it look like this?

74
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.710
&gt;&gt; You haven't defined positions for
anything in the grid yet.

75
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.038
&gt;&gt; I haven't defined positions for
anything in the grid yet.

76
00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:43.967
So it's actually still applying grid
template columns of 1fr and 1fr, isn't it?

77
00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:46.948
And it's putting things where they belong.

78
00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:48.665
That's what grid does.

79
00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:53.315
Okay, so for our reviews, then,

80
00:04:56.024 --> 00:05:00.796
Let's start by putting a border on it,

81
00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:06.299
2px solid, and that was var(--cyan).

82
00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:08.504
That will put a nice blue
box around the whole thing.

83
00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:17.244
Okay, We're still gonna
be working in grid.

84
00:05:17.244 --> 00:05:21.579
We've actually declared display:
grid here at the mobile level,

85
00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:24.172
that will carry into our media queries.

86
00:05:24.172 --> 00:05:27.357
But I think for clarity,
for reading this code,

87
00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:30.931
I'm just gonna put it in one more time,
just sort of for

88
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:35.767
documentation purposes for the next
person who comes along to read this.

89
00:05:40.926 --> 00:05:44.375
Now, we're talking about
making six columns here.

90
00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:54.068
So if I said grid-template-columns:
repeat(6,1fr),

91
00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:59.994
what's gonna happen is this, right?

92
00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:04.851
Everything is contained very nicely
inside of our grid container.

93
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.464
It's doing the best it can to shove
all six of those things together, but

94
00:06:08.464 --> 00:06:12.627
our container is a little bit small right
now, so it's wrapped onto another line.

95
00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:15.785
That's why we don't get six things,
or is that six things?

96
00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:16.667
That is six things.

97
00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:22.533
We have seven things to lay out, and
we have six things going across right now.

98
00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:27.394
So that's why we have one there
on the second line for quotes and

99
00:06:27.394 --> 00:06:29.329
three pictures, okay?

100
00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:33.326
But notice that nothing is hanging
outside of that outside container, and

101
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.997
that's because we're
working with fractions.

102
00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:37.942
Fractions are flexible.

103
00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:41.734
Everything should be contained
inside of our grid container.

104
00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:46.633
So if we want that effect where some
things are hanging outside of that

105
00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:49.505
container, so-called grid blowout,

106
00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:54.242
we'd actually wanna work with
a fixed width for our grid columns.

107
00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:56.526
And it is possible to use pixels there.

108
00:06:56.526 --> 00:07:00.968
We often don't, because we actually
usually want a flexible kind of grid.

109
00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:03.773
But here, we wanna have a fixed width so

110
00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:08.629
that we can get that effect of
having those images hanging outside.

111
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.768
So I am going to change this to 90px,

112
00:07:13.768 --> 00:07:18.917
90px, so repeat(6, 90px).

113
00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:22.487
And if you multiply those
two numbers together,

114
00:07:22.487 --> 00:07:25.805
90 times 6, you'll come up with 540.

115
00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:27.757
So our max-width,

116
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:36.409
Actually just our width, sorry,
width, will be 540 pixels.

117
00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:43.117
And I'm using just width here
because I actually don't want this

118
00:07:43.117 --> 00:07:45.612
whole layout to flex once again.

119
00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:48.822
And since our breakpoint is at 700 pixels,

120
00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:52.204
this will never get smaller anyway,
all right?

121
00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:55.101
So 540 pixels, that's what we want.

122
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:58.724
So now comes the fun part.

123
00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:03.349
One of the things that we can do here
is we can set up some ordering for

124
00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.818
each of these reviews in
each of these pictures and

125
00:08:06.818 --> 00:08:10.143
that will help us order these interows,
okay?

126
00:08:10.143 --> 00:08:14.811
So what I wanna do is set
up a selector basically for

127
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:19.590
each one of these elements,
each one of the reviews

128
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.496
specifically, and
then one sort of for the images.

129
00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:27.838
So we could do that by making
a whole bunch of classes.

130
00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:32.214
We could put classes on all those reviews
and so forth, and write classes for them.

131
00:08:32.214 --> 00:08:36.280
But because we have people out
there who are selector fans,

132
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.097
let's write some whacked out crazy
selectors because we can, okay?

133
00:08:41.097 --> 00:08:46.187
So what we wanna do here is
we have reviews, of course,

134
00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:52.178
is our container and we have figure,
figure, figure, right?

135
00:08:52.178 --> 00:08:56.614
And we have these divs with the class
of featured images in between.

136
00:08:56.614 --> 00:08:59.700
So nth child isn't going to work here.

137
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.148
nth child will not work here,
because our first child is figure.

138
00:09:04.148 --> 00:09:09.849
But if you think of our figure our second
child, and you're thinking of the figure,

139
00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:15.327
that doesn't exist because the second
figure is a third child of a side, right?

140
00:09:15.327 --> 00:09:17.105
It's actually the third child.

141
00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:22.657
So we're going to work with the of
type selectors, so nth-of-type,

142
00:09:22.657 --> 00:09:29.242
which will select our first figure, our
second figure, our third figure that way.

143
00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:32.979
And I talk more about that in
the intermediate CSS course,

144
00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:36.495
the difference between nth child and
nth-of-type.

145
00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:40.768
Okay, so here, we're gonna say, for

146
00:09:40.768 --> 00:09:45.571
our reviews, figure: first-of-type.

147
00:09:48.157 --> 00:09:52.072
And let's set its order to 1.

148
00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:56.186
That's gonna try to put it in the first
row, nothing is gonna change,

149
00:09:56.186 --> 00:09:58.160
cuz it's kind of already there.

150
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.214
Actually, I lied.

151
00:09:59.214 --> 00:10:01.416
Let me rephrase that.

152
00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:04.606
If you'll notice, just wow,
that was our first quote.

153
00:10:04.606 --> 00:10:06.511
It shows up down at the bottom.

154
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:08.707
And anybody know why that is?

155
00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:13.824
&gt;&gt; Cuz none of the rest
of them have in order.

156
00:10:13.824 --> 00:10:18.179
&gt;&gt; None of the rest of them have an order,
so they show up before that one.

157
00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:22.516
So as we continue to add things here,
it will show up in the correct location,

158
00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:24.139
which is up in the first row.

159
00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:29.211
Okay, so
then can anyone suggest how I select

160
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:33.629
my second figure, HTML element here?

161
00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:37.822
Can anybody suggest a selector for that?

162
00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:40.597
Figure what?

163
00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:43.636
&gt;&gt; Second-of-type selector.

164
00:10:43.636 --> 00:10:46.222
&gt;&gt; Second-of-type, very close.

165
00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:53.924
The way we would write
that is nth-of-type(2).

166
00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:56.638
Yeah, we have a first-of-type,
and we have a last-of-type, and

167
00:10:56.638 --> 00:10:58.018
then everything else has a number.

168
00:10:58.018 --> 00:10:58.591
[INAUDIBLE].

169
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:02.111
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good guess, okay?

170
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:05.009
So this one will also have an order of 1.

171
00:11:08.487 --> 00:11:16.428
Okay, and
then let's pick our third reviews.

172
00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:18.591
Let me just start copying these.

173
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:22.784
So for our third reviews,
how do I modify the selector?

174
00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:23.884
Switch the number.

175
00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:28.493
Gonna be number 3, and
we want the order to be what?

176
00:11:28.493 --> 00:11:29.050
&gt;&gt; 3.

177
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.955
&gt;&gt; 3, cuz we want it in the third row.

178
00:11:33.955 --> 00:11:38.989
And then our last one, .reviews figure.

179
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:46.000
We can say last-of-type, or you could
say nth-of-type 4, that works too.

180
00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:53.792
Order will be 3, okay?

181
00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.361
Now, how about our images?

182
00:11:57.894 --> 00:12:01.861
The images are gonna go in the second row,
right?

183
00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:10.195
So we can just say that our class
featured-img, the order will be 2.

184
00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:18.279
Okay, so we have the first thing done.

185
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:22.793
We have our two reviews that go on
the top, we have our three images, and

186
00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:24.910
then we have our last two quotes.

187
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.995
Make sense?

188
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.242
We haven't assigned things to cells yet,
but

189
00:12:28.242 --> 00:12:30.610
they're at least in
the right order on the page.

190
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.512
[LAUGH] Okay.
