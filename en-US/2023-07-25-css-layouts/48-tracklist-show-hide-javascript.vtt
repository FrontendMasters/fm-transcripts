00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.326
All right, so now comes the part
that we've all been waiting for.

2
00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:07.535
And that is to write a little bit of
JavaScript in order to make this button

3
00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:09.470
actually do something.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.238
So to do that, we have here in your
JavaScript, I've actually put it in for

5
00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:17.660
you already,
all you'll need to do is uncomment it.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.504
This is the first bunch of JavaScript
up here at the top, which my friend

7
00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:28.610
Erica Lee wrote, gave to me many years
ago and I continue to use it to this day.

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.630
So what we have here is we are looking for
a querySelector.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.789
And we are looking for
a querySelector of .button-tracklist,

10
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.180
and we are adding to that,
an EventListener.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.843
So on click, we're going to do something.

12
00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:51.410
We're going to switch a class
of hidden to a class of showing.

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.782
And so now we need to configure these
classes that are here inside of

14
00:00:55.782 --> 00:00:58.137
this JavaScript to match our HTML.

15
00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:01.578
So the first part of this,
the document querySelector,

16
00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:05.950
where it says the .button-tracklist,
we need to have a class assigned

17
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.770
to our button that matches this particular
querySelector, so let's do that.

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.605
We've got our button
with the ID of tracklist.

19
00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:22.980
Let's also give it a class
of button-tracklist.

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.561
So when the button is clicked,
what are we going to do?

21
00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:31.630
We're gonna swap these classes
of hidden and showing.

22
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.440
So where should we apply that?

23
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.870
Think about that for a moment.

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.450
Should probably be the table.

25
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.290
So we'll start with our table
with a class of hidden.

26
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.593
Now absolutely nothing has happened yet

27
00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:57.231
because we don't have that class of hidden
defined, so let's put that in as well.

28
00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.551
So continuing on here in
on our layer of tracklist,

29
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:07.926
right after our table styles,
then we can add

30
00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:12.784
a class of hidden,
which will be display: none.

31
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:21.598
And we can add a class of showing,
and that will be display: table.

32
00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:26.052
You may not know that there is a display
type of table, but in fact there is, and

33
00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:28.700
since this is a table,
we might as well use it.

34
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.928
So not display: block or anything else,

35
00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:36.644
just display: table, and so
now we have a button down here.

36
00:02:36.644 --> 00:02:38.699
When we roll our mouse over it,

37
00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.820
everything highlights, even over
here in the edges of this button.

38
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.073
When we click it, that button opens and

39
00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:51.719
there's our tracklist,
opens right on down the page.

40
00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.600
Very, very nice.

41
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.351
Okay, so the only thing we have
going now is a usability problem.

42
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:01.639
So our button, which is great,
it says tracklist,

43
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.030
that's exactly what we want
it to say before it's opened.

44
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.117
But there's not necessarily a way
to close this tracklist up again,

45
00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:13.581
it's not obvious how to do that.

46
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:16.300
So one of the things
that we could do here,

47
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.420
because when we click the button again,
it does in fact close,

48
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.643
we could change the text on this
button from tracklist to close.

49
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:28.174
And we can do that with another
piece of JavaScript, right?

50
00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:32.438
So here, inside of our
JavaScript box here in CodePen,

51
00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:36.250
I found a little bit of
JavaScript to do this.

52
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
I copied it from a blog post, and
there's the credit where you can go and

53
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.503
read about that.

54
00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:45.857
I'm relatively sure that you could combine
these two pieces of JavaScript, but

55
00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:47.465
I am not a JavaScript person.

56
00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:50.808
So I leave it to you guys to
figure out how to combine all this

57
00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:54.849
JavaScript into a single kind of
function and make all of this happen.

58
00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.780
But it works just fine as two
separate little functions, and

59
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.730
they're both very short.

60
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.410
So what we're going to do here is
uncomment this little bit of JavaScript.

61
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.140
And as you see here, this one is
doing a getElementById('tracklist').

62
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.678
So that's our button
with the ID of tracklist.

63
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:21.008
And what it will do then
is it has a constant here,

64
00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:25.370
the initial text is going to be tracklist,
great.

65
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.657
That is exactly what we want it to say.

66
00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:32.849
And then once we have clicked on it,
if that initial text is there,

67
00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.200
swap it for the text, and it says, close.

68
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.010
And you see we have that interesting
looking little bit of unicode there.

69
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.930
This is an actual x, so
it's an x kind of thing.

70
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.688
Otherwise, we are gonna
show the initial text.

71
00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:52.744
So once that's in place and
you have uncommented it,

72
00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:57.715
then when you click the tracklist button,
now our text changes.

73
00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.640
There's our close.

74
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.470
And when you click it again,
it goes back to the word tracklist.

75
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.351
So that is how we're going to set
up our initial tracklist here for

76
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.963
our mobile display.

77
00:05:09.963 --> 00:05:13.229
Looks great, but
when we get to our tablet display,

78
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.471
we want this tracklist to show up on
the left side of our album cover.

79
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:19.100
Let's take a look at that next.
