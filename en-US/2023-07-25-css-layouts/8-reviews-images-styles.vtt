00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.490
The next thing we're going
to take a look at is,

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.565
in our practical.css.education
website we're on chapter three,

3
00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:12.380
and we are looking at 3C,
reviews and images.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.470
So, this is the next part of
the page that we're going to style.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.590
And I am going to open up
the screenshot that we have here.

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.430
And let's focus in down here at the
bottom, so you can see what's going on.

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.440
So, there's all of our tour dates,
we just styled those.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.223
Then we have our images, there it is.

9
00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:38.869
And then we have our quote, and
our stars, and the person who said it,

10
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:43.490
all stacked nicely on top of
each other like this, okay?

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.280
So let's go back and compare that with
what we have in our CodePen so far.

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.042
And as always, you can get the beginning
CodePen and the ending CodePen,

13
00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.299
they're right here inside of the website.

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.042
So let's take a look at what we have here.

15
00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:02.997
This is what ours looks like right now.

16
00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:08.660
Okay, so can anyone make some suggestions.

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.680
What is it that we need to fix?

18
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.879
What is it that we need to change
in order to set this page up?

19
00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.764
What do we need to do?

20
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.890
&gt;&gt; Horizontally align our stars.

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.890
&gt;&gt; Horizontally align our stars.

22
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.195
They are kind of, a little much.

23
00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.390
[LAUGH] So yeah, absolutely,
we need to do that.

24
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.974
What else?

25
00:01:31.974 --> 00:01:34.210
&gt;&gt; Scale them.

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.712
&gt;&gt; Definitely scale them down.

27
00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:37.914
Yep, what else?

28
00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:44.119
Remember, just compare back and
forth here.

29
00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:51.264
Maybe a little spacing,
we've got a spacing issue going on here,

30
00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:53.013
maybe above the image, yeah?

31
00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:57.790
And down here, our text.

32
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.310
Because of the way the cite CSS element is
styled by default, it gives you an italic.

33
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.250
And our designer says it
should not be italic, okay?

34
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.340
So, it's always good just to
make that list of things.

35
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.503
Just looking, comparing where you are and
where you're going, and

36
00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:21.690
just write the things down in
regular old plain English.

37
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.420
That will help organize you as to like
what the next step is here, right?

38
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.450
That's always a really
important thing to do.

39
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.571
All right, so let us set up then
our layer, @layer reviews (,

40
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.554
cuz that's what we're gonna put in here.

41
00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:47.730
And, we'll remind ourselves of
what our HTML looks like for this.

42
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.829
So if we scroll down here to line,
what do we have?

43
00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.872
39 to 40, we have our image, right?

44
00:02:55.872 --> 00:03:00.434
Our &lt;div class="imggroup"&gt; that goes
around the whole entire picture plus

45
00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:02.320
the review underneath, right?

46
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.190
So that's one thing.

47
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.900
Inside of that we have the image itself,
and those images are in pretty good shape.

48
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.010
There probably not a lot to do here,
right?

49
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.210
And then after that,
we have our text, the blockquote,

50
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.190
those images, and so forth, right?

51
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.342
So always good to review your HTML so you
remember what the structure is like, so

52
00:03:23.342 --> 00:03:26.319
you can remember how you're going
to put this thing together.

53
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.190
All right, once you've got that,
then we can start writing some styling.

54
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.410
So I'm gonna start with our image group,
.imggroup.

55
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.950
And let's give it a little bit of
space on the top, because right now,

56
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.640
our image really smashes
into our tour here.

57
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.110
So, let's give this
some margin on the top.

58
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.985
Let's call it 2rem.

59
00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:56.855
And that'll give us a little
bit of spacing between things.

60
00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:00.460
2rem is a pretty common thing, we're
gonna use that for a lot of stuff today.

61
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.918
Fortunately, our designer is very,
very consistent in his spacing.

62
00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:08.489
Okay, and then as you know,

63
00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.010
it's really distracting to think about
anything until we deal with these stars.

64
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.490
So let's deal with the stars.

65
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.947
We have a class of star that we
can work with, so let's use it.

66
00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:26.510
And we can set that width to
something like 18 pixels.

67
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.220
You can absolutely put that
in rems instead, if you wish.

68
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.770
Remember that those stars will
scale with the size of your page.

69
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.230
So really the question is,

70
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.060
do you want the stars to scale
with the size of your page or not?

71
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.608
If somebody blows up the text,
you also want the stars to be blown up.

72
00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:43.584
&gt;&gt; Probably not.

73
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:44.490
&gt;&gt; Right?

74
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.390
So, you can sort of think about that
in terms of how you choose your units

75
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.080
for this.

76
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.285
I decided I didn't want that to happen,
so I picked 18 pixels,

77
00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:57.192
but you absolutely could
have done 1.125rem instead.

78
00:04:57.192 --> 00:05:02.411
Okay, so that right there solved so
many of our problems.

79
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:08.206
[LAUGH] Just by giving
those stars a width.

80
00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:09.050
Thank goodness.

81
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.650
And now, they show up next to each other.

82
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.560
Why?

83
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.052
We didn't even have to do any kind
of layout to get those stars next to

84
00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:17.420
each other.

85
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.296
Why?

86
00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:18.796
&gt;&gt; Images are inline.

87
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.520
&gt;&gt; Images are inline.

88
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.239
Right on, Andrew, images are inline.

89
00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:28.620
And so by default, they just stack
up next to each other horizontally,

90
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.500
without having to do anything special.

91
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.516
So provided that our page
is wider than 18 times 4,

92
00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:42.427
those stars are gonna show up next
to each other just like that.

93
00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:43.312
Make sense?

94
00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.071
Okay, so then the next part of this.

95
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:54.980
We need to put in some styling for
our blockquote and our cite.

96
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.104
And, I'm gonna go back up into
my base styles to do this,

97
00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:02.350
because this is working
with an HTML element.

98
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.390
So I'm gonna just put it up here for
organization's sake.

99
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.060
So just scroll to the bottom
of that base layer.

100
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.238
I'm around line 106 or so.

101
00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:18.921
And by default, you may know blockquote
is indented slightly on the page.

102
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.509
So, the centering here for
these quotes is slightly off.

103
00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.748
And if you're not a designer you might
not notice that, but it is slightly off.

104
00:06:26.748 --> 00:06:31.763
So, if we say our blockquote
will have a margin of 0 and

105
00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:37.106
a padding of 0, just in case
we never know what the browser

106
00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:43.121
does with that default space, so
we'll just set them both to 0.

107
00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:50.233
And that gets us a little bit closer,
yeah?

108
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.803
All right, now the last thing
we have to do is deal with

109
00:06:54.803 --> 00:06:58.270
this citation that's down here.

110
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.015
So, let's add to this a cite.

111
00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:09.960
Now, by default, I told you the cite
is displayed as a italic text there.

112
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.490
So, how do we get the text
to be not italic?

113
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.740
What is the property and value for that?

114
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.716
Anybody know?
&gt;&gt; Font style?

115
00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:23.549
&gt;&gt; Font style, exactly.

116
00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:24.750
And what's the value?

117
00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:28.789
&gt;&gt; Normal?

118
00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.123
&gt;&gt; Normal.

119
00:07:30.123 --> 00:07:33.481
Normal, okay?

120
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:39.160
Cool, so there that is, okay?

121
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.182
And again, if you're not a designer,
you may think, okay, we're done, but

122
00:07:43.182 --> 00:07:46.620
see how that space there is slightly
bigger than the space above it?

123
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.600
That also annoys designers.

124
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.000
How to annoy your designer friends?

125
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.560
Leave things like that.

126
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.536
So, one of the things that we can
do here is, you might say, well,

127
00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:58.243
how would you address that?

128
00:07:58.243 --> 00:08:00.847
Anybody have an idea of how
you might address that?

129
00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:05.654
&gt;&gt; Look in DevTools,
see if there's margin or padding.

130
00:08:05.654 --> 00:08:09.020
&gt;&gt; You could look in DevTools and
see if there's margin or padding.

131
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:16.622
Absolutely, we could also just set our
margin to 0 and our padding to 0, right?

132
00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:21.360
That should take care of that even
if we're not in DevTools, but

133
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.276
that space is still a little bit wonky.

134
00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:27.444
Anybody have any other idea how
we might reduce that space?

135
00:08:30.854 --> 00:08:32.912
Remember our margin can go negative.

136
00:08:35.628 --> 00:08:38.426
We can do a negative margin thing.

137
00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:46.920
And it happens to be, if we say margin-top
is -3 pixels, how did I arrive at this?

138
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.751
Lots and lots of testing.

139
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:52.589
[LAUGH] Nice guess.

140
00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:57.075
You'll wind up with that space
being a little bit closer here.

141
00:08:57.075 --> 00:09:00.060
Although, the ad actually
hasn't applied yet, has it?

142
00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:03.858
&gt;&gt; Nope.

143
00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:05.174
&gt;&gt; Why didn't it apply?

144
00:09:09.618 --> 00:09:11.550
&gt;&gt; Cuz you already set margin to 0.

145
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.800
&gt;&gt; I did set margin to 0.

146
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.760
Margin-top comes later, but
we could get rid of that if you want.

147
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.454
Well, I'll tell you,
cite is an inline element.

148
00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:25.385
Cite is an inline element which
means that negative margin,

149
00:09:25.385 --> 00:09:30.098
margin going up and down on the page,
does not apply to inline elements.

150
00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:32.896
Who knew?

151
00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:37.794
So, if we change this to display: block.

152
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:43.402
Now, that will apply.

153
00:09:43.402 --> 00:09:48.564
You can see that that space has,
[SOUND] looks all pretty now.
