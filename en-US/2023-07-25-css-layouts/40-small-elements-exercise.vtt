00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.211
We are ready to start working
on our difficult design.

2
00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:09.010
And I have here some screenshots for
how that will look.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.785
We'll start here, this is the desktop
dimension for what we're building.

4
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.355
So you can see we've reused a lot
of things that we've already built.

5
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:20.485
So we've got some buttons
here we've already built.

6
00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:23.395
We've got a couple of boxes
we've already built, but

7
00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:26.685
we have some crazy new things
that are going on here.

8
00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:30.125
You'll notice that our
tracklist has moved.

9
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.033
So we have a tracklist that
goes to the side of our album.

10
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.500
When we click the button there,
it's gonna fly out.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.780
Wow, that's a whole thing.

12
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.440
Obviously these diamond pictures,
that's a whole thing to think about.

13
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.550
Here's how it's going to look on tablet,
all right?

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.870
Kinda the same thing all stacked up.

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.251
And then on mobile, notice our tracklist
does something completely different.

16
00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:01.139
Instead of flying out to the side next
to our album it's gonna be down here and

17
00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:06.210
open downwards pushing content
here down the page, make sense?

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.935
Now a lot of crazy things
that are going on here.

19
00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:12.390
But a lot of things we can reuse.

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.360
So we can reuse our audio player,
for example, that's gonna stay.

21
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.103
We've pulled the images
out of our reviews and

22
00:01:19.103 --> 00:01:22.870
we've replaced a couple of them
with lightning bolts, okay?

23
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.570
So, there's a couple of little
things in there like that.

24
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.935
So that is where we're headed
here in these designs, and

25
00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:30.660
of course you can refer to these
screenshots at any point in time.

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.900
So where we're gonna start with this
is the so-called small elements.

27
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.253
And because this difficult design
has two major areas of focus,

28
00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:46.690
which is gonna be that album cover and
the tracklist, and the diamond images.

29
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.250
So we're gonna spend a lot
of time on those two things.

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.580
But the rest of this, there's a lot
of stuff that's being reused.

31
00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.220
So what I would like for you to do is I've
given you links to a bunch of stuff here.

32
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.925
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna build these pages here.

33
00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:09.847
So, here's the mobile version of this,
we've got some reviews up here on the top.

34
00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:14.720
On the tablet version, we have some
lightning bolts that are appearing.

35
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.610
We have a box that's gonna have
the guise here in the background.

36
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.871
But it looks like kinda the same sort
of box that we have down here already,

37
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.508
it's just this one has a background, okay?

38
00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:33.590
We have a big button that goes all the way
across, we have these lightning bolts and

39
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.399
the footer is the same as
what we had before, okay?

40
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.586
So this is what I'm calling
the quote small elements.

41
00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.773
I've just put them all
together in a code pen and

42
00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:48.873
we need to work with the styling that
we already have from our medium design,

43
00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:53.671
and then we're gonna modify it a bit
here for our more advanced design.

44
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:58.195
And then when you get to, I guess this is
desktop, it's gonna look ridiculous, but

45
00:02:58.195 --> 00:02:59.635
don't worry about that.

46
00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:02.780
[LAUGH] Don't let that bother you,
this is not permanent.

47
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.950
So, that is what we're going to do here.

48
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.960
What I've given you to start
with is your beginning code pen.

49
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.270
You'll see that things look
a little bit odd here.

50
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.097
This is some of that lingering styling
from the reviews from our medium design,

51
00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:19.610
right?

52
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.770
I've also given you an image for
the new tour box.

53
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.100
So you can copy that URL, that'll be the
image that we wanna use on the tour box.

54
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.430
And we also have a link to the SVG code
here for the lightning bolt, makes sense?

55
00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:45.272
Okay, so where are we gonna start is we
are going to start here on this page and

56
00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:51.015
I'm actually gonna ask you guys to
do a little bit of this as well.

57
00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:56.028
So first of all, what I'd like for
you to do is see what you can do about

58
00:03:56.028 --> 00:04:02.097
styling these buttons, photos from the
road and the magenta line official store.

59
00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:06.985
And the way those buttons should look
is basically they are as wide as

60
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:08.970
the box above them, okay?

61
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.690
And that button might
look familiar to you.

62
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.461
Maybe we have the button kinda
like that already, yeah?

63
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:24.000
It's a link photos from the road and
the magenta line official store.

64
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.020
So let's give you like five minutes.

65
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.018
See what you can do about styling those
two buttons right here inside of this

66
00:04:33.018 --> 00:04:33.850
code pen.

67
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.799
So go ahead and go.
