00:00:00.061 --> 00:00:04.764
Welcome everyone to practical
CSS layouts I'm Jen Kramer and

2
00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.655
I am here to talk about taking your
CSS layouts to the next level.

3
00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:13.128
This course is going to cover
building three kinds of websites,

4
00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:17.134
I'm gonna show you what those are going
to look like here in just a moment.

5
00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:21.248
And the goal for
this is to exercise the part of front end

6
00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:25.194
development that gets
undervalued consistently.

7
00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:29.200
Two thirds of the front end
consists of HTML and CSS.

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.390
Only one third of the front
end consists of JavaScript.

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.249
Today we're gonna be working
with the two thirds.

10
00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:39.825
And one of the reasons I love teaching for
front end Masters is that their values

11
00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.930
align with mine in that fundamentals
are critically important.

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.842
So if you know how to code HTML, CSS and

13
00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:51.670
JavaScript from scratch,
you can build literally anything.

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.790
You don't have to keep up
with the latest frameworks.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.330
And so
that is what we will be doing today.

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.940
We will be working with HTML and CSS,
we're gonna write it all from scratch.

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.690
We are gonna be working
inside of code pen.

18
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.925
If you don't have a CodePen account,
I would recommend that you sign up for

19
00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:15.120
one at codepen.io, and I will be
giving you code pins along the way.

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.524
Those you can fork to your own account and

21
00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:20.790
then you can follow along
with me as I write code.

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.850
Why are we doing it in CodePen?

23
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.843
Because I think it's a great
teaching environment and

24
00:01:26.843 --> 00:01:29.610
particularly for HTML and CSS.

25
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.424
Every time I make a change It's
immediately reflected in the CodePen

26
00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:37.020
environment, so
you can see what the web page looks like.

27
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.909
We are not slowed down
by workflow additions or

28
00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.850
anything else that you might bundle
up with your web development process.

29
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.093
It gets you out of that mindset of all
these automatic things that are happening

30
00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:53.090
in the background to focus you exactly
on what's happening in the code.

31
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.511
You know exactly what the HTML and
the CSS, and

32
00:01:56.511 --> 00:02:02.070
we'll even do a tiny little bit of
JavaScript, what those are doing.

33
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.420
Trust me, I'm not writing any JavaScript.

34
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.410
We are going to get
JavaScript from other places.

35
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.410
But you'll see that in action as well.

36
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.756
The website for the course is available at

37
00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:20.530
practical.css.education, this
is the course website.

38
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.089
You can see here that we have a chapter
listing down here that will talk you

39
00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.965
through all of the things that you need
to know about this particular course.

40
00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:33.025
If you click on the link for
chapter one, this is where we're at.

41
00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:35.535
This is the prerequisites and the setup.

42
00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:39.074
And this is where I will show you
what the site is gonna look like,

43
00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:42.833
that we're going to build,
links to CodePen, that kind of thing.

44
00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:47.408
When we get into the next chapter,
you'll have references here for

45
00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:50.470
example, here we're working with colors.

46
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.220
Here's all the hex codes that
you're going to need to do that.

47
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.330
Here's the link to the CodePen,
where you're gonna put those in place.

48
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.256
Here's what the very first
page we're going to build,

49
00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:03.130
this is what it's gonna look like,
that kind of thing.

50
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.350
It's all here available on the website,
practical.css.education.

51
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.919
So we will be building three websites
in this course that I've affectionately

52
00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.260
called easy, medium and hard.

53
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.234
And that's only because that reflects
their levels of complication.

54
00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:25.378
There are websites for
a fictitional band called Magenta Lime.

55
00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:30.227
And I picked a band because there
are certain kinds of topics that lend

56
00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:36.010
themselves to being all about emotion as
opposed to trying to sell you something.

57
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.045
So pretty much every corporate website
we've ever built has been all about trying

58
00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:42.150
to get you to buy something,
or call them or

59
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.620
whatever that call to
action happens to be.

60
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.604
When you build websites for
movies or bands, other things,

61
00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:49.920
it's about feeling and emotion.

62
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.680
And so we can be a little bit
crazier with our designs.

63
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.090
We can be a little bit more innovative
in what it is that we're doing.

64
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.591
So this is Magenta Lime and
the easy version,

65
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:05.530
on the left hand side,
you'll see the mobile layout here.

66
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.120
So just some basic a little bit of text,
some pictures and some reviews.

67
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.922
When we go to tablet we are going to
change our layout a little bit as we

68
00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:20.430
often do, and when we get to desktop
we'll change our layout again.

69
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.320
So this is the quote easy version of this.

70
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.880
If you are relatively new to CSS, this is
gonna be a great place for you to start.

71
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.370
This is something that you'll
probably find kind of challenging.

72
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.419
If you have been in this field for
a while,

73
00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.550
you may find this a little bit too easy.

74
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.100
Don't panic, there's more.

75
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.390
So we're gonna take the work that
we did on that easy site, and

76
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.220
then we're gonna apply it and take things
to the next level with our medium site.

77
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.170
So we have mobile, tablet and desktop
here for the Magenta Lime of sight.

78
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.770
And so
here we're going to do a bunch of things.

79
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.850
We're gonna skin an audio player,
that actually will play music.

80
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.380
We're going to work on
a tracklist that we have here.

81
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.704
And if you take a look very closely,

82
00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.420
we have these crazy little
bits of layout that are here.

83
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.701
So this is the reviews and the images,

84
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:14.708
we go from mobile there on the top
to the tablet there on the bottom.

85
00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:19.250
And then over to this desktop layout
where it'll be a column over on the side.

86
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.368
So we have some interesting kind of layout
issues that we're going to encounter along

87
00:05:24.368 --> 00:05:25.400
the way here as well.

88
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.160
And then finally we're gonna get to
the difficult, so-called difficult site.

89
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.930
The track list that you see here on
the right-hand side is the mobile layout.

90
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.470
You can see that track list there,
that collapses, all right?

91
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.339
When it goes over to the tablet layout
here, you'll see that track list shows up

92
00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.420
on the left side of the album cover,
and it will open from the side.

93
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.823
Instead of opening down,
as it does on mobile,

94
00:05:54.823 --> 00:05:58.030
it'll open from the side and
we change the text of the button.

95
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.668
So there's a bunch of crazy
things that's going on with that.

96
00:06:00.668 --> 00:06:04.751
And of course, you'll also see those
diamonds, see those diamonds there?

97
00:06:04.751 --> 00:06:05.929
Those cool images?

98
00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:09.487
We are gonna lay that out as well,
we're gonna use Flexbox to do that.

99
00:06:09.487 --> 00:06:13.159
So, we got some crazy layout things
that are going on in here as well.

100
00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:14.019
Yes.

101
00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:17.149
&gt;&gt; Are we covering anything
about animations or transitions?

102
00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:20.499
&gt;&gt; Well, we'll be a little bit
of animations in transitions.

103
00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:23.272
It is not a focus of the course but
we will use them.

104
00:06:23.272 --> 00:06:26.819
There is a separate course in the front
end masters library that focuses

105
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.652
on animations and transitions, and

106
00:06:28.652 --> 00:06:31.626
if you want to know them in
detail you should check that out.

107
00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:36.961
Okay so, let me just go over some basics
here code pen if this is new for you.

108
00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:40.744
You'll wind up in a pen,
it will look like this., okay?

109
00:06:40.744 --> 00:06:46.130
So you'll have three boxes across the top
that will have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

110
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.989
You click the little, it looks like
a cupcake to me, I don't know,

111
00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:51.977
cupcake button up here at the top.

112
00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:55.411
And we are going to switch the view here,

113
00:06:55.411 --> 00:07:00.060
I usually like to put my code
over on the left hand side.

114
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.389
You can choose to do whatever you want.

115
00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.772
You can, of course, adjust these windows,
so I'm just gonna hide the JavaScript

116
00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:09.603
window because there's
nothing there that we need.

117
00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:15.772
And I prefer to do work this way
because then I can see my CSS right.

118
00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:20.121
Applied here,
we do this all day long in CSS, [LAUGH].

119
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:24.874
And so this is, will give us
a quick view of how the things

120
00:07:24.874 --> 00:07:29.138
are gonna look on mobile,
tablet, and desktop.

121
00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:34.672
To fork it down here at the bottom,
there's a button that says fork.

122
00:07:34.672 --> 00:07:38.985
And so if you click that button,
it will fork it.

123
00:07:38.985 --> 00:07:42.519
It will actually save it to your
account if you've created an account.

124
00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:46.763
And from that point on, it's saved for
in your account forever.

125
00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:49.574
There's some other features
here that I like to use,

126
00:07:49.574 --> 00:07:52.475
specifically the adding
to collection feature.

127
00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:56.205
So there is a so-called collection,
that's available.

128
00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:59.664
This link is inside of the website,
and so,

129
00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:03.789
wow, that was,
I clicked on the wrong thing there.

130
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.030
You try that again?

131
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.010
This is, this one.

132
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.589
So this is a collection of all of
the CodePens here, front end masters,

133
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:13.850
practical CSS layouts.

134
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.440
These are all the code pens.

135
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.464
Start and finish states for
everything that we're going to do today.
