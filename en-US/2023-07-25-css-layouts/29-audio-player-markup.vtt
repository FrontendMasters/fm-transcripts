WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.488
So the first thing that we'd like to
do is we'd like to substitute our

2
00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:07.060
audio track for the one that's here.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.440
So, if you play this audio right now,
it's this weird new age kind of thing.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.120
That's so not magenta line, right?

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.991
So, our audio track is right
here in the comment at the start

6
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:24.766
of the HTML If you copy that
URL you'll see here on line 8,

7
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:30.040
it's the second line of the HTML
there is an audio element here.

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.876
If you're not familiar with the audio
element this is an API built right in

9
00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:38.000
the HTML then we'll play audio files.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.150
But it's gonna play them with that
default browser sort of look.

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.580
So let us just drop in our correct URL for
our audio track.

12
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.850
And now when you play it,
it sounds more like Magenta Lime.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.320
Finest royalty-free music
that money can buy.

14
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.730
So there we go.

15
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.039
All right, the next thing I wanna do is if
you take a look at some of the elements

16
00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.980
that we have here on the page,
we have things that we can group together.

17
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.941
So if we review to our design here,

18
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:19.663
how might we lay this out without
thinking about our current HTML or

19
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:23.359
anything else, how might we lay this out?

20
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.971
&gt;&gt; You want the play button in a row,

21
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:27.930
and then pretty much everything
else in another row.

22
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.580
&gt;&gt; You might have the play button, right?

23
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.118
That's gonna be in one row,
along with probably bombshell looks and

24
00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:35.190
track seven, right?

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.378
The name of the song and
the track number and then in another row,

26
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:43.640
we're gonna have what
&gt;&gt; Song and the volume.

27
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.135
&gt;&gt; We're gonna have the sort of that
slider so we can fast forward through

28
00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:53.020
the song and the slider for
the volume with that icon, right.

29
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.644
So we probably want to
put in some groupings for

30
00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:59.209
those as we put this together so
let's take a look at our HTML and

31
00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.923
see if we can understand
what's going on here.

32
00:02:01.923 --> 00:02:06.795
So clearly we have a div with an audio
player container that goes all the way

33
00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:12.900
around this, awesome then we have our next
line is the actual audio track, awesome.

34
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.209
Then we have this audio
player ish a paragraph,

35
00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.750
we have the button that's
called the play icon.

36
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.780
And then we're into the time,
right that time, the slider and the time.

37
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.468
So anybody want to take a guess
at what's going on here?

38
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:36.967
We have this thing called
play icon what is that?

39
00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:43.571
That's the play button right here yeah

40
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:48.201
then it says current time where is that?

41
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.601
&gt;&gt; It's the time slider.

42
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:54.088
&gt;&gt; This end of the time slider
okay remember it says 00 here

43
00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:58.772
that's what it starts at
&gt;&gt; But because I played the song, right,

44
00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:02.860
the number here may be different
JavaScript's updating that, right?

45
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.409
Okay, then we have our range slider,
which is what?

46
00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.644
&gt;&gt; The thing you just moved.

47
00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:13.750
&gt;&gt; The thing I just pulled right here,
yeah.

48
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.760
And then we have a duration
it's also set to 0.

49
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.971
Where's that?

50
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:19.824
&gt;&gt; The end.

51
00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.521
&gt;&gt; That's the end right here.

52
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.010
And remember the numbers
different because JavaScript.

53
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.340
Yeah?

54
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.300
Okay.

55
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.130
Then we also have down here an output.

56
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.033
Says 100, yeah?

57
00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:35.210
Okay, that's this number here.

58
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.774
What's this next thing?

59
00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:39.199
&gt;&gt; Volume.

60
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.075
&gt;&gt; Volume slider,
that's this actual slider here.

61
00:03:42.075 --> 00:03:43.900
And then we have our mute icon, right?

62
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.680
Because we can mute it,
or we can play it, right?

63
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.350
Okay, so given that,
how should we group together?

64
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.100
We wanna have on one particular
row we just said we wanna have

65
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.630
the words bombshell looks a Play icon and
the words track seven.

66
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.182
What should we start with here on
the screen in terms of grouping those,

67
00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:12.043
anyone have any ideas?

68
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:18.580
&gt;&gt; We want the sliders
to be on the same row?

69
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.930
&gt;&gt; We definitely want the sliders
to be on the same row.

70
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.274
Yeah, so what would you suggest them what
would be some elements you would group

71
00:04:27.274 --> 00:04:28.499
first the sliders.

72
00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:35.900
&gt;&gt; Maybe in this ad or
something to give them the same class, or

73
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.034
I don't know some kind of div.

74
00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:38.845
&gt;&gt; How about this?

75
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.820
Let me let me rephrase that question.

76
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.494
What line numbers would you
want to group together?

77
00:04:43.494 --> 00:04:44.461
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

78
00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:54.149
15 sit the volume slider and
the 12, the range slider.

79
00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:59.420
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah so lines 14, 15, and
16, that's our volume thing, right?

80
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.720
So maybe we should group those.

81
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.374
So we're gonna call this
div with a class of volume,

82
00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:12.781
because we are super creative that way and
/div.

83
00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:18.360
Okay, so we know that's our volume slider,
all right?

84
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.965
Does anybody have another group that's
maybe kind of obvious that we might want

85
00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:23.936
to put in place?

86
00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:29.020
&gt;&gt; Maybe a navigation group?

87
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.680
&gt;&gt; A navigation group?

88
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah
&gt;&gt; Where?

89
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.990
Like a Sikh group.

90
00:05:36.382 --> 00:05:37.064
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So

91
00:05:37.064 --> 00:05:41.503
what line numbers are you
talking about here in the HTML?

92
00:05:41.503 --> 00:05:44.215
&gt;&gt; 11 12 and 13.

93
00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:45.478
&gt;&gt; 11 12 and 13, so

94
00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:50.120
that is the like the sort of the place
lighter kind of thing, right?

95
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:58.226
So let's put in a div with
a class of he play-slider.

96
00:05:58.226 --> 00:06:00.080
That's what those things are.

97
00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:05.438
/div.

98
00:06:05.438 --> 00:06:10.147
Okay, and of course, since we're being
very careful about this as we add these

99
00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:14.014
elements, you can always go back and
hit the play button again and

100
00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:16.069
make sure it still works, right?

101
00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.790
[LAUGH] Because we don't want
to break this as we go through.

102
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.840
Okay, so
that was relatively straightforward.

103
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.670
We have a volume group we
have a place lighter group.

104
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.420
Now we have some words.

105
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.280
We have a button that's
our Play icon right?

106
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.445
And so,
what might that match here in this design?

107
00:06:42.098 --> 00:06:44.857
That's our play button, right?

108
00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:48.060
Maybe these are some words
that are already there.

109
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.080
Maybe we can add these words, right?

110
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.240
Okay, so let's try that.

111
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.680
So, let's make a group here.

112
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.420
So a div with a class of name hyphen play,
because that's what's going on.

113
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.095
It's the name of the track and
the play button.

114
00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:13.840
And we can change the name here.

115
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.510
So where it says Audio Player ish.

116
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.530
Let's change that, and
the name of the track is Bombshell Looks.

117
00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:32.247
Then we have our Play icon and then
we're gonna add a paragraph after that,

118
00:07:32.247 --> 00:07:36.130
and we'll say track 7
because that's what it is.

119
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.865
Now obviously we're doing this
in a static kind of way where

120
00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:45.237
we're just hard coding in the name of
the track and all that kind of stuff.

121
00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:51.200
Your next project will be how do we come
up with a dynamic list of audio files?

122
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.967
And whenever you click on
the link it's gonna load in here

123
00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:59.652
right that is your
homework have fun [LAUGH].

124
00:07:59.652 --> 00:08:04.640
We are not gonna do that today we are just
really focused on laying this out okay

125
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.030
all right so
it definitely looks a little bit weird.

126
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.739
Yeah, but

127
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:14.090
we have to start with good HTML before
we can really start laying things out.

128
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.513
All right,
the last thing I want to do now,

129
00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:23.456
we can start collapsing a few things
here so we have our bombshell looks play

130
00:08:23.456 --> 00:08:28.733
contract seven that corresponds with
this bombshell looks Play icon track 7.

131
00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:31.980
There's a Div around that, so
we can make that into a row.

132
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.920
Check, okay,
then we have a play slider, right?

133
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.210
And we have our volume.

134
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.300
So if we look at that, there's our
play slider and our volume, right?

135
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.110
But they are not in the same row.

136
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.524
Those are just free little elements
hanging out in space right now,

137
00:08:52.524 --> 00:08:54.700
aren't they, right?

138
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.130
See how I came up with that?

139
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.891
So what do we need to do to
make them go on the same row?

140
00:08:59.891 --> 00:09:01.120
&gt;&gt; Flexbox.

141
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.310
&gt;&gt; Well, flexbox or grid, yeah.

142
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.130
And what do we need to
do to make that happen?

143
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.970
&gt;&gt; Wrap them.

144
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.790
&gt;&gt; They need to have a container, right?

145
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.040
We've got to have a container or
some kind of parent for them.

146
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:19.649
So let's give them a div
with a class of controls,

147
00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:24.005
and then a /div after that.

148
00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:27.235
So now they're grouped, so name play,

149
00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:32.740
we have the three elements that
are gonna show up in our first row.

150
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.240
Yeah?

151
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.411
And then the play slider and

152
00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:39.170
the volume are the controls that
are gonna show up in the second row.

153
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.190
This is really, really super
important what I just did here.

154
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.033
Do you see how I just sliced and diced
that HTML to put everything together so

155
00:09:47.033 --> 00:09:48.900
that we could do the layout?

156
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.510
It looked absolutely impossible before,
didn't it?

157
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.449
But now that we have the layout
all together like this, and

158
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:59.499
we actually haven't changed
the look all that much,

159
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:03.470
now we can start to apply CSS to
make it look exactly as we want.

160
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.180
Make sense?

161
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.020
Awesome.

162
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.359
So this is a big take away for

163
00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:12.170
you because you'll always be
working with other people's code.

164
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.683
So you wanna like make these
