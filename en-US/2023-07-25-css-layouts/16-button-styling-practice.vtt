1
00:00:00.077 --> 00:00:03.744
All right, so,
we need to style our buttons,

2
00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:07.987
so let's come up with a style here for
these buttons.

3
00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:11.915
I'm gonna go to my tour layer here and

4
00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:17.381
I'm gonna start with .button-primary,
okay?

5
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:23.116
All right, so this is the way the buttons
are gonna look, like this, all right?

6
00:00:26.974 --> 00:00:32.874
Right now, they don't look like that,
what would be your suggestions?

7
00:00:32.874 --> 00:00:39.302
And I'll zoom in, and button-primary
are these ones here that say Buy Tickets.

8
00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:43.445
So, what would be your suggestions for
styling this button?

9
00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:44.911
&gt;&gt; Border.

10
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.003
&gt;&gt; Maybe a border is a good
place to start, what else?

11
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:49.911
&gt;&gt; Color.

12
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:52.894
&gt;&gt; We have a border, a color, what else?

13
00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:53.938
&gt;&gt; Border radius.

14
00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:56.131
&gt;&gt; A border radius, what else?

15
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.815
&gt;&gt; Background: none.

16
00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:00.330
&gt;&gt; Background: none, yeah, what else?

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.321
&gt;&gt; Some padding.

18
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.703
&gt;&gt; Some padding, what else?

19
00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:04.789
&gt;&gt; Uppercase letters.

20
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.343
&gt;&gt; Uppercase letters, what else?

21
00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:11.325
&gt;&gt; Rounding the radius of the square so
it's not so sharp on the edge.

22
00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:14.484
&gt;&gt; Yeah, border radius, yeah, what else?

23
00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:16.928
&gt;&gt; Hover state?
&gt;&gt; Moving out to the side.

24
00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:17.571
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

25
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:18.675
&gt;&gt; Moving them over to the side.

26
00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:20.383
&gt;&gt; We definitely have
to do a layout thing.

27
00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:25.759
We're not gonna worry about that part
just yet, it's coming, what else?

28
00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.338
&gt;&gt; Center the text.

29
00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.611
&gt;&gt; Center the text in the button.

30
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:32.107
Nobody has said the font.

31
00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:32.658
&gt;&gt; Ah-ah.

32
00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:37.283
&gt;&gt; Ah-ah, the font is Serif now,
isn't it, okay?

33
00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:42.250
So, the font, we can actually change this
on the body, and the reason we gonna do

34
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.604
that is because previously we had only one
font family, everything was Sans-serif.

35
00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:52.349
Now, predominantly in our design,
you'll just have to take my word for it,

36
00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:53.519
it is a Serif font.

37
00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:58.776
So I am gonna change this to Serif as
my base body family, and that will

38
00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:04.954
change everything immediately, okay,
even our buttons and all the rest of it.

39
00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:05.570
Okay, so

40
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.269
it sounds like you guys had a pretty
good idea of how to style this button.

41
00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.508
So I am gonna give you five
minutes to style just this button,

42
00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:17.974
the Buy Tickets button, and

43
00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:23.442
you heard all the things that need
to change over what you have.

44
00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:28.241
So let's take five minutes and
write a style for that button, go.

45
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.752
All right,
how'd you do with those buttons, good?

46
00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:41.164
All right, tell me how to style them.

47
00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:42.947
We can just sorta go through here, and

48
00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:46.035
everybody tell me one property that
I ought to add to this button.

49
00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:49.513
So we'll start over here with you,
Kelsey, tell me something I should do.

50
00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:51.263
&gt;&gt; text-transform: uppercase.

51
00:02:51.263 --> 00:02:54.493
&gt;&gt; text-transform: uppercase.

52
00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.415
Okay, good start, Andrew, what you got?

53
00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:06.322
&gt;&gt; border: 2px solid: magenta.

54
00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:10.665
&gt;&gt; var(--magenta), okay?

55
00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:14.076
2px solid, var(--magenta), nice.

56
00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:17.220
Patrick, what you got?

57
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.477
&gt;&gt; padding: 1rem 2rem.

58
00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:25.223
&gt;&gt; 1rem 2rem, okay, nice, looks good.

59
00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.206
Jason, what you got?

60
00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.247
&gt;&gt; Set your color to magenta.

61
00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:36.065
&gt;&gt; color: var(--magenta).

62
00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:40.017
Nice, Michael, what you got?

63
00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:42.534
&gt;&gt; I did a border radius of 10 pixels.

64
00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:49.026
&gt;&gt; border-radius: 10px, sweet.

65
00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:51.658
By the way, why pixels on border-radius?

66
00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:54.389
Because, I mean, does it need to respond?

67
00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:54.905
Probably not,

68
00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:57.253
you probably want the same amount of
rounding no matter where you are.

69
00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.507
So pixels are just fine.

70
00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:01.049
Siya, what you got?

71
00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.330
&gt;&gt; I just switched text-alignment: center,
but

72
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.174
it looks kinda centered to me, [LAUGH].

73
00:04:05.174 --> 00:04:09.616
&gt;&gt; Okay, text-align: center,
there's no problem,

74
00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.617
assuring that that in fact happens.

75
00:04:12.617 --> 00:04:14.565
Anything else?

76
00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:17.034
&gt;&gt; text-decoration: none for
the Buy Tickets.

77
00:04:17.034 --> 00:04:23.824
&gt;&gt; text-decoration: none,
that's a good addition.

78
00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:28.520
Okay, so there we go, looking good?

79
00:04:30.376 --> 00:04:33.811
All right,
let's see if I have anything else.

80
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.319
I had a just a couple of other things.

81
00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:41.506
Let's see, I had a font weight of 600,
just to make them bold.

82
00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:43.836
Did that actually do anything?

83
00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:51.869
700, 600, Did that do anything?

84
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.266
Yeah, that did something, okay.

85
00:04:57.266 --> 00:05:01.929
So I made the text bold for
whatever reason.

86
00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:07.022
And let's see, uppercase,

87
00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:13.699
I did a display, display: inline-block.

88
00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.282
And that is so that we can put
potentially a little bit of margin on it,

89
00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:21.610
and maybe that comes later.

90
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.535
The other thing that I
added here that you might

91
00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:29.976
be interested in doing is
a white-space of nowrap.

92
00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:35.855
Anyone have any idea what that is,
white-space of nowrap?

93
00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:40.056
Okay, so the idea here is
that if we have long text and

94
00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:45.608
we start squashing this together,
see how this is not going to wrap.

95
00:05:45.608 --> 00:05:53.350
If we don't have that in place,
Then the buttons will wrap, see that?

96
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.229
[SOUND] So
if you don't want the words to wrap,

97
00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:05.122
then you add that, white-space: nowrap.

98
00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:09.786
Cool, and they are different widths

99
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:14.303
here on the page is the other thing.

100
00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:17.165
Eventually this will matter,
doesn't matter right now, but

101
00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:20.626
when we put them in this column, you
probably want them to be the same width.

102
00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:27.824
So, you can set a width there so that
they're all wind up being that same width,

103
00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:32.024
and for whatever reason I said 170 pixels.

104
00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:37.913
Okay, good, so now,

105
00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:43.188
we have a whole bunch of buttons
that are exactly the same width.

106
00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:48.024
Well done, everybody, yay,
[APPLAUSE] good job, good job, good job.
