1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.765
The very very last thing we need
to do now with our design is to

2
00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:07.670
set up our desktop break point.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.540
So to remind you what these look like
we've got our mobile is under control.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.050
It's over on the right hand side.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.940
We've got our tablet under
control there in the middle.

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.550
Now we need to worry about our layout
over there on the left hand side.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.752
And as you see here, we have a nav bar,

8
00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:28.069
we have our album cover,
our audio, our reviews.

9
00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.225
Then over on the right column
we have our advertising boxes,

10
00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.976
our diamonds, and
all of the other small elements, and

11
00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:43.630
then the footer has wound up
being over on the left again.

12
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.791
So when we look at a type of
layout kind of like that,

13
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:51.721
we need to start thinking about how do we
group together these elements such that

14
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.610
we can lay everything out for desktop.

15
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.520
So let's put that together now.

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.320
If we take a look at our HTML at a very,
very high level.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.060
We have a div with a class of wrapper
around everything, as you know.

18
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.680
Then we have our header, our main grid.

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.789
Remember, main grid contains our cover and

20
00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.906
our track list are contained
inside of that main grid.

21
00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:19.204
And the cover includes the cover and
the audio player.

22
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.880
We have our side of reviews.

23
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.070
That's another element that we have there.

24
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.220
We have our album Magenta Lime,
that's the box with the guys in it.

25
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.218
We have our diamond box, and

26
00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:36.550
then I've called this thing
just CTA as in call to action.

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.042
That's all the extra little stuff down
there at the bottom, the buttons,

28
00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:42.020
the lightning bolts, the and so forth.

29
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.950
All the other little small stuff.

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.650
And then we have the footer.

31
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.707
So let's put in some groupings here.

32
00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:51.598
It's not going to break any of our
layouts that have come before, but

33
00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:56.309
let's put in some groupings now, that will
help us with our desktop based layout.

34
00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:00.464
So I am going to group together
these elements with just an old div,

35
00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.180
because we're not adding
anything semantically here.

36
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.300
We just need something to hold a class.

37
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.851
So I'm going to say here
at the very first one,

38
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:18.460
we're gonna say div with a class of left,
because it's gonna go on the left.

39
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.060
And inside this div I am
going to put in a header,

40
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.973
a main grid and my reviews,
because that will

41
00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:35.292
show up on the left hand
side of our layout/div.

42
00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:41.572
Then I'm going to put in another
div with a class of right.

43
00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:49.217
And this div is going to include
our boxes, our diamond images, and

44
00:02:49.217 --> 00:02:51.597
all of the other small elements.

45
00:02:59.332 --> 00:03:01.771
And then we have the footer by itself.

46
00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:06.321
So basically we have a wrapper, it has
three children, has div with a class of

47
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.384
left, div with a class of right and
footer, that's all we've got.

48
00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:15.110
So now we have our div with a class of
wrapper all the way around the outside.

49
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.360
We have a div with a class of left, a div
with a class of right, and our footer.

50
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.460
So now all we have to do is write
our grid-based layout for this.

51
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.503
I'm just gonna add this to the bottom of
the page because this is a general page

52
00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:31.150
layout that is going to apply everywhere.

53
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.270
It's not really associated with any
of our layers such as they are.

54
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.132
So I'm just gonna put this down
here in our last media query,

55
00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:42.390
which is a desktop based media query here.

56
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.316
So the first thing that I'm going to do is
turn this into a minimum width of 1440,

57
00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:51.920
which is a number that came
to us from the designer.

58
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.371
So we have our wrapper
set to a maximum width of

59
00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:03.543
1440 as well, and
now we can say display grid,

60
00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:07.754
and we can say our grid template columns,

61
00:04:07.754 --> 00:04:13.560
I kinda want a 60 40 split
in terms of the sizing here.

62
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.190
In other words,
not two evenly sized columns.

63
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.984
I want the left side to be slightly
larger than the right hand side,

64
00:04:21.984 --> 00:04:25.921
so I'm going to use 6fr, 4fr, to do that.

65
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:36.434
Then we can set up a bunch of
other styles here for this.

66
00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:45.104
Remember that we had some classes earlier
called Hide Tablet and Hide Mobile.

67
00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:46.500
These are up in the reviews, and

68
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.610
I think we've probably already
declared these in the reviews.

69
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.994
I'm gonna re-declare them here again so

70
00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:56.569
that we get a very clear picture as to
what's going on at our desktop dimension.

71
00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.213
So we'll say display block,

72
00:04:58.213 --> 00:05:02.170
we want those little lightning bolts
in between the reviews to show up.

73
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.000
Then we can say left.

74
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.972
We're gonna have to give this a very
specific place for it to appear,

75
00:05:12.972 --> 00:05:15.593
because when we make
this screen big enough.

76
00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.291
And mine will not go big enough.

77
00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.384
We wanna be sure to have all
of our elements show up here.

78
00:05:27.384 --> 00:05:32.084
And what's gonna happen right now is our
footer will wind up showing up all the way

79
00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:34.010
down here at the bottom.

80
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.195
And we actually want our footer to
show up more in this area here,

81
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:41.854
with this right column going
long down here on the side.

82
00:05:51.403 --> 00:05:56.324
So, I'm going to call out my grid column.

83
00:05:56.324 --> 00:06:02.204
So 1/2 and my grid-row, so 1/2.

84
00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:05.413
Because we want everything
that's there on the left,

85
00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:09.889
we want it to take up our first column,
and we want it to take up our first row.

86
00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:17.169
Likewise for our right side,

87
00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.600
we want that to take up
our grid-column of 2/3.

88
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.568
So we want that to take
up the next column and

89
00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:32.674
grid-row, we want that to take up 1/3.

90
00:06:32.674 --> 00:06:37.821
So we want it to occupy the row
that will have all of left and

91
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:42.559
it will occupy the row that
will contain our footer.

92
00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.558
In addition, because that last button
that we have over there in that right

93
00:06:46.558 --> 00:06:50.113
column doesn't necessarily have
any margin associated with it,

94
00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:52.495
let's give it a little
bit of margin there.

95
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:59.410
Margin-bottom of 5rem, that way it doesn't
crash into the very bottom of the browser.

96
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.987
And then finally, we can specify
where we want our footer to appear.

97
00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:10.891
Footer, and
we're gonna say our grid column is 1/2,

98
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:14.347
so it's over on the left column.

99
00:07:14.347 --> 00:07:17.743
We want our grid row to be 2/3, so

100
00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:22.290
it'll appear underneath
of that left column.

101
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.780
We don't want it to overlap it.

102
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.960
We want it to appear underneath.

103
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.920
And then we can control exactly where
we want it to appear via margin.

104
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.740
So let's just check how this looks so far.

105
00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:43.158
So as we scroll down here, here's
the footer down here at the bottom, and

106
00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:48.585
it is showing up in the second row but
it still kinda got a large gap here.

107
00:07:48.585 --> 00:07:54.455
So we can convince it to display a little
bit higher using negative margin.

108
00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:07.066
And I'll do that by adding
a margin on the top of -20 rem,

109
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:11.702
and that was derived just by trial and
error.

110
00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:15.447
So now, when we take a look at this again,

111
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.837
That will pull the footer up a little
bit closer to the reviews and

112
00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:25.771
give us a little bit of that extra
space over here on the side for

113
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:29.341
the additional items that
are in the right hand column.

114
00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:32.650
Now the other problem that we
have here is our navigation bar.

115
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.610
You'll see that our navigation bar is
crashing into our right column here.

116
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.128
And so we might need to tweak this a
little bit to make this work a little bit

117
00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:42.732
better.

118
00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:59.764
If we go back into our nav styling here,

119
00:08:59.764 --> 00:09:02.737
we have a style for top,

120
00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:11.021
And it has no maximum
width associated with it.

121
00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:15.385
So let's give it a max
width of 600 pixels.

122
00:09:18.098 --> 00:09:23.111
And now when we go back to
the way this page looks

123
00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:30.358
Now our navigation is aligned
a little bit better over our cover.

124
00:09:30.358 --> 00:09:33.754
It doesn't smash into
the side here on desktop.

125
00:09:33.754 --> 00:09:38.182
And it continues to look okay here
on tablet although now it's up

126
00:09:38.182 --> 00:09:43.710
a little bit here on the tablet, so
we can add some more styling on that.

127
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:51.260
So here in the top UL, we can give this
a gap of one rem instead of two rem.

128
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:59.680
And for the margin, let's change
that to a margin of 0.5 rem 0 0 0.

129
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.185
And that will push that navigation
bar into better alignment here so

130
00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:06.090
that it's not off anymore.

131
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:12.930
So now as we make our page bigger,
the desktop layout looks great.

132
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.800
As we make our page smaller,
we still have our working track list.

133
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.210
The navigation looks good.

134
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.790
Until we get to our mobile dimensions,
there's our button.

135
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.530
Get a little further and
the name disappears.

136
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.320
So there we are.

137
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.943
We are all done with our
more challenging design.
