00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:04.665
So now that we kinda have a sense
of what's going on here, vaguely,

2
00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:07.930
the HTML is certainly easy to understand.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.530
Let's get into that and
start making changes to our HTML, right?

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.993
We need to add the logo, all right?

5
00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:19.225
And the logo actually changes
a little bit across break points.

6
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:22.433
We're gonna have the logo,
just that magenta lime,

7
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.801
the lime with the lightning
bolt at mobile dimensions.

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.300
We'll have that lime with
the word Magenta Lime next to it.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.965
We can have that at tablet dimensions
with the hamburger button.

10
00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:35.923
And then when we get to desktop,
we'll have the lime,

11
00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:40.370
the magenta lime and
the full navigation bar, okay?

12
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.180
So we need to come up with some
way of including all of that.

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.610
We need to modify the navigation bar to
include links to home, tour, and store.

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.780
They can all just go
to a placeholder link.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.163
So why don't you take five minutes and

16
00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:59.280
see if you can make those
modifications here to the HTML?

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.270
So what you're gonna need in order to
get this done, at the top of the HTML in

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.918
the comment up here, you'll see I've given
you a link to the SVG for that lime logo.

19
00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:12.839
You could put that in an image element, or

20
00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:18.778
if you've put that directly in your web
browser like this, it'll show you the SVG.

21
00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.834
And then if you view the source for
the page,

22
00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:26.719
it'll give you the SVG code,
if you wanna include that code instead.

23
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.005
Some of you look surprised, you didn't
know you could do that, did you?

24
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.445
Yeah, you totally can.

25
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:35.679
So you could just put in the URL for
the SVG in the browser window.

26
00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.409
And then just right-click somewhere and
say View Page Source or

27
00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.483
whatever similar it is, and
that'll give you that code for that SVG,

28
00:01:43.483 --> 00:01:45.918
which you can just copy and paste, okay?

29
00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.690
See if you can get that in place,
the logo,

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.091
the word Magenta Lime in the correct font
and make the change to the navigation bar.

31
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.047
So all of these are HTML changes.

32
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.971
Tell me some of the changes that you made.

33
00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:06.680
&gt;&gt; Including the image.

34
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.719
&gt;&gt; You put in the image,
and how did you do that?

35
00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.244
&gt;&gt; I originally was using a picture, but
then I realized that the title that you

36
00:02:15.244 --> 00:02:18.425
wanted next to it at various
sizes was just the h1, so

37
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:20.992
I went back and
just changed it to an image.

38
00:02:20.992 --> 00:02:22.048
&gt;&gt; You went back and

39
00:02:22.048 --> 00:02:24.801
used an image element with the SVG-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

40
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:25.775
&gt;&gt; URL?

41
00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.413
Certainly, that works.

42
00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:32.940
So you would have h1, the a href, and
then that image element right here, okay?

43
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000
So it's definetly one way to do it.

44
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.145
The other way to do it
is to do what I did,

45
00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.900
which is to put in
the actual SVG in line here.

46
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.290
Either one of those is absolutely fine.

47
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.367
It ultimately depends on what
you're gonna do with this SVG.

48
00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:48.690
As we know, if you're gonna do hovers and
stuff like that,

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.890
you probably want the SVG in directly.

50
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.500
If you're not,
the image element is just fine.

51
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.823
And then you said you put
in the words Magenta Lime,

52
00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:01.355
you just typed them on in
there directly in the h1?

53
00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:01.981
&gt;&gt; Correct.

54
00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:07.375
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I've got mine here in the h1.

55
00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.955
I put a span element around it,
didn't give it a class,

56
00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:12.640
just put a span around it.

57
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.409
Why on earth would I do that?

58
00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:21.853
&gt;&gt; If you wanna make it inline?

59
00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:25.719
&gt;&gt; It is an inline element,
that's for sure.

60
00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:30.226
Remember I said sometimes we're
gonna have the SVG by itself and

61
00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:33.827
sometimes we're gonna have
the SVG with the name.

62
00:03:33.827 --> 00:03:36.714
[SOUND] So
if we put that span around the name,

63
00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:41.410
we now have something to grab on to
make that name appear and disappear.

64
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.180
So that's why I put that there, okay?

65
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.217
Other changes that you might
have made along the way.

66
00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:55.272
&gt;&gt; My approach to that same thing was
just to paste the SVG before the h1.

67
00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:56.431
&gt;&gt; Before the h1?

68
00:03:56.431 --> 00:04:00.183
So you actually put it sort of right here,
you put your SVG?

69
00:04:00.183 --> 00:04:03.601
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's great.

70
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:07.824
The only problem with that
is it's not clickable.

71
00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:11.516
So if you want people to be able to
click it and go back to the homepage,

72
00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:13.843
you'll wanna put it inside the link.

73
00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:15.782
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

74
00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:17.139
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

75
00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:25.703
All right,
any other modifications that you made?

76
00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:27.817
&gt;&gt; Change the LIs.

77
00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:29.275
&gt;&gt; Change the LIs down here?

78
00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.250
Yeah, so home, tour, and store, right?

79
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.756
There was one of those links that was
tagged with a class of action that gave

80
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:39.150
you that sort of buttony-looking link.

81
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.900
I just got rid of it,
we don't need it, all right?

82
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.335
Cool, so our HTML should be in good shape,

83
00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:51.886
now we can dive into our CSS,
that'll be in the next part.
