1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.864
The next thing we're gonna work
on is skinning an audio player.

2
00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:08.925
And there is a lot of work to do
where audio players are a concern,

3
00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.894
you may already know that you can play
audio directly inside of your browser and

4
00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:16.549
you can use an audio
HTML element to do it.

5
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:22.216
In fact If you just drop a MP3 URL
inside of your web browser window,

6
00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:26.847
you'll see an audio player there,
it works just great.

7
00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:30.967
We have a little play button,
it'll play whatever it is, and

8
00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.673
it'll have volume associated with it.

9
00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:39.078
Now, this is Chrome,
if we take a look at other styles,

10
00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:42.643
this is how it looks here in Firefox,

11
00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:47.253
looks like that kind of
completely different.

12
00:00:47.253 --> 00:00:53.879
And if we look at it in Safari,
it looks even more different [LAUGH].

13
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.404
Okay, and that's because this is
the browser's default styling for

14
00:00:58.404 --> 00:01:01.402
all of these various
kinds of audio elements.

15
00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.608
It may or
may not work with your page design.

16
00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:07.640
So, normally what developers
will do is they'll build

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.001
their own audio component for
their webpage.

18
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:14.839
Now, and use a little JavaScript
by the way to power it.

19
00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:18.820
So, we could go through that
whole process, and honestly,

20
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.717
it'd probably be a whole course by itself.

21
00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:24.645
So instead,
we're gonna cheat just a little bit.

22
00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:28.197
I am pointing you to this
great CSS tricks article,

23
00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:31.181
about how to create a custom audio player.

24
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:36.010
And if you go through this entire course,
it will explain everything to you,

25
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.874
explains to, you the various
elements of your audio player,

26
00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:41.980
it explains the JavaScript API.

27
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.861
It explains how to lay things out.

28
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:48.248
And we wind up with,
after a very long article,

29
00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:52.579
we wind up with a final code pen,
which I have forked for you.

30
00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.324
And, we have this audio player.

31
00:01:55.324 --> 00:02:00.016
So if you go into, we're still

32
00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:04.532
at practical CSS education.

33
00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:10.237
And we are in chapter 4, and
we are down at 4D, the audio player.

34
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:13.825
There are links to To
that CSS Tricks article,

35
00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:18.517
the article describing how that
audio player was created and

36
00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:22.577
our starting code pen,
which is right here, okay.

37
00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:25.338
So, already everything is in place,

38
00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:29.751
this is the HTML that comes from
CSS Tricks, there it all is.

39
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:35.235
This is their CSS,
all of this stuff here that we forked in.

40
00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:40.203
And we have all of the JavaScript
that's down here required to make

41
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:42.696
this thing work, so let us talk.

42
00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:47.381
We're gonna start by,
coming up with a plan.

43
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:52.859
We have, this was the way the audio player
looks, the one that we are starting with.

44
00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.381
This is what we want it to look
like when we're done, [LAUGH] okay.

45
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:01.296
So we have a little bit of
changing to do here, don't we?

46
00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:04.093
So, can anybody start to identify?

47
00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:08.917
What are the kinds of things that
we need to think about as we make

48
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:11.752
a change to this particular player.

49
00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.883
What do we need to think about,
what do we need to change?

50
00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:18.091
&gt;&gt; Positioning the elements.

51
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:21.880
&gt;&gt; The positioning of the elements
obviously not quite right,

52
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.149
you were gonna say?

53
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.705
&gt;&gt; We need to bring in the track and
the track number.

54
00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:31.934
&gt;&gt; We have a track and a track number,
that is not there on audio player -ish.

55
00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:35.218
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] right What else?

56
00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:36.074
&gt;&gt; Colors.

57
00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:39.645
&gt;&gt; The colors are completely wrong,
we need to swap that around.

58
00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:43.405
There's a lot of things to consider here.

59
00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:46.626
If you take a look here
inside of our code,

60
00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.862
you take a look inside of the JavaScript.

61
00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.520
The thing we don't wanna do is we don't
wanna break the functionality of our audio

62
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.325
player, right?

63
00:03:54.325 --> 00:04:00.431
Because this works [LAUGH] and
that's a really wonderful thing.

64
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:03.435
So, we wanna be sure to keep it working.

65
00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:08.483
[LAUGH] And in order to keep it working,
we need to make sure that we don't change

66
00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:13.085
elements, that are called for
here inside of our JavaScript, right?

67
00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:18.905
So our JavaScript has got things like
getElementById, playIcon, getElementById,

68
00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:24.420
audio player container, getElementById,
volume slider, mute icon, right?

69
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.703
So that stuff we need to be sure
to leave alone in our HTML,

70
00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:33.807
because otherwise we'll break
our JavaScript make sense, okay.

71
00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:37.173
So, that is always what I start with here,

72
00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:40.827
what can't I change in
the skinning process?

73
00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:43.937
And it looks like this
particular JavaScript author

74
00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:46.842
relied a lot on get element by ID,
which is nice.

75
00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:50.840
Because that gives us a little bit
more freedom with our classes, right?

76
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.627
Okay, the other thing is, where do the
icons come from, anytime you take a look

77
00:04:55.627 --> 00:05:00.505
at something like this, we need to figure
out where those icons are coming from.

78
00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:05.321
And if you take a look, actually
it's right here in the JavaScript,

79
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.154
it says it's importing this
thing called LottieWeb.

80
00:05:09.154 --> 00:05:14.147
And LottieWeb happens to be an icon
library with animated icons,

81
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.426
so that is where our
icons are coming from.

82
00:05:21.023 --> 00:05:28.142
So we don't wanna break that either
[LAUGH] so, there is our HTML.

83
00:05:28.142 --> 00:05:30.485
And this is always a good place to start,
right?

84
00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:33.159
I've told you this throughout the course,

85
00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.928
we wanna start by looking at our HTML and
starting to make some modifications,

86
00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:40.910
that then we can work with for
styling purposes.

87
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.330
And o again, when we're trying
not to break the JavaScript,

88
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.985
it's often easy enough to
add containers to this.

89
00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:52.791
So we can group elements here
with like divs, and so forth.

90
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:58.434
But removing elements tends to be tricky,
if we remove elements,

91
00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:02.073
we may break things all together, right?

92
00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:04.680
Make sense,
everybody clear on our approach here?
