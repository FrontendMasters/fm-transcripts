WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.739
Right, so we are done with easy design and
we are moving on to our medium design.

2
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:11.029
So we are in Chapter 4,
practical.css.education.

3
00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.603
And if you take a look at that website,

4
00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:18.113
you will see what we are going to
be building for our medium design.

5
00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:21.665
And actually we're not gonna
start with what is pictured here,

6
00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.517
we will start with the tour page.

7
00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:28.206
And the tour page, if you scroll
down about halfway down the page or

8
00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:31.404
so, you will find
a picture of the tour page.

9
00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:33.014
It looks like this.

10
00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:37.450
So we have now added to
the tours that we had before.

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.833
Already had the tours.

12
00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:43.992
Obviously, we're adding now a button so
that you can buy tickets.

13
00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:47.450
I notice we have some buttons
that are sold out, yeah.

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.174
Other changes that you see there?

15
00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:51.687
&gt;&gt; Gradient.

16
00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:52.676
&gt;&gt; Background gradiant.

17
00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:54.327
&gt;&gt; There's definitely
a background gradient.

18
00:00:54.327 --> 00:00:57.181
By the way, I apologize for
the stripy thing.

19
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:03.012
The way I took a screenshot of this
meant the gradient kept redrawing.

20
00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:04.508
So that's why it looks that way.

21
00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:07.108
It should be smooth gradient
from top to bottom.

22
00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.423
Any other changes that you see?

23
00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:11.967
&gt;&gt; It has social media.

24
00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.629
&gt;&gt; There's social media
down here in the footer.

25
00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:16.745
So that's something that
we're gonna need to build.

26
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.501
And anything else that you see?

27
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.300
&gt;&gt; Font.

28
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.546
&gt;&gt; The fonts are different, yeah.

29
00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.619
So we have some additional
fonts that are here in place.

30
00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.840
So that's the kinda stuff that we're
gonna think about here for our tour page.

31
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.717
So if you open up,
you're starting CodePen.

32
00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:40.017
All right, And

33
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:46.471
that starting CodePen, wow,
I forgot to put it on there.

34
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.547
So to get to the starting CodePen,

35
00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:54.118
click on the CodePen Collection
up here on the top.

36
00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:56.517
So put you into a table of contents.

37
00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:03.567
And on the second page, look for 4a,

38
00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:07.800
medium design tour page begin.

39
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.935
That is where we're going to start from,
okay?

40
00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.161
So 4a, medium design tour page begin.

41
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:16.961
I'll add the link for this.

42
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:21.884
Okay, so once we've got that open,
make sure you fork that to your account.

43
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:27.488
And so you'll see here what we have.

44
00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:35.583
We are starting with basically the stuff
that we had on our old site, okay?

45
00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:40.362
We've got some new wild and
wonderful things here that are coming in.

46
00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:44.801
I have given you a few things I was gonna
talk about in a little bit more detail,

47
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.686
just to sort of move
the course along a little bit.

48
00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:50.902
So let's just look at the markup here and
see what we've got.

49
00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:55.656
So at the beginning, we have a wrapper
here and I put a note at the top.

50
00:02:55.656 --> 00:03:00.732
Eventually, we need to add some top
navigation, we will add that later.

51
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:02.177
We have a wrapper around the whole thing.

52
00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:07.170
We have the header with the logojust like
we had before, nothing to change there.

53
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.325
We have our main focus of the site, that's
our tour, we have our individual dates.

54
00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:16.244
But now,
in addition to that date information,

55
00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:20.067
we have an a and
sometimes they have one class and

56
00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:25.051
sometimes they have two
button-primary button-sold out.

57
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:26.423
Make sense?

58
00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:32.846
Okay, and so that's goes down here
through the main part of the page.

59
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:38.221
Down here in the footer,
I've got some SVGs down here that are for

60
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:43.694
the social media, they are inside
of a link that go to SoundCloud,

61
00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:45.972
Spotify, and Instagram.

62
00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:47.864
Make sense?

63
00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:53.373
Okay, so always good to take a look
at your HTML before you start so

64
00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:57.094
you understand what you're working with.

65
00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:01.137
All right, so let's start making
some changes here to our CSS.

66
00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:06.382
So since we're working on the tour page,
where we're gonna start is we can get rid

67
00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:11.800
of this layer here for reviews, which just
doesn't apply to this particular page.

68
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.284
And to keep our CSS down, you can just
get rid of the layer for reviews.

69
00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:19.708
The media queries that are here,
we can get rid of those as well.

70
00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:24.603
We actually don't want it to do
the designs that we had for the easy page,

71
00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:28.393
right, where it goes to this wild and
wacky thing here.

72
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.342
So it doesn't work on this page.

73
00:04:30.342 --> 00:04:32.980
So let's get rid of that.

74
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.786
So inside of our media query for
the main width of 800 pixels,

75
00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:41.171
we can get rid of main,
main h1, and aside.

76
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.089
So basically,

77
00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:46.901
the only thing that we're keeping there
in that media query is our wrapper with.

78
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:50.722
Likewise in the larger media query,
get rid of main.

79
00:04:50.722 --> 00:04:52.995
So when you're done,
it should look like this.

80
00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.783
You should have base, header banner tour.

81
00:04:55.783 --> 00:05:01.400
You should have the media query
with just the wrappers in it, okay?

82
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.727
I'll give you a second.

83
00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:04.013
Everybody good?

84
00:05:04.013 --> 00:05:08.880
Okay, so let's focus on these
buttons here to start with.

85
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.540
So you'll see here, I have a button,
it's a link currently.

86
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.066
It says, Sold Out, okay?

87
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.543
And this one says, Sold Out.

88
00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:19.658
And then down here, I have Buy Tickets.

89
00:05:19.658 --> 00:05:23.108
That one's actually underlined,
everybody see that?

90
00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:27.447
Okay, let's look in the HTML
at how those are looking.

91
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:33.771
So I am up around line number 13.

92
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:38.368
So here, we have a paragraph,
inside of that we have a link.

93
00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:41.553
It says,
a class button-primary button-soldout.

94
00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:43.640
What is missing from that element?

95
00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:46.411
&gt;&gt; A button.

96
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:47.066
&gt;&gt; Href.

97
00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:49.591
&gt;&gt; There's an href missing, right?

98
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:53.033
There's no actual href in there,
there is nothing.

99
00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:56.311
When this button is clicked,
it doesn't go anywhere.

100
00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:57.609
How cool is that?

101
00:05:57.609 --> 00:06:02.004
This is the easiest way if you wanna
have a button that ultimately when you

102
00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:06.272
mouse over it, nothing happens,
it looks like that Sold Out button.

103
00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:07.977
This is the easiest way to code it.

104
00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:10.783
It goes nowhere, all right?

105
00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:13.026
Why didn't I use the button element here?

106
00:06:13.026 --> 00:06:16.005
Why did I use a instead of button?

107
00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:18.512
Anyone have any comment on that?

108
00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:26.888
Do we have any idea why I
would ever do such a thing?

109
00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:29.289
&gt;&gt; Cuz it's a link that goes
to an external website.

110
00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.601
&gt;&gt; It is a link.

111
00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.910
It actually doesn't matter if
it goes to an external website.

112
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.440
This is a link.

113
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.602
Obviously, it probably would go
to an external website, right,

114
00:06:37.602 --> 00:06:39.074
where you go buy your tickets.

115
00:06:39.074 --> 00:06:40.295
It's not a button.

116
00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:41.643
What are buttons used for?

117
00:06:41.643 --> 00:06:45.433
The actual HTML button,
what is that used for?

118
00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:50.807
&gt;&gt; Interpage, or sorry,
same page interaction, or form submission.

119
00:06:50.807 --> 00:06:53.709
&gt;&gt; Form submission, yes, that's one thing.

120
00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.978
Anything that has to do with JavaScript,
okay?

121
00:06:56.978 --> 00:07:00.074
So some kind of
functionality is happening,

122
00:07:00.074 --> 00:07:02.848
basically anything that's not a link.

123
00:07:02.848 --> 00:07:07.855
So if you wanna have a button, it looks
like a button, but it's going somewhere

124
00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:12.519
else, you code it like a link, and
then you style it to look like a button.

125
00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:14.071
Make sense?

126
00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:16.212
A link is a link, people.

127
00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:17.540
A link is a link.

128
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.866
We will die on this hill, all right?

129
00:07:20.866 --> 00:07:25.373
So that's what's going on for
those sold out ones.

130
00:07:25.373 --> 00:07:26.341
They have a class,

131
00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:29.805
but they have no href, that's gonna
help us make a Sold Out button.

132
00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:34.547
But notice that we still have
a hover state, look at that.

133
00:07:34.547 --> 00:07:37.300
That's because links have hover states.

134
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.060
So somehow we're gonna have
to disable that, yeah.

135
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.438
Down here, we have a hover state too,
but that when we actually want,

136
00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:48.381
because I mean ultimately that
would go somewhere, right?

137
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:54.377
Okay, and those are just
the button primary by itself.

138
00:07:54.377 --> 00:08:00.433
So let's go through and
set up some styling for these then.

139
00:08:00.433 --> 00:08:08.429
And so, Here's what I'm gonna do.

140
00:08:08.429 --> 00:08:12.352
Currently, we have a layer that's
called header-banner-tour.

141
00:08:12.352 --> 00:08:14.311
Let's turn off the part of that.

142
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:20.197
Let's rename that layer to just header and
banner, okay?

143
00:08:20.197 --> 00:08:22.417
And then down here, we have date and club.

144
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:25.648
Date and club, remember,
apply to this tour section.

145
00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:32.821
So I'm going to end my
layer here on line 136.

146
00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:37.167
So that'll just be header and
banner, those styles.

147
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:43.739
And then for date and club,
we'll set up a new layer, layer tour.

148
00:08:47.137 --> 00:08:49.854
And there's the date in
the club inside of that.

149
00:09:01.304 --> 00:09:03.149
Some other changes we're
gonna need to make.

150
00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:06.894
If we go to our base styling here,
right now on our body,

151
00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:09.937
we have a text-align center; that's set.

152
00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:12.151
In this medium design, we don't need that.

153
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.045
So you can get rid of
the text-align center on the body.

154
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.981
And in our variables up here,

155
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:27.654
we have a font variable here for
sans-serif.

156
00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:30.002
We will have two more variables.

157
00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:32.941
I've already set up this CodePen
to link to the Google fonts,

158
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:35.549
we don't have to go through
that whole process again.

159
00:09:35.549 --> 00:09:38.822
So you'll just trust me
that it was done correctly.

160
00:09:38.822 --> 00:09:43.601
We're gonna have a serif font, and

161
00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:50.784
I'm gonna call this Cormorant Garamond,
serif;.

162
00:09:50.784 --> 00:09:57.084
And I'm gonna add what's
called cursive and

163
00:09:57.084 --> 00:10:02.070
that one is Pacifico, cursive;.

164
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.727
So those are the three fonts
that we're working with so

165
00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:06.472
we can configure those variables.

166
00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:09.597
And then, of course,
if you were working in real life,

167
00:10:09.597 --> 00:10:13.331
you would add your Google font links
to those fonts and in CodePen.

168
00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:14.883
You would put it in
the right place in CodePen.

169
00:10:14.883 --> 00:10:16.356
I've already done that for you.

170
00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:26.164
One of the other nice things that we have
is we have a lovely gradient background

171
00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:30.391
to this page, instead of having
the solid teal color that we have now.

172
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:35.315
And there are lots of websites
if you Google for CSS gradient.

173
00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:40.540
I believe one is css-gradient.io
where you can just go and

174
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.151
create these gradients, so
I had done that for you.

175
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:51.100
And, Hopefully, this is relatively
straightforward to type in.

176
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.686
But anyway, if it's not, you can always
go to the ending CodePen and copy it.

177
00:10:54.686 --> 00:10:56.961
All right, this is our gradient.

178
00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:02.147
It's gonna be the name of our variable,
cuz it is.

179
00:11:02.147 --> 00:11:04.011
It's gonna be a linear gradient.

180
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:13.139
And into that,
we're gonna say 180deg, var(--black).

181
00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:19.505
So it's gonna go from black starting
at 0%, and it will go to var,

182
00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:24.545
oops, there's a comma, 0%, var(--teal).

183
00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:28.705
It's gonna go to teal at 100%.

184
00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:30.686
This is a pretty straightforward gradient.

185
00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:38.038
So normally, it would go from teal to
black, where the 180 switches it around,

186
00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:42.253
so black's on the top,
teal's on the bottom.

187
00:11:42.253 --> 00:11:47.774
And so that it will set up the gradient,
its here on the page.

188
00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:51.141
So just cuz you have a variable
doesn't mean it applies, right?

189
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:53.415
Where do I apply this?

190
00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:54.266
&gt;&gt; Body.

191
00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:57.013
&gt;&gt; Body.
&gt;&gt; On the body element, exactly.

192
00:11:57.013 --> 00:12:00.733
So instead of background
color of our teal,

193
00:12:00.733 --> 00:12:06.171
we can change that to var (--gradient),
see if that works.

194
00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:08.543
And it doesn't work, why doesn't it work?

195
00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:16.020
First rule of CSS, don't freak out.

196
00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.219
What's wrong?

197
00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:22.849
Says background color, doesn't it?

198
00:12:22.849 --> 00:12:26.607
This isn't a color, we just say background

199
00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:36.866
Okay, so gradients are different
than colors, don't freak.

200
00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:42.691
[LAUGH] Nice?

201
00:12:42.691 --> 00:12:44.257
Okay, much better,

202
00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:48.789
pops off the page a little bit
better than that teal by itself.

203
00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:50.591
All right, sweet, and

204
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:55.827
you can see it stretches all the way
down the page, isn't that nice?

205
00:12:55.827 --> 00:12:59.530
&gt;&gt; I think you need quote
around Pacifico on cursive.

206
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.248
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, Pacifico.

207
00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:06.104
Okay,
