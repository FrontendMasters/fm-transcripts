1
00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:02.947
So let's move on to the Tour
section of the page,

2
00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:05.632
now that we've got this
header taken care of.

3
00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:09.134
This is the part that's really super fun.

4
00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:17.119
So, I'm gonna recommend that you
fold up your HTML here, all right?

5
00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.638
So if we fold up all of our HTML here,
let's just open up main.

6
00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.784
Look at what's going on
here inside of main.

7
00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:33.855
Okay, cuz we wanna get some
columns going here with main.

8
00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:37.288
Anytime we wanna get columns we know
we're gonna work with flexbox or grid.

9
00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:40.667
And the first thing that we should think
about when we think about flexbox or

10
00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:41.321
grid is what?

11
00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:47.625
&gt;&gt; The structure of what
you are trying to achieve.

12
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.394
&gt;&gt; The structure of what
I'm trying to achieve.

13
00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:52.309
So in my HTML, where is the parent,

14
00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.502
where is the children, or
where is the container?

15
00:00:56.502 --> 00:00:58.668
Where are the items, okay?

16
00:00:58.668 --> 00:01:03.350
So here we have main that contains
all of the things that I wanna

17
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.611
lay out on this page, right?

18
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.244
So main is where I'm
going to apply my layout.

19
00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:13.052
And then all of those children inside,
there's an h1 and

20
00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:17.496
a bunch of paragraphs, they are what
will be laid out, make sense?

21
00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:19.345
Cool, let's write it.

22
00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.216
Okay, so we are in the Tour.

23
00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:28.362
We're in our Tour layer.

24
00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:32.309
I had my media query here,
I'm gonna run line 1 through 43.

25
00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:34.127
So there's my wrapper.

26
00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:40.777
All right, so
let's put in a style, main, &gt;*,

27
00:01:40.777 --> 00:01:46.864
this is a great thing to do anytime that
you are working with any kind of layout,

28
00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:54.388
this will always give you the border,
1px solid white.

29
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.231
So that's gonna give us a border around
all of these things that we're trying to

30
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:03.206
lay out, yeah?

31
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:06.150
Even though we have some h1s and
we have some paragraphs in there,

32
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.163
we have a border around everything,
so we can see what's going on.

33
00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:20.117
Here it is.

34
00:02:20.117 --> 00:02:25.240
Okay, and so now,
I'm gonna use grid for this.

35
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.902
And the reason why is
eventually I need my h1 to be

36
00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:34.695
all by itself, right,
sort of on a row by itself.

37
00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:38.665
And then all of these tour dates need
to be on a grid underneath, right?

38
00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:42.809
So I'm gonna use grid over flexbox for
this, for that reason.

39
00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:48.867
So how would I start writing
some grid layout here?

40
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.986
First of all, what is my selector?

41
00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:55.528
&gt;&gt; Wasn't it just main?

42
00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:57.804
&gt;&gt; It would be main, right?

43
00:02:57.804 --> 00:03:01.884
So on main, all right?

44
00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:03.720
And then how do I set this up for grid?

45
00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:07.065
&gt;&gt; display: grid?

46
00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:07.966
&gt;&gt; display: grid.

47
00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:15.177
Great, and nothing happens.

48
00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:19.198
Why not?

49
00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.746
&gt;&gt; You didn't give it any columns.

50
00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:22.256
&gt;&gt; I didn't give it any columns.

51
00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:26.570
Exactly, so grid-template-columns will be,

52
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.965
there's a bunch of ways to write this.

53
00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:35.551
Let's just write it this way, repeat( 3,

54
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:40.656
1fr), what does that mean?

55
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:44.405
&gt;&gt; Three columns,
each getting one fraction of the whole.

56
00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:45.882
&gt;&gt; One fraction of the whole.

57
00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:49.806
Whatever that whole is,
break it into three parts, right?

58
00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:54.342
Where do fractions, that fr unit,
where does that work in CSS?

59
00:03:57.095 --> 00:03:58.880
Can I use it anywhere?

60
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.979
&gt;&gt; No, just on grid.

61
00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.902
&gt;&gt; Just on grid.

62
00:04:02.902 --> 00:04:07.023
So sad, wouldn't it be great
if we could use fr anywhere?

63
00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:10.351
That would be amazing,
but it only works on grid.

64
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.107
Okay, so there we go.

65
00:04:12.107 --> 00:04:15.561
It did exactly what we told it to do.

66
00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:16.261
&gt;&gt; Looks great.

67
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:16.957
&gt;&gt; Looks great.

68
00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.217
We're done, moving on.

69
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.341
Now, if you like it, you can keep it.

70
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:26.163
There's nothing wrong with this,
but anyone wanna make a comment?

71
00:04:26.163 --> 00:04:29.213
Something you'd prefer.

72
00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:31.763
&gt;&gt; Tour needs to span
the entire width of the grid.

73
00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:37.037
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the designer said tour needs
to be on a plane all by itself, right?

74
00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:42.873
Okay, so let me remind you about grid and
how this all works.

75
00:04:42.873 --> 00:04:46.679
I keep touching my tablet and
it keeps moving my notes.

76
00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:53.165
Okay, so do you remember the story
of grid lines inside of grid?

77
00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:55.360
You ever heard about grid lines?

78
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.806
Okay, so in your grid you have, obviously,

79
00:04:59.806 --> 00:05:05.776
a series of lines represented
by these fine borders, yeah?

80
00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:11.361
Okay, and you can count these lines,
the numbers are their names.

81
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:15.120
You start counting like a human with
number one, not like an engineer.

82
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.387
Don't start with zero, okay?

83
00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:18.484
Count like a human.

84
00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:22.003
So this line here is?

85
00:05:22.003 --> 00:05:23.177
Line one.

86
00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:24.715
This line here is?

87
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:25.256
&gt;&gt; Two.

88
00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:25.867
&gt;&gt; Two.

89
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.155
This line here is?

90
00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:28.105
&gt;&gt; Three.
&gt;&gt; Three.

91
00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:29.292
This line here is?

92
00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.274
&gt;&gt; Four.
&gt;&gt; Four, okay?

93
00:05:31.274 --> 00:05:33.220
Likewise, we can do it with rows.

94
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.175
So this line on the top is?

95
00:05:35.175 --> 00:05:35.838
&gt;&gt; One.

96
00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:36.342
&gt;&gt; One.

97
00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:37.237
This one is?

98
00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:37.975
&gt;&gt; Two.

99
00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:41.002
&gt;&gt; Two, it looks like two lines
cuz of the two borders, but

100
00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:43.200
it's really just one line, all right?

101
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.836
This line here is?

102
00:05:44.836 --> 00:05:45.999
&gt;&gt; Three.
&gt;&gt; Three, and

103
00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.339
this one down here at the bottom is four.

104
00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:55.524
Yeah, okay, so
we can specify an area with our main h1,

105
00:05:55.524 --> 00:05:59.566
because that tour is an h1, and

106
00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:05.423
we can specify that area
using those numbers.

107
00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:11.914
So what would be the starting point for
our row?

108
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:14.363
What number do we start with for our tour?

109
00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:18.530
If we want it to go all the way across
here, what number do we start with?

110
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.348
&gt;&gt; One.

111
00:06:19.348 --> 00:06:23.539
&gt;&gt; One, so, we're gonna say grid-area, and

112
00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:31.491
the shorthand goes like this, Let me put
in the numbers and then I'll tell you.

113
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.372
1 is for that first row.

114
00:06:34.372 --> 00:06:37.615
Where is our column number starting?

115
00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:40.030
&gt;&gt; Online says -1.

116
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.700
&gt;&gt; -1, really?

117
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.539
No, not -1, we're starting with 1, yeah.

118
00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:49.573
&gt;&gt; 0?

119
00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:51.458
&gt;&gt; No, 1.

120
00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.463
We count like humans, we start with 1.

121
00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:58.623
We don't start with -1,
we don't start with 0, [LAUGH] okay?

122
00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:04.310
So we start with 1 as our starting row,
what is our starting column number?

123
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.070
&gt;&gt; 1.
&gt;&gt; 1, so that's the next number.

124
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.277
Okay, where is our ending row?

125
00:07:12.277 --> 00:07:14.444
&gt;&gt; 4.

126
00:07:14.444 --> 00:07:16.427
&gt;&gt; No, 2.

127
00:07:16.427 --> 00:07:19.577
&gt;&gt; How many say 2?

128
00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:21.733
How many say 4?

129
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:26.281
Okay, it would be 2, because we just
want it to span over this first row.

130
00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:28.313
Not all the rows, just the first row.

131
00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:34.359
So 2, that's our ending row,
and our column would be what?

132
00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:34.984
&gt;&gt; 4.

133
00:07:34.984 --> 00:07:38.326
&gt;&gt; 4, cuz we're gonna go all
the way over to the end.

134
00:07:42.412 --> 00:07:45.209
Woo, look at that.

135
00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:48.755
So let me give that to you as a comment.

136
00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:54.588
So this is grid-row-start
/ grid-column-start,

137
00:07:54.588 --> 00:07:58.565
these are the actual CSS properties.

138
00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:02.558
So you could write this out as
four separate statements or

139
00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:05.230
you can use the shorthand, up to you.

140
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.302
grid-row-end and

141
00:08:09.302 --> 00:08:13.855
grid-column-end.

142
00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:17.869
So that's the order of those numbers and

143
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:23.074
what they mean, and
that's the way you count them.

144
00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:25.637
So that tour wound up being pretty easy.

145
00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:29.117
Okay, so the last thing we need to do
is just get rid of our borders here,

146
00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:31.038
that was just for debugging purposes.

147
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.474
Okay, ooh, so pretty?

148
00:08:38.224 --> 00:08:41.749
Nice, and now you can do the thing.

149
00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:43.951
Ooh, it all works.

150
00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:45.284
How cool is that?

151
00:08:48.824 --> 00:08:51.868
Okay, fantastic.

152
00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:55.091
All right, so this last one here,

153
00:08:55.091 --> 00:09:00.661
we have our series of reviews and
images down here, right?

154
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.939
And we said we wanna
put those side-by-side.

155
00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:06.454
So inside of my reviews layer,

156
00:09:06.454 --> 00:09:11.397
I am going to add my media query so
that all my CSS is together.

157
00:09:11.397 --> 00:09:18.668
So @media (min-width: 800px).

158
00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:26.491
All right, so I'm gonna ask you guys,
you're gonna write this code for me.

159
00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:34.397
So always start with your HTML.

160
00:09:34.397 --> 00:09:37.192
We wanna put three boxes,
all next to each other.

161
00:09:40.123 --> 00:09:42.702
Where am I going to make my declaration?

162
00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:46.696
Where is the parent or the container?

163
00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:47.738
And where are the children?

164
00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:51.669
So where is the parent in this case?

165
00:09:51.669 --> 00:09:52.705
&gt;&gt; The aside.

166
00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:57.281
&gt;&gt; The aside, and where are the children?

167
00:09:57.281 --> 00:10:00.595
They're divs with a class of image-group,
right?

168
00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:04.235
Okay, so with that in mind,

169
00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:09.697
what do I write here
inside my media query,

170
00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:12.590
what's my selector?

171
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.236
&gt;&gt; aside.

172
00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:17.119
&gt;&gt; aside, okay, then what?

173
00:10:19.124 --> 00:10:19.939
&gt;&gt; display: grid.

174
00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:20.840
&gt;&gt; display: grid.

175
00:10:23.324 --> 00:10:24.294
Then what?

176
00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:29.700
Grid-template?

177
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:36.621
&gt;&gt; Yeah, grid-template-columns.

178
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:38.714
What are we gonna do?

179
00:10:38.714 --> 00:10:39.396
&gt;&gt; repeat.

180
00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:40.192
&gt;&gt; repeat.

181
00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:44.394
&gt;&gt; 3 times
&gt;&gt; 3.

182
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.197
&gt;&gt; One fraction each.

183
00:10:45.197 --> 00:10:47.679
&gt;&gt; 1fr, whoo-ooh.

184
00:10:50.552 --> 00:10:54.472
Okay, now what?

185
00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:56.465
&gt;&gt; gap.

186
00:10:56.465 --> 00:10:58.589
&gt;&gt; How about a gap?

187
00:10:58.589 --> 00:10:59.504
2rem.

188
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:08.355
So pretty, yay.

189
00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:12.466
[APPLAUSE] Okay, and
you could do the thing again.

190
00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:15.771
Wow, look at that, so awesome.

191
00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:21.488
&gt;&gt; Why would you do grid sort of flex
cuz you could just do flex-grow?

192
00:11:21.488 --> 00:11:23.326
&gt;&gt; You could do flex, absolutely.

193
00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:24.074
Nothing wrong with that.

194
00:11:24.074 --> 00:11:26.884
You could do flexbox, if you wish.

195
00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:29.514
I think you'll find for layouts like this,

196
00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:32.509
more people are tending
to use grid than flexbox.

197
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:37.408
Flexbox tends to be used when we
have an unknown number of items.

198
00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:40.553
So I have something coming off the server,
and I've got image.

199
00:11:40.553 --> 00:11:43.572
I'm Instagram, I've got some number
of images coming off the server,

200
00:11:43.572 --> 00:11:45.617
I don't know how many
images there are gonna be.

201
00:11:45.617 --> 00:11:49.619
&gt;&gt; Right, and I need to somehow
deal with that in a layout,

202
00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:53.121
I think people tend to use flexbox for
that more.

203
00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:57.236
&gt;&gt; Okay, I don't know how
am I gonna phrase this, but

204
00:11:57.236 --> 00:12:01.365
could you do a media query and
change the font size?

205
00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:01.983
&gt;&gt; Sure.

206
00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:05.830
&gt;&gt; Is that typical, so adjust.

207
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.967
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
what would you like the font size to be?

208
00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:10.809
You want it to be bigger or smaller?

209
00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:14.606
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm just thinking,
I was trying to make a website and

210
00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:18.408
I set something to 16 pixels,
it looked good on a desktop.

211
00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:20.935
&gt;&gt; And then I saw it on my phone and
it was way too big.

212
00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:21.785
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

213
00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:25.119
&gt;&gt; So do people usually account for
that for a p tag?

214
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:29.724
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you can, but
because of the way we wrote our fonts,

215
00:12:29.724 --> 00:12:32.840
we have a very cool way of doing that,
okay?

216
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.046
So let's just take a look
at that real quick.

217
00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:38.144
Let's say we wanted to
change our font size here.

218
00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:41.656
We can go back to root, and

219
00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:46.621
we can change our base size to 2rem.

220
00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:49.649
That's all we have to do.

221
00:12:54.688 --> 00:12:56.192
How awesome is that?

222
00:12:56.192 --> 00:13:00.804
Literally, change one variable in our
media query, and it affects everything.

223
00:13:02.445 --> 00:13:05.945
Okay, or in addition to or instead of,

224
00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:10.939
obviously, you could also
change your scale, right?

225
00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:14.911
So we had a scale of 1.25 before or
something, right?

226
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:18.162
Let's say we want it 1.414.

227
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.312
That actually didn't change much.

228
00:13:24.312 --> 00:13:26.048
Did I call it scale?

229
00:13:26.048 --> 00:13:27.785
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it made tour bigger.

230
00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:28.970
&gt;&gt; It made tour bigger.

231
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:34.136
Yeah, it may be less obvious
with the other stuff.

232
00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:37.532
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, I think we get a bigger

233
00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:42.377
bang with the base size, but
this is one of the wonderful things here.

234
00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:47.225
You can do other stuff here too,
like I don't want

235
00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:52.201
white to be white anymore
here at this media query.

236
00:13:52.201 --> 00:13:55.711
I don't know why you would do that,
but let's just say that that is true.

237
00:13:55.711 --> 00:14:00.453
White now has a value of red, okay?

238
00:14:00.453 --> 00:14:05.670
So there you go, [LAUGH] okay?

239
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.905
Just cuz you can, doesn't mean you should.

240
00:14:07.905 --> 00:14:08.868
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But

241
00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:12.993
you can change the values of
any of these variables, yeah?

242
00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:17.249
Okay, all you have to do
is put it inside of root.

243
00:14:17.249 --> 00:14:20.669
So the logic is really abstracted,
this is the cool part of the CSS.

244
00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:24.013
The logic is abstracted to
that top of the webpage, and

245
00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:28.677
now here we just change the variables and
use the same logic to process them.

246
00:14:28.677 --> 00:14:30.992
Pretty awesome.

247
00:14:30.992 --> 00:14:33.742
Okay, we really don't wanna do that.

248
00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:42.206
[LAUGH] All right, any other
questions here on what's going on?

249
00:14:42.206 --> 00:14:47.451
&gt;&gt; So in Tours,
the tour dates are going as a row?

250
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:47.969
&gt;&gt; Yes.

251
00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:51.728
&gt;&gt; Could we change those to
be a column with grid easily?

252
00:14:51.728 --> 00:14:57.080
&gt;&gt; You mean going in a vertical direction,
a series of columns?

253
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.080
There might be a way to do that,
but there's another way you

254
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.681
could manage this,
which would be you could just say,

255
00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:11.884
I think it's just columns: 3, right?

256
00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:15.131
Yeah.

257
00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:24.996
&gt;&gt; You're saying having the image
in one column straight down?

258
00:15:24.996 --> 00:15:28.933
&gt;&gt; No, I mean like when I originally
read Tours, it's 31st and

259
00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:30.955
then second then will below it.

260
00:15:30.955 --> 00:15:31.819
&gt;&gt; And then eight.

261
00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:34.862
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that may be a reason to do a flexbox.

262
00:15:34.862 --> 00:15:35.761
&gt;&gt; Okay.

263
00:15:35.761 --> 00:15:38.329
&gt;&gt; For sure, cuz then you could
definitely put that in columns.

264
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.923
&gt;&gt; Got it.

265
00:15:38.923 --> 00:15:43.946
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this columns: 3,
it's just another way to lay things out,

266
00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:48.623
you have very little control over
how many columns there are, or

267
00:15:48.623 --> 00:15:51.241
their spacing, or anything else.

268
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:54.829
It happened to work really well right
here, but this is another way to do this.

269
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.332
More commonly,
columns like this is used in,

270
00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:01.243
let's say you have an article and
you wanna have two columns of text, and

271
00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:04.534
you don't know where that break
in the text is gonna happen.

272
00:16:04.534 --> 00:16:09.337
Using this column's property here, you
could say it has two columns, and even if

273
00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:13.809
the page is shorter or longer, it'll
format the text into the right spots.

274
00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:15.976
Yeah, okay?

275
00:16:17.897 --> 00:16:19.831
So let me put it back to the way it was.
