00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.472
Let's do the part that is
relatively straightforward for

2
00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:07.840
these SOLD OUT buttons and
let's also do some hover states as well.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.679
So what you can't see in the picture,
is when you hover over these buttons,

4
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.570
so I'm hovering over
my BUY TICKETS button.

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.619
I would like it to turn cyan.

6
00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.579
Cyan text and cyan border,

7
00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.507
anybody have any idea how it
would go about doing that?

8
00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:36.531
&gt;&gt; So do like button-primary:hover?

9
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:43.521
&gt;&gt; Yep, button-primary:hover,
exactly, okay?

10
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:47.461
And we want to change the text color and
the border color.

11
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.741
So how do we do that?

12
00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:52.692
&gt;&gt; Set your color.

13
00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:55.224
&gt;&gt; So what would I type?

14
00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:57.438
&gt;&gt; So color, and
then you said you wanted it-

15
00:00:57.438 --> 00:01:02.472
&gt;&gt; Color: var (--cyan), okay?

16
00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:07.187
So now when I mouse over the button,
not the SOLD OUT buttons,

17
00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:10.464
the BUY TICKETS buttons, I get blue text.

18
00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:11.722
But my border stays pink.

19
00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:13.036
Now, if you like it,

20
00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:17.793
you can keep it, but your designer said
make that border change color, too.

21
00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:20.668
So how do I do that?

22
00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:25.340
&gt;&gt; Border-color:var, and then cyan.

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.542
&gt;&gt; Yeah, border-color: var (--cyan).

24
00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:33.719
In other words, you don't have to type the
whole border properties over again all you

25
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.471
need to do is just change the color.

26
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:38.536
So when you roll your mouse over it,
now we got a, ooh,

27
00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:40.948
everything turns blue, how cool is that?

28
00:01:43.212 --> 00:01:45.061
Okay, we approve.

29
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.852
Now we can roll our mouse over
the SOLD OUT buttons, but

30
00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:51.748
notice they're not clickable, right?

31
00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:55.934
That is bad UX, and now you have
the entire UX department mad at you,

32
00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.951
you have major usability
problem on your hands.

33
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.836
So now we need to fix that, okay?

34
00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:04.003
So let's set that up.

35
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:08.775
Remember that on the SOLD OUT buttons,
we have an additional class, right?

36
00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:13.933
So we're gonna put that after our button
primary so we can override stuff, yeah?

37
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:18.759
Okay so
this one is gonna be button-sold out.

38
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:25.499
And there's a couple of things we
can change immediately on that.

39
00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.301
Notice that in our picture,

40
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.127
they look a little bit faded out
maybe [LAUGH] It's it's clear

41
00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:36.102
on your screen that's in front of you
trust me they look a little bit faded out.

42
00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:40.699
So what could I do here to make that look

43
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:45.200
a little bit more faded out
&gt;&gt; Opacity.

44
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.832
&gt;&gt; Something to do with opacity, right?

45
00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:53.179
The problem with opacity as a property,
this property opacity,

46
00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:58.926
is everything inside of that
particular element will become opaque.

47
00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:02.583
And you don't necessarily always want
that, we want the color to become opaque,

48
00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.123
but not everything else, right?

49
00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:06.261
So what's another way
that I could do this?

50
00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:08.085
&gt;&gt; Could use the magenta 50.

51
00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:09.938
&gt;&gt; The magenta 50, right?

52
00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:13.898
So we can say our color is

53
00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:18.852
var(--magenta50) and

54
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:27.973
our border color is var(--magenta50),
okay?

55
00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:35.038
So those definitely look a little bit
faded out relative to the buy tickets, All

56
00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:40.400
right, now we have the last part, which
is really hard cuz those designers they

57
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.621
made a vertical line through our button or
diagonal line through our button.

58
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:49.596
How on Earth are we going to make
a diagonal line through our button,

59
00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.725
any suggestions?

60
00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:54.704
&gt;&gt; Pseudo element?

61
00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:56.636
&gt;&gt; Maybe a pseudo element maybe.

62
00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:04.507
Do a linear gradient,
&gt;&gt; A linear gradient,

63
00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.858
this is a really cool idea.

64
00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:11.138
So if you take a look,
I have a think of it's on

65
00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:16.005
the webpage as well,
I have a link to this code pen.

66
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:21.253
So I Googled for this and I said how do
you make a diagonal line on your webpage?

67
00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:25.674
And this guy, I forked his code pen, and

68
00:04:25.674 --> 00:04:28.925
you'll see here in the HTML,

69
00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:34.516
he's using tables, but
it's the same idea here,

70
00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:39.089
just basic, straight up, simple HTML.

71
00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:44.434
But in the CSS, he has the so
called simple way,

72
00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:47.654
see that, diagonal cross.

73
00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:51.602
So it's a linear gradient
that's set up in this way.

74
00:04:51.602 --> 00:04:57.528
So let's copy that line of code, it's on
line 40, just that background part there.

75
00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:03.202
Copy that and let's put that in our
code pen here on button-soldout,

76
00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:07.914
we're just gonna paste it in directly,
just what it is and

77
00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:10.846
let's see what happens.

78
00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:13.052
Nice?

79
00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:17.363
That's pretty cool.

80
00:05:17.363 --> 00:05:21.560
Now it's not the way the button's supposed
to look, but we're closer, aren't we?

81
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.155
All right, so how are we going to
make it look exactly right now?

82
00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:28.778
What do we need to change?

83
00:05:30.804 --> 00:05:32.787
&gt;&gt; Change black to magenta 50.

84
00:05:32.787 --> 00:05:36.771
&gt;&gt; Change black to magenta 50, so

85
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:41.610
where it says black here we're gonna say

86
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.892
var(--magenta50), okay?

87
00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:50.170
What else?

88
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.526
&gt;&gt; Change white to like
an rgb of like zero opacity.

89
00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:56.344
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we need to take out the white,

90
00:05:56.344 --> 00:05:58.876
we can actually just use
the keyword transparent.

91
00:06:00.678 --> 00:06:03.383
&gt;&gt; Okay.

92
00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:08.984
Okay, that helps some,
this is what I got here, okay?

93
00:06:08.984 --> 00:06:12.840
Linear gradient, two top right,
here's the other white,

94
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.811
the other white is right here.

95
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:18.810
So take out both of the whites and
change them to transparent.

96
00:06:22.877 --> 00:06:28.635
Okay, what if we want the line
to be a little thicker?

97
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:29.942
&gt;&gt; Just increase the pixels.

98
00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:31.641
Why don't we increase the pixels here?

99
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:36.073
So instead of 1 pixel,
let's say 2, so +2 and -2.

100
00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:39.730
All right,
we still have one final problem here.

101
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.364
When I roll my mouse over this button,
it's still giving me this hover state,

102
00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:45.078
isn't it?

103
00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:49.656
What do I need to do now?

104
00:06:49.656 --> 00:06:51.226
&gt;&gt; Button-soldout hover.

105
00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:55.435
&gt;&gt; Button-sold out:hover.

106
00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:58.633
And what am I gonna change?

107
00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:01.740
Just change the colors, so magenta 50.

108
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.325
&gt;&gt; Yeah, var(--magenta50).

109
00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:12.081
And border-color: var(--magenta50).

110
00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:22.281
&gt;&gt; If you wanted to you could also put
a pointer dash events on button-sold out,

111
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.761
and set that to none.

112
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:25.871
&gt;&gt; Pointer, I'm sorry,
what is it, pointer?

113
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:33.480
&gt;&gt; So you don't want to do it on the hover
state, but rather the opening class.

114
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.195
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

115
00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:38.213
&gt;&gt; Pointer-events: none.

116
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.373
&gt;&gt; Pointer-events: none.

117
00:07:45.373 --> 00:07:49.068
&gt;&gt; And then the hover shouldn't,
you shouldn't even need the hover.

118
00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:49.791
&gt;&gt; Okay.

119
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.670
So if we get rid of the hover?

120
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.999
&gt;&gt; And that way your cursor doesn't, it'll
still show a pointer in some sort of way.

121
00:07:56.999 --> 00:08:00.378
&gt;&gt; Still shows a pointer and we don't even
need the hover state, how cool is that?

122
00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:02.429
So there you go,
learn something new every day.

123
00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:08.181
So pointer-events: none, there we go.

124
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:12.018
Alternative solution,

125
00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:16.772
no hover needed, there we go.

126
00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.394
Okay so either one of those would work.

127
00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:21.870
Obviously, pointer events as
many fewer lines of code.
