1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.420
The last part of our easy design,
we are almost done, now,

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.150
we just have our desktop
layout left to go.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.319
So once again, let's take a look
at our desktop layout and

4
00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.915
let's take a look at our tablet layout.

5
00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:19.669
And let's talk about
the differences between these,

6
00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.410
it's always a great place to start.

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.444
So here's our tablet layout as it exists,

8
00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:29.999
here's our desktop layout,
what is happening?

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.681
&gt;&gt; Tour is moving over.
&gt;&gt; So we're pulling Tour out and

10
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:42.870
we're putting it in a column
on the right-hand side, yeah?

11
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.670
So we're taking the thing in the middle,
right?

12
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.677
We're taking the thing in the middle, and

13
00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:50.869
we're putting it over
on the right hand side.

14
00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.981
Anything else?

15
00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:59.242
Pretty much it, yeah?

16
00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:05.685
Okay, so anybody really concerned about
that, like that can't possibly happen?

17
00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:13.350
Okay, so let's see what we
can do to make that happen.

18
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.227
We're gonna pull the thing
in the middle out, and

19
00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:20.931
we'll start with our
Beginning CodePen here.

20
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:25.505
So in order to get the Tour gates
next to those other items, now,

21
00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:31.014
rather than focusing on units within
the page, like we focused just on Tour,

22
00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:35.460
now, we need to focus on the shape
of the page overall, okay?

23
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.975
So we're gonna lay out
the whole page overall.

24
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:43.640
And to do that,
we will open up another media query here.

25
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.670
And I guess I'll just put it here, @media.

26
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.390
And we'll just say for argument's sake,
this has a min-width of 1025 pixels.

27
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.010
And again, how did you wind up with that?

28
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.230
The designer said you experimented,
you came up with that number.

29
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.088
And so
we'll start by resetting our wrapper.

30
00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:18.115
And then we'll have
a max-width of 1200 pixels.

31
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.290
Okay, so
when you make your window big enough,

32
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.191
you should get a really hunk and
big picture, right?

33
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.968
And when you hit that breakpoint,

34
00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:34.159
you might get a little space
around the picture, make sense?

35
00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:43.005
Okay, so let's refer to our HTML here, and

36
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.650
we can flatten everything here.

37
00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:52.400
So we can see our outer structure.

38
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.683
So what we have is we have a div
with a class of wrapper, and

39
00:02:56.683 --> 00:03:01.414
that is going around a div with
a class of banner, around main,

40
00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:05.450
around aside, and around footer, right?

41
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.480
Look like a structure you know and
love, okay?

42
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.350
So what is the parent or the container?

43
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.850
&gt;&gt; Wrapper.
&gt;&gt; Wrapper.

44
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.019
&gt;&gt; The wrapper, and what are the children?

45
00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.082
&gt;&gt; All the other.

46
00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.865
&gt;&gt; All the other stuff,
those are the children, right?

47
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:28.601
So if we set this up to layout and grid,
we can set it up with two columns, right?

48
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.410
And then we can actually tell each one
of those HTML elements which column to

49
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.023
wind up in.

50
00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:39.261
That you cannot do with Flexbox,
not easily.

51
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.655
So let's do that here with grid.

52
00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:49.669
All right, so we were gonna set this up,
is we're gonna say display: grid.

53
00:03:52.437 --> 00:04:00.360
And then grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr.

54
00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.735
Okay, and then gap, 0 2rem.

55
00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:13.354
Those two numbers specify top and
bottom, right?

56
00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:20.436
So zero gap on the top and the bottom,
and 2rem specifies in-between,

57
00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:24.396
so the columns, so it's row, column.

58
00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:29.800
And it looks like nothing on the page
has changed, so make your page bigger.

59
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.402
[SOUND] What's going on here?

60
00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:43.063
Your first rule of CSS is don't freak out.

61
00:04:43.063 --> 00:04:44.878
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, don't freak out.

62
00:04:44.878 --> 00:04:47.914
You did this thing,
you have no idea what's going on,

63
00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:51.546
what's the first thing that you
should do besides not freak out?

64
00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:52.438
&gt;&gt; Put a border on-
&gt;&gt; Border it up.

65
00:04:52.438 --> 00:04:54.740
&gt;&gt; Put a border on it, okay?

66
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.850
What the heck just happened,
let's put a border on it.

67
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.923
So we can use that same selector again,

68
00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:08.319
wrapper &gt; *, border 1px solid white.

69
00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:13.730
Okay, so that helps, doesn't it?

70
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.605
You can see that we have two columns.

71
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:23.160
Do you see what's going on
here now with those lines?

72
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.764
Can someone describe to
me what's going on here?

73
00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:32.498
&gt;&gt; It took every child inside of
wrapper and put one in each grid space.

74
00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:34.401
&gt;&gt; It did what grid always does.

75
00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:37.711
Gosh, darn it,
it put the header in the first spot,

76
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:42.453
it put the div class of banner in the
second spot, it put main in the third and

77
00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:46.370
aside in the fourth and
footer in the fifth, right?

78
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.311
Because this is what grid does,
it takes everything and

79
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:52.013
then it assigns it to the columns,
just like that.

80
00:05:52.013 --> 00:05:56.533
All done,
except that's not what we want, right?

81
00:05:56.533 --> 00:06:00.585
Okay, so
what do we need to do to fix this?

82
00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:03.343
&gt;&gt; Specifically assign
each child to a spot.

83
00:06:03.343 --> 00:06:07.022
&gt;&gt; We're gonna specifically assign
each child to a spot, for sure.

84
00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:14.077
Okay, so we need to use the grid-area
function again to have the Tour

85
00:06:14.077 --> 00:06:16.660
information in the right column.

86
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.870
So let's put that in place.

87
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.730
So remember we had grid-area
a little bit earlier.

88
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:29.027
We can do the same thing here, and
we can say main, in our grid-area.

89
00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:37.380
Okay, so main is this Tour location here.

90
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.382
We want it to show up over
here in the second column, and

91
00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:44.172
we wanna show up from start to finish.

92
00:06:44.172 --> 00:06:48.347
So the first thing that we need
is the grid row start number.

93
00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:53.005
So what row do we want
the Tour to show up in?

94
00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:55.852
&gt;&gt; One.
&gt;&gt; We want it to show up in one,

95
00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:57.441
the first row.

96
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.315
Then the next number is
our grid column start.

97
00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:02.319
So what column do we
want it to show up in?

98
00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:07.417
This is one, even though it looks
like there's two, this is just one.

99
00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:09.065
[LAUGH] It's just one thing here.

100
00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:12.925
So this is number two and
this is number three over here.

101
00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:21.010
So it's gonna be 1/2/, then we want it
to show up all the way down the page.

102
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.916
So it's gonna go 1, 2, 3, 4,

103
00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:30.819
all the way down here at the bottom,

104
00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:33.936
4, right, /4/.

105
00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:36.518
And then the end of this
column would be number three.

106
00:07:39.744 --> 00:07:40.722
Let's see what happens.

107
00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:48.369
Okay, so we said, main,
we want you to show up and

108
00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:51.380
occupy the entire right column.

109
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.540
What did that mean for everything else?

110
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.991
There was nowhere for it to go, but
the left column, right, correct?

111
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:04.460
Right, [LAUGH] so everything showed
up over here in the left column.

112
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.532
Awesome, so
now what do we need to do with Tour?

113
00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:13.720
&gt;&gt; Make everything inside one column.

114
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.272
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here's the interesting
thing about that Tour, right?

115
00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:24.931
It is a grid child, right, as a result
of wrapper, it's a child of the wrapper.

116
00:08:24.931 --> 00:08:28.650
But main also has its own children, right?

117
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:36.450
So main itself, all we actually need to
do here is we could say display: block.

118
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:45.491
That turns off grid and it reverts
to the column that we had earlier.

119
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.322
How cool is that?

120
00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:48.540
Just turn the grid off.

121
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.834
We don't need to go reset everything,
okay?

122
00:08:55.834 --> 00:09:02.644
And now, let's compare that with how
we're supposed to be looking, okay?

123
00:09:02.644 --> 00:09:06.280
What other changes do we need
besides turning off the borders?

124
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.192
Here's where we are.

125
00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:11.811
Here's our comp, what do we need to do?

126
00:09:14.824 --> 00:09:16.913
&gt;&gt; Less spacing around the header.

127
00:09:16.913 --> 00:09:21.189
&gt;&gt; Maybe less spacing, or push Tour
down here to be even with the picture,

128
00:09:21.189 --> 00:09:23.061
something like that, right?

129
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:28.268
And I think I did that
with just a padding-top

130
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:34.577
here on main of 8rem,
which was just trial and error.

131
00:09:35.772 --> 00:09:42.430
And let's turn off those borders now, and
let's see if that wind up working out.

132
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.325
Well, it looks a little funky,

133
00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:50.231
maybe this is actually 5, 3.

134
00:09:50.231 --> 00:09:50.779
Did that work?

135
00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:54.030
Here we go, you have to count.

136
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.330
If you can't count,
you can't get the right answer.

137
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.990
So my grid-area, I had the wrong
number here for my ending row.

138
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.001
So I changed it to a 5 and

139
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:05.970
now everything's lined up the way
it's supposed to line up.

140
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.582
So look at that, you're done,
you've completed the easy design.

141
00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:11.698
Was it easy?

142
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:14.826
[LAUGH] It wasn't too terrible, right?
