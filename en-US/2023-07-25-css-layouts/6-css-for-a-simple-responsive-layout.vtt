1
00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:03.267
Next up is the header,
the banner, and the tour styling.

2
00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:06.244
By the time we're done with this section,

3
00:00:06.244 --> 00:00:11.204
as you see here in this screenshot,
by the way these are all clickable so

4
00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:14.941
you can open them up in a new window and
zoom in on them.

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.702
By the time we're done with this,
we'll have our header styled,

6
00:00:18.702 --> 00:00:20.716
we'll have our banner styled, and

7
00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:24.426
we'll get our tour dates sort of
basically in place here, okay?

8
00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:30.618
So that is where we are headed with this.

9
00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:35.821
All right, so go ahead and
open up your CodePen for this.

10
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.840
This is the easy design header and
banner styling, or

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.142
you can continue working in
the CodePen you already have.

12
00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:46.975
Make sure you fork it to your account.

13
00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.037
And then we can get busy styling here.

14
00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:55.172
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is I'm going to do

15
00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:58.223
a little trick that a lot of you
may not even be familiar with.

16
00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:03.365
What we have written so far for our CSS,
this is what we wrote back in Chapter 2.

17
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:07.397
It's just copied and pasted right here.

18
00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:14.101
This is kind of like our base styling,
and as you can already tell,

19
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.305
we're already up to 137 lines of CSS.

20
00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:22.719
[LAUGH] We haven't even, like,
really gotten started with this.

21
00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.853
So, I'm going to show
you this little trick.

22
00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:33.649
What I'm going to do is I'm gonna
put around this at layer base.

23
00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.557
And we're gonna open our curly
bracket here on line one,

24
00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:43.364
we're gonna scroll all the way
to the end of our CSS, and

25
00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:48.393
we're gonna put in another
curly bracket here at the end.

26
00:01:48.393 --> 00:01:50.672
And then you can say format CSS,

27
00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.483
it'll clean up any formatting
issues that you have.

28
00:01:54.483 --> 00:02:01.577
And now what that will do for us is we can
collapse all of that CSS just like that.

29
00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:04.169
[LAUGH] That's our base styling, okay?

30
00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:09.520
If you're not familiar with Layer, these
are actually used as part of the cascade.

31
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.947
You can have unnamed layers, you can have
layers with names is what we have here.

32
00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:19.241
We can specify in what order we want
the layers to apply to our design.

33
00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:22.427
I talk about all of this in my
intermediate CSS course here at

34
00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:23.521
Frontend Masters.

35
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.274
We are not going to use
layers in the cascade,

36
00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:29.183
we are just using them
as a grouping mechanism.

37
00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:34.227
So I wouldn't necessarily recommend that
you use it this way in your production

38
00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:38.895
code it's more for teaching purposes and
that's why we're doing this,

39
00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:41.999
just to make our code
a little bit easier to read.

40
00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:52.162
Okay, so to this we'll add some new CSS so

41
00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:56.654
I'm going to make another layer and

42
00:02:56.654 --> 00:03:00.247
I said this is like header and

43
00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:05.504
banner styling so we'll call it header.

44
00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:10.418
Just header and
then inside of this we'll put in our

45
00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:15.342
styling it pertains to that header and
the banner.

46
00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:19.565
Now, when I start putting let's
see styling right here on

47
00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:24.319
the webpage at what dimensions of
the screen is it going to apply?

48
00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.398
&gt;&gt; All dimensions.
&gt;&gt; All of them.

49
00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:28.378
All of them, right?

50
00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:32.010
So in other words mobile tablet and
desktop.

51
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.636
So when we start adding additional
styling here we're really thinking

52
00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:39.189
about our mobile dimension right now.

53
00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.481
So we're going to work on just styling
the mobile dimension and then we'll start

54
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.916
adding media queries that will allow us to
make our changes for tablet and desktop.

55
00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:49.946
Make sense?

56
00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:51.253
Okay, great.

57
00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:54.285
So here at the header,
let's start with our wrapper.

58
00:03:56.574 --> 00:04:02.388
And we can say something
like max-width 375 pixels.

59
00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:06.923
Okay?

60
00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:09.809
And if you're ever not
sure what's going on,

61
00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.334
what is the thing I tell you to do always?

62
00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:17.437
The world's greatest debugging tool
when it comes to your CSS border.

63
00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:21.000
Border one pixel solid.

64
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.917
Usually I do red, but since we're on
a green background, let's do white.

65
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:33.628
That'll always put a border on something
so you can see exactly what's going on,

66
00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:37.821
because if you can't see it,
you can't style it.

67
00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.002
Very, very important.

68
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.030
We can't see what's going on here.

69
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.659
We cannot style it.

70
00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:52.117
I think right now, in my base layer I
may have the image style commented out.

71
00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.757
Yes, a temporary comment right here.

72
00:04:54.757 --> 00:05:00.189
So if your image style in the base
is probably not uncommented

73
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.303
that's great I'm going to make
sure that works that will

74
00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:11.282
put all of my images right inside
of my wrapper, see how I did that?

75
00:05:11.282 --> 00:05:13.799
&gt;&gt; So
did you uncomment the temporary comment?

76
00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:18.372
&gt;&gt; I uncommented the temporary comment,
correct.

77
00:05:18.372 --> 00:05:21.262
Okay.

78
00:05:21.262 --> 00:05:24.547
Anybody happy with that?

79
00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:25.112
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks great.

80
00:05:25.112 --> 00:05:26.784
I think we're done.

81
00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.365
&gt;&gt; Awesome, yeah Mark.

82
00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:30.551
&gt;&gt; Why pixels instead of rem here?

83
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:33.228
&gt;&gt; Why pixels instead of rem here?

84
00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:35.885
You absolutely can do this in rems.

85
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:36.971
That wouldn't be a problem at all.

86
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.737
What I find is, again,
for teaching purposes,

87
00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:43.654
I find when I get to these larger numbers,
people get very confused.

88
00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:46.927
And the pixels are a better
thing to use for that reason.

89
00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:51.325
Also when you go to your media queries,
the rems and

90
00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:55.019
pixels are pretty well interchangeable.

91
00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:58.453
If you take a look at a lot of the way
a lot of people write their CSS,

92
00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:01.906
they use pixels in the media queries and
they use Rems elsewhere.

93
00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:05.137
But you can absolutely convert this
to rems and do that if you wish.

94
00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:06.894
Not a problem at all.

95
00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:09.976
&gt;&gt; You ever use CH as a method
of measurement especially in

96
00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:12.901
Mac's with circumstances
&gt;&gt; I have never used CH but

97
00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:15.739
that means nothing is neither here nor
there.

98
00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:20.019
Whatever works for you,
I think is an awesome choice.

99
00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.896
&gt;&gt; Your question about your
developing like mobile first?

100
00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:25.793
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

101
00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:29.992
&gt;&gt; In Chrome they have the mobile, they
have tools where you can see it and for

102
00:06:29.992 --> 00:06:31.433
different dimensions.

103
00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.048
Do you like to just resize it
to kind of look like a mobile or

104
00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:36.344
are there dimensions that
you like to style it to?

105
00:06:36.344 --> 00:06:40.525
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what are the right dimensions?

106
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:43.746
Depends on your design, okay?

107
00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:46.771
So you just sort of look at your
design and see what looks good.

108
00:06:46.771 --> 00:06:49.979
Often your designer was gonna give
you the dimensions to use anyway.

109
00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.871
[LAUGH] Designer gave me
the dimensions to use here.

110
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.889
That's how we wound up with these.

111
00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.684
But if you wind up ever styling
on your own, do the thing.

112
00:07:00.684 --> 00:07:06.022
Do the thing and figure out where
it looks good for you, right?.

113
00:07:06.022 --> 00:07:09.537
If stuff starts rapping at
a certain point in time,

114
00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:13.153
that's a good place to
sometimes put a media query.

115
00:07:13.153 --> 00:07:15.692
Makes sense?.

116
00:07:15.692 --> 00:07:17.015
Okay.

117
00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:18.583
Okay, this is great.

118
00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:21.601
I would like it centered.

119
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:24.964
How can I center this on the page?

120
00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:25.693
My wrapper.

121
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:32.832
&gt;&gt; Flexbox.
&gt;&gt; Flexbox is one possibility.

122
00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:36.789
What would be another
possibility that's even easier?

123
00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:37.458
&gt;&gt; We can do margin auto.

124
00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:38.519
&gt;&gt; We can do margin.

125
00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:43.178
So if we add to this margin, 0 auto.

126
00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.047
Okay, two numbers.

127
00:07:48.047 --> 00:07:51.683
So the first number refers to the top and
the bottom.

128
00:07:51.683 --> 00:07:55.962
The second number or keyword in this
case refers to the left and the right.

129
00:07:55.962 --> 00:08:00.609
So what auto is doing is it's looking
at the width of the page relative to

130
00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:03.794
the width of the wrapper
which is 375 pixels.

131
00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:06.708
It takes whatever space is left over,
divides it by two and

132
00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:08.739
sticks it on the left and the right side.

133
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:09.610
So it's centered.

134
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.340
Makes sense?

135
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.840
Awesome.

136
00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:20.622
Okay, so let's move on to our header.

137
00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:24.641
The actual header itself.

138
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:30.227
It is kind of large,
[LAUGH] so let's give this

139
00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:35.671
a little bit of breathing room, all right?

140
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:40.857
First of all, it's smashed up
against the top of the page,

141
00:08:40.857 --> 00:08:46.994
so let's remedy that by giving it
some padding on the top, three rem.

142
00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:51.566
Let's give it some padding on the bottom,
like two REM.

143
00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:55.879
Yeah, you could write that in
one declaration if you prefer.

144
00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:58.490
Whatever works for you is fine.

145
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.264
So that'll give us a little bit
of space between our logo and and

146
00:09:03.264 --> 00:09:05.977
the image that comes after, okay?

147
00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:17.426
And then we could say header image.

148
00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:21.171
So remember, this is all just
coming from our HTML here.

149
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:22.471
We have our image.

150
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:26.078
The image is right here
on line 3 in our HTML.

151
00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:28.544
It's inside of header.

152
00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:30.593
So we have here a descendant class.

153
00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:33.831
Images inside of header
are going to do what?

154
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:40.831
They are going to have
a max width of a 150pixels.

155
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:42.764
Why because the designer said so.

156
00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:52.566
Right, what else should we do there?

157
00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:53.456
&gt;&gt; Center.

158
00:09:53.456 --> 00:09:56.477
&gt;&gt; Let's center the image, yeah?

159
00:09:56.477 --> 00:10:01.441
Okay, what kind of centering should
I use and where should I put it?

160
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:03.179
Anybody say we should use Flexbox?

161
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:07.595
Could do that, right?

162
00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:12.398
We have parents and
children here, header A.

163
00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:14.136
That's one way to do it.

164
00:10:14.136 --> 00:10:17.430
There's an easier way.

165
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.897
Images in line.

166
00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:26.262
So all we need to do really
