00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:04.759
Well, at this point we have styled all of
the individual components that make up our

2
00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.897
difficult design.

3
00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:08.509
And now it's time for
you to give this a try.

4
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.934
You're gonna put this all together
into a single code pen and

5
00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.710
assemble everything in place, and so

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.239
we have links here to the code
pens that you're going to need.

7
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.820
We started with out small elements,
remember all of our little boxes, and

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.403
lightning bolts and that kind of thing
we have our double border corners our

9
00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:32.040
navigation tweaks that we needed to make.

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.234
Our cover icons, the track list
that flies out for tablet, and

11
00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:40.905
the tablet version, of course
contains also the mobile version, and

12
00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:46.315
the diamond images, with all of those
kinds of things that are available to you.

13
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.936
And there's links to all of those code
pens containing those bits of code.

14
00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:53.115
Here's my recommended approach for
you as you do this.

15
00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:54.202
So first of all,

16
00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.724
I would recommend that you fork
the double borders corners Code pen.

17
00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:03.683
Because in that code pen I've given you
some commenting in the HTML as to where

18
00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:08.490
you should insert things like the track
list and the diamonds and so on and so

19
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.039
forth.

20
00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.645
Then from the diamonds code pen,
which is the last one that we developed,

21
00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:16.470
copy the CSS and
the JavaScript from there and

22
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.316
paste that into the double
borders code pen.

23
00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:22.314
You can get rid of
whatever was there before.

24
00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:27.540
Then go through and copy the appropriate
HTML from the remaining code pens

25
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.525
into that double border code pen
that we started with, and then test.

26
00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.961
You're going to find that the design
should work for mobile and tablet, And

27
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.674
there's probably going to be a few minor
tweaks that you're gonna need to make in

28
00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:43.636
order to make it work perfectly.

29
00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:49.139
And to remind you what the final
version is going to look like.

30
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:54.824
We are looking for
a mobile site that looks like this.

31
00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:58.556
Remember we have our cover and
our audio here.

32
00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.360
Remember we have our track
list that's going to open.

33
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.151
And then we're going to have our reviews,
our shows announced box,

34
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:11.024
and then our diamond layout there,
followed by a couple of buttons and

35
00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:15.170
lightning bolts and so
forth all the way down to the bottom.

36
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.001
When you look at this,
at tablet dimensions,

37
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.627
your site should look like this,
you're gonna have your nav bar.

38
00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:28.342
Remember, you're going to have the ability
to have your track list fly out.

39
00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:31.824
And then everything else is the same
as you scroll on down here on the page,

40
00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:33.186
you'll have your reviews.

41
00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:36.881
You'll have your shows the downspouts,
your diamonds, and

42
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:40.373
the other little elements there
at the bottom of the page.

43
00:02:40.373 --> 00:02:44.931
Don't worry about the desktop layout
that just yet we'll do that momentarily.

44
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:49.574
So go ahead and give this a try and
see if you can get this all assembled.

45
00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.119
All right, well,
I hope that all worked out for you.

46
00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.815
You should have a basically
a working page here for

47
00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:03.863
the tablet now that we've
assembled all of the parts,

48
00:03:03.863 --> 00:03:07.739
so make sure you're with
here in code pen is no more.

49
00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.063
Then say 800 pixels, 900 pixels.

50
00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:16.344
That is where we want to test and
make sure that this is working correctly.

51
00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:20.953
When you get to desktop dimensions, you'll
find that the page looks ridiculous.

52
00:03:20.953 --> 00:03:24.898
Don't worry about that right now, we are
about to add our desktop breakpoint and

53
00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:26.418
fix that particular problem.

54
00:03:26.418 --> 00:03:30.742
Right now, we're only concerned with
what's going on on tablet and mobile.

55
00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:36.264
So what I would recommend that you do as
you've put together this entire page,

56
00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:39.955
make sure that all of your
widgets are working here.

57
00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.638
We have a functional navigation bar.

58
00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:46.858
We have functional audio is still working.

59
00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:50.542
Our track list still opens and
closes the way it should.

60
00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:55.734
That's always our first check, make sure
we haven't broken any of the JavaScript or

61
00:03:55.734 --> 00:04:00.149
that we remembered to copy it all over,
that is an important thing to do.

62
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:04.348
Make sure that as we scroll down here,
things look reasonable.

63
00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.446
So our diamonds have
a little bit of a gap here.

64
00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:11.568
One of the things you may have to go
back and do is in your diamond layout,

65
00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:14.545
you may need to add a little
bit of margin on the top.

66
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:19.234
We set the diamond pane here to center
on the page via margin zero auto,

67
00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:24.001
but you may need to change that to say
like two REM auto in order to give you

68
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.290
a little bit of space on the top,
and the bottom.

69
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.766
So there's that, everything else
should be all in line here on mobile.

70
00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:37.987
When you make it a little bit bigger,
your track list should still fly out,

71
00:04:37.987 --> 00:04:42.007
should still be smooth, should still
have your close button working,

72
00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:44.032
the audio should continue to work.

73
00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:45.989
[MUSIC]

74
00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:47.985
Your reviews should be working correctly.

75
00:04:47.985 --> 00:04:50.905
And remember we did some work on those,
lightning bolts,

76
00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.850
so the correct lightning bolts should be
on and the correct ones should be off.

77
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.227
And again, we still have the new tour and
the diamonds and so forth.

78
00:04:58.227 --> 00:05:00.795
They're all approximately the same width.

79
00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:04.021
So, if you manage to get a page
that looks pretty similar to that,

80
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:05.148
you're doing great.

81
00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:05.859
And of course,

82
00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:09.271
the answer to that particular challenge
is available in CodePen as well.

83
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:11.910
You can always compare
that with your code.
