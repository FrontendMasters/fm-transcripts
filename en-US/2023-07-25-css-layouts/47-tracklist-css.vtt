1
00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:04.121
Now we're getting into some of the
exciting features of our difficult design.

2
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.966
And one of the first things that we're
going to work on is the track list.

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:12.496
And the track list is the list of songs
that we have down here at the bottom.

4
00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:17.716
These are tracks that we laid out in
the medium version of the website.

5
00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:22.424
And what we are going to do with these now
is we'd like to hide them behind a big

6
00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:23.022
button.

7
00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:29.008
And if you take a look at the course
website, which is practical.css.education,

8
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.069
we're in Chapter 5, Part E,
the track list on mobile.

9
00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:36.651
You will see how this is going
to look when we're done.

10
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:41.551
So basically, we will have a track
list button here that when

11
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.928
clicked will open up the full track list.

12
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:48.004
And the button will say tracklist here,

13
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.815
and it's going to say close once
that button has been clicked.

14
00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.334
Now, thinking about an approach for this,

15
00:00:55.334 --> 00:01:00.047
I'm sure JavaScript comes immediately to
mind for you and that's totally fine.

16
00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:02.713
We are definitely going to
need some JavaScript for

17
00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:04.884
this because we have a toggle state here.

18
00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:08.276
We need to make something appear and
disappear on click.

19
00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.584
And as we know, CSS does not have
a click state inside of it, so

20
00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:14.142
we're gonna have to go to JavaScript for
that.

21
00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:16.688
But it doesn't have to
be difficult JavaScript,

22
00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:18.454
we don't need a library for this.

23
00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:22.733
We don't need it anything except for
plain, simple vanilla JavaScript.

24
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:27.482
And literally just a few lines of
code that will swap some classes for

25
00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:31.414
us that are going to control
exactly how this will work.

26
00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:35.233
So basically on click, the class
is going to switch and we can just

27
00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:39.964
set up two sets of styling, the open set
of styling and the closed set of styling.

28
00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:43.829
So that is going to be our overall
approach to putting this together.

29
00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.379
If you open up the code
pen starting with this,

30
00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:51.583
fork it to your account,
we can get started with this.

31
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:56.299
As always, the first thing we're
gonna start with is our HTML, and

32
00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.682
if you take a look at the HTML we
have here I have continued on with

33
00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:04.850
the HTML we've been working
with in the difficult design.

34
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.982
So we have our cover section of this
page that contains the album cover,

35
00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:14.013
it contains the icons and
it contains our audio player.

36
00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:17.976
And then after that we have
a section that contains our table.

37
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:21.118
And the table of course contains
all of the information of

38
00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:23.023
the tracks that are on this album.

39
00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:28.881
So in order to get this style, the first
thing I'm going to do is give this section

40
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:34.065
a class and I'm going to call it
tracklist because I'm very creative.

41
00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:41.494
And then we can also, here in our layers,
we have a layer called playlist.

42
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.260
And I've started to call
this the track list.

43
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.098
So I'm gonna just rename this layer to
track list I think it's gonna help us keep

44
00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:50.485
track of everything.

45
00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:53.038
So track list is the name of my new layer.

46
00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:57.576
And if we open that up, you'll see
that right now we have all of the CSS

47
00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:01.413
that's here for our table styling and
there's not a lot,

48
00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:06.602
it's just a little bit of styling that
applies to that particular track list.

49
00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:11.718
So the first thing that we need to include
here is something to click in order

50
00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:17.018
to make this thing appear and disappear,
and so we'll do that with a button.

51
00:03:17.018 --> 00:03:19.361
Why a button instead of a link?

52
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.414
Well in this case this is not
going anywhere the button is

53
00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:26.433
triggering an action in JavaScript and so

54
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:31.193
therefore we'll use a button for
this not a a link the anchor tag.

55
00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:34.793
So we're gonna call this button and
we'll give it an ID,

56
00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:39.444
which we'll refer to in the JavaScript
eventually, called track list.

57
00:03:39.444 --> 00:03:42.640
Again, very, very creative of us.

58
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.094
And the text we'll put on that
button will be track list.

59
00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:56.015
Slash button.
So this will show up here at the top of

60
00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:56.737
our table.

61
00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.967
There's our button.

62
00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:00.995
It does nothing right now, but

63
00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:05.662
we have the start of our
tracklist button here.

64
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:10.453
Now as for this button, we should give it
some better styling than what we see here.

65
00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:12.882
So, let's set that up as well.

66
00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:18.805
And I'm just gonna use the ID to
style that, we'll call it track list.

67
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:24.210
The ID of track list,
first of all, will display block.

68
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.013
By default buttons are a either inline or
inline block.

69
00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:32.562
We want it to have the ability to stretch
across the page to have margin and

70
00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:34.362
padding on all of the sides.

71
00:04:34.362 --> 00:04:37.229
So we'll set it to display block.

72
00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.746
We'll set its border to none.

73
00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:45.384
Once again, the default button that comes
from your web browser has a border on it.

74
00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.347
We are just gonna turn it off.

75
00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:51.924
We'll give it a font.

76
00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.565
Family of Var serif,

77
00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:59.858
which is what's called for in the design.

78
00:04:59.858 --> 00:05:06.985
Text-transform uppercase again called for
in the design.

79
00:05:06.985 --> 00:05:10.355
And the width to 100%.

80
00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:20.863
So we've start to have the outlines
of a reasonable looking button there.

81
00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.474
And now, we'll set our color to

82
00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:31.117
var-, Magenta.

83
00:05:31.117 --> 00:05:36.281
We'll set our background
color to transparent.

84
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.678
There it is.
It's just the word TRACKLIST that's there

85
00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:43.560
right now, OK?

86
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.330
And then finally,
we can make that text a little bit bigger.

87
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.890
Font size, bar, h5, and

88
00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.603
our padding of one rem.

89
00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:06.165
So it doesn't look like a super attractive
button there at this moment in time.

90
00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:11.863
And that is because we need to put
a border around the entire layout here.

91
00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:17.663
So you see here in our design, we have
the word track list and we have this

92
00:06:17.663 --> 00:06:24.253
border out here that border expands to
encompass the entire track list on click.

93
00:06:24.253 --> 00:06:27.083
So we don't want the border to be on

94
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:31.876
the button we want that border
to actually be on our table.

95
00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:37.374
So we'll continue on with our styling
here let's set up a quick hover state for

96
00:06:37.374 --> 00:06:38.298
our button.

97
00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:42.646
So track list colon hover,
and we'll set that to a color

98
00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:47.377
of VaR cyan kind of been doing
that throughout our document.

99
00:06:47.377 --> 00:06:53.346
So we'll have a cyan hover state on it and
that is working just fine.

100
00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:56.370
OK, so
now we have a button that is styled up.

101
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.538
It doesn't do anything yet.

102
00:06:57.538 --> 00:07:00.733
We'll have to add some JavaScript
in order for it to do anything.

103
00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:05.223
But for right now,
let's move on to styling up the table.

104
00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:10.305
So for the table, we have our
section with a class of track list.

105
00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.793
We have the table inside of it.

106
00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:16.208
It is the only table in our document,
so we can continue to style with

107
00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:20.396
some of these generic selectors
that we have here for the table.

108
00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:25.025
But the first thing I wanna work on is
the section that surrounds that table,

109
00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:27.572
the section with the class of track list.

110
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:31.622
So we'll add a class of track list.

111
00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:38.607
And we can set this to margin 0 auto,

112
00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:44.402
to make sure it's always
centered on the page.

113
00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:45.687
Padding 0, 1.5rem.

114
00:07:52.114 --> 00:07:55.108
Not a lot of change going
on down here just yet.

115
00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:59.409
That's really completely obvious, but
it will add up here in just a moment.

116
00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:03.078
And then we'll put our border on this.

117
00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:07.478
So our border of 2pixels

118
00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:12.722
solid var(= =magenta).

119
00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:21.496
So now we have that nice border
all the way around the page here.

120
00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:25.960
We have a little bit of
separation between the table and

121
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.366
the edges of that border so it looks nice.

122
00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:33.177
Now on hover,
notice that my button is changing color.

123
00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:36.203
Why shouldn't my border
change color as well?

124
00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:37.134
When that'd be great.

125
00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:42.414
So we could add that also,
we could say our class

126
00:08:42.414 --> 00:08:49.954
of track list on hover,the border
color should change to var cyan.

127
00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:54.739
So now down here in our tracklist when we

128
00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:59.669
roll our mouse over it both the button and

129
00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:06.496
the border change color when
you hover over the button.

130
00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:09.053
Otherwise just generally
in the track list,

131
00:09:09.053 --> 00:09:12.699
it will change the color of
the border here, but not the button.

132
00:09:15.136 --> 00:09:19.518
All right, now for our table,
as we see from our diagram here,

133
00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:24.415
we have somehow gotten rid of those
headers that we have in that table.

134
00:09:24.415 --> 00:09:27.703
We still want those headers there for
accessibility reasons.

135
00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:30.584
But for our visual viewers of this page,

136
00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:35.009
we don't necessarily need to
have those showing on the page.

137
00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:39.869
So what we'll do for that is,
up here where we have caption, remember,

138
00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:44.988
we have a caption for this table that
you can't see because we collapsed it.

139
00:09:44.988 --> 00:09:47.346
We can do the same thing for
our table headings.

140
00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:50.958
So we can say caption, comma, th.

141
00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:55.014
And that will collapse
our table headings and

142
00:09:55.014 --> 00:10:00.468
then we can turn off the styling here for
our table headings.

143
00:10:00.468 --> 00:10:03.997
That'll get rid of that underline there
and of course we don't need to have,

144
00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:06.983
it doesn't matter what the font
family is or the text alignment,

145
00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:09.023
we're not gonna look at it anymore anyway.

146
00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:12.121
So we can just get rid of that style.

147
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:15.012
And we can get rid of the padding
on the cells as well.

148
00:10:15.012 --> 00:10:17.827
So that will just apply to the TD now.

149
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.915
So there's our track list and
there's our styles here underneath.

150
00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:28.653
One of the last things that I wanna do
here is these timestamps that are over

151
00:10:28.653 --> 00:10:30.234
here on the right-hand side.

152
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:32.188
See how it looks a little
bit crooked there?

153
00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:35.183
That looks like those
timestamps are are pushed in.

154
00:10:35.183 --> 00:10:37.320
We can always put a border on things.

155
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.645
So if I put a border one
pixel solid white on my Td's,

156
00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:50.409
you'll see that our timestamps here
are shoved to the left side of the cell.

157
00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:53.874
That's what's causing that sort of
awkward look that's going on there.

158
00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:57.221
So our track numbers are here
at the left side of their cell.

159
00:10:57.221 --> 00:11:02.708
Looks like it has a nice even padding
over there on the side, but our eye

160
00:11:02.708 --> 00:11:09.037
adds together that same padding over here
on the side of our table and our number.

161
00:11:09.037 --> 00:11:13.954
So what we'll wanna do is we'll wanna
push those timestamps to the right side

162
00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:18.433
of the table and that will make our
padding look a little bit more even.

163
00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:26.591
So, to do that,
we'll just simply add to td last of type,

164
00:11:26.591 --> 00:11:30.599
we can say text align right.

165
00:11:30.599 --> 00:11:34.396
And once we have that in place, you see
that our timestamps are pushed over there

166
00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:36.448
to the side,
we can get rid of that border.

167
00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:47.240
And now things look a little bit more
even there in that particular box.
