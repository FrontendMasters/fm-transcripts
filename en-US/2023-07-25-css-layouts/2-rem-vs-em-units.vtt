00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.301
Is it preferably better to use
the rem instead of like or pixel?

2
00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:09.577
&gt;&gt; Yes, I like ramps,
and I'll show you why.

3
00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:14.770
So I'll do the CodePen that I do for
a lot of courses here.

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.200
So I'm going to set this up.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.470
I'm gonna set up an h1, and
I'm going to say practical CSS layouts.

6
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.119
And then I'm gonna put in a paragraph and
I'm gonna say Jen Kramer.

7
00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:36.425
And then in my CSS I'm gonna set up my H1.

8
00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:38.407
I'm gonna set up a quick style here.

9
00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:44.155
Let's say I have a background
color of green and

10
00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:47.180
a color of white, okay?

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.473
And then in my paragraph, I'm going to say

12
00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:58.411
a background color of blue and
a color of white.

13
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.625
Super simple.

14
00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:06.840
And because I can't stand it, body,

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.440
font-family, arial, so ugly.

16
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.481
Okay, so here we are we have an h1 and
we have a paragraph, right,

17
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:23.174
and they have you can see
the backgrounds around them, okay.

18
00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:28.955
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to apply a font size from my body and

19
00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:34.670
then I'm gonna apply it here to
practical CSS layouts and to GenCramer.

20
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.630
I'll apply to both of those because
font size is something that inherits.

21
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.960
And what I'm going to do,
actually not font size.

22
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.060
I'm gonna do padding.

23
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.960
Padding.

24
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.630
And I'm going to set this to be 1rem.

25
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.545
When I set this to.

26
00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:59.700
[INAUDIBLE]
Apologies.

27
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.350
Let's just do it this way.

28
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.040
Padding, 1rem, and paragraph.

29
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.630
Padding, 1rem.

30
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.800
Pretty much as you'd expect, right?

31
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.560
Same kind of padding on both of these.

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.660
You can see that the text is lined
up here on the left-hand side, okay?

33
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.810
That is because a rem stands for what?

34
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:29.177
&gt;&gt; It's a relative type measurement,
but relative to the root.

35
00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:30.620
&gt;&gt; Relative to the root.

36
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.500
Root relative.

37
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340
Cool, that really helps.

38
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.895
What is an?

39
00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:39.983
[LAUGH] Anybody know what an is?

40
00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:43.272
&gt;&gt; Isn't it like the pixel size
of like literally a letter.

41
00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:49.450
&gt;&gt; It is literally the size of a,
I think it's a lowercase letter okay.

42
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.934
The lowercase letter,
letter which is kinda fat,

43
00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:57.110
that is gonna be defined as one
of those things, all right?

44
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.253
So if I take the r from my rem, and

45
00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:04.916
I set the padding to 1em,
guess what happens?

46
00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:09.862
Those things are different, aren't they?

47
00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:11.087
Why is that?

48
00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:16.679
&gt;&gt; Is it cuz the font size are different?

49
00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.170
&gt;&gt; Cuz the font sizes
are actually different.

50
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.042
They are relative to the letter and
the H1 as we know by default has

51
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:29.500
a bigger lowercase letter than
the paragraph does, right?

52
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.319
And the spacing is scaled accordingly.

53
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.980
Okay, so
that's why you get different things.

54
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.977
So what I find is that as I teach,
I work with rems,

55
00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:48.074
they give us the flexibility,
the wonderful flexibility that's great for

56
00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:51.710
responsive design and they are consistent.

57
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.470
Instead of worrying about what's
happening exactly in space.

58
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.240
Make sense?

59
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

60
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.120
&gt;&gt; So what is the,
when it's relative, what is it?

61
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.710
It didn't look like
the paragraph padding changed.

62
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.200
&gt;&gt; Right?

63
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.640
&gt;&gt; So what is the-
&gt;&gt; What's it relative to?

64
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.095
That is the best question, and that is
something I am going to ask you a lot.

65
00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:17.594
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What is it relative to?

66
00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:22.684
In this case it's route relative,
so this is the size of the HTML

67
00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:27.799
elements text, it is set usually
by the browser to 16 pixels.

68
00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:30.409
So 16 pixels is generally 1rem.

69
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.985
&gt;&gt; Our paragraph is set to 16 pixels, so
you actually you didn't see that change.

70
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.015
&gt;&gt; Okay.

71
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:42.588
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about the benefits of
rem from an accessibility standpoint?

72
00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:47.576
&gt;&gt; Yes, so any of these units of
measure that are relative, percents,

73
00:04:47.576 --> 00:04:49.986
ems, rems, that type of thing.

74
00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:54.230
As you enlarge things for
your screen, if you decide to blow up

75
00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.080
the magnification of the page,
everything scales proportionately.

76
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.800
Because you're scaling
that root level size.

77
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.303
So you're going from 16 pixels
to 18 to 20 to 22, right?

78
00:05:07.303 --> 00:05:12.539
It's getting larger and larger and larger,
and your whole page scales consistently.

79
00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.883
As opposed to things not
scaling consistently and

80
00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:18.597
you wind up with a wonky-looking page.

81
00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:20.616
Make sense?

82
00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:23.146
&gt;&gt; Question about resetting.

83
00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:27.890
I see people that will change
the size to match, like one pixel.

84
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.150
10 pixels equals 1rem or
something like that.

85
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.798
&gt;&gt; Yes.

86
00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:31.506
&gt;&gt; Is that something you recommend?

87
00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:33.465
&gt;&gt; That's an old trick.

88
00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.308
It's been around for many, many years.

89
00:05:35.308 --> 00:05:39.988
And I think people do that because
they're trying to make their math easier,

90
00:05:39.988 --> 00:05:43.308
that they're not thinking
about things in base 16.

91
00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:45.041
So, yeah.

92
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.678
Yep?

93
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:49.782
&gt;&gt; So is relative to the parent,
and rem is relevant to the root?

94
00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:52.006
&gt;&gt; Correct, correct.

95
00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:56.717
is relative, actually not even the parent
to the element that we're looking at

96
00:05:56.717 --> 00:05:58.913
at the moment, in this case the H1.

97
00:05:58.913 --> 00:06:05.326
Because H1's parent is body, and body has
got 16 pixels, right, for the font size.

98
00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:11.562
So it's actually the actual element
itself, and rem is relative to the root.

99
00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:14.614
And we're gonna see how
this is important here in

100
00:06:14.614 --> 00:06:17.938
just a moment, okay, yes
&gt;&gt; Are you saying that by default

101
00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:21.706
the browser says that 16 pixels is
the rem unless you say that some

102
00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:23.266
other element is the root.

103
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:27.650
&gt;&gt; 16 pixels is the root font
size that the browser has set

104
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.550
unless we decide we wanna change it.

105
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.491
&gt;&gt; Okay, and you would do that in the,
&gt;&gt; And

106
00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:35.920
we're gonna do that coming right up,
[LAUGH]
