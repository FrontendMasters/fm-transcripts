00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.264
Okay, so if you guys will go to 4D part 5,
final styling of the elements,

2
00:00:08.264 --> 00:00:12.852
open up that code pen and
fork it to your account.

3
00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:17.169
We're ready for the last part of
this which is adding an album cover.

4
00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.850
Remember that album cover
is going to show up above.

5
00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:28.220
Above the audio player, there we go.

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.350
Kind of like that.

7
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.756
The track list is not in
the right place on this, but

8
00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:37.760
the cover will be on the top and
the audio player will be underneath, okay?

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.730
So let's go through how we're
gonna go about adding that.

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.874
If you've forked your code pen here,
you'll see that we have the URL

11
00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:55.080
here at the top of the 4D audio player,
part E, style, everything else.

12
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.792
And we can just copy that URL here.

13
00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:03.896
And we are going to add that
before our audio player container.

14
00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:07.786
So we can put in, let's say,

15
00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:11.992
a section with a class of cover.

16
00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:20.780
And we can end that section,

17
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.975
right after our audio
player container here.

18
00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:39.336
And then for our image,
we can just post that on in here,

19
00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:46.550
copy and paste in our album cover, and
we can say for our alt text, album cover.

20
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.729
It was all a dream by

21
00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.697
Magenta Lime, okay?

22
00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:58.698
And then we have a little
bit of styling to do here

23
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.901
I'm gonna just add this style here inside
of audio and what I'm going to do,

24
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:17.572
because now I have this section with
a class of cover that goes around that

25
00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:20.048
image and my audio player container.

26
00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:24.729
If I can just take this audio player
container and just change it to cover,

27
00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.520
a class of cover, and
that'll group everything nicely.

28
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.220
There's our album cover and
there's our audio player right underneath.

29
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.650
Sweet, so what I'd like for you to take
away from this section is the following.

30
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.508
We went online we found an article that
explained how to make an audio player

31
00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:50.441
without, hey look the audio player has
a mute button, it has a play button,

32
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:55.500
it has the little track for volume and
for playing the track, right?

33
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.235
And all those things look terrible, didn't
look anything like we wanted it to look,

34
00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:03.417
but yet we were able to go in and
apply our styling to that.

35
00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:07.609
And the reason I'm bringing this to your
attention is that you are going to do

36
00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.180
the same thing, but
with the hamburger button
