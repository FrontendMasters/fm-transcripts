00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.212
All right, so if you take
a look at this image, it may or

2
00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:07.940
may not look good on your computer,
depending on how big your screen is.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.430
Does it look like a quality image?

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.730
Does it feel kind of big?

5
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.040
Maybe it feels a little bit big.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.680
Maybe it's a little bit tall.

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.024
I mean, this is how the webpage is gonna
look when you arrive on it, right?

8
00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.500
So it looks like magenta line.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.160
And there they are.

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.812
And if you're not looking for
a scroll bar,

11
00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:31.280
you could easily miss the actual
content of this web page, yeah?

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.939
Okay, so there is a way that we
can deal with these images, and

13
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:40.400
we are going to do that
here inside of our HTML.

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.190
So if you open up your HTML here,
make this just a tiny bit smaller.

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.540
There we go.

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.384
If you open up your HTML here and
take a look for the banner,

17
00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:59.670
which happens around line 5,
right now we have a single image in place.

18
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.450
See that.

19
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.990
That is our image of the guys here.

20
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.780
And it is actually at 475 pixels.

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.770
It actually doesn't get any
bigger than that by default.

22
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.827
Remember, we have a style on it
that has a width set to 100%.

23
00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:17.159
So this definitely is stretched
to at least 800 pixels, okay,

24
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.590
which will make it a little bit fuzzy.

25
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.089
Again, that may come through on
your computer, or it may not.

26
00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:27.550
It's a little bit bigger than
the original size we designed it for.

27
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.207
One of the things that
we can do with pictures,

28
00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:34.435
especially banner pictures like this
that need to switch their quality,

29
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:37.450
is we can leverage HTML for
that, believe it or not.

30
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.980
And it's very efficient.

31
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.320
It will not impact
the performance of your page.

32
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.740
This is through something
called the picture element.

33
00:01:50.163 --> 00:01:54.990
And the picture element is designed
to swap between different pictures.

34
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.085
It is smart enough to load the right
picture into your webpage,

35
00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.290
depending on how wide your screen is.

36
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.464
So if you're not familiar
with the picture element,

37
00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:08.152
this is gonna change your life,
[LAUGH] okay?

38
00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:09.300
So let's set this up.

39
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.880
So right after the banner here,
let's put in our picture.

40
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.810
And it starts with picture,
exactly as you'd expect.

41
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.310
And it ends with /picture.

42
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.341
So this is the responsive way to deal
with images here inside of HTML.

43
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:31.707
And then with this picture, we can add,

44
00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:35.570
I'm actually just gonna
copy my image tag here.

45
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.459
Just copy that, and
we can make changes to it.

46
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.199
So it's not image, it will be source,
is the name of your element, source.

47
00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:52.471
And it's not src for the attribute,

48
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:57.320
it's srcset, Okay?

49
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.240
So we have a picture element
around the whole thing.

50
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.100
The first element is gonna be our
source with a source set of, and

51
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.786
this is gonna change to 1200 pixels,
so 1200.jpg.

52
00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:14.330
So that's gonna load in the right
version of the picture.

53
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.200
See how that picture is
a little bit less tall?

54
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.600
Pulls up the rest of the content
there on the bottom, okay?

55
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.640
And there is no alt text on a source item.

56
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.960
That alt text is only on the image,
which is part of the picture.

57
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.840
So the image down there always comes last.

58
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.800
It has the alt text on it,
and it is the default.

59
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.647
So if your browser
doesn't support picture,

60
00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:47.538
which at this point is pretty much none
of them but if doesn't support picture or

61
00:03:47.538 --> 00:03:52.510
you're on a mobile device, that is kind
of the one that's going to load, okay?

62
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.570
On your source, we're gonna add a test.

63
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.340
And that test is gonna be
media is our attribute.

64
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.382
And to this we can add a media query,
that kinda style.

65
00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:10.861
So min-width: 800px, just like that.

66
00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:20.100
So at 800px and higher, we'll load
in the 1200px version of this image.

67
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.560
And when it's smaller, we'll go to
the other version of the picture.

68
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.569
See how that happens?

69
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.218
We maintain our quality and these are
slightly different, so the headspace here

70
00:04:31.218 --> 00:04:36.730
on this picture is lower than we have
on the original version of the picture.

71
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.230
See that?

72
00:04:42.404 --> 00:04:44.920
Cool?

73
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.800
So we did a min-width that
matched our media query, right?

74
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.280
So we have a min-width 800px media query.

75
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.610
We have a min-width 800px picture.

76
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.410
Don't have to.

77
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.940
We could have different versions
of this picture, right?

78
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.620
We could load it in at all
different points for media.

79
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.457
You can also do other tests here as well,
once again.

80
00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.560
Makes sense?

81
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.100
So if you're on portrait, load something.

82
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.690
If you're on tablet, load something else.

83
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.200
That kinda thing.

84
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.819
&gt;&gt; Where do you add
those additional media-

85
00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:17.996
&gt;&gt; That would be part of this

86
00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:19.180
media query here, yep.

87
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:23.531
How fun is that?

88
00:05:25.823 --> 00:05:28.110
&gt;&gt; So would you keep adding sources then?

89
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.560
&gt;&gt; You could, you could have
as many sources as you want.

90
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.334
So, just for illustration sake, whoops.

91
00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:41.010
Here I go.

92
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.847
I've got, whoops, [LAUGH].

93
00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:46.750
I-
&gt;&gt; You copied an opening tag.

94
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.890
&gt;&gt; I did.

95
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.801
Here we go.
Let me try again.

96
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:54.800
Here we go.

97
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.690
Now I've got four different sources.

98
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.420
And I could write all kinds
of different media queries.

99
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.980
I can have different source images for
that.

100
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.080
I could be loading, for example, we have
a whole bunch of new image formats, right?

101
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.960
We have WebP image formats.

102
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.230
And we have AVIF and stuff.

103
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.316
If I wanna load one of those in but I'm
not sure that we have enough browsers that

104
00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:20.349
are supporting it yet, I can do that kind
of thing here with my source images.

105
00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.479
Make sense?
&gt;&gt; So you have one source tag per query

106
00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:23.422
that you want?

107
00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:27.083
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
in theory something is going to change.

108
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:29.808
Yeah, and the browser's gonna
iterate through those, and

109
00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.631
the first match that it finds will load.

110
00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:39.700
So in this case, if we're at 700 and,
whatever, here I am.

111
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.880
I'm at 642 pixels.

112
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.270
So the browser goes to my first source
here, and it says min-width: 800px.

113
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.505
And it goes, not that one, and
then it'll jump to the next one,

114
00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:55.600
where it's still not 800px, and it's still
not 800px, and it's still not 800px.

115
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.587
So then it gets to the image tag,
make sense?

116
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.590
Okay, we don't need all those.

117
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.416
That is something that I hope you all
take home and put to work immediately.

118
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.580
Very handy thing to know.

119
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.630
&gt;&gt; Why did it crop the top of the picture?

120
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.670
&gt;&gt; That's what the graphic designer did.

121
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.
That's the picture itself.

122
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.168
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the graphic designer has the eye
to figure out what should be shown and

123
00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:25.860
what shouldn't and where the focus,
sort of that quote art direction.

124
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.693
There are other ways of loading
images if you're just looking for

125
00:07:31.693 --> 00:07:36.484
the smallest image, based on whatever
is going on with your web browser and

126
00:07:36.484 --> 00:07:39.740
your Internet connections and stuff.

127
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.080
There's a whole bunch of these,
and I cover that.

128
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.995
I think I covered that in my Flexbox and
grid course.

129
00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:51.777
And if you wanna watch that chapter,
there's a whole bunch of ways of dealing

130
00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:55.177
with pictures, yeah, but
this way is art direction.
