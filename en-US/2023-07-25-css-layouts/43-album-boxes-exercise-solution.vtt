WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.019
Not so bad, right?

2
00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:05.176
You've been learning some stuff,
how to apply it, right?

3
00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:10.076
Okay, so the last thing that we
need style here on this page

4
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.276
now is these album boxes.

5
00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:18.759
So we have this album box down here, the
new album It Was All a Dream, Order Now.

6
00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.786
That one is correct.

7
00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.424
It's just fine the way it is.

8
00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.996
We don't need to change anything on it.

9
00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:31.937
But this one here shows announced new
tour get tickets, that one changes.

10
00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:36.117
So we need to have a background
image on that box.

11
00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:40.380
Notice that the height of that
box changes a little bit as we

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.524
go from one break point to another, yeah.

13
00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:47.173
So, we got a little bit
more height to that box,

14
00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:50.751
whereas the album box is not changing,
okay?

15
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:54.253
And these should stretch all
the way across the screen, so

16
00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.484
they match our ridiculous buttons.

17
00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:59.031
[LAUGH] Okay?

18
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:01.005
Makes sense?

19
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:04.476
And while you're there,
drop some bolts here.

20
00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:09.882
In where they're called for so
you're gonna do two things then

21
00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:15.401
one I'd like you to style up
the show's announced new tour box.

22
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:15.965
Okay?

23
00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:20.390
So that it reflects these and
you're gonna drop in these lightning

24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.640
bolts here they go around
the it was all a dream box

25
00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.181
All right, well we are almost done
with the small things that we need for

26
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:35.648
our difficult design and
I hope this all went well for you.

27
00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:39.029
The last part now is putting
in these lightning bolts.

28
00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.990
And styling up this box that says
New Tour on it, as opposed to the one

29
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.878
that says It Was All a Dream,
which should stay the way it has been.

30
00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:51.886
So what I did for my answers for this,

31
00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:57.723
we first of all we put in these lightning
bolts that are here on the page.

32
00:01:57.723 --> 00:02:01.723
And I just dropped those in where the
comment was there was a comment that said

33
00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:03.170
put a lightning bolt here.

34
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.804
So I dropped in those lightning bolts just
as the SVG version of this we don't need

35
00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:10.338
a hover state so
it's fine to use the image.

36
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.890
If you put it in as an SVG directly,
that's okay too.

37
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.719
And I gave it a class of
bolt hyphen LG for this

38
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.707
is the big bolt as opposed to the ones we
had earlier which were a little bolts.

39
00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:25.863
And then I wrote a CSS class for that.

40
00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:29.624
And I decided that 155
pixels was the right size.

41
00:02:29.624 --> 00:02:33.183
I gave it some margin around it and
centered it on the page.

42
00:02:33.183 --> 00:02:35.164
Pretty straightforward, right?

43
00:02:35.164 --> 00:02:37.543
Okay, so there's our two bolts.

44
00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:42.328
Now how about these boxes the box for
the new tour and It Was All a Dream.

45
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.714
How did you guys approach those?

46
00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:49.727
Did you write a whole bunch of
new styles for the new tour box?

47
00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:51.114
&gt;&gt; Added a class.

48
00:02:51.114 --> 00:02:53.804
&gt;&gt; We added a class, right?

49
00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:56.314
So, we did that same idea.

50
00:02:56.314 --> 00:03:00.914
So what I did was for,
It Was All a Dream that new album,

51
00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:06.116
it just still has the class of album,
but this other one here.

52
00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:08.228
We've got it all set up.

53
00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:12.914
It is now has a class of album and
mag line because, of course,

54
00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:16.084
those are the magenta line guys, right?

55
00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:19.112
And so,
then we just need to style that up.

56
00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:24.668
So I've styled that as putting
it in as a background image.

57
00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:28.244
So there's the background image and
I said no repeat.

58
00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:30.373
Okay, so it doesn't repeat itself.

59
00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:32.978
And then we said
the background size was cover.

60
00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:33.771
So in other words,

61
00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:36.654
we wanted to be sure to stretch to
cover the entire width of the thing.

62
00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.295
Make sense?

63
00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:40.235
Okay.

64
00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:43.448
When we get things that are bigger.

65
00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.000
Like this.

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.289
I think we added some styles down here.

67
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.494
Yeah, I changed the height
of it to 300 pixels.

68
00:03:53.805 --> 00:03:55.992
All right.

69
00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:58.610
And I don't think I have
anything down here for desktop.

70
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.458
I don't.

71
00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:03.021
Okay.
So we just set that up there.

72
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:08.218
You, of course, can put that media query
inside of the album layer if you wish.

73
00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:09.273
Make sense?

74
00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:15.366
So we're all done we, now have all that
stuff styled it's like half the webpage.

75
00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:16.751
Boom, boom, boom, we're done.
