1
00:00:01.528 --> 00:00:04.531
Now that we have our
tracklist working on mobile,

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:08.114
now it's time to get it working for
our tablet and desktop.

3
00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:13.421
What we would like to have happen here
is we are going to take the tracklist

4
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:19.424
which is currently located underneath the
audio player here on mobile devices and

5
00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:23.345
we're going to move it to
the left of the album cover.

6
00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:28.082
When clicked, the tracklist is
going to fly out to the left, and

7
00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:31.788
the close button,
we're gonna take our button.

8
00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:37.004
We remember we've toggled the name of
it from tracklist to close, that will

9
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:42.474
fly up to the top, and we will have a list
of tracks that will appear underneath.

10
00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:46.421
And we'll style a scroll bars and
all of that kind of thing as well.

11
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.623
So my approach to this is as follows,
first of all,

12
00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:54.394
we just wanna get the tracklist to show
up on the left side of the album cover.

13
00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:57.560
It doesn't matter what it looks like,
we just wanna move it and

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.829
make sure that it works.

15
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.262
Then the next thing we're
gonna do is format the button.

16
00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.608
So we need to make sure we turn it
on its side and maybe change it,

17
00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:08.463
some of the colors, and so
forth associated with it.

18
00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:13.933
We need to fix the formatting of the area
where the tracklist will appear.

19
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:18.058
We want it grow on click because
we're gonna have a narrow area for

20
00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.233
the button before it's clicked,

21
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:25.124
we want it to have a larger area to
display the tracklist after it's clicked.

22
00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:26.984
And then of course,
we need to add some fun stuff.

23
00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:30.135
We need to add some animations and
some scroll bar style and

24
00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:33.553
other kinds of things to give it
that last little bit of sizzle.

25
00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:36.299
So let's start with that first problem,

26
00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.230
which is how do we get the tracklist
to the left-hand side.

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.514
And that, as you've seen throughout this
course, always starts with the HTML.

28
00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:50.436
So if you take a look at the HTML
here in our starting state,

29
00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:55.468
you'll see that we have a div
with the class of main-grid.

30
00:01:55.468 --> 00:02:00.104
Inside of that, it has two children,
it has a main with a class of cover,

31
00:02:00.104 --> 00:02:05.196
that includes the cover art that you see
there, its icons and the audio player,

32
00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:09.616
and it includes the tracklist which
is underneath the audio player.

33
00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:12.624
All of that is inside of
the main-grid right now.

34
00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:17.506
So it's actually really easy to move
that tracklist button from the bottom

35
00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:19.451
over to the left-hand side.

36
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.847
Very, very straightforward to do.

37
00:02:21.847 --> 00:02:24.647
Because all we have to do is
leverage those parents and

38
00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:26.400
children in some kind of layout.

39
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.520
And we can do that with grid.

40
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.812
So inside of our CSS, let's scroll on down
here to the bottom of our tracklist layer,

41
00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:40.762
and I'm going to add a media query,
at media,

42
00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:46.797
min-width, 800 pixels.

43
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:55.603
Then I'm going to leverage
that main-grid class here, and

44
00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:59.038
set that up with our grid-based layout.

45
00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:08.657
So our main-grid will display grid

46
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.793
And I'm going to have
grid-template-columns,

47
00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:20.659
l have two of those, one will be 100
pixels and one will be 500 pixels.

48
00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.892
The album cover is 500 pixels wide.

49
00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:28.710
The button column will be 100 pixels
wide actually don't want these to have

50
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.690
any flex associated with them.

51
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.406
Normally we'd use something like
an FR unit, or something flexible,

52
00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:40.276
here I wanna have a very stiff kind of
layout because I have a very demanding

53
00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:43.363
set of specs for
this particular part of this.

54
00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:48.900
I'm gonna set my max width to 600 pixels.

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.928
Why 600 pixels?

56
00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:56.470
Because that's 100 plus 500 makes 600.

57
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.515
We'll also have no gap, And

58
00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:07.481
we'll have a margin of 0 auto to center
this particular element on the page.

59
00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:12.642
When I make my display
window a little bit bigger,

60
00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:15.164
you'll see that the tracklist
shows up there.

61
00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:18.193
It's showing up in the 500 pixel area.

62
00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:21.989
The cover is showing up in
the 100 pixel area of the grid.

63
00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.019
And when I click on the tracklist,
it still works just fine.

64
00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.811
Looks terrible, works just fine.

65
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.153
So let's swap these two so that
the tracklist is over on the left side.

66
00:04:33.153 --> 00:04:39.367
We can do that pretty easily
just by saying our cover,

67
00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:44.062
which is the main class of cover here, so

68
00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:49.738
our .cover class is going
to have an order of 2.

69
00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:52.185
And that will swap those two.

70
00:04:52.185 --> 00:04:54.523
Immediately, it starts to look better.

71
00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:57.130
Tracklist is still working.

72
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.004
When we click it, of course,
it's behind the album cover.

73
00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:04.656
And it stretches all the way down
the page, which we don't want but

74
00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:08.992
it's still at least in the right place,
so one step at a time.

75
00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:12.495
The next thing to do is to
fix this tracklist itself.

76
00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.203
So the tracklist is too
long as you can see,

77
00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:21.358
we want that tracklist to be
only as high as the album cover.

78
00:05:21.358 --> 00:05:23.574
So we can write a new style for that.

79
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:34.605
And we will say art, a class of tracklist,
in other words, our section there.

80
00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:38.736
I'm going to give it a fixed
height of 500 pixels.

81
00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:43.167
That matches the album cover so
that the tracklist and

82
00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:46.032
the album are now the same height.

83
00:05:46.032 --> 00:05:48.697
I'm going to say justify self and

84
00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:54.120
we don't want any gap in between
the album cover and our tracklist,

85
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.830
so by pushing that, sell the tracklist,
sell over to the album cover,

86
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.900
and we make sure that they
are absolutely touching each other.

87
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.505
We can turn off any padding and
margin associated with that section

88
00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:15.923
because once again we don't want
any gaps in between those two.

89
00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:20.145
And then the last part here has
to do with the tracklist itself.

90
00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:24.045
When I click the tracklist,
it shows up very happily.

91
00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:25.571
There it is.

92
00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:28.520
We can just scroll down the page and
read the whole thing.

93
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.676
But that's not the behavior that we want.

94
00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:33.458
What we want to do is get
a scroll bar here, so

95
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:37.371
when we click the tracklist button,
we see that content, but

96
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.775
we also get a scroll bar
that appears automatically.

97
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:45.283
And we can do that with
the overflow property.

98
00:06:45.283 --> 00:06:50.113
And I'm specifically gonna say overflow y,
auto.

99
00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:57.031
So the value of auto says to the browser,
if the scroll bar is required, display it.

100
00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:58.495
Otherwise, don't display it.

101
00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:02.545
So when I click on tracklist now,
I wind up with a scroll bar, and

102
00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:05.629
I can scroll very nicely
there within that area.

103
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.979
And we can apply some styling to that
scroll bar later to make it look a little

104
00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.301
bit more attractive.

105
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:15.717
We're just getting the default styling
that comes with our web browser for

106
00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:17.619
that scroll bar for the moment.

107
00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:22.215
If I had said, over flow y of scroll,

108
00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:28.946
Notice that you'll have a space for
scrollbar all the time, whether or

109
00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:30.213
not it's required.

110
00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:34.900
So by using auto,
it only shows up when it's needed.

111
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.090
Now as for the x direction,
I do not want that to show up ever.

112
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.584
So I'm going to say overflow-x and hidden.

113
00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:47.878
And that means just cut off any extra
content that happens to show up in

114
00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:51.596
the direction, and
it'll just turn that off completely.

115
00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:55.764
So, fundamentally it's working,
it's ugly, but it's working, and

116
00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:57.188
that was our first goal.

117
00:07:57.188 --> 00:08:01.001
Get it on the left side, make sure that
it works because if it's not working,

118
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:02.949
there's no point in making it pretty.

119
00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:08.360
The next thing to do is
to format this button.

120
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.317
So, in our comp here, we see that the
tracklist button is turned on its side,

121
00:08:14.317 --> 00:08:18.362
and it shows up in the middle
of that tracklist area.

122
00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:23.515
And when clicked, it should fly up
to the top of our tracklist and

123
00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:26.482
show up there, where it says close.

124
00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:29.481
So let's see if we can
make that happen as well.

125
00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:36.267
I'm gonna start by,

126
00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:44.043
Opening up in my HTML my button here.

127
00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:46.743
And right now my button
has an ID of tracklist.

128
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:52.111
That ID is there specifically for
some JavaScript purposes we're using

129
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:57.127
it to swap the the text that's on
the button and we've actually used

130
00:08:57.127 --> 00:09:02.416
it as a trigger to swap classes for
that table, from hidden to showing.

131
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:06.576
I'm gonna add to this now a class, and

132
00:09:06.576 --> 00:09:10.867
I am gonna call it button-tracklist.

133
00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:11.813
Why?

134
00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:15.231
Because this button is gonna
have two states to it as well.

135
00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:19.131
We're going to have its default display,
which is pretty much kind of

136
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:23.510
like it is right now, with a couple of
additions, like turning it on its side.

137
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:28.039
When clicked, we're going to use
JavaScript to swap a class again and

138
00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:31.417
it'll turn into our closed
version of the button and

139
00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:34.353
it will have completely different styling.

140
00:09:34.353 --> 00:09:36.638
If we leave one as an ID and
one as a class,

141
00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:40.353
we're going to have specificity
issues here dealing with this.

142
00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:43.842
So what we wanna do is have
a class in both situations so

143
00:09:43.842 --> 00:09:48.890
that these styles easily override each
other rather than relying on that ID.

144
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:54.896
All right, so
let's go down to our JavaScript And

145
00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:59.218
if you scroll down to the bottom of our
JavaScript you'll find in our little

146
00:09:59.218 --> 00:10:02.658
function here that is hiding and
revealing our tracklist.

147
00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:14.591
So remember that first line there and
that JavaScript is when that add

148
00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:19.708
that button with the ID of tracklist
is clicked, stuff is gonna happen.

149
00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:22.939
We swap our table class
from hidden to showing.

150
00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:25.723
We're also now going to do something else.

151
00:10:25.723 --> 00:10:28.586
We can swap that new class
that we just created.

152
00:10:32.724 --> 00:10:37.757
So we're gonna swap our
button-tracklist class.

153
00:10:37.757 --> 00:10:42.747
And we're going to swap it for
a class called button-close.

154
00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:47.578
So that will allow us to apply
some new styling to our close

155
00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:52.121
button that isn't necessarily
present otherwise.

156
00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:54.242
So let's head back into our CSS and

157
00:10:54.242 --> 00:10:57.764
now let's style our button
in its two different states.

158
00:10:57.764 --> 00:11:01.391
We're gonna style the tracklist
version of this, in other words,

159
00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:05.911
the default unclick version of the button,
and then we will style the close button,

160
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:08.349
which is the clicked
version of this button.

161
00:11:08.349 --> 00:11:17.045
So let's start with our button-tracklist.

162
00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:21.245
This is of course, the version of
the button here in this state.

163
00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:29.264
We're going to set this to
transform rotate, 90 degrees.

164
00:11:29.264 --> 00:11:33.018
So that will turn it on its side
exactly as we wish for it to look.

165
00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:36.641
And when we do that,

166
00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:41.301
it will just turn right on the center
axis of the word tracklist.

167
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:45.896
So it's actually cut off there
off the top of that particular

168
00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:50.864
section at the moment in time,
but don't worry, we will fix it.

169
00:11:50.864 --> 00:11:54.404
We'll say display block,
we already said this and

170
00:11:54.404 --> 00:11:57.861
earlier in the mobile
version of this button, but

171
00:11:57.861 --> 00:12:02.488
I'll say it again just to make
the code a little bit easier to read.

172
00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.525
We'll turn off any margin.

173
00:12:06.832 --> 00:12:10.183
And padding associated with this button.

174
00:12:10.183 --> 00:12:17.172
And then I'll override that, actually,
I'll say margin-top of 225 pixels.

175
00:12:17.172 --> 00:12:20.149
And that will push that tracklist
down to roughly the center.

176
00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:23.023
Remember that our album
cover is 500 pixels wide.

177
00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:27.949
So 225 with the word tracklist
looked about right to me in

178
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:30.916
terms of being there in the center.

179
00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:35.622
So now when we click this we get our
tracklist and our close button is

180
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:40.499
sitting right in the middle exactly
where our tracklist button was,

181
00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:43.205
and it's turned sideways like this.

182
00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:45.673
So what we want to have happen is,

183
00:12:45.673 --> 00:12:50.978
we want our close button to turn back
around to where it was originally.

184
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:54.502
And we want it to go up to
the top of our tracklist.

185
00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:57.036
So we can write a class to do that.

186
00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:04.065
So, this is button-close.

187
00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:09.267
After clicking, of course,
this is the class that's available.

188
00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:11.941
We'll say transform.

189
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:14.724
Rotate 0 degrees.

190
00:13:17.858 --> 00:13:22.503
So that will allow our close button to
rotate back to its original position.

191
00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:31.297
And we can give it a little padding,
1ram 0 and

192
00:13:31.297 --> 00:13:36.027
we'll set its position to sticky.

193
00:13:36.027 --> 00:13:38.245
And we want that to be at the top.

194
00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:42.058
So if you just turn it now, it is sticky.

195
00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:47.269
It'll scroll up to the top here, actually
just continues to scroll off the page.

196
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:50.725
But if we say top, 0,

197
00:13:54.936 --> 00:14:00.704
Then our close button will scroll up
to the top here and stay put, see that?

198
00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:04.532
As we scroll this on by.

199
00:14:06.353 --> 00:14:07.073
Okay?

200
00:14:09.278 --> 00:14:10.389
So what's going on?

201
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:12.456
Why didn't that close button?

202
00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:16.338
Why does it stay right here in the middle?

203
00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:20.511
Why didn't it show up here
at the top if we said top 0?

204
00:14:20.511 --> 00:14:23.592
Well, the answer is that
our button tracklist,

205
00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:26.009
we have a margin top of 225 pixels.

206
00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:27.476
And that's exactly what's happening here.

207
00:14:27.476 --> 00:14:28.484
We have this margin.

208
00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:33.185
Position, sticky says it's gonna get up
to the top and then it's gonna stay put.

209
00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:36.119
And if that's an effect you like,
you can keep it.

210
00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:39.016
But I want mine to go up
to the top immediately.

211
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:41.254
So we can turn off that margin.

212
00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:46.811
So margin top of 0 will turn that off.

213
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:51.417
So when I click it, now my close button
shows up at the top of the list.

214
00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:55.008
And then we can add some styling to this.

215
00:14:55.008 --> 00:14:59.360
Because, of course, right now it's
transparent, it looks like our tracklist

216
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.881
is going underneath that close button,
which, in fact, it is.

217
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:06.606
Let's give that close button
a little bit more styling.

218
00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:11.931
So let's say a background

219
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:16.529
color of var, cyan and

220
00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:21.376
a color of var, black.

221
00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:24.816
So we'll have a little bit of text there.

222
00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:28.057
So now when I click on
the tracklist button,

223
00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:31.659
it should show up here
with the styling in place.

224
00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:37.477
All right, so why didn't that styling
work here on this close button?

225
00:15:37.477 --> 00:15:42.253
See we called for
a background color of cyan we called for

226
00:15:42.253 --> 00:15:47.649
a color of black, why is it still
displaying the way that it is?

227
00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:48.692
Great question.

228
00:15:48.692 --> 00:15:53.304
Well, if we scroll back on up
to our original styling here,

229
00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:56.457
we originally used our ID to style this.

230
00:15:56.457 --> 00:16:01.583
So way up here at the top of our layer,
we have an ID of tracklist

231
00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:06.821
with a background color of transparent and
a color of magenta.

232
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:09.469
So what's happening is
a specificity problem,

233
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:13.939
we're having a class trying to override
an ID, and of course that doesn't work.

234
00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:19.051
So one solution to this would be
to change our ID of tracklist.

235
00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:21.529
We could change that
now to their new class.

236
00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:25.375
So let's call it button-tracklist.

237
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.744
Our original styling is still safe here,
but now our closed styling will apply.

238
00:16:32.744 --> 00:16:35.179
Looks like we need to fix
a hover state here too.

239
00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:38.129
As you see when we roll over,
it looks like the text disappears.

240
00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:43.726
That's because the text is set
to be cyan on hover by default.

241
00:16:43.726 --> 00:16:47.954
So while we're here,
let's change our ID of

242
00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:52.645
tracklist hover to button-tracklist:hover.

243
00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:56.338
That will be fixed that
same particular problem.

244
00:16:56.338 --> 00:16:57.938
There we go.

245
00:16:57.938 --> 00:17:05.115
All right, so then when we scroll
back down into our media query and

246
00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:09.341
we go to our close button now we can say,

247
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:13.954
button-close:hover, and we can say our

248
00:17:13.954 --> 00:17:18.907
color, Can be whatever you want.

249
00:17:18.907 --> 00:17:22.905
There are a lot of different colors we can
change our background color or something.

250
00:17:22.905 --> 00:17:25.943
So maybe we say our background color

251
00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:31.953
Goes to var magenta.

252
00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:40.064
And our color goes to var white.

253
00:17:40.064 --> 00:17:45.588
So now click our close button,
looks like that,

254
00:17:45.588 --> 00:17:52.348
might be better with black,
maybe we want it lime instead.

255
00:17:58.008 --> 00:17:59.465
Maybe something like that, so

256
00:17:59.465 --> 00:18:03.171
you can continue to play around with it
until you find something that you like.
