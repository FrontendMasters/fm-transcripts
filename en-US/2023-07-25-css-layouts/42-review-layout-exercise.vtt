00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.370
Next thing that I'd like for you to do is
I'd like for you to tackle these reviews.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.200
So remember the weird layout that's caused
up here is caused by some of those media

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.440
queries that we had earlier.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.823
So you may wind up having to get rid of
some of those media queries that were

5
00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:18.330
responsible for the review.

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.309
That's thing number one.

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.894
Thing number two,
inside of the reviews here,

8
00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:32.826
let's look at our HTML, so
that HTML is changed a little bit.

9
00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:36.930
Our figures are the same, but
you'll notice that what I called for

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.189
in between each figure is the quotes,
small lightning bolt, okay?

11
00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:44.680
And you have access to
that small lightning bolt.

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.120
It's here in the exercise up here,
there's the lightning bolt.

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.710
You can view it for the SVG code,
or copy that URL and

14
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.486
put it in an image tag, all right?

15
00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.870
And you'll drop all those
lightning bolts on in there.

16
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.400
Then what you're going to need to
do is look at your designs here.

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.122
And notice that depending on the layout,

18
00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:13.100
you're gonna show different
lightning bolts or hide them.

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.210
Make sense?

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.020
You don't have to do
all the review layout.

21
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.678
Let's just focus on getting those
lightning bolts in the right place and

22
00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:24.826
showing or hiding as correctly.

23
00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:28.346
So what I'd recommend that you do is
your first approach is go through and

24
00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:32.039
put in the lightning bolts, just put
them all in and make sure they all work,

25
00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.140
that would be the first
thing that I would do.

26
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.303
Then I would think about, just on mobile,
what lightning bolts are showing,

27
00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:43.180
what lightning bolts are hiding, right?

28
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.873
We probably need a class
to make that happen.

29
00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:48.777
And then you're gonna change
that setting at tablet, and

30
00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:50.930
you'll change it again at desktop.

31
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.568
Make sense?

32
00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:59.340
Let's see how you did with the reviews.

33
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.680
But before we go there, I wanna point out
the error that I made with my buttons.

34
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.700
And that is, I have a wrapper here,
this is inside of my base styles.

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.440
I have a wrapper that did
not have the max width set.

36
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.750
So I set my max width to 500 pixels.

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050
And now my buttons are behaving just fine.

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.230
So without that line,
I'll show you what it looked like.

39
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.907
They were whacked out in crazy [LAUGH] so
when I put that line back in,

40
00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:35.340
now those buttons are behaving
a little bit better.

41
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.750
So that's what happened with that.

42
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.821
Remember that later in our document,

43
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:46.500
way down here at the bottom,
where have I got it?

44
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.160
I've actually got it in my reviews.

45
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.485
I have two media queries in my reviews,
one is a minimum width of 800 pixels and

46
00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:57.270
the other is a minimum
width of 1,000 pixels.

47
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.882
And here I change the width of my wrapper,
okay?

48
00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:07.055
So now those buttons should
behave a little bit better, okay?

49
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:09.800
So here we are at tablet dimensions.

50
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.001
They are bigger than the boxes,
the album boxes there, the NEW TOUR and

51
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:18.083
IT WAS ALL A DREAM, they're a little
bit bigger than that right now.

52
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:22.048
And that is because their width this
currently controlled by the width of

53
00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:22.763
the rapper.

54
00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:23.560
Make sense?

55
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.690
Okay, fantastic.

56
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.950
All right, so
let's talk about these reviews.

57
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.983
So let's start off with our HTML.

58
00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:40.640
And what I have going on here in the HTML,
we have our figures.

59
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.220
We can just fold up the figures,
we don't need to even look at them.

60
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.280
Then I have a line of code like this.

61
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.920
So this is a div with a class of
bolt because it's a lightning bolt.

62
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.010
And then we have our image source and
we have our lightning bolt here.

63
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.700
I've left the alt text empty because
these are truly decorative elements.

64
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.350
They're just little
separators on the reviews.

65
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.907
We don't need a screen reader
to tell us that they are bolts.

66
00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:12.110
[LAUGH] Make sense?

67
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.469
Okay, so these are just decorative images.

68
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.390
Now, some of these,
let's take the second one here.

69
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.230
I have some other classes in place.

70
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.210
I have a class of hidemobile.

71
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.215
Guess what that does?

72
00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:25.404
&gt;&gt; Hides it on mobile.

73
00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:29.410
&gt;&gt; Hides it on mobile, wow.

74
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.040
And I have other ones here
with a class of hidetablet.

75
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.999
Guess what that does?

76
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.390
&gt;&gt; Hides it on tablet.

77
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.164
&gt;&gt; Hides it on tablet?

78
00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:39.600
Wow, cool.

79
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.959
Yeah, super high tech approach here.

80
00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:47.130
So there's a mix of those hiding
on tablet and hiding on mobile.

81
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.410
So then the corresponding code in
CSS winds up looking like this.

82
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.684
So here I am in my reviews layer, okay?

83
00:04:57.684 --> 00:05:04.103
I changed my reviews layout, so I'm just
doing flex box now, plain old flex box.

84
00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:08.686
Row wrap, justify the content
in the center, one rem gap,

85
00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:10.870
and text-align center.

86
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.220
So everything is just gonna flow with flex
box which is exactly what we want, right?

87
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.100
We don't want any stiff kind
of grid stuff going on.

88
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.990
We want these to be
a little bit more flexible.

89
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.610
So that's why I picked flex box.

90
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.842
And then I have hidemobile display none.

91
00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:30.328
In my media query, for tablet,
we bring back hidemobile,

92
00:05:30.328 --> 00:05:36.160
now it's display block and
we take hidetablet and we display none.

93
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.670
Make sense?

94
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.700
Change the padding on
the reviews a little bit.

95
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.390
So, when we get to the larger screen size,
there they are, they look good, okay?

96
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.228
And then when we get to
the larger dimension,

97
00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:52.710
now hidetablet is back to display block.

98
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.020
So there it is.

99
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.202
And eventually,

100
00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:59.786
you can stretch your reviews all
the way across the top of the screen.
