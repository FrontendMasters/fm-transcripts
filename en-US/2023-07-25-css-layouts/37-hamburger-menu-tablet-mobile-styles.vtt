1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.710
All right, so we're gonna move on
now to the mobile dropdown menu.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.052
I'm gonna make one
change here immediately,

3
00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:14.517
which is I want my max
width to be 600 pixels.

4
00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:15.186
Why?

5
00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:15.855
I don't know.

6
00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.831
That's sort of what worked for me.

7
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:20.337
So the next thing that we need to do,

8
00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:25.867
we need to style our hamburger button
here, which is the wrong color, right?

9
00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:31.000
And when we click it, we get this
weird fly-down thing like this.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.479
Do you like it?

11
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.189
&gt;&gt; No.

12
00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:35.475
&gt;&gt; No, what would you rather have?

13
00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:38.164
&gt;&gt; Drop down.

14
00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:42.123
&gt;&gt; Some kinda drop-down kinda thing
that occupies the whole screen and

15
00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:43.565
just has the links on it.

16
00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:45.829
Kinda like you see on every other website.

17
00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.908
Yeah, okay, we can do that.

18
00:00:47.908 --> 00:00:52.343
All right, so
let's start with the easiest thing first.

19
00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:55.148
Let's start with this hamburger button.

20
00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:57.511
Where is it?

21
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.870
How do we change its color?

22
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.823
Take a look there in the code and
see if you can find that.

23
00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:07.320
Pro-tip, there is a comment where it says
[LAUGH] where the hamburger button is.

24
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.426
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; 182.

25
00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:13.288
&gt;&gt; Yeah, around 182, something like that.

26
00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:19.203
This is the hamburger button itself
right here, MainMenuOpen after content.

27
00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:22.494
That 2630 calls for
the hamburger button, okay?

28
00:01:22.494 --> 00:01:26.006
So where's the color for
the hamburger button called?

29
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:27.238
&gt;&gt; In there.

30
00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:34.014
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't see the color here right
now, where would the color be called?

31
00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:34.834
&gt;&gt; Up above in there.

32
00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:38.643
Up above right here in MainMenuOpen.

33
00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:45.404
So let's change that to var magenta or
whatever color you want.

34
00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:48.379
Okay, so the next thing here is this one.

35
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.814
It's called MainMenuOpen + nav.

36
00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:54.687
What does the plus sign mean?

37
00:01:54.687 --> 00:01:56.392
&gt;&gt; It's an immediate sibling.

38
00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:58.238
&gt;&gt; An immediate sibling.

39
00:01:58.238 --> 00:02:04.866
Yep, the,
Sibling right next to each other.

40
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.716
So next to MainMenuOpen.

41
00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:08.815
So here's that button, right?

42
00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:09.611
Here's that button.

43
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:11.681
That's the one with MainMenuOpen.

44
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:16.571
When we say + nav, we're looking for
the sibling, right?

45
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:20.308
So the same level, immediately next to it.

46
00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:23.579
So that is this nav right here.

47
00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.271
There's no other nav in the document.

48
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:28.083
Now, did he need to put
that plus sign in there?

49
00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:35.373
No, [LAUGH] cuz without it,
it will work just fine.

50
00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:38.571
It will still work just fine.

51
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.154
Although look at that, I just broke it.

52
00:02:41.154 --> 00:02:42.681
So what do I know?

53
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:43.716
I know nothing.

54
00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:46.621
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; We'll leave it in there because it was

55
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:47.326
working.

56
00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:50.527
But that is what exactly that is doing,
okay?

57
00:02:50.527 --> 00:02:55.843
So, the nav immediately next
to the button which has that

58
00:02:55.843 --> 00:03:01.404
ID of MainMenuOpen and
has JavaScript associated with it.

59
00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:07.058
Okay, so what this is saying,
can anybody look at this bit of code and

60
00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:10.486
sort of interpret what's going on here?

61
00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:15.035
Let's look at position fixed,
top zero, left minus 100%,

62
00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:19.846
width 100%, height 100%,
overflow auto, display flex.

63
00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:21.532
What is going on here?

64
00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:25.744
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Is that the original starting point?

65
00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:26.743
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

66
00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:31.526
So this is at fixed position, means that
it's gonna be static on your screen,

67
00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:32.036
right?

68
00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:35.816
And if it's to the left 100%, where is it?

69
00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:36.716
&gt;&gt; Not on the screen.

70
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.468
&gt;&gt; Not on the screen.

71
00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:44.319
So that's what's going on here with this.

72
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.359
It's at the top of the screen,
but left side it's -100%.

73
00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.908
It's totally hidden from view.

74
00:03:50.908 --> 00:03:53.783
When does it come back into view?

75
00:03:55.327 --> 00:03:56.899
&gt;&gt; It's focused.

76
00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.269
&gt;&gt; When we hit the focus.

77
00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.182
So the button is focused, in other words,

78
00:04:03.182 --> 00:04:07.965
we remember we don't have
a click inside of CSS, but

79
00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:13.202
when the button has focus, so
the mouse is focused on it.

80
00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:17.922
Then we can shift that
left from -100% to 0.

81
00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:19.806
That brings the thing on screen.

82
00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:25.799
And we bring up the opacity from
0 to 1 and make it visible.

83
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.563
See how that is working?

84
00:04:28.563 --> 00:04:35.371
Okay, so with that in mind, let's
click the button and see what happens.

85
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:42.353
So when we click the button,
So what can we interpret here?

86
00:04:42.353 --> 00:04:45.031
We have a background color of defd.

87
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:47.629
Anybody wanna take a guess
at what color that might be?

88
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:53.808
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; This kinda light blue on the screen,

89
00:04:53.808 --> 00:04:54.376
right?

90
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:57.325
And it has no opacity to it.

91
00:04:57.325 --> 00:05:02.186
So this light blue color to it,
that is what's going on here.

92
00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:05.591
So we can start making
some changes to this.

93
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:11.708
We want to leave the box off-screen,
right, by default until it's clicked.

94
00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.368
We can leave this set to display flex.

95
00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:19.573
Let's give it some padding from the top.

96
00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:28.947
Let's give it 100 pixels, so
it'll push down the page a little bit and

97
00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:32.187
I'm gonna get rid of
a line item center and

98
00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:35.541
just leave the justified content setter.

99
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:39.834
And then I am going to make my
background black instead because this

100
00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:43.678
is a magenta line like blue is
just not cool on this website.

101
00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:48.831
So we're gonna change this if you're
wondering what a four-digit hex code is,

102
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:52.338
remember we talked about
H-digit hex codes earlier.

103
00:05:52.338 --> 00:05:55.752
This is that shortened version
of it just four digits.

104
00:05:55.752 --> 00:06:00.059
So if we change this to 000
followed by the letter d,

105
00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.442
that'll make it black with some opacity.

106
00:06:03.442 --> 00:06:05.833
Makes sense?

107
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:10.286
Okay, so now when I click this,
you see how the background got black with

108
00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:15.180
some opacity to it, and that's coming
from this color here on the background.

109
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.020
How cool is that?

110
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.772
So the next one we will look at here is
the nav with the unordered list in it.

111
00:06:22.772 --> 00:06:27.198
And we're gonna make some changes to this
one as well because this is what you

112
00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:27.829
see here.

113
00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:33.804
This thing that comes on the screen,
this is that ul thing that's going on.

114
00:06:33.804 --> 00:06:39.316
Whatever this is, we wanna make some
changes to it because it's kinda ugly.

115
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.203
And so to do that, we can get rid of the,

116
00:06:41.203 --> 00:06:44.601
I don't know why this guy kept
putting in flex-grow for everything.

117
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:45.641
We don't need it.

118
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:48.121
You can get rid of that.

119
00:06:48.121 --> 00:06:55.436
And this time for our flex,
I'm gonna change this to a flex-flow.

120
00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:58.546
And we're gonna say this is a column wrap.

121
00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:02.116
So other words, we want things to
display in a column here, right?

122
00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:05.193
We wanna have our stacked-up
navigation vertically,

123
00:07:05.193 --> 00:07:09.060
instead of it going horizontally on
the page as it does on the desktop.

124
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.197
So when we click this now we
have those funky button things,

125
00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:17.436
they're at least going in
a column sort of vaguely, right?

126
00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.447
Okay, so that's what that did.

127
00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:27.071
&gt;&gt; Why did you do that instead of
just flex-direction with column?

128
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:32.243
&gt;&gt; You can flex-flow is shorthand for
flex-direction and flex-wrap.

129
00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:35.616
It's a shorthand property that puts
both of those in one property.

130
00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:36.133
&gt;&gt; Got you.

131
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:40.204
&gt;&gt; Yep, okay.

132
00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:45.553
So we can then say justify-content,

133
00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:51.245
flex-start so that is gonna put
us at the very top of that box.

134
00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:56.823
You may not see much change yet,
but it will come.

135
00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:06.505
Now, right now this is set to a max

136
00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:11.792
width of 14 m and, I don't like it.

137
00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:17.926
[LAUGH] What I'm gonna do instead
is I'm gonna change that unit.

138
00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:21.611
So I'm gonna have a max width of 100vw.

139
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:23.336
What is vw?

140
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.805
&gt;&gt; Viewport width.

141
00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.427
&gt;&gt; Viewport width, right?

142
00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:29.638
So whatever it is,
we're gonna occupy no more than 100%.

143
00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:32.100
Basically the whole
width of that viewport.

144
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.386
And we can also have a min-width
if you want of 50vw.

145
00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:42.439
So it's gonna be somewhere between 50 and
100, right?

146
00:08:46.244 --> 00:08:48.661
Overflow hidden.

147
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:53.399
Okay, so then there's some
other stuff that's going on in

148
00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:57.204
here as we bring the box
down having added that.

149
00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:58.799
Some extra things we don't need.

150
00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.236
We don't want this background color.

151
00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:02.872
That's ugly.

152
00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:06.800
8ac is gonna be yet
another light blue color.

153
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.199
Very not magenta line.

154
00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:09.691
So we're gonna get rid of that.

155
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.730
We don't need these border radiuses
because we're not having the rounded

156
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.274
corners in our flyout menu.

157
00:09:15.274 --> 00:09:16.464
We can get rid of that.

158
00:09:16.464 --> 00:09:19.946
We don't need any box shadow because
we don't have that in our menu.

159
00:09:19.946 --> 00:09:22.021
We can get rid of that.

160
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:26.648
We can still want the transition from the
top though because we still want the menu

161
00:09:26.648 --> 00:09:27.817
to come in, right?

162
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:32.076
So now when I click this button, we get
sort of the skeleton of this main menu.

163
00:09:32.076 --> 00:09:32.929
Make sense?

164
00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:37.461
Okay, so then we're gonna go
down here to our top nav a.

165
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:42.290
And you see here we have top nav a,
top nav a.action.

166
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.082
Do we need top nav a.action?

167
00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:48.587
Do we need that style?

168
00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:52.193
No, we don't have any action anymore,
so we can get rid of that.

169
00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:59.436
And here in this top nav a,
we have our display block, which is good.

170
00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:00.881
We can change our padding.

171
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:07.732
I'm gonna change this to 2rem 1rem.

172
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:12.067
And we'll keep the text-align center,
but we don't want the white background.

173
00:10:12.067 --> 00:10:14.070
We don't want a box shadow.

174
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.275
We don't need a border-radius
because we're not doing that, right?

175
00:10:19.275 --> 00:10:22.728
When we click this, now we have,
here's our three links, and

176
00:10:22.728 --> 00:10:27.505
we're getting closer and closer and closer
by stripping some of this extra stuff out.

177
00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:29.191
Everybody see how that's happening?

178
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.035
Cool.

179
00:10:30.035 --> 00:10:34.885
All right, we get to our next style here,
which is the top a focus, the hover,

180
00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:37.913
and then we've got
the action version of those.

181
00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:39.714
Do we need the action version?

182
00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:43.299
Nope, we got rid of all that,
so we can delete that.

183
00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:51.737
In fact,
do we even need any hover styles at all?

184
00:10:54.337 --> 00:10:55.276
&gt;&gt; Not for mobile.

185
00:10:55.276 --> 00:10:56.974
&gt;&gt; Not for mobile, right?

186
00:10:56.974 --> 00:11:00.502
If you're actually doing mobile,
do we need this stuff going on?

187
00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:03.749
Let's get rid of it.

188
00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:10.774
So let's just get rid of that whole,
blah, don't wanna.

189
00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:11.759
So there we go.

190
00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:16.679
Now it's a lovely light blue [LAUGH]
ever state, we're getting there,

191
00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:19.064
stripping one thing out at a time.

192
00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:23.515
Okay, so now we're on to our

193
00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:29.638
MainMenuOpen nav ul before and after.

194
00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:34.389
So before we have this content
here that says Main Menu, right?

195
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:37.777
So that is this whole thing that
appears up here at the top.

196
00:11:37.777 --> 00:11:39.960
We actually don't need any of this.

197
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.067
So let's just get rid of that whole style.

198
00:11:43.067 --> 00:11:44.636
Okay, the whole entire style.

199
00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:45.591
We don't need any of that.

200
00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:46.871
We don't want it to say main menu.

201
00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:48.258
We don't want any of that kinda stuff.

202
00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:49.800
So we can just get rid of it.

203
00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:55.054
Almost done.

204
00:11:55.054 --> 00:11:59.208
Okay, so then the last part
here is the after part of this.

205
00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:03.952
So right now you see here we have our
content is set to this thing that

206
00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:05.151
doesn't work.

207
00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:08.267
[LAUGH] Okay.

208
00:12:08.267 --> 00:12:10.026
Well, we'll just get rid of that.

209
00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:16.158
But we're gonna keep the content you
can make a space or something, but

210
00:12:16.158 --> 00:12:19.790
we're gonna get rid of that
code that isn't even working.

211
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.557
Instead, we'll set up a background image.

212
00:12:22.557 --> 00:12:27.857
And I have an asset for that.

213
00:12:27.857 --> 00:12:31.238
Did I give it to you up here
in the top of the HTML?

214
00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:32.731
Hopefully, I did.

215
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:33.959
&gt;&gt; I think so.

216
00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:41.434
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, so if you look up at
the top of your HTML, you'll find it.

217
00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:46.990
I don't have it in front of me at the
moment, so I'm gonna copy this URL, great.

218
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.805
And what we'll do is we'll set
it up as a background image.

219
00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:57.338
Background is url, that thing,
that close button.

220
00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:06.566
And then we can say no repeat, And

221
00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:11.053
center so that it'll not repeat and
look nice.

222
00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:15.661
Because we're working with a background
image, we should set a width and

223
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:16.503
a height to that.

224
00:13:16.503 --> 00:13:21.204
So width 2rem, height 2rem.

225
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.670
So there's our close icon.

226
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.027
It closes.

227
00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:34.979
Woo hoo, yay.

228
00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:41.581
As for the rest of the styling here,
you can get rid of whatever you want.

229
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:49.762
I get rid of let's see,
I didn't play around with top and right.

230
00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:50.825
I just got rid of those.

231
00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:52.619
I got rid of the font size.

232
00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:55.913
I got rid of the line height cuz
that comes in from our base.

233
00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:05.112
What I will say is,
top is 0, and right is 0.

234
00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:10.657
And so, now when you click on it,
there's our close icon.

235
00:14:10.657 --> 00:14:12.597
It's working.

236
00:14:12.597 --> 00:14:14.540
Check it out.

237
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.279
We did it.

238
00:14:17.868 --> 00:14:22.471
That was a lot of work to
repurpose that but we made it.

239
00:14:22.471 --> 00:14:23.646
How are you doing?

240
00:14:25.314 --> 00:14:26.488
Yes.

241
00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:30.461
&gt;&gt; A little bit ago you did the 100.

242
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:34.236
The width was 100vw for something.

243
00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:38.329
&gt;&gt; Yeah, up here
&gt;&gt; What's the difference between

244
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:41.210
max-width 100% and 100vw?

245
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.962
&gt;&gt; Great question.

246
00:14:41.962 --> 00:14:47.202
What is the difference between max-width
of 100% and max-width of 100vw?

247
00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:49.101
Anybody wanna take a guess?

248
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:54.001
&gt;&gt; 100% will fill the width
of the parent's width.

249
00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:54.978
&gt;&gt; Right.

250
00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.204
&gt;&gt; And 100vw is just a vw no matter what.

251
00:14:57.204 --> 00:14:59.398
&gt;&gt; The vw of the browser.

252
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.958
Right, exactly.

253
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.672
Always the question relative to what?

254
00:15:04.672 --> 00:15:06.821
And that is the answer for any vw.
