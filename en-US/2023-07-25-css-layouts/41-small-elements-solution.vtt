00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.782
So let's go through my answer for this.

2
00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:08.393
So what I did was I found first in
the HTML, we gotta find those links.

3
00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:12.465
So the order now link is around line 69.

4
00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:17.342
And it actually, that one has a clot,
whoops, I'm looking at the wrong thing,

5
00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:18.365
that's right.

6
00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:23.734
Around line 72, there's a link to
the magenta line official store.

7
00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:30.687
So here, I am going to give
this a class of button-primary.

8
00:00:32.893 --> 00:00:34.208
Okay?

9
00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:38.556
And there it is, okay?

10
00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:42.817
Not perfect, but close.

11
00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:46.271
And then we can do the same
thing with photos from the road.

12
00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:50.339
Let's give that a class too,

13
00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.577
class="button-primary.

14
00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:55.659
Okay.

15
00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:58.324
Fantastic.

16
00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.141
So that gives us our starting buttons.

17
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:05.178
Now what we need to do, we don't wanna
change the styles with the button primary

18
00:01:05.178 --> 00:01:07.664
because, of course,
we're already using it.

19
00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:12.001
We're using it for get tickets in order
now, and it works great there, right?

20
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.537
So what might be our approach when we're
really close here for these buttons, but

21
00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:19.309
they definitely need
a little bit more tweaking?

22
00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:21.100
What could we do instead?

23
00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:25.510
&gt;&gt; Add a secondary class.

24
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.248
&gt;&gt; We could add a second class, all right?

25
00:01:29.248 --> 00:01:31.421
So here I could add a class,

26
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:37.009
let's call it button-fullwidth
because it's a fullwidth button.

27
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.732
[LAUGH] And
you know I'm super creative that way.

28
00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:45.406
So here, you can have as many
classes as you want in your CSS.

29
00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:49.159
If you haven't seen this before or maybe
you have cuz you're a tailwind person.

30
00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.038
You just put class so you just stack up
the class names, separate them by spaces.

31
00:01:54.038 --> 00:01:57.404
So button-fullwidth.

32
00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:03.386
Okay, and
absolutely nothing will change on the page

33
00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:06.556
because you haven't styled anything yet.

34
00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:10.118
But now we can add some styling to that.

35
00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:14.486
So I am going to copy my style.

36
00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:23.356
I had it placed here in my answer pen,
I had this placed in the base style.

37
00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:26.870
You could put it wherever it
seems to make sense for you.

38
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.048
So I'm just gonna drop
it here inside of base.

39
00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:33.576
Wherever it is that makes sense and
you can find it again later.

40
00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:37.705
And so
I'll style my button full width this way.

41
00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.526
So, here's what I did.

42
00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:44.230
I set it to display block and

43
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.118
that will make it stretch as
wide as its container, right?

44
00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.840
&gt;&gt; Is button-primary defined
after button-fullwidth?

45
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.783
&gt;&gt; There you go.

46
00:02:57.783 --> 00:03:00.720
&gt;&gt; That's probably what I did, thank you.

47
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.606
Yeah, I don't know where
button-primary is.

48
00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:05.022
Where did you guys find it
here in all these styles?

49
00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:07.791
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; It was album?

50
00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:12.816
Okay, so I'm gonna move my
button-primary from where it is

51
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.045
Here, in album, I'm gonna move it up
to bass because that makes more sense

52
00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:23.951
to me at this moment with this design
cuz now I'm using it in a lot of places.

53
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.853
So now I move my style and
now it's gonna work.

54
00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:28.981
Thank you, guys.

55
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:29.928
There we go.

56
00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:31.924
So now it looks ridiculous, right?

57
00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:34.461
It stretches all the way
across everything here.

58
00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.589
And the first one works and
the second one doesn't.

59
00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.463
So did I apply my class to the second one?

60
00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:48.369
I did not.

61
00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:52.095
Button primary, button-fullwidth.

62
00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.551
There we go.

63
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:57.334
&gt;&gt; Can I ask?

64
00:03:57.334 --> 00:03:57.849
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

65
00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.232
&gt;&gt; What is the benefit of adding
a secondary class as opposed to just

66
00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:05.128
creating a different class for
the buttons that you want to be different?

67
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:11.603
&gt;&gt; Great question, why would we create
a second class rather than just making

68
00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:16.963
a brand new class with all of
this styling associated with it?

69
00:04:16.963 --> 00:04:19.233
Maybe you have an opinion on that.

70
00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:23.612
&gt;&gt; I think it saves you having to copy
all of the styling of the first class-

71
00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:24.228
&gt;&gt; Right.

72
00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:25.184
&gt;&gt; Into the second one.

73
00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:29.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have to copy all the
styles from our first style here, right?

74
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.718
&gt;&gt; If you have classes that
are mostly the same like this.

75
00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:34.892
&gt;&gt; Right?

76
00:04:34.892 --> 00:04:41.514
And we can also do things like, say,
a bunch of stuff that changed in here.

77
00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:46.395
But we could do things like, say, we no
longer want our buttons to be magenta

78
00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:49.619
anymore, we're now all about the lime,
right?

79
00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.376
So we change it once here, and then it
changes everywhere here on the site,

80
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:58.302
right, rather than having to go
find all the other classes and

81
00:04:58.302 --> 00:05:00.284
change it in a bunch of places.

82
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:03.657
So some of it is a matter of preference,

83
00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:09.708
some of it is a matter of efficiency,
you'll find your style, yeah.

84
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.521
Yeah, okay great.

85
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:18.462
Okay, so over here in my answer pen,
it is working correctly and

86
00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:21.845
I'm not gonna take
the time to figure out and

87
00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:26.709
debug exactly why I don't have
it working there but here it is.

88
00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:30.129
Here's the full width that's
here inside of my answer pen.

89
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.856
And you can see here that we
have photos from the road.

90
00:05:32.856 --> 00:05:35.344
It's as wide as its container.

91
00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:40.230
And the same is true later on down
here in the document as well.
