00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.798
Now we're going on the album and
the tracklist.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.808
Yah, album is in tracklists.

3
00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:08.055
Okay, so let's go.

4
00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.984
We'll get started here on that.

5
00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:18.580
So open up your starting code pen,
make sure you fork it to your account.

6
00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:22.183
And let's talk about this.

7
00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:27.425
So here in the HTML, here is what
we're going to need to have up here.

8
00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:32.757
Let's open up a new tab.

9
00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:35.231
This is what we're building now.

10
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:40.151
We are going to build this sort of box
that's up here on the top, new album.

11
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:42.474
It was all a dream with the button.

12
00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:44.881
And then the line around it.

13
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:50.137
And then after that,
we have sort of this playlist kinda thing.

14
00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:52.005
So what is our track number?

15
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:53.754
What's our song name?

16
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:56.040
And how long does it take to play?

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.525
Okay, so this is the next part of
the page that we're going to build.

18
00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.711
We will continue to add elements to this,
make sense?

19
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:07.234
All right, so here and
starting in our HTML,

20
00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:11.986
that's always where we start,
we never start with the CSS.

21
00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:15.895
We have all of this lovely text.

22
00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:18.705
So let's talk about how to mark it up.

23
00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:24.347
And I wanna start with the tracklist
down here at the bottom.

24
00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:27.601
What should we do to
mark this tracklist up?

25
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:33.540
What would be appropriate HTML for that?

26
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.006
&gt;&gt; List.

27
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.561
&gt;&gt; It could be a list.

28
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.018
If we were going to take this and

29
00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:44.185
put it in another piece of software,
any software.

30
00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:49.085
Let's say a commonly used piece
of software that you might

31
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:53.997
use in an office environment,
what might you put this in?

32
00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:54.597
&gt;&gt; Table.

33
00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:55.399
&gt;&gt; Yeah, table.

34
00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.449
&gt;&gt; You might put it in an Excel, right?

35
00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:01.206
In some kind of table or
Google Sheets, yeah?

36
00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:05.620
So anything that you wind up putting
in Excel or in Google Sheets,

37
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.801
what should that be in the HTML?

38
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:08.861
&gt;&gt; A table.

39
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.729
&gt;&gt; An HTML table.

40
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.725
How many of you are set
to write an HTML table?

41
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:15.753
Yeah?

42
00:02:15.753 --> 00:02:19.906
Okay, so I am gonna let you write
that here in just a moment.

43
00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:24.706
Let's also talk about while we're here,
we have these words, new album,

44
00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:26.669
it was all a dream, order now.

45
00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.930
And let's look at this.

46
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.012
So clearly there's a styling piece here.

47
00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:35.869
Anybody wanna make comments on how
we might mark up this, new album,

48
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.058
it was all a dream, order now?

49
00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:46.862
What is the most important
part of that box?

50
00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:48.444
&gt;&gt; It was all a dream.

51
00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:49.793
&gt;&gt; It was all a dream, right?

52
00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:55.357
The name of the album, what is sort
of supporting information for that?

53
00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:56.021
&gt;&gt; New album?

54
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:57.730
&gt;&gt; New album, right?

55
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.436
And then order now is what?

56
00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:01.559
&gt;&gt; A link that looks like a button.

57
00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:02.091
&gt;&gt; That's our link.

58
00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:03.244
That looks like a button.

59
00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:04.518
So we've already got that styled.

60
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.628
We know what that is, right?

61
00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:07.295
That's button primary.

62
00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:11.422
So if it's the most important thing here,

63
00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:15.441
How should we markup it was all a dream.

64
00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:17.351
It could be an H1, right?

65
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.679
Some kind of heading depending on
what else was there on the page.

66
00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:25.205
Let's say for argument's sake because
it is the only H1 on the page,

67
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.058
we're going to call it h1.

68
00:03:27.058 --> 00:03:30.673
What should we use for
markup for the new album then?

69
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.678
&gt;&gt; H2.

70
00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:38.409
&gt;&gt; H2, whoa, yes.

71
00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.205
H2 is correct.

72
00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:45.277
Even though it goes 2 to 1,
that is totally cool.

73
00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:47.123
Your accessibility people
will not get mad at you.

74
00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:51.203
You've identified the most important
thing, it was all a dream.

75
00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:54.708
You've identified the second
most important thing, new album.

76
00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:58.633
Order now, you've coded semantically
as well because that's a link,

77
00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:01.219
even though it looks like a button,
all right?

78
00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.345
And now how are we gonna get
that border around all that?

79
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.620
&gt;&gt; Wrap it in a section or something.

80
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.181
&gt;&gt; Wrap it in a section, or
a div, or something, right?

81
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.283
Now I'd like you to mark
up all of this stuff here.

82
00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:16.077
So we just talked about how to do it.

83
00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:22.278
Set up your section up here at the top for
the new album, mark up your table.

84
00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.259
So go on ahead and get that done now.
