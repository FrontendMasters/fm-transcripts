1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.076
All right, so now we're gonna dig into
some of these sliders that are here.

2
00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:09.372
And the sliders are styled a little
ways down here in our CSS.

3
00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:11.190
So if we go down, take a look.

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.280
We have a volume-slider here, see that?

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.135
And this is set to a 58% width.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.910
And our volume-slider is here.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.060
It's an input type of range, okay?

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.240
So, this one we could just
get rid of that width.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.390
See if that does anything.

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.855
Nope.

11
00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:39.212
We could make it 100%.

12
00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:40.453
What will that do?

13
00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:44.586
So that will make it a little bit longer.

14
00:00:52.621 --> 00:01:00.152
And we could set its background-color,
To transparent.

15
00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.539
Hey, look at that.

16
00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.530
It worked.

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.925
So let's focus on this play slider
here now, the other slider.

18
00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:14.847
We've got, let me scroll on down here.

19
00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:18.630
This is the one with
the input type of range.

20
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.560
So as you see here in our HTML,
there's our input type of range.

21
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.790
The id is seek-slider.

22
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.832
So this is input with a type of range.

23
00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.535
Do you see that brackets?

24
00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:32.350
That's an attribute selector.

25
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.760
So if you guys are not familiar with that,
input, of course, is the HTML element.

26
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.370
But the brackets here say look for the
attribute of type and the value of range.

27
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.500
So this is an exact match, right?

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.960
It has to be a type of range,
nothing else.

29
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.869
There's a whole bunch of
these attribute selectors.

30
00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.626
You can do wildcard searches, you can
do with starting, kind of names for

31
00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:00.597
attributes or the end,
the attribute ends in something,

32
00:02:00.597 --> 00:02:03.343
there's a whole bunch of
things that go on with this.

33
00:02:03.343 --> 00:02:06.354
I cover that in the intermediate
CSS course where I go into

34
00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:08.812
these attribute selectors
a little bit more.

35
00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:13.830
So here we're gonna set
our width to 100% again.

36
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.254
Okay, and we don't necessarily
want it to float because now we've

37
00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:25.913
laid this out differently with grid so
you could get rid of that.

38
00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:29.690
Depending, you can try getting
rid of things like margin.

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.690
Or maybe you like margin, and

40
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.400
actually looks like it was lined up better
with the margin, so we'll leave that.

41
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.048
Interestingly he said
margin zero here first and

42
00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:46.214
then he overrode it later,
which happens in the development process.

43
00:02:46.214 --> 00:02:53.416
Of course, the other thing we can add to
that is background-color: transparent.

44
00:02:55.477 --> 00:02:58.961
And that'll give us a nice
clear background slider.

45
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.720
Okay, then we have a whole bunch
of stuff here underneath of that.

46
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.955
This has to do with coloring things,
and we can go through this and

47
00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:15.950
we can change all of these
colors to our color palette.

48
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.924
So instead of to the right
RGBA bla bla bla bla bla,

49
00:03:21.924 --> 00:03:25.337
we could get rid of this, and

50
00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:30.188
we could say var(--cyan), right?

51
00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:32.540
See how that works?

52
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.375
Changes the color of that.

53
00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.518
If that's something you wanna do,
that is something you can do.

54
00:03:42.518 --> 00:03:46.687
So you can start messing around here with
some of the colors on these sliders,

55
00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.420
making those kinds of changes.

56
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.188
Anywhere here where it says background
color, you could change that.

57
00:03:53.188 --> 00:04:00.040
var(--cyan), what does that do for us?

58
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.818
Maybe you like that better.

59
00:04:03.818 --> 00:04:08.633
Maybe you wanna change your background
gradient to what it was, right?

60
00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.884
Var(--cyan).

61
00:04:16.153 --> 00:04:17.293
That looks good.

62
00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:24.658
Now it's sort of dark back there and
then as you play, it changes color, yeah?

63
00:04:24.658 --> 00:04:26.896
You see how that works?

64
00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:31.761
&gt;&gt; So is the before pseudo element,
is that selecting before you drag it and

65
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:33.772
then reassigning the color?

66
00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:37.662
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so these styles here,
great question.

67
00:04:37.662 --> 00:04:41.922
These styles here, where we're talking
input type of range before, and

68
00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:44.310
we also have input type of range here.

69
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.532
Notice it says position: relative, right
here for the input type of range before,

70
00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:49.730
position of relative.

71
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.719
And then before it,
we have a position of absolute.

72
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.240
And it has all these colors
that are going on here.

73
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.260
What is happening is this is showing
the two colors here on the track.

74
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.185
So we've actually drawn the track twice,
and

75
00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:11.260
what's happening is we have
one color as the track plays.

76
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.530
And we have the second color
that's sort of the default.

77
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.480
So we're stacking these things on top
of each other as the track plays.

78
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.200
This lighter color is filling
in here on this track.

79
00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:25.535
See that?

80
00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:27.615
So, how do we figure that out?

81
00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:29.135
Well, just change the color.

82
00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:31.605
Let's make it magenta.

83
00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:34.411
What happens?

84
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:36.421
See that?

85
00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:40.807
Cool, right?

86
00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:43.260
One change in a time and test it.

87
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.791
[LAUGH]
Okay.

88
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.615
So there's plenty of other places
we could go through here and

89
00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:53.097
make some more color changes.

90
00:05:53.097 --> 00:05:58.707
Anytime you see the 007db5,
you can put in var(--cyan), yes?

91
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.309
&gt;&gt; Do attribute selectors
work on custom attributes?

92
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.753
If we set a custom attribute in HTML,
can we access it through CSS?

93
00:06:07.753 --> 00:06:11.489
&gt;&gt; Yes, so if you have a data hyphen
attribute, like for your JavaScript or

94
00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:15.182
something, yes, you could use
an attribute selector to select that.

95
00:06:15.182 --> 00:06:18.229
Absolutely, great question.

96
00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.118
We're at the fiddly bits part of this,

97
00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:23.450
[LAUGH] where there's just a lot
of little changes to make.

98
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.190
Okay, so here for our input type of range.

99
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.450
Relative, none.

100
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.300
There's our width.

101
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.177
I actually got rid of the width
here in my notes, and

102
00:06:36.177 --> 00:06:38.872
I set my margin and padding to zero.

103
00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:41.136
Isn't that interesting?

104
00:06:41.136 --> 00:06:46.123
Height's 19,
the background-color is transparent.

105
00:06:46.123 --> 00:06:48.411
And then we also have,

106
00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:56.902
Some other additional
styles I'm gonna add here.

107
00:06:56.902 --> 00:07:02.754
The current time, And

108
00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:06.197
that is here,
the span with the id of current-time.

109
00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:08.063
We can set some alignment for that.

110
00:07:08.063 --> 00:07:12.771
Text-align: left.

111
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:14.868
We can set the duration.

112
00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:24.092
Text-align: right, okay?

113
00:07:30.485 --> 00:07:33.439
Do I have an audio player, [INAUDIBLE].

114
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:40.574
Okay, this output style that we have here,

115
00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:44.864
I'm gonna change it to audio-player-,

116
00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:54.870
container-output, and I'm going to
change this to display of inline-block.

117
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.073
I don't want the width.

118
00:07:57.073 --> 00:07:59.190
I don't want the font size.

119
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.038
I don't want the margin,
the float, the clear.

120
00:08:01.038 --> 00:08:02.972
I don't want any of that.

121
00:08:02.972 --> 00:08:09.606
And that will put a lot of these elements
better into line with each other, okay?

122
00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:11.970
So I'll take care of a lot
of those alignment issues.

123
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.500
And I think I've got
most of the things now.

124
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.190
This play-slider looks a little bit off.

125
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.995
So let's see if we can fix that problem.

126
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.608
If we go back up to my play-slider,

127
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.527
We're gonna put some borders on that,
see what's going on.

128
00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:43.274
[LAUGH] Okay.

129
00:08:43.274 --> 00:08:46.198
Well, here we could add a little
bit of padding to this,

130
00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:49.070
a couple of other things in
order to make this line up.

131
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.830
But I think you guys kinda get
the idea here at this point, right?

132
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.420
We're sort of fiddling around here,
continuing to make tweaks,

133
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.820
and we're darn close to finishing
up our audio player here.

134
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.973
Fair enough?

135
00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.576
Okay, and
we do have a final version of that,

136
00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:07.870
just to show you that I did in
fact work through the whole thing.

137
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.435
Down here at the bottom.

138
00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:19.194
Let me open up that Codepen.

139
00:09:19.194 --> 00:09:23.876
So, if you compare this one here
with what we've done so far,

140
00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:27.402
you will find all of
the styling that's here.

141
00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:31.059
And I definitely missed a few things
in presenting this to you, but

142
00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:32.640
most of it is there, right?

143
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.650
One of those last little bits
of alignment, and so forth.
