1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
So the last thing we have to do then
is getting our desktop layout in place.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.778
So let's do a quick check of that.

3
00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:15.793
Okay, we did not finish
the desktop layout.

4
00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:17.970
Let me find you the desktop layout here.

5
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.056
Okay, so the desktop layout
will wind up looking like this.

6
00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.941
Remember, it's still gonna
have the gradient on it.

7
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:29.672
The screenshot doesn't have it because
it'll look really ugly if it does,

8
00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:32.140
just the way the screenshotting
software works.

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.763
So what we wanna do is we wanna put
our reviews over here in a column by

10
00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:37.763
themselves.

11
00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:41.739
In the middle, we're going to have
our album and our audio player.

12
00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.512
And then on the right hand side,
we're going to have our new album and

13
00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.077
we're going to have our tracklist.

14
00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:53.365
And then down here at the bottom of
all that, we'll have our footer and

15
00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:57.010
of course on the top of all that
we will have our navigation.

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.061
Okay, sounds good.

17
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:03.208
Should I give you guys a chance to see
if you can make this happen on your own?

18
00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.730
I think at this point you should
be able to do this on your own.

19
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.169
All the code is written.

20
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:09.362
What is our approach here?

21
00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:11.962
Does anybody have a suggested approach for
this?

22
00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:14.224
&gt;&gt; Grid.

23
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:17.175
&gt;&gt; Grid.
&gt;&gt; Probably grid, right?

24
00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:22.000
So, if we're gonna do grid,
we have an outside wrapper, right?

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.242
Which is our wrapper,
inside we have our elements, yeah?

26
00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:32.207
So, we can set up grid and
we can tell everything where to go and

27
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:34.131
it should just work, right?

28
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:41.578
Okay, So we're starting from this state.

29
00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:44.330
Go through a detail,
a more detailed answer.

30
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.575
We're starting from this state, right?

31
00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:47.961
This works great.

32
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:53.282
Looks good on mobile,
looks good on tablet, perfect.

33
00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:58.563
So now what we need to do is we
need to get this into the columns.

34
00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:02.518
So we need to have the reviews on
that left-hand side, the album, and

35
00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:07.212
the audio in the middle, everything else
on the right-hand side, and of course,

36
00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:08.974
the footer across the bottom.

37
00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:13.244
So how do we go about doing all of that?

38
00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:17.607
By the way, pro tip, many of you forgot
to copy over your JavaScript for

39
00:02:17.607 --> 00:02:18.789
the audio player.

40
00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.791
So if you forgot to do that,
you'll know because your audio player,

41
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.350
the button here will
just be a green circle.

42
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.436
It actually won't have the triangle in it.

43
00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:29.888
That indicates that there's something
wrong with your JavaScript,

44
00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:31.849
I've noticed with this
particular little bit of code.

45
00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.827
So make sure you've copied
over your JavaScript so

46
00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:37.817
that you still have
the ability to play this track.

47
00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:44.528
Okay, so
then let us go to work here on our CSS.

48
00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:50.942
So I'm just gonna flatten down all my
layers here got a bunch of layers.

49
00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:56.151
Okay, and what I'm going to do here
is the first thing that we need

50
00:02:56.151 --> 00:03:02.228
to do of course is evaluate that design
and think about what needs to change.

51
00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:04.975
So we have a header that
goes across the top,

52
00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:09.652
we need to take the reviews which are kind
of in the middle of things pull them

53
00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:13.811
over to the left hand side then we'll
put the audio in the middle and

54
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.701
then we'll put the other content
here on the right hand side.

55
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:22.042
But the header goes across the top and
the footer goes across the bottom.

56
00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:26.641
So you could do something as we've
done many times before with grid,

57
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:31.797
where you could have the wrapper be
your grid container, and you could have,

58
00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:35.871
big layers for layers with a grid
area associated with them.

59
00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:38.508
That will stretch all the way
across the top and the bottom.

60
00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:40.429
That's one approach to this.

61
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:44.004
Or you could put in a little
bit of extra HTML and

62
00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:47.500
group those particular elements together.

63
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.970
So remember our HTML is looking like this.

64
00:03:53.212 --> 00:04:00.722
Okay, and so what I'm going to do,
just to kind of continue to mix it up and

65
00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:06.538
show you there's all kinds
of approaches to this stuff,

66
00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:11.036
we will add a div with
a class of main-grid.

67
00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:15.217
And I'm gonna end that just
after the unnamed section.

68
00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:24.563
And the whole purpose of that div with
a class of main-grid is to make our

69
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:28.048
layout work just a little bit more easily,
okay?

70
00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:31.233
So now all I have to do is
put the cover in the middle,

71
00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:35.920
the reviews on the left and the album and
the table will fall in on the right.

72
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.338
Make sense?

73
00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:42.652
Okay, so then I can make
a corresponding layer at layer,

74
00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:48.203
main grid, because that's
what we're going to put here.

75
00:04:48.203 --> 00:04:53.154
And then inside of this we need
to figure out what our media

76
00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:55.329
queries are going to be.

77
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:58.767
And you may have come up with all
kinds of different media queries for

78
00:04:58.767 --> 00:04:59.862
what you're doing.

79
00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:03.682
I'll just give you what numbers
I had found worked okay for me.

80
00:05:03.682 --> 00:05:09.071
So I had and at media with a max

81
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:13.795
width of 700 pixels.

82
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:18.919
And for this, We'll see.

83
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.211
I had a wrapper class here which will

84
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:30.813
have a mean width of 325 pixels and

85
00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:34.530
a max width of 700 pixels.

86
00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:43.143
And a padding of 01 rim to keep
it off the edges of the webpage.

87
00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:46.465
So of course that's gonna
impact very small sizes here.

88
00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:49.334
So when we get to mobile, right?

89
00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:53.814
We'll have a little bit of space on
either side, just like that, and

90
00:05:53.814 --> 00:05:56.141
we'll get no smaller than 325.

91
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:59.854
We'll start scrolling off
the screen when we hit 325,

92
00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:04.266
and we'll stay at this mobile
dimension until we hit 700 pixels.

93
00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:09.340
And when we hit 700 pixels, we'll actually
know because we'll see the tablet,

94
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.493
I mean, sorry, we'll see the blue
border appear around the album.

95
00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:19.236
There, so that's where we leave
that particular media query, okay.

96
00:06:22.878 --> 00:06:29.707
So then for our desktop layout,
we can add ourselves an add media.

97
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.948
And this time I'm going to do
a min-width of 1025 pixels.

98
00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:42.818
And, by the way,

99
00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:47.443
we kind of have some starting kind
of stuff down here at the bottom.

100
00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:49.106
We can get rid of this.

101
00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:53.530
So we can get rid of this,
these other media queries that were here.

102
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.736
This one?

103
00:06:58.702 --> 00:07:01.110
Yeah, we'll just get rid of that too.

104
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.769
Okay, get rid of those.

105
00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:07.974
And then in here we're gonna have
a wrapper, a glass of wrapper.

106
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.318
We're gonna have a max
width of 1440 pixels.

107
00:07:15.318 --> 00:07:18.436
So we're gonna make it for
up to a really big screen.

108
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.337
And as always, you can put a border on it.

109
00:07:25.337 --> 00:07:27.244
That will help.

110
00:07:27.244 --> 00:07:30.636
It never fails to help,
1 pixel solid white.

111
00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:32.090
We can get rid of it later.

112
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:39.919
That's a debugging border that shows us
what's going on here with our wrapper.

113
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.670
Hopefully my screen can get big enough.

114
00:07:49.942 --> 00:07:53.652
Anybody getting a border show up?

115
00:07:53.652 --> 00:07:55.278
Mine is, okay, good.

116
00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.802
Okay, then, for main grid itself,

117
00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:06.717
notice main grid hasn't been
styled at anywhere along the way.

118
00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:09.586
We haven't styled it for mobile,
we didn't style it for tablet,

119
00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.545
we're only gonna style it here for
desktop.

120
00:08:11.545 --> 00:08:14.817
And so here we can say display grid.

121
00:08:14.817 --> 00:08:21.724
And we can say our grid template columns.

122
00:08:21.724 --> 00:08:26.615
And often we use that
flexible fr unit of measure,

123
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:30.928
but sometimes you may
want to mix it up a bit.

124
00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:36.777
So here what I wanna do is make
my left column, 200 pixels wide.

125
00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:42.163
Remember we designed specifically for 200
pixels wide for that left column, right?

126
00:08:42.163 --> 00:08:47.659
When we worked on those reviews auto,

127
00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:51.274
and then 350 pixels.

128
00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:55.214
So, what this is going to do is it's going
to give us a fixed width left column,

129
00:08:55.214 --> 00:08:56.648
a fixed width right column,

130
00:08:56.648 --> 00:08:59.611
and all of the extra space goes
to the middle of the design.

131
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:01.794
Make sense?

132
00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:06.303
So, that middle of the design can
expand and contract as needed, but

133
00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:09.647
those two columns will stay
a fixed width because,

134
00:09:09.647 --> 00:09:14.571
that track list doesn't look particularly
good when it gets overly wide.

135
00:09:14.571 --> 00:09:18.215
And we don't want the reviews to get
too wide cuz then they'll turn into

136
00:09:18.215 --> 00:09:19.806
their tablet format, right?

137
00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:23.427
So this is an approach that we
can use to make that happen.

138
00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:25.787
And then, of course, we can give it a gap.

139
00:09:25.787 --> 00:09:27.156
Let's do 2rem.

140
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.633
Okay, so if we take a look at it so far,

141
00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:35.904
I must have something wrong
in my code somewhere.

142
00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:36.834
Maybe a query.

143
00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:38.003
Look at that.

144
00:09:38.003 --> 00:09:42.720
[LAUGH] Okay, so
I never close my first media query.

145
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.699
Let me close that real quick.

146
00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:49.430
So there's one media query,
here's the second media query.

147
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.195
And then in theory,

148
00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:02.908
There we go.

149
00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:09.934
All right, so this tends to give us errors
for these layer things here in CodePen.

150
00:10:09.934 --> 00:10:12.403
This is a shortcoming of CodePen.

151
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.317
Don't worry about it.

152
00:10:13.317 --> 00:10:14.786
Everything is fine.

153
00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:15.979
We'll Save and Refresh.

154
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.402
Not working yet.

155
00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:25.694
Ha, finally.

156
00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:26.863
Okay, here we go.

157
00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:29.072
I don't know what it was,
but now it's working.

158
00:10:29.072 --> 00:10:31.770
Okay, continuing on.

159
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.528
[LAUGH] All right, so
let me collapse everything up here.

160
00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:37.235
There we go.

161
00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:40.482
Playlist, okay, so
here inside of our main grid,

162
00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:43.285
we're working on our desktop media query.

163
00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:45.998
And so now I have my three columns and

164
00:10:45.998 --> 00:10:51.890
grid will assign those three columns
in the order of the HTML source, right?

165
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:57.105
So we wind up with our cover over here
on the left side, we have our reviews

166
00:10:57.105 --> 00:11:02.420
in the middle, and then we have this
new album thing over here on the side.

167
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.005
And it looks like maybe I
do have some sort of HTML,

168
00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:11.108
problem because this rap
down here underneath.

169
00:11:11.108 --> 00:11:13.481
&gt;&gt; Those two are separate sections, right?

170
00:11:13.481 --> 00:11:14.924
&gt;&gt; They're separate sections.

171
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:18.574
And so it's grid is doing what grid does,
right?

172
00:11:18.574 --> 00:11:20.859
It's put it down here in the next column.

173
00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:22.379
So that's what's going on.

174
00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:24.092
Now what about this?

175
00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:25.596
It was all a dream.

176
00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:26.976
What is going on here?

177
00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:30.473
We didn't, certainly didn't style it this
way with this grapey, huge, long column.

178
00:11:30.473 --> 00:11:31.782
What is happening there?

179
00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:35.931
Ready now?

180
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:37.319
&gt;&gt; There needs to be a deliver on that.

181
00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:42.431
And there's something around
that in the tracklist.

182
00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:46.511
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so somehow we need to
group the it was all a dream and

183
00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:50.595
the tracklist and
then that border will resolve itself.

184
00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:51.703
It'll fix.

185
00:11:51.703 --> 00:11:55.365
Because what happens with grid is this
is gonna stretch all the way down

186
00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:56.608
automatically, and so

187
00:11:56.608 --> 00:12:00.231
if you don't want this effect you'll
have to do something to fix it.

188
00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:01.241
Make sense?

189
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:06.472
Okay, great, so phew, let's group

190
00:12:06.472 --> 00:12:11.051
together our two sections here.

191
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.157
We don't actually even need a class for
this or anything.

192
00:12:14.157 --> 00:12:19.776
We can just say div and /div.

193
00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:23.305
The whole purpose is just to
group them for grids for grid and

194
00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:25.856
we don't have to tell grid to do anything.

195
00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:30.721
So, just by putting that div in place,
then those two items wind up here in that

196
00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:33.688
column all together,
exactly as they should.

197
00:12:33.688 --> 00:12:35.511
Yeah?
Make sense?

198
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:40.347
Okay, so, now with we need to do

199
00:12:40.347 --> 00:12:45.551
a swap here for ordering, right?

200
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:48.688
So we can say our .cover.

201
00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:50.877
And that of course comes from our HTML.

202
00:12:50.877 --> 00:12:53.476
Inside of our main grid, we have a section

203
00:12:53.476 --> 00:12:58.099
with a class of cover that includes
the album cover plus the audio player.

204
00:12:58.099 --> 00:13:03.396
We'll just say that that is
going to go to order two, and

205
00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:10.183
what will happen is where is this gonna
go when I make the screen bigger?

206
00:13:10.183 --> 00:13:13.345
Is it gonna go to column one,
to column two, or column three?

207
00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:15.793
How many people say it's
going to column one?

208
00:13:15.793 --> 00:13:18.916
How many people say it's
going to column two?

209
00:13:18.916 --> 00:13:21.983
How many people say it's
going to column three?

210
00:13:21.983 --> 00:13:24.576
One person says it's
going to column three,

211
00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:29.572
one person says it's going to column two,
and the rest of you didn't vote, cowards.

212
00:13:29.572 --> 00:13:31.659
Cowards all of you, okay?

213
00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:37.187
So the answer is,
it will go to column three, why is that?

214
00:13:37.187 --> 00:13:41.352
We said order two, but I went to
column three, why did that happen?

215
00:13:41.352 --> 00:13:45.613
&gt;&gt; Because it's the only thing that
has order, and thus it's going to be

216
00:13:45.613 --> 00:13:49.892
positioned based on the fact that
the others are by default order one.

217
00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:52.556
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.

218
00:13:52.556 --> 00:13:54.590
So the other things
don't have an order yet.

219
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.723
So it goes over to the very end.

220
00:13:56.723 --> 00:14:00.977
All right, so that means we have to

221
00:14:00.977 --> 00:14:05.974
assign something else so we can say our.

222
00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:14.487
Let's see, actually I wrote this style,
main grid aside.

223
00:14:18.883 --> 00:14:22.349
Aside, I don't have an aside anymore,
I have a div.

224
00:14:22.349 --> 00:14:30.673
Div last child [LAUGH]
Why did I write that?

225
00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:34.203
Basically, I'm targeting
this div right here,

226
00:14:34.203 --> 00:14:37.574
which is this is the last
child in the main grid.

227
00:14:37.574 --> 00:14:45.176
So that will we'll put that
as an order three, okay?

228
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:50.014
So cover, that's the cover with the audio,

229
00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:56.124
is now order two,
that the track list is now order three,

230
00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:59.448
and the reviews have no order.

231
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:05.312
So in what order are those
going to display?

232
00:15:05.312 --> 00:15:08.360
Reviews is gonna be in what position?

233
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:14.035
We haven't assigned an order to it, so it
will show up in the first position, right?

234
00:15:14.035 --> 00:15:15.474
On the left.

235
00:15:15.474 --> 00:15:19.520
The album cover will show up where?

236
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.522
In the second position, in the middle.

237
00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:24.495
And where will the track list show up?

238
00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:26.542
Over on the right hand side.

239
00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:27.598
That's our theory.

240
00:15:27.598 --> 00:15:29.150
We're sticking to it.

241
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.910
Hey, there we go.

242
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.453
Okay, looking good.

243
00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:37.985
And there's our border
here on the outside.

244
00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:41.655
So we have a couple little
clean up things to do.

245
00:15:41.655 --> 00:15:45.603
First of all we wanna have these
all evenly to the top of the page,

246
00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:47.079
what's going on here?

247
00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:50.029
Why isn't this even with the other two?

248
00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:51.917
&gt;&gt; We assigned a margin to it.

249
00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:54.335
&gt;&gt; We did assign a margin to it,
didn't we?

250
00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:59.167
We assigned a margin to this thing
in an earlier style somewhere.

251
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.622
You can dig into it and
find it eventually.

252
00:16:01.622 --> 00:16:03.651
So I'll spare you that trouble.

253
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:06.619
It's called .album is the class for that.

254
00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:10.062
And we can just say margin top of 0.

255
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.258
Okay?

256
00:16:19.258 --> 00:16:21.095
So now, they're all the same height.

257
00:16:24.087 --> 00:16:27.708
For the navigation,
we may want to play around with,

258
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:31.257
continue to play around with
this a little bit more.

259
00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:34.056
We may wanna push our
navigation in a little bit.

260
00:16:34.056 --> 00:16:36.139
So these are all now tiny tweaks, right?

261
00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:38.773
Everything is generally in the right spot,
so

262
00:16:38.773 --> 00:16:41.211
now we just do a couple
little tiny tweaks.

263
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:45.803
And so I can take out my border on

264
00:16:45.803 --> 00:16:50.580
the wrapper for my navigation.

265
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.499
We'll see.

266
00:16:51.499 --> 00:16:54.091
Actually, that's top.

267
00:16:54.091 --> 00:17:00.840
We might do something like
a max width of 850 pixels and

268
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.892
a margin of four REM auto and
that will push this in.

269
00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:12.372
When we get here to desktop, yeah.

270
00:17:12.372 --> 00:17:16.347
So it's not quite all the way to the edges
of the page, that's up to the designer if

271
00:17:16.347 --> 00:17:19.588
that's the look they want, well,
we can give it to them, right?

272
00:17:24.013 --> 00:17:29.144
And then of course you could do something
like with your rapper we currently set it

273
00:17:29.144 --> 00:17:34.433
to 1440 bands a little big maybe we
actually want it more like 1200 pixels.

274
00:17:34.433 --> 00:17:39.368
And then that way, my screen won't expand

275
00:17:39.368 --> 00:17:43.893
any larger than 1,206, [LAUGH] But

276
00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:49.787
in that way we can reduce
how wide it's expanding,

277
00:17:49.787 --> 00:17:57.072
and you can stick some whatever,
a margin on that or whatever.

278
00:17:57.072 --> 00:17:59.935
So you could say something like margin.

279
00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:05.168
Let's say two REM zero.

280
00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:10.074
So we're gonna put margin on the two
sides and then that way our images won't

281
00:18:10.074 --> 00:18:14.609
be cut off on the edge of the page if
you can make your window big enough.

282
00:18:14.609 --> 00:18:18.145
And right now I can't make my
window big enough, unfortunately.

283
00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:21.027
Actually I've got those numbers backwards,
don't I?

284
00:18:21.027 --> 00:18:24.154
I do should be zero to REM.

285
00:18:24.154 --> 00:18:28.345
Sorry, zero to REM.

286
00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:30.473
Let's try that one more time.

287
00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:33.368
Like that.

288
00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:40.317
Cool?

289
00:18:40.317 --> 00:18:46.734
Probably one of the more complicated
pages some of you have ever made, true?

290
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:47.937
Yeah?

291
00:18:47.937 --> 00:18:52.094
Nice, so, congratulations everybody,
you did it, you survived,

292
00:18:52.094 --> 00:18:53.791
you made the medium design.

293
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:59.457
[APPLAUSE] Fantastic work everyone
