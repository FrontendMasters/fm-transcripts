WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.959
Next thing to do is our social
icons that are on the cover, okay?

2
00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:09.150
So we have these cool social icons,
there they are.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.150
And we want them to appear
on the cover of the album.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.590
This is at mobile dimensions, okay?

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.999
So on the cover itself, and
then when we get to larger dimensions,

6
00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.961
we want those social icons to
appear right here on the edge.

7
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.494
Wow.

8
00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.692
A lot going on with that?

9
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.721
Okay, so you guys ready to dive into that?

10
00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:42.941
All right, so
let's open up that beginning code pen.

11
00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:52.930
And fork

12
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.827
it to your

13
00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:07.590
account.

14
00:01:13.912 --> 00:01:16.646
There's our audio player, okay, great.

15
00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:24.829
So first of all let's start
off with our HTML here.

16
00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.625
And the first thing that we
need to do is add our social

17
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:33.114
sharing icons right here in our HTML.

18
00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:35.898
So we know that they're
gonna be near the cover.

19
00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:40.428
So here's my main with the class of cover.

20
00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:44.160
There's the image for
the album cover right there.

21
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120
And then under this is the audio
player container, make sense?

22
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.982
Okay, right after the image here,

23
00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:54.831
we're going to put in a div
with a class of icons.

24
00:01:57.072 --> 00:01:59.471
Slash div.

25
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:04.047
Inside of this,
we're gonna make this a list.

26
00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:05.415
Why are we making this a list?

27
00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:10.808
&gt;&gt; A series of icons.

28
00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:12.041
&gt;&gt; It's a series of icons,

29
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:16.320
kind of like a list of possible links
that you might wanna visit, right?

30
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.504
So the correct markup here would be UL
cuz you can visit them in any order.

31
00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:29.031
And then we'll put in an LI.

32
00:02:30.997 --> 00:02:38.324
Okay, and then inside of that, we're gonna
have our link, ahref equals something.

33
00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:42.948
We go somewhere, we can put

34
00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:47.779
in a target = "_blank".

35
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.413
Slash a slash li.

36
00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:02.390
So we're gonna have this
come in three times.

37
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.824
So I'm gonna put it in once,
gonna put it in a second time,

38
00:03:04.824 --> 00:03:06.030
gonna put it in a third time.

39
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.810
While we're here, target = "_blank",
tell me about that.

40
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.173
What is "_blank"?

41
00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:18.420
&gt;&gt; It goes to a different tab, a new tab.

42
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.480
&gt;&gt; It opens in a new tab or a new window.

43
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.840
Why does it start with an underscore?

44
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.420
Isn't that kind of weird?

45
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.770
Would it do the same thing if I did this,
target blank?

46
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.240
It actually does not, okay?

47
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.950
This goes back to our days in frame land.

48
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.350
Do you guys remember frames?

49
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.330
They were chunks of web
pages that we put together.

50
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.703
And when you click the link in a frame,
so it was like one webpage and another

51
00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:52.680
webpage, kinda like iframes are now
except super ugly with scroll bars, okay?

52
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.444
So if you clicked a link in the frame
that was over here and you wanted to load

53
00:03:56.444 --> 00:04:00.054
something in the page over here,
you had to have a name for that frame.

54
00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:04.135
And so we use this target thing a lot and
back in those days.

55
00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:06.694
But when you call it " _blank",

56
00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:10.843
this is a special keyword,
will open into a new window or

57
00:04:10.843 --> 00:04:16.258
a new tab depending on how the person
has the browser configured, okay?

58
00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:19.658
So you can use other values there,
but generally speaking,

59
00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:22.871
we're are in the 2020s,
we don't do that anymore.

60
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.516
[LAUGH] Makes sense?

61
00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:30.116
Okay, so now we're going to
add to this our various icons,

62
00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:33.980
which I may have neglected
to give you once again.

63
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.380
So let's just grab the icons that we
have down here in the footer for now.

64
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.960
So if you open up,
go back to like your navigation CodePen.

65
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.310
Did we have a footer down there?

66
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.195
We did not.

67
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:59.033
Okay, we opened up our CodePen collection.

68
00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:02.775
Go on back to our,

69
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.484
Our double border corners CodePen.

70
00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:15.100
If we go back to that, that one has
a footer down there on the bottom.

71
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.740
Let's just grab those
links that are down there.

72
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.568
So I am going to scroll in
my HTML down to the footer.

73
00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:33.364
And in fact, I can just grab this
whole list, and we'll use those.

74
00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:38.876
So I'm gonna start here around line 76 in
the double border corners ending CodePen.

75
00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:44.066
And I'm gonna copy one, two, three icons,

76
00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:48.311
all the way down to line number 92.

77
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:53.102
Okay, and that'll grab us Instagram,
Spotify, and SoundCloud.

78
00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:57.638
It won't give us the sharing icon, but
whatever, you can swap that out later,

79
00:05:57.638 --> 00:05:58.394
make sense?

80
00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:06.671
Okay, and we're gonna paste that here
inside of our div with a class of icons.

81
00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:10.529
Paste that in,
we should wind up seeing some icons, and

82
00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:12.428
I copy a whole lot of stuff.

83
00:06:16.283 --> 00:06:20.275
This is all okay, this is all okay,
everything is great.

84
00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.046
Okay, so why didn't those SVGs show up?

85
00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:31.879
I see bullets here, but I don't
actually see the SVGs, what's going on?

86
00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.870
&gt;&gt; Is there a lack of default fill?

87
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
we probably have a lack of default fill.

88
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.629
So let's add ourselves here another layer.

89
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:41.313
Add layer.

90
00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:46.199
And we can call it icons, or

91
00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.553
you can put this inside of the audio or
whatever you want to do.

92
00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:57.371
I'm just gonna put it here inside of
icons and we can now set up our SVGs.

93
00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:02.813
So these are gonna be .cover svg and

94
00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:09.173
we can say fill var(--line) I think.

95
00:07:09.173 --> 00:07:10.174
And that's what we need.

96
00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:16.619
There they are, okay?

97
00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:18.781
And while we're here,
let's set up a hover state for them.

98
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:23.614
So .cover svg:hover,

99
00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:28.911
fill:var(--cyan).

100
00:07:32.302 --> 00:07:36.657
So we have a hover state,
yay, there they are.

101
00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:38.472
So far, so good?

102
00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:42.648
Cool, okay, the next thing we ought
to do is turn off our bullets,

103
00:07:42.648 --> 00:07:44.300
always a good thing to do.

104
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.777
So .cover ul, we'll

105
00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:55.597
say list-style-type:none,

106
00:07:55.597 --> 00:08:01.600
padding:0, margin:0.

107
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.002
So I'll turn off all
the listy kind of stuff and

108
00:08:04.002 --> 00:08:05.926
give us a set of three icons, right?

109
00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:09.257
All right, now,

110
00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.759
Notice that we have our div
with the class of icons.

111
00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:19.333
It's inside of our main class of cover,
see how we did that?

112
00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:25.591
So, now we've got inside
of our main class of cover,

113
00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:29.037
we have our image,
that's the big cover image.

114
00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:32.097
We have our icons, they're right there,

115
00:08:32.097 --> 00:08:35.910
and then we have our audio player,
all right?

116
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.626
Now what we need to do
is take these icons and

117
00:08:38.626 --> 00:08:42.280
we need to move them up onto the album,
all right?

118
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.107
Now, there's a bunch of
ways we could do that,

119
00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.810
anybody have any ideas
how we could do that?

120
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.980
&gt;&gt; Position absolute.

121
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.920
&gt;&gt; We could do absolute positioning for
sure.

122
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.870
What else could we do?

123
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.719
There's actually a very cool technique
that we could use to make this happen.

124
00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:04.096
Grid cells are allowed to overlap.

125
00:09:04.096 --> 00:09:08.973
So if we have two grid cells and
we call out their same location,

126
00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:12.670
they will sit very happily
on top of each other.

127
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.090
Why don't we do that?

128
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.144
Because that's gonna make our layout so
much easier later when we take our

129
00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:21.890
icons and
we wanna make them go horizontal, right?

130
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.550
So let's try doing that.

131
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.680
So to set this up,
let us start with .cover.

132
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.391
Let's turn on a border for
all of the children of cover, so

133
00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:40.870
border: 1 pixel solid white.

134
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.630
So there's our cover, there's our icons,
there's our audio player.

135
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.096
Now what I wanna do is set this up,
kind of unusually,

136
00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:58.079
I wanna set it up with a series
of rows and one column, okay?

137
00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:03.721
So if I go to .cover,

138
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:08.961
we're going to display grid.

139
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:14.187
We'll say grid-template-columns,

140
00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:19.724
there's only one 1fr, [LAUGH] all right?

141
00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:29.023
And we'll say grid-template-rows:
repeat (3, auto).

142
00:10:29.023 --> 00:10:33.786
In other words, there as tall as however
they need to be, but we want three rows.

143
00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:37.238
So there we go, there's our three rows,
our album, our icons, and

144
00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:38.201
our audio player.

145
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:39.001
Make sense?

146
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.751
Guess what the next thing I'm gonna do is?

147
00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:51.587
Tell them where to display, right?

148
00:10:51.587 --> 00:10:54.180
We need to get those icons
on top of the cover and

149
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.160
we need to have the cover occupy
the same spot, that image.

150
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.578
So we'll say .cover img,

151
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:11.230
border: 2 pixels solid var(--cyan), right?

152
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.290
So that's our border that's
on that image already, right?

153
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.813
Grid-column will be what?

154
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:24.007
&gt;&gt; 1.

155
00:11:24.007 --> 00:11:24.990
&gt;&gt; 1.

156
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.180
&gt;&gt; 1/2.

157
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.370
Grid row will be what?

158
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.420
&gt;&gt; 1.

159
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.283
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1/?

160
00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:37.888
&gt;&gt; 2.

161
00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:38.422
&gt;&gt; 3.

162
00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:40.005
&gt;&gt; Is it 2?

163
00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:40.717
&gt;&gt; Maybe 3.

164
00:11:40.717 --> 00:11:41.925
&gt;&gt; 3.

165
00:11:41.925 --> 00:11:46.269
It'll be 1/3 because we
wanna have our album and

166
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:50.524
the icons eventually overlap each other,
okay?

167
00:11:50.524 --> 00:11:53.073
So right now nothing changes.

168
00:11:53.073 --> 00:11:55.580
Very happily grid has
added a fourth row for us,

169
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.380
[LAUGH] even though we didn't tell
it we wanted one, it added one.

170
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:06.260
All right, so now let's go to our .icons.

171
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.375
And basically we're gonna
do the same thing here.

172
00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:15.664
We're gonna say the same grid-column and
grid row associated with those icons.

173
00:12:15.664 --> 00:12:19.038
Boom, look at that.

174
00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:21.374
Woo.

175
00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:26.006
[LAUGH] It worked, okay?

176
00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:33.666
And then our audio player will show up
right underneath of our album, right?

177
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:37.510
And we can spell out exactly where
we want that to be if you want.

178
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.340
Obviously, it's displaying without us
explicitly calling for that location.

179
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.058
But if you feel more comfortable doing it,
we can add it.

180
00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:49.426
Audio-player-container is

181
00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:54.298
gonna be grid-row: 3/4, and

182
00:12:54.298 --> 00:13:00.010
it's gonna be grid-column: 1/2.

183
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.262
Now, why did I put in all
these grid column 1/2's?

184
00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:09.619
Why didn't I just leave off the columns?

185
00:13:09.619 --> 00:13:13.898
We're not dealing with the columns,
we want these in rows, right?

186
00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:17.458
Well, the answer is this,
if we take out the column,

187
00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:22.147
what will happen is grid will very
happily make another column for us.

188
00:13:22.147 --> 00:13:25.045
Because grid really doesn't want you
to have things on top of each other

189
00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:25.589
by default.

190
00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:29.864
Okay, so our last thing to do then,
how about these icons?

191
00:13:29.864 --> 00:13:31.706
Let's add to this a border.

192
00:13:34.175 --> 00:13:39.445
1 pixel solid var(--Lime)

193
00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:44.913
just to show us where that box is.

194
00:13:44.913 --> 00:13:47.270
It's as big as that whole album, isn't it?

195
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.240
Okay, so
how are we gonna push these icons over?

196
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.075
There's a grid property that will do this.

197
00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:02.465
Okay, so
we'll add to this justify-self end,

198
00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:08.718
that will push our grid icons
there over to the right.

199
00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:14.486
And then we can give it
padding on the right and

200
00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:19.341
potentially on the top too,
if you want, of 1 rem.

201
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:21.360
Just so
that they're not smashed into the side.

202
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.140
Make sense?

203
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.440
And we can get rid of that border.

204
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.369
Sweet, all right, so
I'm gonna get rid of that border there.

205
00:14:32.932 --> 00:14:38.145
All right, so now we have our icons
here on top of our album, right?

206
00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:39.403
So far so good?

207
00:14:39.403 --> 00:14:42.810
Now all we have to do is
make them go horizontal.

208
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.721
So what are we gonna do for that?

209
00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:52.762
&gt;&gt; Media query.

210
00:14:52.762 --> 00:14:56.987
&gt;&gt; Probably want a media query,

211
00:14:56.987 --> 00:15:02.737
add media, min-width 800 pixels.

212
00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:07.112
So 800 pixels and higher, double
check CodePen, make sure we're there,

213
00:15:07.112 --> 00:15:07.917
there we are.

214
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:15.281
I want those icons to go horizontal,
so what might I do?

215
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.690
&gt;&gt; You display flex.

216
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, display flex.

217
00:15:26.583 --> 00:15:27.767
Flex flow.

218
00:15:29.878 --> 00:15:30.880
Row wrap.

219
00:15:39.275 --> 00:15:40.415
&gt;&gt; Would you want them
to wrap in this context?

220
00:15:40.415 --> 00:15:47.203
&gt;&gt; Oops, I've got it on the wrong thing,
Icons ul, there we go.

221
00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:50.637
&gt;&gt; Should be able to just say flex
because the default is row and

222
00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:52.021
the default is no wrap.

223
00:15:52.021 --> 00:15:52.901
&gt;&gt; There's no wrap.

224
00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:56.116
&gt;&gt; Would you want them
to wrap in this context?

225
00:15:56.116 --> 00:15:58.770
&gt;&gt; Probably not, so
we could leave that off.

226
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.260
We could leave this off altogether
if you wish, and that would be fine.

227
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.280
They'll display like that by default.

228
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.014
We can give them a little
bit of a gap though, gap.

229
00:16:09.014 --> 00:16:16.155
Gap, 1 rem or whatever,
make them look a little bit better.

230
00:16:18.035 --> 00:16:19.415
And now we want them on that border.

231
00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:22.437
How do we get them there?

232
00:16:22.437 --> 00:16:23.405
&gt;&gt; Relative positioning.

233
00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:27.113
&gt;&gt; We can do it with
relative positioning or?

234
00:16:27.113 --> 00:16:28.160
&gt;&gt; Negative margin.

235
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.980
&gt;&gt; Negative margin, margin top.

236
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.170
Negative something, right?

237
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.823
20 pixels or whatever.

238
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.149
Something like that.

239
00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:42.380
Cool, so
now we go from icons here to icons there.

240
00:16:46.227 --> 00:16:48.979
Looks even better with the right icons,
but you get the idea.
