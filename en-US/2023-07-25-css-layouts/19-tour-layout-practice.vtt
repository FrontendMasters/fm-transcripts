1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.073
So why don't you take five minutes and

2
00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:08.160
I want you to see if you can come
up with a layout here for tour.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.835
By the way, that tour looks like
it's got the wrong font on it.

4
00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.075
So remember to look at your,

5
00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:21.384
oops [LAUGH] I just zoomed in too far.

6
00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:26.050
Make sure to look at your comp here,
see if you can get tour tlook like that.

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.460
See if you can get these buttons
aligned over here on the side.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.928
And if you have a little extra time,
you're gonna lay out the footer and

9
00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:37.503
you're gonna lay out the grid
here with the tour dates and

10
00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:43.737
the buttons Welcome back,

11
00:00:43.737 --> 00:00:48.285
everybody, I hope you had fun putting
together that grid here for the tour page.

12
00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:52.245
So I am going to ask the people
here in the classroom to

13
00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:56.580
tell me all about how we
are going to set up our grid.

14
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.480
So let's start with an easy thing,
how about the tour title?

15
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.430
What do I need to do to
style the tour title?

16
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.765
Somebody have a style for that?

17
00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:11.193
Yeah, so we're gonna do main.

18
00:01:11.193 --> 00:01:13.030
&gt;&gt; h1.

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.301
&gt;&gt; h1, yep.

20
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.368
&gt;&gt; Font family cursive.

21
00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:21.763
&gt;&gt; And font family, Cursive.

22
00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:28.010
And remember the size is already
set cuz we had a class called h3 so

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.288
that should be good.

24
00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:32.681
&gt;&gt; Font-family colon.

25
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:38.046
&gt;&gt; Forgot the colon, thank you I was like
what did I do and a var in front of it.

26
00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:45.166
Var, var cursive.

27
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.501
There we go, that works, anything else?

28
00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:55.801
Probably we wanna do a text-align?

29
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.867
Well we'll see, text-align center,
let's just put it in for now.

30
00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:09.377
Cool, all right, so then we had
our HTML and you guys were looking

31
00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:14.603
at that HTML pretty much the same
as what we had before, right?

32
00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:19.150
When we were working with this on
the easy design, just a whole bunch of

33
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.082
paragraphs here only there's more of
them because one of them is the tour and

34
00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:26.342
one of them is the button, right?

35
00:02:26.342 --> 00:02:28.421
So how did you guys do this for grid?

36
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.024
Anybody have a style to tell me?

37
00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:38.283
&gt;&gt; Grid area, grid-area, 1, 1, 2.

38
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:43.882
&gt;&gt; Okay, and what was your selector?

39
00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:45.569
&gt;&gt; We still on main h1?

40
00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.021
&gt;&gt; Well, let's start with main.

41
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:51.496
So what was your style for main?

42
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.925
Anybody have a style for main?

43
00:02:57.925 --> 00:02:58.904
&gt;&gt; Display grid.

44
00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:02.247
&gt;&gt; Display grid always a good start, okay?

45
00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:05.613
What comes after display grid?

46
00:03:05.613 --> 00:03:07.296
&gt;&gt; Grid template column.

47
00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:10.609
&gt;&gt; Grid template columns, yeah.

48
00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.485
&gt;&gt; Maybe 2fr, 1fr.

49
00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:20.142
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
we could do something like 2fr, 1fr.

50
00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:25.714
I don't remember what I did,
I might have just done 1fr,

51
00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:30.052
1fr but yeah, something like that, okay?

52
00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:32.421
And then for the h1, what did we do?

53
00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:36.791
You were getting ready
to tell me something.

54
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.394
&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] Grid.

55
00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:40.319
&gt;&gt; Grid area.
&gt;&gt; Yep.

56
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.112
&gt;&gt; Grid area 1/1.

57
00:03:42.112 --> 00:03:44.861
&gt;&gt; 1/1.

58
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.397
&gt;&gt; 2.

59
00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:46.095
&gt;&gt; 2.

60
00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:47.157
&gt;&gt; 3.
&gt;&gt; 3.

61
00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.812
Look at that, sweet.

62
00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:57.701
And now with the wrapper doing its thing,
okay, so

63
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:02.870
it's gonna change its layout when
we get to the larger points here.

64
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.088
So what's going on here when
I get to my larger size?

65
00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:09.474
I mean it looks great
here on mobile right?

66
00:04:09.474 --> 00:04:16.839
Not quite centered over the top here,
but okay, right, what's going on?

67
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.136
Anybody have any ideas?

68
00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:24.580
All right, so when in doubt always do
a main greater than sign star, right?

69
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.288
We're gonna stick a border on it.

70
00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:34.456
And that will help diagnose our problems,
look at that, that's what's going on.

71
00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:38.816
So we have a button that's aligned to
the top here and when we get bigger,

72
00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:42.334
everything is aligned to
the left-hand side, see that?

73
00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:50.863
Okay, so what we can do to
fix that particular problem,

74
00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:55.581
we can do something like this,

75
00:04:55.581 --> 00:05:00.300
main p:nth-child(odd),

76
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.657
anyone seen a selector like that before?

77
00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:10.308
Okay, so some say yes and some say no.

78
00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:16.167
So nth-child means we can take a look
at all the paragraphs that are there.

79
00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:19.043
And in this case,
we're gonna take the odd-numbered ones.

80
00:05:19.043 --> 00:05:23.052
Again, human counting, so
the first, third, fifth, etc.

81
00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:29.018
We're gonna take those odd numbers
of paragraphs inside of main,

82
00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:35.960
and we can say, these are alignment
options, justify-self: end; okay?

83
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.622
Now oddly, odd applies to the things
that are on the right and

84
00:05:40.622 --> 00:05:43.650
you might go but wait, those are even.

85
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.899
Anybody going wait those are even,
why did odd work on the buttons?

86
00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.683
Anybody wondering that?

87
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:55.073
Yeah, remember,
tour is our first option, so that's one.

88
00:05:55.073 --> 00:05:59.878
So two becomes the tour date on the left,
so that's two, four, six,

89
00:05:59.878 --> 00:06:03.712
eight and three, five, seven,
nine are on the right.

90
00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:05.850
Okay, so it did in fact work.

91
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.734
So ustify-self: end; and
we can also do an align-self : center.

92
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.860
And that will center the button here
within, so when our screen gets small,

93
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.816
see how nicely the button centers
relative to the tour dates?

94
00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.061
It does it on bigger screens too,

95
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.510
but it's more noticeable when
it's here on the smaller screen.

96
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.426
And then, of course,
once you're done with that,

97
00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:32.914
you can get rid of your debugging borders.

98
00:06:36.384 --> 00:06:42.916
Sweet, Now, if you were wondering where
that stuff came from, we may need

99
00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:46.990
to do a little bit more modification here
by the way that looks a little bit big.

100
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.401
We could modify our wrapper to be
a little bit narrower that kind of thing.

101
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.709
But if you're wondering where I
got these properties, anytime,

102
00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:02.660
this is your million dollar tip,
you Google CSS tricks grid.

103
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.550
And the first link will be
the complete guide to CSS grid, okay?

104
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.080
And in here is everything you need to
know about the containers and the items,

105
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.660
the parents and the children, right?

106
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.040
Everything is in here,
all the properties, all the values.

107
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.397
And of course, inevitably, the next
thing I hear is, yes, I use the one for

108
00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:25.664
flexbox all the time.

109
00:07:25.664 --> 00:07:29.905
Yes, that too if you
Google CSS tricks flexbox,

110
00:07:29.905 --> 00:07:33.742
you'll find the flexbox grid here as well.

111
00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:40.590
Bookmark them, there's a poster you
can download and print right here,

112
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:47.818
download free, you can print it and
put it on your wall, Good stuff.

113
00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:53.927
All right, so we're gonna call
that done here for our tour page,

114
00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:56.488
are there any questions at this point?

115
00:08:00.088 --> 00:08:05.048
&gt;&gt; At this point should it be
looking good and all of the views?

116
00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:08.560
&gt;&gt; It may be a little bit off, well,

117
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.216
we've got some weird things
going on there, right?

118
00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:16.267
So, what's going on there?

119
00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:19.972
What happened?,
&gt;&gt; Our largest media query,

120
00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:22.488
&gt;&gt; Our largest media query is doing

121
00:08:22.488 --> 00:08:24.560
something, right?

122
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.813
Look at that, display grid,
grid template columns 2fr,

123
00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:34.269
it's doing exactly what we told it to do
once again, so if we get rid of that.

124
00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:43.360
That problem's fixed,
they may be a little bit far apart here.

125
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.353
So maybe we wanna change our max width,
maybe we change our max width to 800

126
00:08:47.353 --> 00:08:52.071
pixels no matter what Or 600 pixels.

127
00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:59.009
Maybe we set that to 600 pixels
up here in our first media query.

128
00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.728
Our max width is 600 pixels and

129
00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:07.281
we get rid of our last media query
because we don't need it anymore.

130
00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:11.887
Yeah, those kinds of tweaks,
those little clean up things.

131
00:09:16.942 --> 00:09:18.110
Everybody happy?

132
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.436
How cool is that diagonal line?

133
00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:25.740
Who's gonna go and
use it immediately on their next website?

134
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.999
Right?
That would be amazing.

135
00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:33.855
In terms of the footer I give you
a code pen that's in here for

136
00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:39.975
this as an exercise, and the thing that
I wanted to point out here was this,

137
00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:44.465
so I have the footer it's
built in two different ways.

138
00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:48.868
The first footer that's here at the top,
this is using,

139
00:09:48.868 --> 00:09:54.485
as you see here on line eight,
this is using images to display your SVGs.

140
00:09:55.505 --> 00:09:59.213
And what happens when you use the image
tag to display your SVG is you can't get

141
00:09:59.213 --> 00:10:00.195
a hover state on it.

142
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.194
So that's an interesting tip to file away,
why you might wanna not use the image

143
00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:11.507
tag for displaying your SVGs,
it means you can't have a hover state.

144
00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:17.474
So the second ones down here
that do have a hover state,

145
00:10:17.474 --> 00:10:23.455
they have,
the SVG is actually included here inline.

146
00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:26.905
Make sense?

147
00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:31.515
Okay, so
when the SVG here is included inline,

148
00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:34.973
then you can get a hover state on it,

149
00:10:34.973 --> 00:10:39.832
and that code is, Here's my footer.

150
00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:51.391
So you just do it this way, footer SVG,
you make it a color by fill,

151
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:55.152
because remember SVG
has its own properties.

152
00:10:55.152 --> 00:10:59.401
So it's the fill is what you want for
the SVG to make it the lime color, and

153
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.550
then when you hover it,
you change your fill to cyan.

154
00:11:04.983 --> 00:11:08.513
Okay, so
that's just an extra thing that's in here,

155
00:11:08.513 --> 00:11:11.287
as to why we coded
the footer the way we did.
