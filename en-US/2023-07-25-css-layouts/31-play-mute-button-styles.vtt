1
00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:04.817
So now we're down to this last part here,
where now we can do some final

2
00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.387
styling here to actually get it
to look a little prettier, right?

3
00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:13.034
We probably don't want that white
background on those sliders,

4
00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:16.813
we need to get bombshell looks and
track seven aligned a bit better,

5
00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:19.881
we need that play button to
have the green background.

6
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.960
So there's a whole bunch of little
things that we need to do here.

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.131
So I'm gonna add that now,
I'm just gonna continue to add that on.

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.366
So here, just for consistency sake, we can
stick an ID in front of our button here.

9
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.508
We don't want a generic button cuz we've
got other buttons in our document, right?

10
00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:46.335
So we wanna be sure that the buttons here
are the ones that apply to our audio

11
00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:47.026
container.

12
00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:56.445
So we're gonna say, audio-player-container
space button for that reason.

13
00:00:56.445 --> 00:01:00.029
We'll keep our padding, our border,
our background, transparent,

14
00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:02.333
the cursor of pointer and
the outline of none.

15
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.626
So all of that stuff is good, we just
wanted to make that a little bit more

16
00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:09.002
specific to apply to our audio styles.

17
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.621
And then we can talk
about specific buttons.

18
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:18.099
So let's talk about that mute-icon,

19
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.421
button#mute-icon.

20
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:22.954
Now, what is that selector?

21
00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:24.337
There's no spaces in that.

22
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:25.183
What is that?

23
00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:28.212
Where does that come from?

24
00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:33.833
What does that mean?

25
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:35.283
Why didn't I put a space in that?

26
00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:37.263
Anybody have any ideas?

27
00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.809
&gt;&gt; Cuz the mute-icon isn't a child of
the button, it is the actual button.

28
00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.145
&gt;&gt; It is the actual button, right?

29
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.643
So the button has that
idea of the play-icon.

30
00:01:46.643 --> 00:01:51.167
So button with mute-icon, all together, so

31
00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:55.118
called all one word, no spaces, okay?

32
00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:58.174
Same thing with classes,
if you have a class on that button.

33
00:01:58.174 --> 00:01:59.748
Why did I do it this way?

34
00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:03.550
Because we may have styles later in the
document for just the mute-icon, right?

35
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.190
And I want my styles to win, so
I've made this a little bit more specific.

36
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.345
So my styles will override
anything that comes later,

37
00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:12.207
cuz I didn't write all the CSS.

38
00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:13.293
Make sense?

39
00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:16.923
&gt;&gt; Could you just repeat that,
it's not a child of the button?

40
00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:18.809
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not a child of the button.

41
00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.133
So if we take a look at our HTML here,

42
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.625
we're specifically talking
about the mute button.

43
00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:30.948
So here it is, Line 23, so
it's a button with an ID of mute-icon.

44
00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:37.014
So if I said button space #mute-icon, that
would mean that I have a button and inside

45
00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:42.841
of it I have something with that ID of, I
mean, like a span or something like that.

46
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.515
So here when we have no space,
then they are the same element.

47
00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:47.976
Yeah, thanks for asking.

48
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:56.346
Okay, so for my mute-icon then,

49
00:02:56.346 --> 00:03:03.636
let's set a width of 2rem to make
it bigger cuz we can't see it.

50
00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:08.428
And we can give it a margin-left of 1rem.

51
00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:13.613
That'll give us a little bit of space
from that volume, which we're gonna

52
00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:18.904
enlarge here momentarily, so don't be
too bothered by what you see there.

53
00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.157
Let's do the same thing for
our play button.

54
00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:27.579
So button#play-icon, and
we'll style that up.

55
00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:34.803
So the first thing that I wanna do is set
this to display block, because when I

56
00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:39.629
set it to display block, now I can put
margin and padding on all four sides.

57
00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.158
When it's a plain old image,
I can't necessarily do that, or

58
00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:45.620
a plain old button.

59
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.796
We'll put on a padding of
0.5rem on all four sides.

60
00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.682
That'll reduce its size a little bit.

61
00:03:55.279 --> 00:04:03.925
And then we can give it
a background color of var(--lime).

62
00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.955
Hey, look at that!

63
00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:13.275
Getting closer and closer, okay?

64
00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:16.277
Now it's a lovely square, but
I really want it to be round.

65
00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:19.752
What do I do, how do I make it round?

66
00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:21.153
&gt;&gt; Whatever it is, 50%.

67
00:04:21.153 --> 00:04:27.798
&gt;&gt; Yeah, border-radius is 50%.

68
00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:29.836
And that'll turn it into a lovely circle.

69
00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:34.229
And just to be sure that we've
got it at the square, because,

70
00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.540
of course,
a circle is derived from a square.

71
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.493
[LAUGH] If it's more like a rectangle,
it'll look more like an egg than a square

72
00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:46.786
or than a circle, so let's just give
it a width and a height as well.

73
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:54.012
So width of 3rem and a height of 3rem.

74
00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:57.402
&gt;&gt; Can she use aspect ratio?

75
00:04:57.402 --> 00:05:00.699
&gt;&gt; Potentially,
you could use aspect ratio.

76
00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.404
I'm not sure about the support,
if the support is completely there for

77
00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.689
the browsers, but
that's definitely an up and coming thing.

78
00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.631
Yeah, aspect ratio would be fine.

79
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:15.778
Okay, so we've got a green button,
nice, but

80
00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:20.930
wouldn't it be nice to have something
like it'd change color on-hover?

81
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.561
Wouldn't that be awesome?

82
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.428
Yeah, so let's add that.

83
00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:36.536
Button#play-icon, :hover,

84
00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.967
all one word, okay?

85
00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:44.474
So this is a button with
the ID of play-icon on-hover,

86
00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:46.115
no spaces in there at all.

87
00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:57.402
And we can set our
background color to cyan.

88
00:05:57.402 --> 00:06:04.534
That'll match the rest of the site where
we have lime going to cyan, right?

89
00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:07.954
Because we imported this icon from
Lonnie Web, it's an SVG, and so

90
00:06:07.954 --> 00:06:09.460
this will all work just fine.

91
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.410
Make sense?

92
00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:18.123
Okay, and then the last part here,
for this playing icon here,

93
00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:22.623
we need to make that triangle not blue,
we want it to be black.

94
00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:24.748
Anybody have an idea of how to do this?

95
00:06:26.393 --> 00:06:30.535
It's an SVG, so it's a little different.

96
00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:32.389
&gt;&gt; SVG stroke?

97
00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.339
&gt;&gt; Yeah, close, it's a path.

98
00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:37.260
But yeah, it's not like border or

99
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.385
anything that would come
to mind immediately, right?

100
00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:48.059
So button#play-icon space path.

101
00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:54.502
And there's a space because this
is inside of the button, right?

102
00:06:54.502 --> 00:06:58.879
That is not obvious here in our HTML,
but because the JavaScript

103
00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:03.742
connection to Lonnie Web, this is
pulling in that SVG over the API, and

104
00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:07.898
we're now referring to a path
inside of that button, okay?

105
00:07:07.898 --> 00:07:10.182
So that's where that selector comes from.

106
00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:14.355
And we just say stroke,
I'm sorry, did I say?

107
00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:15.203
You were right.

108
00:07:15.203 --> 00:07:21.776
[LAUGH] Path is the selector,
and stroke is the property.

109
00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:26.423
So stroke is var(--white).

110
00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:33.770
Or black, so
we can actually see it, black.

111
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.617
[LAUGH] There we go.

112
00:07:37.617 --> 00:07:39.911
Nice?

113
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:40.746
[MUSIC]

114
00:07:40.746 --> 00:07:42.268
Still plays.

115
00:07:42.268 --> 00:07:44.261
[SOUND] All is well.

116
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:47.661
[LAUGH] Okay.

117
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.010
And I've got a couple more notes here,

118
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.748
we're just continuing to go on through
here and style other things, so.

119
00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:09.103
I bet that audio player container path
stroke white is probably pertaining to

120
00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.228
that mute button.

121
00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:13.946
We go to our mute button.

122
00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:19.546
Let's say button#mute-icon, path,

123
00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:25.946
and we'll set it stroke to var(--white).

124
00:08:29.168 --> 00:08:30.552
There we go.

125
00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:36.044
So now our mute-icon,
let's make sure that that's still working.

126
00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:37.567
[MUSIC]

127
00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:38.261
Yep.

128
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:40.083
[MUSIC]

129
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:41.433
Still working.
