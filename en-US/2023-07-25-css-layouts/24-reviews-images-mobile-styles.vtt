1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.782
The next thing we wanna take a look at
in our medium design is our reviews and

2
00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:06.941
images section of the webpage and

3
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:09.892
to remind you what this
is going to look like.

4
00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:14.642
This is the reviews and
images section of our webpage.

5
00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:19.243
Sometimes it's useful just to pull this
out of what you're working on and put it

6
00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:23.568
in a separate code pen so you can just
focus on one part of your page at a time,

7
00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:26.743
so we're just gonna focus on
this part of the web page.

8
00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:29.119
And as you can see here in this slide,

9
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.268
the very top is the way that our
mobile reviews are going to look.

10
00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:37.082
In other words,
we're gonna have four reviews, no images.

11
00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:41.906
When we go to our tablet, we've still got
four reviews, but we're gonna have images

12
00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:45.939
in the middle, and we have the border
that goes around the whole thing.

13
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:50.449
And then when we go to Desktop, this
will be a column in our desktop design.

14
00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.515
So we're gonna stack things
on top of each other,

15
00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:57.910
stack the review, stack the images,
and so forth on top of each other.

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.980
So as we get started with
this section of the webpage,

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.517
my first question to you is this.

18
00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:10.337
What order should we have our HTML
to satisfy all of these layouts?

19
00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.663
Does anybody have an idea what order?

20
00:01:12.663 --> 00:01:16.048
And you can just sort of generally talk
like review image, that kind of thing,

21
00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:18.379
we don't need to worry about
the details of the HTML.

22
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:19.396
May, you have an idea?

23
00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:20.094
Yeah.

24
00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:23.134
&gt;&gt; Review image,
review image, review image.

25
00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:27.464
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're just gonna alternate
starting with the review and

26
00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:28.932
going to the image, so

27
00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:33.828
we're actually looking at the desktop
as our HTML ordering here, right?

28
00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:38.739
Because that's that simple
flow from top to bottom, and

29
00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:43.358
we'll modify that for
mobile and for tablet, okay?

30
00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:44.420
Does that make sense?

31
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.042
Okay, cool.

32
00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:50.340
So, if you fork your CodePen and
open that up in CodePen,

33
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.447
you'll see here,
this is what we have to start with.

34
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:58.466
So, we start with a review, that's
the review that's inside of the figure.

35
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:02.611
We mark that up in our Easy Design,
that markup hasn't changed.

36
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:05.516
Then we have an image
that comes after that.

37
00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:09.056
You'll notice that the image
is inside of a div already,

38
00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:13.775
that div has a class of featured- image
because these are featured images,

39
00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.891
I don't know,
that's what I decided to call it.

40
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:21.540
Remember that div is there just
to make those images flexible.

41
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.880
And we alternate these, so
then we have another quote here,

42
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.454
we have another picture,
we have another quote,

43
00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:34.753
we have another picture, and then we
have our last quote here on the page.

44
00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:40.233
So we are going to give our aside, which
we've wrapped around this whole thing,

45
00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.873
what is the purpose of the aside element,
by the way?

46
00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:46.276
Does anybody know what the purpose
of the aside element is?

47
00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:47.616
Why did I pick that?

48
00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:51.060
&gt;&gt; So an aside is secondary
content to your main content, so

49
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.013
without the main content there, the aside
wouldn't necessarily make sense, so

50
00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:59.694
it's in support of whatever is
the main content on the page.

51
00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:02.423
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so
it's in support of the main content.

52
00:03:02.423 --> 00:03:06.113
So our main content is those tour
dates and this is people saying, hey,

53
00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:09.514
you should go on the tour because
it's totally awesome, right?

54
00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:12.386
This is that convincing material.

55
00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:14.555
Okay, so that's why we chose the side.

56
00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:19.818
Let's give it a class of reviews,
because we're

57
00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:24.593
gonna need a class in
order to get this going.

58
00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:28.022
All right, so let's get into the CSS now.

59
00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:31.117
I'm gonna pulling up our CSS here,

60
00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:36.287
we have our reviews layer right
here inside of our CodePen.

61
00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:40.902
Remember, you can collapse these layers
to find the reviews quickly and easily.

62
00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:46.042
And if you take a look here,
[COUGH] we copied this from our previous

63
00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:51.469
work here on the easy design,
that's what that comment there says.

64
00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.767
We've already styled the block quote,
and the site, and the figure,

65
00:03:55.767 --> 00:04:00.147
that's all in our base layer, so
I'm just gonna pull that comment out.

66
00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:02.441
And we have a class here for image group.

67
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:05.424
That was something that we
used in our easy design

68
00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:08.188
where we had groups each
image with a review,

69
00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:13.016
we don't have that class anymore, so
we can just get rid of that style as well.

70
00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:17.182
We'll still wanna keep that star style
to keep our stars at a reasonable size.

71
00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:20.470
So now that we've got that in place,

72
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.210
what do we need to do as a first
step to achieve our mobile design?

73
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.768
So for our mobile design,
remember this is what it looks like.

74
00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:35.511
What is the first thing that we should do
in our CSS to achieve this mobile design,

75
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:36.276
anybody?

76
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.657
&gt;&gt; Remove the images.

77
00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:38.864
Let's hide those images.

78
00:04:38.864 --> 00:04:42.036
Yeah, okay.

79
00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:44.921
So, if we take a look here in our HTML,

80
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:49.176
remember we have a div with
a class of featured-image.

81
00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:54.783
So all we should do here
then is say .featured-image,

82
00:04:54.783 --> 00:04:59.929
that's our class, and
we can say display: none.

83
00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.903
And all those images go away.

84
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:09.976
Super simple.

85
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:14.990
Okay, then next we wanna
style this reviews container

86
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.568
such that we get our four quotes,
two on the top and

87
00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:24.477
two on the bottom, remember,
just like we saw here.

88
00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:26.659
So we need two on the top and
two on the bottom.

89
00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.553
Does anyone have any suggestions about how
we might achieve that particular layout?

90
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.038
The grid.

91
00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.574
&gt;&gt; Maybe CSS grid.

92
00:05:38.574 --> 00:05:42.298
Let's try it, okay?

93
00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:44.279
So if we go to our CodePen,

94
00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.976
we can work right here with our reviews,
which is our parent.

95
00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:55.160
Yeah, we have a parent, we have all these
children that come after it, so .reviews

96
00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:02.170
Anybody have any suggestions what
should be my first step here?

97
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.451
What kind of styling do I need in order
to achieve that two on the top and

98
00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:11.201
two on the bottom,
kind of centered on the page?

99
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:12.800
&gt;&gt; Start with center in it,
maybe margin 0.

100
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.027
&gt;&gt; We could start.

101
00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:21.905
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
we could say margin: 0 auto, okay?

102
00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:23.855
And why didn't not do anything?

103
00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:26.765
&gt;&gt; Maybe because we haven't
set the maximum width.

104
00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:28.536
&gt;&gt; Maybe because we
haven't set a width yet.

105
00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:34.519
Remember we can always stick a border
on it, border one pixel solid white.

106
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.870
And notice that our border goes
all the way across the page.

107
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.896
So we did do the margin: 0 auto,
it's just occupying all the space,

108
00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:46.435
there is no extra space
to make it centered.

109
00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:50.815
So we need to always set a width
when we use our margin like this.

110
00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:56.298
In this case,
we can set a max width of 500 pixels.

111
00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:57.908
There we go.

112
00:06:57.908 --> 00:07:02.252
And now we have the right width,
and it's centered for us as well.

113
00:07:02.252 --> 00:07:03.626
What else should we do here?

114
00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:10.759
&gt;&gt; Center the content.

115
00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.073
We could center the content.

116
00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:15.547
So text-align: center.

117
00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:19.763
There it is, great.

118
00:07:19.763 --> 00:07:21.494
What else?

119
00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:25.653
&gt;&gt; Display a grid with two columns.

120
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.341
&gt;&gt; Yeah, display a grid.

121
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:36.197
&gt;&gt; And then grid-template-columns:

122
00:07:36.197 --> 00:07:38.966
1fr 1fr.

123
00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:43.246
Actually not bad, looks pretty good.

124
00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:44.276
What are we missing?

125
00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.529
&gt;&gt; A gap.

126
00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:50.386
&gt;&gt; Maybe a gap, 2rem.

127
00:07:53.128 --> 00:07:58.383
There, a little space in between them,
okay?

128
00:07:58.383 --> 00:07:59.817
That looks pretty good.

129
00:07:59.817 --> 00:08:06.882
I've also got here
justify-content: center.

130
00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:09.733
I'm not sure that actually
does anything here,

131
00:08:09.733 --> 00:08:12.315
cuz our text-align will do the same thing.

132
00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:14.967
Okay, so once you got all that in place,

133
00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:17.854
we can get rid of our
border here if you want.

134
00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:22.186
The other thing I'm going to do while I'm
here, I'm gonna change my 0 auto to 2rem

135
00:08:22.186 --> 00:08:26.093
auto, that'll give us a little bit of
space on the top and the bottom there,

136
00:08:26.093 --> 00:08:29.331
so we're not shoved up against
the edge of our browser window,

137
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:31.068
it just looks a little prettier.

138
00:08:31.068 --> 00:08:33.396
Cool, so we're all done with that.

139
00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:35.051
That was pretty straightforward.

140
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:37.331
That is our mobile design.

141
00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:40.190
That's our code for it, pretty similar.
