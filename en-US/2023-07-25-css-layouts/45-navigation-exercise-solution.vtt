1
00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:05.577
We have got our small things done,
we got those cool double border corners,

2
00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:10.137
and now we are going to take care of
our navigation before we sorta get

3
00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:14.300
to the main course of our track list and
those diamond images.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.344
So where we're going to start
this one is with our nav tweaks,

5
00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.256
and we are at 5C, our navigation.

6
00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:26.463
You can see here, this is the kind
of thing that we're looking for, for

7
00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.230
the way this page is laid out.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.391
So when we're very small on mobile,
I sort of mentioned this earlier,

9
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.059
we're trending in this direction,

10
00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.461
we were going to have just the lime and
the hamburger button.

11
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.995
When we got to a slightly larger screen
size, we were actually gonna have the word

12
00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:48.204
Magenta Lime up here,
still with the hamburger button.

13
00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:51.521
And then when we got to
our larger navigation,

14
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:55.531
we would have everything
that was visible here, okay?

15
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:58.246
So that's what you're
gonna see on desktop.

16
00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:02.580
So, we know we already have
a working hamburger button,

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.851
we already put that in place.

18
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:09.755
To your starting codepen, I've added,
there's a couple of extra links here

19
00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:13.408
that I've added on, so
now we also have Music and Signup.

20
00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:17.536
What that means is when we get
to this break point, yeah,

21
00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:22.370
that's probably not the effect
that we're looking for, right?

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.745
We don't want to have this sort
of wrap underneath like this and

23
00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:32.373
we have to scroll in for a while before we
get to our lime and our hamburger button.

24
00:01:32.373 --> 00:01:36.860
So we're gonna need to tweak what in order
to make this work a little bit better?

25
00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:41.992
&gt;&gt; Max-width?

26
00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:46.023
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got some media queries
we're gonna have to think about.

27
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.959
You need to go back and
revisit our media queries and figure out.

28
00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.344
So here,
we'd wanna see the hamburger button still,

29
00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:56.692
right, but the whole Magenta Lime logo.

30
00:01:56.692 --> 00:02:01.538
And when we got to here,
then we'd see everything, right?

31
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.400
So we need to think about
where those breakpoints are.

32
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.131
We have a layer here called nav,
that's all the code that we worked

33
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:13.202
with before and the break points and
all the rest of that.

34
00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:17.890
So this should be relatively
straightforward for you to figure out.

35
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.479
Don't break the JavaScript, okay?

36
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.718
The JavaScript is down here, there's
nothing you need to do with it, but

37
00:02:23.718 --> 00:02:25.509
it does need to continue to run, right?

38
00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:31.446
All right, so
how did you do with that challenge?

39
00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:35.350
Did you get the nav bar to behave, yeah?

40
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.373
So what did you do?

41
00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:39.635
Tell me, Andrew, what did you do?

42
00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:42.703
&gt;&gt; I added a media query-
&gt;&gt; Okay.

43
00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:46.656
&gt;&gt; First for 700 max-width.

44
00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:49.820
&gt;&gt; So for 700 max-width, okay?

45
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.050
So did you just take this one and
change it or did you, you added one?

46
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.932
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess I didn't
realize I did that, but yeah,

47
00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:02.431
I just changed that one to 700-
&gt;&gt; Okay,

48
00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:06.786
just change this one to 700px max-width.

49
00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:10.076
And why did you do that?

50
00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:15.865
&gt;&gt; So that the band name would show
up at tablet width but not mobile.

51
00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:20.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, so we want this
hamburger button to show up for

52
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.563
a longer period of time, right?

53
00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:26.915
And everything that's here inside
of this media query has to do

54
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.471
with that hamburger button, yeah?

55
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:35.137
Pretty much, pretty much that's what's
going on there with that media query,

56
00:03:35.137 --> 00:03:39.150
cuz remember,
we have a desktop first media query here.

57
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.361
Okay, so, all right, so what we wanna
do is outside of some period, right?

58
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:48.588
So probably a little bit
more mobile focused,

59
00:03:48.588 --> 00:03:53.139
maybe around 500 pixels,
we don't want the name to show, but

60
00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.625
we want the name to show here for
at least a little while, right?

61
00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:59.013
So how do we deal with that?

62
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.158
&gt;&gt; Move that bandname, display: none.

63
00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:09.946
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

64
00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:11.682
&gt;&gt; And do a new media query of like 500?

65
00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:13.447
&gt;&gt; We could do that?

66
00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:16.862
We could put display: none,

67
00:04:16.862 --> 00:04:22.058
we could put that in
a different media query.

68
00:04:22.058 --> 00:04:26.358
So let's just take that out of there and
we could say @media and

69
00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:29.292
then (min-width:500px), yeah?

70
00:04:32.358 --> 00:04:39.231
Sorry, max-width, (max-width: 500px)
.bandname {display: none}, right?

71
00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:44.321
So when the screen gets small enough,
the band name goes away, make sense?

72
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:48.404
Okay, when the screen
gets a little bit bigger,

73
00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:52.400
the band name appears
until we get to 700px.

74
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.357
Okay, so at 700px,
we're not quite wide enough yet

75
00:04:57.357 --> 00:05:00.317
to put these things side by side.

76
00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:04.985
So if we change this to
something more like 799px,

77
00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:11.640
then when we get to that breakpoint,
then they are in fact completely open.

78
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.258
So now we can go back again.

79
00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:16.613
So here we are,
there's all our navigation.

80
00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:20.103
There it is with just
the hamburger button.

81
00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:26.354
There it is with just the icon,
makes sense?

82
00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:30.283
&gt;&gt; Why is it 799,
is that the magic number, or it's just so

83
00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:32.414
that it fits into this content?

84
00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:34.282
&gt;&gt; It just happened to fit that way.

85
00:05:34.282 --> 00:05:35.792
&gt;&gt; It's such an odd number to me [LAUGH].

86
00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:40.552
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, so
no more than 799 because we have a lot of

87
00:05:40.552 --> 00:05:45.228
media queries that start
with a minimum width of 800.

88
00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:47.401
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So this stops at 799 and

89
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:49.015
those start at 800.

90
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.985
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense?

91
00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:56.583
Yeah, okay, sweet.

92
00:05:56.583 --> 00:06:02.245
So, then the band name comes back and
displays, all is well.

93
00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:05.285
All right, so everybody okay?

94
00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:07.000
Fantastic, then we're moving on.
