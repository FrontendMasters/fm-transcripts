00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
Well, I am super excited
because at this point in time,

2
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.598
we have coded all of the elements
we need to build our medium design.

3
00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:12.170
We have our header with
our Hamburger button.

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.534
We have the album cover and
our working audio player.

5
00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:21.042
We have all those reviews and images, all
that's all coded and we have our footer.

6
00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.898
All of that is in place.

7
00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:25.838
And we also have of course our track list,

8
00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:30.470
all of the songs that come on that
particular Magenta Lime album.

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.290
So now it's up to you.

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.307
It's time for you to go through and
assemble that into a single document.

11
00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:40.700
So here's what I recommend.

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.874
There is a beginning code pen
I've given you right here.

13
00:00:43.874 --> 00:00:49.438
If you open that up in a new tab,
This is the Hamburger

14
00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:54.830
button work that we just finished, so
there it is, all working for you, okay?

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.000
And you'll see that I've given you links
to the finished state of all of the other

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
things we've assembled for
the medium site.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.198
The album cover with the track list,
the reviews, and images, the new album,

18
00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:09.490
that little box that said new album thing.

19
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.244
The footer and so what I'd like for you
to do now copy over the HTML from those,

20
00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:15.927
assemble it all together,

21
00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:20.189
copy over the layers that contain
the right CSS for all those things.

22
00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.097
Assemble that all
together in the code pen.

23
00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:27.919
And then I've mentioned a few other
things, a few other tweaks you may wanna

24
00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:31.174
make along the way here to
that particular design.

25
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.430
So I'd like you to give that a try.

26
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.069
Go through and
see if you can assemble this webpage.

27
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.060
And then we'll go through
the solution at the end.

28
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.690
So remember, this is just what
you'll need to do the mobile and

29
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.312
tablet versions of the web page layout.

30
00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:50.380
And we'll do desktop separately.

31
00:01:54.753 --> 00:02:00.200
So just a couple of quick things here,
a couple of high points to think about.

32
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.743
We copied, of course, all of our HTML
over a little bit by little bit.

33
00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:07.720
Make sure it's inside of your wrapper,
right?

34
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.934
We have a wrapper that
contains everything.

35
00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.736
So if we flatten up our HTML here,
you have your wrapper,

36
00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:16.044
then you should have your header.

37
00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:20.065
You should have that cover, which is
the thing that contains the audio.

38
00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:25.045
You'll have your reviews, you'll have
that album button that comes later,

39
00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:27.620
down here in the document, there it is.

40
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.464
Then you'll have a section that has no
class on it that has the table with

41
00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:33.689
our tracks in it.

42
00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.440
And then we have our footer down
here at the bottom of the page.

43
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.146
So hopefully,
you got something close to that.

44
00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:42.962
One of the things you'll notice
is that when you make the screen

45
00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:47.530
particularly wide, then our reviews
do exactly what we told them to do.

46
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.938
Gosh, darn it, here,
they are turning into the desktop version.

47
00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:55.795
Now, obviously, that's not where that's
going to be when we get to the desktop

48
00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:00.970
layout version of the site, so you can
just sort of ignore that for the moment.

49
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.436
If you have gotten it such
that it looks like this, and

50
00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:08.813
we've got our tablet version here, and

51
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:14.077
we've got our mobile version
here with the reviews like this,

52
00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:18.771
then you did a fantastic job
well done everybody, yay.

53
00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:21.335
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
