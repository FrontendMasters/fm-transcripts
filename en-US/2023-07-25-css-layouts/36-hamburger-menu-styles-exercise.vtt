1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.447
You're gonna do the following.

2
00:00:01.447 --> 00:00:05.623
Number one, you need to go find
our base styles from any of

3
00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:09.850
the codepens that we've written recently.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.080
Grab your base styles and
drop it into your codepen.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.956
Number two, take a look at the styles
that you've been given here and

6
00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:20.500
make changes to whatever's there.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.984
So for a hint, what I'm talking about,

8
00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:27.750
we were given a body element with a font
family of Poppins by default, right?

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.720
We can just delete that, right?

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.940
We have a body element already
styled up in our base.

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.420
Make sense?

12
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.421
Okay, so that's what I'd like for
you to do next.

13
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:43.261
I'd like you to copy over the base, see
if there's anything in here that you can

14
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:48.189
delete because it's duplicative of what
you already have in your base styling.

15
00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:54.929
And then third see if you can work on
styling that just looks like this,

16
00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.500
don't worry about
the hamburger button part,

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.118
just see if you can get a start
on this styling here, okay.

18
00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:09.539
See if you can make that much happen
by modifying the CSS that you have.

19
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.427
Let's go through the changes that
you might have made to your CSS for

20
00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:20.640
the desktop version of this layout only.

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.473
So, first of all, what we did was we
went back to one of our old codepens of

22
00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:29.450
the more recent old codepens and
copied in our base.

23
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.219
So we copied in our base layer and
we put that at the top of our CSS.

24
00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.675
Next thing that I did was I set up a layer
to go around all of the styles that

25
00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:40.534
already exist right there and

26
00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:44.635
I call that layer header because
it's the header of the webpage.

27
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:46.707
Makes sense?

28
00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.109
Super exciting stuff.

29
00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.653
At that point now we need to think about
which of these styles do we need to keep,

30
00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:57.186
what do we need to modify and
what can we get rid of.

31
00:01:57.186 --> 00:01:57.920
Make sense?

32
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.540
Anybody have any styles
that they got rid of?

33
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.965
We already mentioned the body style it was
there, it had a font family of Poppins,

34
00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.550
we got rid of that.

35
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.812
Okay, well, generally speaking,
you can always assume like,

36
00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:17.660
if it says h1 all by itself,
do we already have an h1 style?

37
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.885
We do.
So that can go bye bye.

38
00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:23.030
[LAUGH] Just get rid of things like that.

39
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.260
We scroll on down here,
we get to our action styles.

40
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.419
Do we even have any action styles anymore?

41
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.060
No, we got rid of them.

42
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.296
So you can get rid of
the styling it pertains to that.

43
00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:41.487
And that would also pertain to
the action styles for focus and hover,

44
00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:43.900
we can just get rid of those.

45
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.550
As always if you're scared,
just comment them out.

46
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.840
All right.

47
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.520
Make sure that they do what you expect.

48
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.928
And then after that we can sort of
guess the rest of what's here, may or

49
00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.740
may not be relevant.

50
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.014
So let's go from there.

51
00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:09.660
So let's start with this h1, that
probably bothering a lot of you, right?

52
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.320
Our h1 is called Magenta Lime, it's blue.

53
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.948
What should it be?

54
00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:15.570
&gt;&gt; White.

55
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.500
&gt;&gt; White, our cursive font, right?

56
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.779
What would be a selector to set that up?

57
00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.139
&gt;&gt; You could give h1 a class.

58
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.850
&gt;&gt; You could give h1 a class, right?

59
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.680
We gonna give h1 a class of some kind and
put a style in here.

60
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.370
What else could we do?

61
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.660
&gt;&gt; Id of top and then to h1 and a.

62
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.183
&gt;&gt; And h1, and
then potentially even a like that, right?

63
00:03:44.183 --> 00:03:46.192
Because we're talking about it's a link.

64
00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:50.704
When we look at our HTML, right,
we have a header, we have an h1, and

65
00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:52.410
then we have our link.

66
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.860
Yeah, makes sense.

67
00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.290
So let's do that, top h1 a,
font-family, right?

68
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.368
var(--cursive).

69
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.820
Color: var(--white) Okay.

70
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.780
Closer, looks a little big, doesn't it?

71
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.970
Okay, so we can change the size, right?

72
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.683
Font size, and you can experiment with
the font sizes that you have, but I

73
00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:32.519
think you'll find that var(--h3) is close
to the size that we actually want here.

74
00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:37.417
All right.

75
00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:43.610
And when I hover over this, you want
that name, band name to change, color?

76
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.295
Would you like that?

77
00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:47.530
Yeah, that would totally be cool,
wouldn't it?

78
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.404
So let's set up a hover style.

79
00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:53.860
Top h1 a:hover.

80
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.136
What color would you like?

81
00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:58.170
&gt;&gt; Cyan.

82
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.030
&gt;&gt; var(--cyan).

83
00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:12.933
&gt;&gt; I suppose maybe lime or
the pink given that there in the logo.

84
00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:14.855
&gt;&gt; Lime?

85
00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:17.483
&gt;&gt; Fuchsia, magenta.

86
00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.975
&gt;&gt; Lime, magenta.

87
00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:22.344
[LAUGH] So you can test any of those,

88
00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:26.201
whatever your favorite happens to be,
you can keep it.

89
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.705
Yeah?

90
00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:32.510
&gt;&gt; There seems to be a transition there.

91
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at that.

92
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.140
Where's that coming from?

93
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.960
Can anybody find it in the CSS?

94
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.084
Take a look at your CSS and

95
00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:43.760
see if you can find where that weird
transition thing is coming from.

96
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.690
It'll be in those styles that
are outside the media query.

97
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.920
So how do you think about this problem?

98
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.409
We know it's a link, right?

99
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.905
So we're gonna look for A's.

100
00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:58.650
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Is it 174?

101
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, around line 174,
somewhere in here.

102
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.070
For me, it's 165, but it's this one here.

103
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.006
top &gt; nav a:focus, top &gt; nav a:hover.

104
00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:16.183
There's a transform there
which makes it bigger, okay?

105
00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:17.430
So that's close.

106
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.120
It doesn't look like it's
getting bigger though, does it?

107
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.850
Okay, so keep looking.

108
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.535
We need an A.

109
00:06:23.535 --> 00:06:32.210
&gt;&gt; There's on line 169.

110
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.767
id top a, and there's, I have a footer in
here still I'll just delete that, but.

111
00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:38.760
&gt;&gt; Okay.

112
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.880
Delete the footer.

113
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.130
&gt;&gt; Looks like there's a transition of.

114
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right here.

115
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.880
For me is around line 150,
somewhere in there.

116
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.680
top a.

117
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.100
So here we have a transition.

118
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.703
And what are we transitioning?

119
00:06:53.703 --> 00:06:58.204
We're doing a transform and
a color and a box shadow, okay?

120
00:06:58.204 --> 00:07:01.011
This definitely applies,
some of that is happening,

121
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:02.970
it looks like the color is happening.

122
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.488
Maybe the box shadow, not entirely
sure on that, but not the size.

123
00:07:09.488 --> 00:07:12.299
Make sense?

124
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:13.550
Okay.

125
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.010
So that's how you figure that stuff out.

126
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.440
You just sort of go well,
what what do I think it might be and

127
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.390
then take a look and
see if you can find something close.

128
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.980
Do you like it?

129
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.340
Do you wanna keep it?

130
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.970
Great, let's keep it.

131
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.930
That's your next thing you ask yourself,
right?

132
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.300
Yeah, or
you ask your designer friend, right?

133
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.330
Can I keep it?

134
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.986
It's so cool, can I keep it?

135
00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:40.861
[LAUGH] All right, great.

136
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:49.740
So next, we have,
Let me make this a little bit bigger.

137
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.395
Okay, there's our fine
navigation up there.

138
00:07:52.395 --> 00:07:57.060
[LAUGH] Not quite what we want, is it?

139
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.684
So did anybody manage to get
some styling to work for that?

140
00:08:02.767 --> 00:08:04.250
No?

141
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.963
You did?

142
00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:08.719
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I put it on nav.

143
00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:10.559
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And that allowed me to change the font,

144
00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:11.640
but not the color.

145
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.070
&gt;&gt; Putting it on nav allowed you to
change the font, but not the color.

146
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.708
Great, so you just did top nav right here,
this one?

147
00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:25.985
&gt;&gt; I just wrote a new-
&gt;&gt; You wrote a new style.

148
00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:28.317
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I just did nav.

149
00:08:28.317 --> 00:08:33.860
&gt;&gt; Okay, top nav and no greater
than sign then that's what you did.

150
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.216
Okay, we don't need this flex grow
thing we can get rid of that.

151
00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:39.960
So here for top nav.

152
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:46.174
So what Andrew is saying is if
we go to font-family Pacifica,

153
00:08:46.174 --> 00:08:50.480
or sorry, var(--cursive), right?

154
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.194
The font changes but
the color stays blue even if we

155
00:08:56.194 --> 00:09:01.141
say our color should be var(--white),
right?

156
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:05.070
Why doesn't the color change?

157
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.948
We know we have the right selector because
our font changed, but the color didn't.

158
00:09:10.948 --> 00:09:12.597
What's going on?

159
00:09:12.597 --> 00:09:16.160
&gt;&gt; You have to select the a tag
in order to change its color.

160
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.100
&gt;&gt; Got to select the actual
a because that's more specific.

161
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.417
Where we have to get through from nav,
we have to get through the ul, the li, and

162
00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:29.750
into the a before we actually get to the
where the color is normally set, right?

163
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.970
If you think about links in a default HTML
webpage, no styling, how do they look?

164
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.173
&gt;&gt; Blue
&gt;&gt; They're blue and underlined, right?

165
00:09:39.173 --> 00:09:44.000
&gt;&gt; We have to get that far in
override that style, okay?

166
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.494
&gt;&gt; Is that for links specifically?

167
00:09:45.494 --> 00:09:50.393
&gt;&gt; That is for links specifically because
they have that style on them that's coming

168
00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:51.535
from the browser.

169
00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:54.952
Yep, so we can go to either top a,

170
00:09:54.952 --> 00:09:59.838
as we know all of these
styles that are here apply

171
00:09:59.838 --> 00:10:04.500
to everything that's here in our document.

172
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.193
But we have earlier in our
document we have top h1 a,

173
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:16.491
even though that comes earlier
it's more specific, right?

174
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.731
Cuz it's got three selectors in it,
the ID and

175
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:25.861
two HTML elements as opposed
to this more generic top a.

176
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:26.824
Make sense?

177
00:10:26.824 --> 00:10:33.480
So if we want this to apply specifically
to our nav bar we can say top nav a.

178
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.680
That's one way to do this.

179
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:45.640
And then we can change our color
from 048 to color var(--white)

180
00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:52.772
Cool?

181
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.200
And for some reason,
we just got an underline on Magenta Lime.

182
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.770
Did anybody get that?

183
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.072
Yeah, well,
I guess this no longer applies.

184
00:11:05.072 --> 00:11:08.476
So we can add that back
here in our top h1 a.

185
00:11:08.476 --> 00:11:13.154
Text-decoration: none.

186
00:11:16.207 --> 00:11:17.670
There it goes.

187
00:11:22.643 --> 00:11:27.187
While we're here at our top h1,
let's also say margin zero.

188
00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:31.399
Because our h1 has
a margin on it by default.

189
00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:36.610
Oops, sorry, that's in the wrong spot.

190
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.179
We need just a plain old top h1.

191
00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:49.551
Top h1, margin 0.

192
00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:51.720
That's causing part of
our alignment problem.

193
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.570
See how nicely that now aligns when we
turn off that top margin on our h1.

194
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.640
Remember h1s have margin on it by default.

195
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.670
Comes from your web browser.

196
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.500
&gt;&gt; Did we not reset that
When we did the base?

197
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.570
&gt;&gt; I think we left some margin
on our h 1's from the base.

198
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.975
But a great point,
you might actually depending on your base,

199
00:12:16.975 --> 00:12:18.230
you might have turned it off.

200
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.082
Okay, so we've got our h1, we've got our

201
00:12:26.082 --> 00:12:31.001
a's now let's worry
about our layouts here.

202
00:12:32.742 --> 00:12:40.306
So we started here with display flex and
a gap of 1.5 rems, okay?

203
00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:43.530
So what is this top style applying to?

204
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.490
What are its children?

205
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.270
We have the h1, we have a button,
and we have the nav, right?

206
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.455
So basically it's putting a 1.5
rem gap in between your h1,

207
00:12:55.455 --> 00:12:57.870
your button, and your nav, right?

208
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.590
Anybody want a bigger gap?

209
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.780
Maybe we need to do some other
things here with our layout.

210
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.410
Make sense?

211
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.708
Okay.

212
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:13.488
So, here's what I recommend.

213
00:13:13.488 --> 00:13:20.183
After we go display flex
let's go flex-flow: row wrap.

214
00:13:20.183 --> 00:13:24.654
Actually, nothing on here will
look like it changes, but

215
00:13:24.654 --> 00:13:30.054
it's good to call this out because
by default the value is row nowrap.

216
00:13:30.054 --> 00:13:32.700
And that would mean that if
your screen gets small enough,

217
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.440
nothing will wrap onto the next line.

218
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.130
It will get cut off.

219
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.894
So by saying row wrap, we know that
this is gonna at least wrap and

220
00:13:39.894 --> 00:13:41.098
stay on the screen.

221
00:13:43.032 --> 00:13:49.201
Then I'm gonna say
justify-content: space-between.

222
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.643
And that will push these two things apart.

223
00:13:56.462 --> 00:13:59.559
H1 goes down here,
nav bar goes down there.

224
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.510
Very, nicely.

225
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:06.160
The button is invisible on desktop, so
we don't have to worry about it right now.

226
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.919
So the gap kind of becomes
irrelevant at this point for

227
00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:11.780
that because we're gonna
keep these apart that way.

228
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.410
Make sense?

229
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:13.984
Okay.

230
00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:22.110
We can set a max-width here, max-width.

231
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.270
This is desktop, so
let's say it's 1200px for our max-width.

232
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.080
And we can center it on the page,
and give it a little bit of margin.

233
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.997
I'm gonna say 4rem 2rem.

234
00:14:38.314 --> 00:14:41.020
So it's not shoved up against
the edges of the webpage.

235
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.590
Makes sense?

236
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.790
How's everybody doing so far?

237
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.476
Okay.

238
00:14:46.476 --> 00:14:47.825
Yes.

239
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:52.120
&gt;&gt; Are any of the reset
CSS files useful or

240
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.260
should we only use those
when starting new projects?

241
00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.808
&gt;&gt; You are welcome to use reset CSS
files if you wish, but as you say,

242
00:15:00.808 --> 00:15:04.863
if you start using these at
the beginning of your project,

243
00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:08.708
right, then that's gonna
apply to everything else.

244
00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:12.830
To try to bring in a reset CSS right
now in the middle of our project,

245
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.308
we'll change a whole lot of
stuff here in our document.

246
00:15:16.308 --> 00:15:19.420
[LAUGH] We probably don't
really wanna do that.

247
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:25.253
The other thing to mention is that there
is a difference between a reset CSS and

248
00:15:25.253 --> 00:15:27.150
a normalize CSS, okay?

249
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.750
So a reset CSS is the older
way of doing things.

250
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.630
What that does is it turns everything off.

251
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.494
So it gets rid of all the font sizes, it
gets rid of all the spacing, the margin,

252
00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:41.762
and then you have to redeclare
everything in order for

253
00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:44.810
that to become a reasonable style sheet.

254
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.475
The normalized style sheet will
normalize padding, margin,

255
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:53.580
font sizes and
stuff between all of the browsers.

256
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.786
So if you like using
normalized stylesheet,

257
00:15:55.786 --> 00:15:58.040
you are more than welcome to use those.

258
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.449
I haven't used them here,
mostly because, again,

259
00:16:01.449 --> 00:16:05.258
this is more of a teaching exercise,
a learning exercise.

260
00:16:05.258 --> 00:16:10.078
I want you guys to become cognizant of
where some of the styling is coming from,

261
00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:12.707
some of it's coming from the browser and
so

262
00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:15.939
that is why I'm not using
them here in this project.

263
00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:19.790
In real life and most likely you
would in fact use one of these.

264
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.080
All right, so everything is looking
pretty good here now for desktop.

265
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:31.202
Anybody have any comments or questions
on that except, looking pretty good.

266
00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:32.939
Comments, questions?

267
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.286
The one thing you might wanna do is maybe
you wanna put a little bit of space

268
00:16:39.286 --> 00:16:42.293
here between the the logo and
the bandname and

269
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:46.092
you could do something like
that if you go into your h1 and

270
00:16:46.092 --> 00:16:50.390
we go into our span somewhere in here,
we have to scroll a while.

271
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.290
There we go.

272
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:57.345
I'll give my span a class of bandname.

273
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.080
And then I could put in
a style here of bandname.

274
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.569
And I could say,

275
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:15.321
padding-left: 1rem.

276
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:18.229
Just give us a little breathing room
between our logo and the name of the band.

277
00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:18.830
Make sense?

278
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.949
Okay.

279
00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:26.412
We have a good hover state for
the bandname.

280
00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.200
How about the hover state here for
our navigation items?

281
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.680
Anybody happy with that?

282
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.360
&gt;&gt; Not in particular.

283
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.380
&gt;&gt; Okay, shall we fix it?

284
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.733
Tell me where the style is that
we need in order to fix our

285
00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:45.856
hover state here for
these navigation items.

286
00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:51.945
&gt;&gt; 186, mine might be different, but
there's nav a:focus, nav a:hover.

287
00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.670
&gt;&gt; Right here.

288
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.900
Yeah, exactly.

289
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.010
Yep, right here.

290
00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:01.570
So somewhere around, for me it's 172,
but that's what we're looking for.

291
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.820
top nav a:focus and top nav a:hover.

292
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.682
So this is currently set to black and
it's set to scale.

293
00:18:07.682 --> 00:18:09.011
Do you like it?

294
00:18:09.011 --> 00:18:09.717
&gt;&gt; No.

295
00:18:09.717 --> 00:18:11.320
&gt;&gt; What would you like to change it to?

296
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:15.880
Shall we change that color?

297
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.850
&gt;&gt; Cyan.

298
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:17.648
&gt;&gt; You want the cyan?

299
00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:22.260
Okay, var(--cyan).

300
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.550
Okay, so when we hover over those, they
turn blue, but they're still getting big.

301
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.848
Do you like that?

302
00:18:31.024 --> 00:18:31.800
Yeah?

303
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.440
Maybe?

304
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.103
No?
[LAUGH]

305
00:18:34.103 --> 00:18:35.936
&gt;&gt; Terrible.

306
00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:39.410
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so it's up to you.

307
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.480
If you wanna keep it, you can have it.

308
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.000
If you wanna get rid of it,
you can do that too.

309
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.740
If we don't want it, what should we
eliminate from our code to get rid of it?

310
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.260
&gt;&gt; Transform.

311
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.050
&gt;&gt; The transform, right?

312
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.040
So if you don't like it,
get rid of the transform.

313
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.617
And then things will not change size
when you roll your mouse over and

314
00:18:57.617 --> 00:18:59.199
we just get our color change.

315
00:19:01.386 --> 00:19:02.192
Okay?

316
00:19:02.192 --> 00:19:05.174
&gt;&gt; What's the difference between hover and
focus?

317
00:19:05.174 --> 00:19:12.219
&gt;&gt; So, focus is what happens, if you've
ever tabbed through a web page before.

318
00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:12.782
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

319
00:19:12.782 --> 00:19:15.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get that box around stuff.

320
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.745
That's the focus state.

321
00:19:16.745 --> 00:19:17.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.

322
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
