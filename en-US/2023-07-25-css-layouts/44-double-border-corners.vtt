00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.722
So, the next thing we need to focus on
are the so-called double border corners.

2
00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.480
Ooh, cool, right?

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.980
So, this is this little detail right here.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.080
You see how just the corners
have a border on them?

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.099
This little corner sort of
effect that's going on.

6
00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:28.350
We have that both on the magenta line box
and we have it on the album box down here.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.770
This is the two spots where we
are using that double border corner.

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150
What do people think about that?

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.819
How do we make that happen?

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.760
Anybody has any ideas at all?

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.950
&gt;&gt; So you would take your container
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

12
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.260
&gt;&gt; And apply the borders to before and
after pseudo elements.

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.246
And because there are four here,
you just have to grab one of the child,

14
00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:55.290
components and do the same thing.

15
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.130
&gt;&gt; There you go.

16
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.280
If you understood what he said,
he's actually got the right answer here.

17
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.238
So I will show you here,
what we've got going on.

18
00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:08.430
The first thing I did to start this was I
googled it, because that's what you do.

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.497
You go Google for
double border corners CSS and

20
00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:17.220
I wound up with this post here on Stack
Overflow, always a great place to look.

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
And it turns out they had a bunch
of different solutions for this.

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.994
I could not believe how many solutions
they came up with that produce double

23
00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:26.250
border corners.

24
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.080
And you can produce all kinds of wacky,
different kinds of double border corners.

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.770
So there you can make far more interesting
ones than the ones that our designer has

26
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.950
called for.

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.700
Here's a way you can do it with SVGs,
so on and so forth.

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.130
But the methodology that I like the best
is the one that Jason described for this.

29
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.027
Feel free to dig into Stack Overflow and

30
00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.620
check out all these other
ways of doing this.

31
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.790
Maybe it'll inspire you for
your next design.

32
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.516
But here I have aJSFiddle
that's responsible for

33
00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.970
sort of inspiring this approach.

34
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.217
JSFiddle is very much like CodePen.

35
00:02:02.217 --> 00:02:07.187
It's more oriented towards
the JavaScript developer community.

36
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:09.833
So you can see kind of
here what's going on.

37
00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.876
Here we have a div with an ID of content.

38
00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:15.730
Inside of that,
we have a paragraph, super simple.

39
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.040
Then what we're going to do is
we work with content before.

40
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.045
So the before and
after associated with that div of content

41
00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:30.745
makes sense that forms two boxes and
then the paragraph

42
00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:35.560
inside of that,
it also has a before and after, right?

43
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.921
So that gives us four little boxes
that we can work with, right?

44
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:45.856
Gives us four sides, then what we're
going to do is use positioning

45
00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:49.579
to move those boxes to
the corners of the main box and

46
00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.580
turn on the borders just for
those little bits of code.

47
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.005
That's sort of broadly
the direction we're going in.

48
00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:59.133
So you're ready, we're gonna write
some code for this Make sense?

49
00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:03.243
Everybody okay?

50
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.430
&gt;&gt; Sorry, can you remind me what
the before and after actually

51
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.584
&gt;&gt; What before and after actually do?

52
00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:17.323
Okay, so remember every HTML
element has a box around it, right?

53
00:03:17.323 --> 00:03:18.117
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

54
00:03:18.117 --> 00:03:20.655
&gt;&gt; We know that cuz we have a border and
we have margin and we have padding,

55
00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:21.527
all that kind of thing.

56
00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:24.363
Every HTML element has that.

57
00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:28.654
And when we work with just HTML and
CSS, usually that's all we access.

58
00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:33.598
Is that so-called node, that's
the program, return that node in the HTML.

59
00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:37.549
But in fact there is space before that and
after that node.

60
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.540
And we can access those with
the sudo element before and after.

61
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.010
And that gives us the ability to
put things before something or

62
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.966
things after it.

63
00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:53.130
Make sense?

64
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.466
We've actually used a little bit of before
and after elsewhere here in our code so

65
00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.500
far, but now we're really digging
into how before and after work, okay?

66
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.190
So let us take a look then at our CodePen.

67
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.494
We'll start with our beginning CodePen for
this section

68
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.226
Okay, so fold all this up and
get it ready.

69
00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:24.003
Nice reviews.

70
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:27.621
The lbum is the layer
that we're working with.

71
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:32.980
We don't need the footer, we don't need
the media da da, da, da, da, da da, okay.

72
00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:40.058
So we don't need either side.

73
00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:46.880
Okay, so our two boxes have a class
of album associated with them.

74
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.172
That is what we're gonna use,
we're gonna use that class of album and

75
00:04:51.172 --> 00:04:53.740
we're going to use their first child.

76
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.575
So it actually happens to be the same for
both of them,

77
00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:58.970
which is this h2 that shows up here,
right?

78
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.270
So there's an h2 that shows
up at the start of one box.

79
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.930
There's an h2 that start shows up
at the start of the other box.

80
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.864
Make sense?

81
00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:14.743
Okay, so
now we can start writing our code here.

82
00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:20.643
So the first thing that I'm going
to do Is on my album style,

83
00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:25.009
I am going to add to
this position relative.

84
00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.936
Guess why I'm adding that.

85
00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:35.615
Do you remember earlier where we talked
about relative and absolute positioning?

86
00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:40.598
We said it will go all the way on up
looking for the the next element inside

87
00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:45.084
of all that nested HTML that
doesn't have a position of static,

88
00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:51.630
has know sticky, fixed, absolute,
relative, right, it's looking for it.

89
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.051
Relative is the one that
we usually use for this,

90
00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:56.250
because it doesn't do anything by itself.

91
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.560
As you can see, nothing has changed.

92
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.890
Whereas sticky or
fixed would definitely change something.

93
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.300
And absolute often changes things as well,
right?

94
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.150
Makes sense, okay?

95
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.731
So we want everything to be
relative to that album item,

96
00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:15.100
which is of course the cyan
border that you see here.

97
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.640
You can read that right there in the code.

98
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.800
Makes sense?

99
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.090
Okay, so then we are going to write
the following whacked out code.

100
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.938
So we're gonna say .album.before, okay?

101
00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:32.630
So that's our selector.

102
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.630
Notice that it has a double colon.

103
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.316
Sometimes you'll see this
written with one colon, and

104
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:43.811
that just has to do with,
one colon was part of CSS2.

105
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:47.066
Sudo-elements and

106
00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:53.578
sudo-classes both had the same colon.

107
00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:58.040
And everybody got confused as to which was
a sudo-class and which was a sudo-element.

108
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.570
So in CSS3, they turned
sudo-elements into double colons.

109
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.473
So you'll see it written both ways,
and I like to do the double colon cuz

110
00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:12.334
it reminds you that it's a sudo-element,
all right?

111
00:07:12.334 --> 00:07:18.614
So, album:::before,

112
00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:24.077
.album::.album.

113
00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:29.479
And then, we're going to say,

114
00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:35.172
the immediate colon first-child::before.

115
00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:39.108
Whoa!, having fun yet?

116
00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:40.594
What does that mean?

117
00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:47.230
&gt;&gt; Before the first-child of the album.

118
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.552
&gt;&gt; Yes, so before whatever that
first-child is a direct descendant

119
00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:55.578
of album, so we don't know what
that first child is gonna be.

120
00:07:55.578 --> 00:08:00.510
In our case, we've actually got h2 both
times, we could just say h2 before.

121
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.849
But this is a more generic way of writing
it, so now you can take the style and

122
00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.970
apply it to any other
web page that you build.

123
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.590
Make sense?

124
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.420
Okay, and then we're gonna write that one
more time, and we're gonna say after.

125
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.342
So now we have four boxes.

126
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:20.030
After, there we go.

127
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.730
And how do I know we have four boxes?

128
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:31.670
Well, I'll show you, if I say the width
is 40 pixels, the height is 40 pixels.

129
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.045
And I put in a border,

130
00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:46.325
two pixels solid var, Cyan.

131
00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:52.881
We might start to see them.

132
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:54.481
&gt;&gt; You need a declare block.

133
00:08:56.988 --> 00:08:58.901
&gt;&gt; Declare a block,
is that what I've left off?

134
00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:00.065
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

135
00:09:00.065 --> 00:09:05.625
&gt;&gt; Okay, Splay block.

136
00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:08.203
&gt;&gt; And your content, I'm sorry.

137
00:09:08.203 --> 00:09:10.162
&gt;&gt; And my content.

138
00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:16.402
Because it requires content for
it to show up here on the page.

139
00:09:16.402 --> 00:09:21.108
&gt;&gt; I don't know if the foreign after
are inline or blocked by default.

140
00:09:21.108 --> 00:09:23.933
&gt;&gt; That actually does isn't needed.

141
00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:30.610
Okay, I'll leave it for
now we'll see what happens.

142
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:38.124
So you see what's happening here, we have
this block here, this block here, okay?

143
00:09:38.124 --> 00:09:43.017
Those are coming from album,
that's before and

144
00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:46.130
after associated with album.

145
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.950
We've now turned them into little blocks
and given them four borders, okay?

146
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.671
And inside of this,
we have this is actually a block,

147
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:57.400
it's not splitting as such,
but trust me, it's a block.

148
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.941
And this one over here is another
block that's associated with the h2,

149
00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:02.924
which is the first-child of the album.

150
00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:05.764
Makes sense, okay?

151
00:10:05.764 --> 00:10:08.488
&gt;&gt; So HTML is kind of
throwing in three blocks for

152
00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:10.840
the price of one with every element.

153
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.560
Exactly, just if you need them,
you can style them.

154
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.881
You can change content with them
,sometimes people change content

155
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:20.643
with them.

156
00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:26.068
You can include, we used them earlier to
include the Hamburger button on the page,

157
00:10:26.068 --> 00:10:27.715
that kind of stuff.

158
00:10:27.715 --> 00:10:31.656
&gt;&gt; As long as the HTML element can
contain something inside of it, so

159
00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:33.565
it doesn't work for inputs.

160
00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:38.511
Well, unfortunately some inputs do work
like range doesn't work for image.

161
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:40.168
So it's kind of a hit or miss.

162
00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:42.345
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

163
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.786
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,
I'm going to set my position to absolute,

164
00:10:48.786 --> 00:10:52.651
because we definitely don't
want these boxes there,

165
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:57.110
we're going to have to move
them around in space, okay?

166
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.060
And they're gonna look weird here for
a while,

167
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.980
just sort of ignore what they're doing,
we have a lot of stuff to type in.

168
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.168
So we've got our position of absolute,
we've got our width and

169
00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:08.540
height which controls
the size of the corners.

170
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.547
Now, I put in the border 2 pixel
solid var(--cyan) here, so

171
00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:16.530
that you could see that
those boxes existed.

172
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.342
I'm now gonna take that out, and

173
00:11:19.342 --> 00:11:24.570
I'm going to change this to
the border color is var(cyan).

174
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.357
Remember, border itself is shorthand,
it contains three properties.

175
00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:34.530
It contains a width, it contains a color,
right, and it contains a style.

176
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.900
So I'm sort of breaking
these out individually now.

177
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.031
So I'm saying that I want cyan borders and

178
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:45.580
I want the border style to be solid.

179
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.510
Now why would I do this?

180
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.716
I'm leaving out the width, right?

181
00:11:50.716 --> 00:11:52.931
Why would I do this?

182
00:11:52.931 --> 00:11:55.739
&gt;&gt; You want different widths depending
on what side of the box it is.

183
00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:58.765
&gt;&gt; I may want different widths depending
on what side of the box it is.

184
00:11:58.765 --> 00:12:01.373
And ultimately with these boxes,
what am I gonna do?

185
00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:03.453
&gt;&gt; I only want part of the box.

186
00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.868
&gt;&gt; I only want part of the box,

187
00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:08.580
I'm only gonna turn on two
of the four borders, right?

188
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.986
And I'm gonna control that
through my border width property.

189
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.830
Okay, so always I want it to be cyan and
I want it to be solid.

190
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.945
But I can say by using my border width
property I can control exactly where it's

191
00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:23.450
gonna show up, make sense?

192
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.700
Awesome, okay?

193
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.657
And let's see, then we want a little
bit of margin ultimately again it's not

194
00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:35.181
really gonna show much here right now.

195
00:12:35.181 --> 00:12:40.440
But we want a little bit of margin between
these inner boxes and the album, right?

196
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.030
So we have a little bit of space to
see the double corner, makes sense?

197
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.616
So we're gonna say margin 0.25 rim,

198
00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:55.829
Okay, So

199
00:12:55.829 --> 00:13:00.525
now, for each of the individual boxes,
we can get specific about it.

200
00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:05.560
So we'll start with .album::before.

201
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.267
And what we're gonna say here about
before is now we use those top left right

202
00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:13.480
bottom properties to position it in space.

203
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.905
So we're gonna tell this
one to go to top 0,

204
00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:25.360
right: 0,
See I went on over there to that corner.

205
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:33.562
And now we can say we want
our border width to be 1px,

206
00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:38.494
1px, 0 0, or 2 pixels, right?

207
00:13:38.494 --> 00:13:40.962
Sort of depends on what
effect you're looking for.

208
00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:44.237
Top right, bottom left.

209
00:13:44.237 --> 00:13:46.910
So there's top and right, makes sense?

210
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.378
How cool is that?

211
00:13:48.378 --> 00:13:49.136
&gt;&gt; That's cool.

212
00:13:49.136 --> 00:13:52.220
&gt;&gt; That is a pretty awesome little trick.

213
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.030
Smoking hot, right?

214
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.528
And it's happening down here
on the other box as well,

215
00:13:56.528 --> 00:13:59.190
right, cuz we're putting
this on our album class.

216
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.170
So now anything with that album class will
wind up with these double border corners.

217
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.020
Okay, so we're gonna continue on here,

218
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.314
copy that style, and
we'll put it down here.

219
00:14:11.314 --> 00:14:15.971
And we're gonna change
this to album::after and

220
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:21.450
it will have a bottom of 0 and
it will have a right of 0.

221
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:28.795
And this time it the border wits
will be 0 2 pixels, 2pixels 0.

222
00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:34.620
So that pushes that border down
to the lower right hand corner.

223
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.246
Now we'll do our next one.

224
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.506
.album greater than

225
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:48.958
:first-child::before, whew!

226
00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.409
What a selector.

227
00:14:52.248 --> 00:14:55.718
So this one will have
similar kind of values here.

228
00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:02.370
And we're going to have it say bottom 0,

229
00:15:07.463 --> 00:15:09.351
Right, 0.

230
00:15:11.404 --> 00:15:14.488
I know what I did,
this one should be top right.

231
00:15:14.488 --> 00:15:17.077
There we go, top right and
the other one is bottom right.

232
00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:22.415
It probably doesn't really matter
what order you do these in except,

233
00:15:22.415 --> 00:15:23.599
you know what?

234
00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:27.154
Let's just leave it,
we'll make this one the top.

235
00:15:27.154 --> 00:15:30.631
And this will be?

236
00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:35.236
&gt;&gt; Top left to 2 0 0, right?

237
00:15:36.362 --> 00:15:37.580
Did it work?

238
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.950
&gt;&gt; That's the same as the first one now.

239
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.367
&gt;&gt; That's the same as the first one.

240
00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:43.399
It is, yep, okay?

241
00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:50.913
Good i, bottom left,
that's what I need bottom Left.

242
00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:56.091
Did it go?

243
00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:57.327
Yeah, there it is.

244
00:15:57.327 --> 00:16:00.093
And now we need 0 0 2 2, right?

245
00:16:08.473 --> 00:16:09.510
There we go.

246
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.131
And then our last one,

247
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.439
.album &gt; :first-child::after.

248
00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:25.151
And this will be our, what are we missing?

249
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:25.902
&gt;&gt; Top left.

250
00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:30.633
&gt;&gt; Top left, Top left,

251
00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:35.337
and this will be 2 0 0 2.

252
00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:48.994
Sweet, how cool is that?

253
00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:51.691
Okay, so
what if we want those borders longer?

254
00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:54.936
What could we do to make them longer or
shorter?

255
00:16:54.936 --> 00:16:56.099
What would we do?

256
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.287
&gt;&gt; Change the size.

257
00:16:57.287 --> 00:17:00.010
&gt;&gt; Change the size, right?

258
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.860
Do they have to be the same size?

259
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.710
Do they have to both be 40 pixels or
whatever, 20 pixels, 60 pixels?

260
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.170
No, we could make them different sizes,
right?

261
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:15.874
We could make one that's 4 pixels wide and
and 40 pixels high, right?

262
00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:18.110
I don't know why you do that,
but you could, right?

263
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.680
Now here we've got little lines
over here on the side instead.

264
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.798
So you could change the color, right?

265
00:17:27.798 --> 00:17:30.125
So you could have one
border that's one color and

266
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:32.290
one border that's the other color, right?

267
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.740
You could admit,
change the styles in all those corners.

268
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.590
You could round them.

269
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.890
There are so many things you could do.

270
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.114
Yeah, okay?

271
00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:47.088
So this is just setting you up with a nice
little chunk of code here that you can

272
00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:50.762
now take and
adapt to all kinds of other designs, yeah?

273
00:17:50.762 --> 00:17:51.709
Super fun.

274
00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:52.696
Yes.

275
00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:55.525
&gt;&gt; I just wanna make sure I understand.

276
00:17:55.525 --> 00:18:00.567
So you're using the first-child before and
after just to get two more boxes

277
00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:02.076
&gt;&gt; Just to get two more boxes

278
00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:03.473
&gt;&gt; You could do the second-child and

279
00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:05.165
I'd work the same
&gt;&gt; You could potentially

280
00:18:05.165 --> 00:18:06.589
do the second child and so forth.

281
00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:11.215
But as Jason was saying, in order for
this to trick to work at all,

282
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:15.020
Well, the album box itself
has to have some content.

283
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.243
So there's always gonna be a first-child.

284
00:18:19.243 --> 00:18:21.153
&gt;&gt; I see.
&gt;&gt; We don't know if there will ever be

285
00:18:21.153 --> 00:18:21.893
a second child.

286
00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:25.970
[LAUGH] So
that's why we set it up this way.

287
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.856
That's a great question,
I'm glad you asked that.
