1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.318
So, now we're gonna move
on to our desktop layout.

2
00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:14.249
And to remind you what that looks like,
Here we are.

3
00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.711
Okay, so we've got our mobile layout,
we've got our tablet layout.

4
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.024
Now we're going to our desktop layout.

5
00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:26.728
Does anyone have any ideas about how
we might lay out our desktop layout?

6
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.502
&gt;&gt; You could use a single column grid or

7
00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:38.530
you could use a flex with
a direction of column.

8
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.873
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's two possibilities.

9
00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.777
So we could do a grid-based layout.

10
00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:46.651
We just have one column,
we have a whole bunch of rows.

11
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.701
And then maybe we'd play
around with some padding or

12
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:53.386
something to push those images over,
that's one way to do it.

13
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.845
We could do it with Flexbox, maybe.

14
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.317
Okay, and I'm gonna give you a third
possibility of how you could

15
00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:10.719
go about doing this because not everything
requires Flexbox or Grid, okay?

16
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.389
So, let's look at a third
possible way of doing this.

17
00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:17.024
So, I'm gonna make my
screen a little bit bigger.

18
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:26.367
Okay, I'm gonna try to get it
out to at least 1000 pixels.

19
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:32.732
All right, and you can watch to your
little number down there at the bottom of

20
00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:35.761
the code pen,
it will tell you how big that window is.

21
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.016
So make sure it's big enough to see
the styles that we're about to add.

22
00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.922
All right, that'll end our media query,

23
00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:51.042
we don't wanna take the last
bracket there that ends our layer.

24
00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:55.571
We're going to add another
media query @media and

25
00:01:55.571 --> 00:02:00.003
then this will be
min-width of 1000 pixels.

26
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.362
Okay, so here's one possibility for you.

27
00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:11.289
And as I said, there's nothing
wrong with working with Grid,

28
00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.566
with working with Flexbox,
that's all great.

29
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.790
But I wanna show you this as well because
sometimes this is a cool way to do things

30
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.680
depending on what else you
have going on in your site.

31
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.261
So, for my reviews class,
we can simply turn off Flexbox and Grid.

32
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:32.621
And the way to do that is
just say display: block.

33
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:36.437
Once you do that, it will go horizontal or

34
00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:41.133
vertical for you right into a column,
there it is.

35
00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:46.422
They just stack on top of each other
automatically just like that, okay?

36
00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:48.124
So, super simple.

37
00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:51.358
And then we can set a width for this.

38
00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:58.575
And 200 pixels is wide enough to give
us kind of what we're looking for here.

39
00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:00.705
Now, what happened, of course?

40
00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:04.775
Why did my first review there,
why did that look so crazy?

41
00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:07.047
Why did these reviews all look different?

42
00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:08.154
What's going on here?

43
00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:12.017
&gt;&gt; The padding.

44
00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.673
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the padding, right?

45
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:18.397
Cuz we put padding on the tablet,
it continues to apply here at the desktop.

46
00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:23.269
So, the first thing we might
wanna do there is we need to list

47
00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.326
all of those selectors.

48
00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:31.395
So .reviews, figure:

49
00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:37.757
first-of-type [LAUGH].

50
00:03:37.757 --> 00:03:41.813
We're gonna list them all,

51
00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:50.100
.reviews figure:nth-of-type(2), .reviews.

52
00:03:53.207 --> 00:04:01.025
Figure:nth-of-type(3),

53
00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:03.992
.reviews.

54
00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:10.041
Figure:last-of-type

55
00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:22.168
Padding: 1rem; So, we'll make them
all have the same amount of padding.

56
00:04:25.837 --> 00:04:30.570
&gt;&gt; Could you write that as nth of type n?

57
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.986
&gt;&gt; You might be able to, sure.

58
00:04:32.986 --> 00:04:35.284
So, let's try that.

59
00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:38.458
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; I think this is clear because now we

60
00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.698
know we're overriding,
all those things that we wrote, but

61
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.268
your shorthand may be
a wonderful way to do this.

62
00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:45.215
So let's try that.

63
00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:54.454
So this is .reviews figure(:)
you want nth of type n.

64
00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:55.886
In other words, all of them, right?

65
00:04:58.609 --> 00:05:03.909
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can put small equations
inside of those parentheses in there.

66
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:04.855
&gt;&gt; Right.

67
00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:09.906
&gt;&gt; And the type will basically
calculate whatever that equation is and

68
00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:14.692
attribute all of the matching elements and
apply the selector or

69
00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:18.256
rather the property value
to those selectors.

70
00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:19.087
&gt;&gt; Right.

71
00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:20.177
&gt;&gt; Nice.

72
00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:22.807
&gt;&gt; So there's a shorthand for you.

73
00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:25.274
Let's just apply it to all of those.

74
00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:27.621
Either one is absolutely fine.

75
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:30.839
Whatever improves your understanding and
is clearer,

76
00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.376
that is absolutely what
you should go with.

77
00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:37.925
But that is a very sweet little
shorthand there, isn't it?

78
00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:44.273
Okay, either one of those works great and
achieves the same effect.

79
00:05:44.273 --> 00:05:49.577
Okay, so that looks pretty good,
our only problem now is we need

80
00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:54.703
to push those those images out
of the box a little bit, right?

81
00:05:54.703 --> 00:05:57.376
Does anyone have any idea how
we might go about doing that?

82
00:05:57.376 --> 00:06:02.687
So, we're talking about .featured-image,
okay?

83
00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:05.466
So let's try some of those things.

84
00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:08.136
Margin-, what?

85
00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:08.938
Left or right?

86
00:06:11.874 --> 00:06:14.913
&gt;&gt; Left
&gt;&gt; Left, and

87
00:06:14.913 --> 00:06:19.785
we'd say something like -1.5 rem.

88
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.291
Okay, cool, very close, very, very close.

89
00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:34.144
But what we're looking for is we're gonna
have a gap over here on the side too.

90
00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:37.964
So, what else could we do?

91
00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.443
&gt;&gt; Relative positioning.

92
00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:41.418
&gt;&gt; Aah, relative positioning!

93
00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:44.043
That's an idea, yeah?

94
00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:50.825
So, if I said position, you guys
familiar with relative positioning?

95
00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:52.096
This is craziness.

96
00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:54.608
So, let's just do it this way.

97
00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:55.947
Position: relative.

98
00:06:55.947 --> 00:07:00.893
All right, now, nothing is gonna
happen initially cuz we haven't

99
00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:06.113
told it what to do yet, other than we
just set up the relative position.

100
00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:10.377
Anytime you see that,
what is the question you should ask?

101
00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:16.057
&gt;&gt; Relative to what?

102
00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:16.897
&gt;&gt; Relative to what?

103
00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:18.020
[LAUGH] That's your million dollar
consulting question, relative to what?

104
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.405
What this will do is it will go
back through your HTML hierarchy to

105
00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:28.407
the closest element that has
a position other than static.

106
00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:31.892
Great, what would that be, okay?

107
00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:37.202
Cuz basically, static is the default
position for all of your HTML elements.

108
00:07:37.202 --> 00:07:44.762
So, if we look at our HTML here,
everything has a static position, okay?

109
00:07:44.762 --> 00:07:49.844
So, if we want and I just made my
screen smaller so it switched.

110
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:53.639
So if we want those images
to be relative to something,

111
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:58.350
maybe we wanna go back to our aside
with the class of reviews, okay?

112
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.512
So to set this up.

113
00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:04.621
We might go back to our side.

114
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:09.664
I'm actually gonna put it cuz we can
just put it in our desktop style here.

115
00:08:09.664 --> 00:08:13.658
And we could say position: relative here.

116
00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:20.809
So, our featured images will
refer back to our reviews for

117
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:23.789
a relative, sort of, anchor point.

118
00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:29.049
And then we can say,

119
00:08:29.049 --> 00:08:33.073
right: 1.5

120
00:08:33.073 --> 00:08:38.032
rem; and whoops!

121
00:08:38.032 --> 00:08:39.675
I did put it on the wrong thing sorry,
[LAUGH].

122
00:08:39.675 --> 00:08:44.654
Not the reviews,
gotta put it on the image right here.

123
00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:50.345
Right: 1.5 rem; there we go.

124
00:08:52.263 --> 00:08:55.872
And that will pull your images right
out of the box just like that and

125
00:08:55.872 --> 00:08:59.302
give you that little bit of space,
so it pulled it to the right.

126
00:08:59.302 --> 00:09:04.171
So the key here with relative
positioning is that you can

127
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.626
move this image around
anywhere on the screen, but

128
00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:13.201
the space that the image
occupied will stay, okay?

129
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:18.166
As opposed to absolute positioning,
which you may have heard of,

130
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:20.925
so if I said absolutely position it.

131
00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:27.266
Look at the difference here, here we've
pulled the images out of the normal flow.

132
00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:32.108
We still pulled them over by the side,
but all of those reviews, the quotes,

133
00:09:32.108 --> 00:09:35.702
they collapsed the space that
the images used to occupy.

134
00:09:35.702 --> 00:09:38.381
So, that's what's going on here, okay?

135
00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:44.589
But when we use relative, that space
that the image occupied is preserved.

136
00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:49.232
So, we still get that stack
thing on top of each other.

137
00:09:51.045 --> 00:09:57.661
This is what I mean by there's a lot out
there [LAUGH] for positioning and layouts.

138
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:02.763
This is very old school, positioning
has been around for a long time.

139
00:10:02.763 --> 00:10:06.972
&gt;&gt; With absolute, it's still looking for
the closest relative, right?

140
00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:10.420
&gt;&gt; Closest relative,
closest absolute, closest fixed.

141
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.083
&gt;&gt; Any of those?

142
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:14.601
&gt;&gt; Or sticky, anything,
anything other than static.

143
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:25.434
Okay, so sweet, we now have
this amazing little widget here

144
00:10:25.434 --> 00:10:31.028
that does this whacked out layout
you never thought was possible.

145
00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:35.301
And you wrote all that code and
you actually understand it, yeah?

146
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.113
Yay!

147
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:37.304
[APPLAUSE]
