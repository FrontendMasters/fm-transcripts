1
00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:04.212
We can start to assign these
to the correct grid cells.

2
00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.128
So here's what I'd like for you to do.

3
00:00:06.128 --> 00:00:10.713
I'm gonna give you five minutes, and I'm
going to tell you to see if you can figure

4
00:00:10.713 --> 00:00:14.849
out how exactly you'd assign all of
those things to the right grid cells.

5
00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.897
You have all of
the selectors that are here.

6
00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:23.413
And I'm going to put up our little
drawing here on the screen for

7
00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:26.966
you so that you can count the grid lines.

8
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:31.427
You're gonna need to assign every
single one of those selectors its

9
00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:35.116
location based on the grid-column and
the grid-row.

10
00:00:35.116 --> 00:00:39.438
So I give you five minutes, see if you
can come up with the right numbers for

11
00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.475
that to set up that layout, okay?

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.961
Great, so
hopefully you got those numbers just fine.

13
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:55.164
So here's what we did if you
take a look at that graphic.

14
00:00:55.164 --> 00:01:00.103
So for our first quote here,
we're going to count, so one, two,

15
00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:03.649
three, four, right, that's gonna be four.

16
00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.715
One to four will be this area here for
this first part, and

17
00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.519
one to two will be its row count, okay?

18
00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:15.900
Likewise, over here for our second quote,
it's four, five, six, seven.

19
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.810
So four slash seven for our column count,
and one to two for the correct row.

20
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.065
Likewise, down here on the bottom,

21
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:29.173
they're the same numbers in terms of
columns, one slash four, four slash seven.

22
00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:32.629
But we're gonna work
with rows three to four.

23
00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:37.790
Now for the images in the middle, we have
something a little bit different there.

24
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.243
So for the images in the middle,
I just simply said, grid-column span 2.

25
00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:48.245
And what that means,
is take each one of these images and

26
00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:52.860
just have it span two columns,
whatever those two columns are.

27
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.611
It's more of a relative kind of thing.

28
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.878
So it doesn't start specifically
in any particular place,

29
00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:00.320
doesn't end in a particular place.

30
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.200
But because the images are in this order,
because we've assigned them the same order

31
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.090
property, they line up very nicely
right here in that particular row.

32
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.942
One thing that is missing from our
images is the border around them, so

33
00:02:13.942 --> 00:02:14.933
let's add that.

34
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:22.433
Border of 2px solid var (--white).

35
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.650
That is something that's
missing from that design.

36
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.745
Okay, so
the very last thing we need to do now is,

37
00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:33.686
we need to do a little bit of
alignment here with these quotes.

38
00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.297
Because they're generally
in the right spot, but

39
00:02:36.297 --> 00:02:38.580
it's still not quite pretty, right?

40
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.110
So we need to play with these
a little bit and get them pretty.

41
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.386
So starting with our first quote
here in the figure:first-of-type,

42
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:53.213
I'm gonna add justify-self: end.

43
00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:57.542
And what that will do is take that
quote and pull it over to the right.

44
00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:04.700
So in this particular orientation,
left is the start, right is the end.

45
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.919
And so this will basically write a line or
quote inside of that grid cell.

46
00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.183
So that would mean that for
the one next to it, the best album ever,

47
00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:20.242
what is our justify-self
property gonna be here?

48
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.354
&gt;&gt; Start.

49
00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:25.951
&gt;&gt; Yeah, start So

50
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.535
that'll pull that one over, okay?

51
00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:35.316
And then we can do the same
thing here on the bottom,

52
00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:41.119
justify-self: end, And

53
00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:45.407
justify-self: start.

54
00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:51.400
Okay, all right.

55
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.690
So, I got a couple of
things going on here.

56
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.848
So we're closer to making
those quotes pretty.

57
00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:01.238
We also have an issue with that
border around those images.

58
00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:03.310
See that tiny little gap there?

59
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.170
Let's address that in just a moment.

60
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.904
I do see it, we're gonna get there, but

61
00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:09.150
let's finish up here with
these quotes here first.

62
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.209
Okay, so then the last part of this,
to achieve perfection for

63
00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.926
those particular quotes, what I did was,
I added some padding around them.

64
00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:22.513
And that padding value will be
different for each one of these.

65
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:23.580
And how did I achieve it?

66
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.589
Just trying a whole lot of
things until something worked.

67
00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:30.310
And it got exactly where
I wanted it to be.

68
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.901
So these are the padding values
that I came up with for this.

69
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:42.880
For the first of type, this would be
padding would be 1rem, 5rem, 0, 5rem.

70
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.603
Now I just typed in four values there for
padding.

71
00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:47.690
What is the order there?

72
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.009
Where are those values applied?

73
00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.197
&gt;&gt; Clockwise.

74
00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:56.020
&gt;&gt; Clockwise,
a lot of people think of it as a clock,

75
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.396
so we start at top, right, bottom, left.

76
00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:02.495
If you're a visual person,
that's the thing that you use.

77
00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:06.427
For those of us who
are challenged with clocks,

78
00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:11.258
[LAUGH] what is another way to
remember those four numbers?

79
00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:14.456
Anybody know this one?

80
00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:19.746
Top, right, bottom, left, TRBL.

81
00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:24.939
Remember that and
stay out of trouble, trouble, get it?

82
00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.540
TRBL, cool, all right?

83
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.538
So that's the padding that we applied for
that one.

84
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:34.700
Then we'll apply some padding here for
our second one.

85
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.512
The padding will be 1rem,

86
00:05:38.512 --> 00:05:42.828
3.5rem, 0, 3.5rem.

87
00:05:42.828 --> 00:05:48.143
Again, I wanted them centered
over the middles here.

88
00:05:48.143 --> 00:05:50.865
They have different lengths of letters.

89
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:54.493
Because we've spanned
all of these grid cells,

90
00:05:54.493 --> 00:05:59.723
we have some room to move around, and
this is just what happen to work.

91
00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:04.915
Okay, for the reviews on the bottom,

92
00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:12.228
we've got padding 0, 2.5rem, 1rem, 1rem.

93
00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:19.967
And then for the last one,
it's a padding of 0, 1rem.

94
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.416
Okay, We may actually wanna bring
those over a little bit more.

95
00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:34.336
Let's see.

96
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.837
It's very highly scientific method.

97
00:06:45.837 --> 00:06:49.277
You can just continue to tweak these.

98
00:06:49.277 --> 00:06:53.994
There we go, maybe more like 2 there

99
00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:58.268
on the left and the right, TRBL.

100
00:06:58.268 --> 00:07:00.732
Let's move this one
over a little bit also.

101
00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:09.217
Did it move?

102
00:07:09.217 --> 00:07:11.066
Maybe it is where it is.

103
00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:14.198
Okay, I've probably
reached a maximum there.

104
00:07:14.198 --> 00:07:18.917
&gt;&gt; It's adjusting itself based on the fact
that the starting line in the grid is

105
00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:19.985
off-screen.

106
00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:22.523
So technically there is 3rem there.

107
00:07:22.523 --> 00:07:26.719
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,
that's exactly what's going on, thank you.

108
00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:33.024
So actually if I set that to 0,
that's closer to what I want.

109
00:07:33.024 --> 00:07:34.386
No, no.

110
00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:37.253
&gt;&gt; You just need to
increase it beyond 3rem.

111
00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:42.634
If you did 5 or 6, I think that
would probably be enough of a buffer

112
00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:48.029
to push the threshold beyond
the space that already exists there.

113
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.877
&gt;&gt; Okay.

114
00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:55.042
Okay, well,
I'm gonna leave it there just for now.

115
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:56.410
You guys know how to do this,

116
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.905
you just continue to tweak away until
it looks the way you want it to look.

117
00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:04.600
So the last thing is that little gap
that we have there between the image and

118
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.276
the border at the bottom.

119
00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:11.415
That is caused because I put this border
here on the div that goes around those

120
00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:17.260
images, and that gives us just that tiny
little bit of space there at the bottom.

121
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:23.105
So if we don't want that, if we go,
we'll just end our featured image style.

122
00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:27.847
And to this we'll add .featured-img img.

123
00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:32.827
So we're actually going to apply our
border to the image directly, and

124
00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:37.476
that will resolve that little gap
down there at the bottom, okay?

125
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:44.830
So anyway, if you continue to play around
there with the spacing on those quotes

126
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.278
at the bottom, you will get to perfection
just by changing the padding, okay?

127
00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:51.185
So very, very cool layout there.

128
00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:56.933
We go from our quotes,
we go to our images.

129
00:08:56.933 --> 00:08:58.694
Very spiffy kind of layout there.
