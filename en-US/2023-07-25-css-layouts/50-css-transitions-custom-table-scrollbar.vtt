WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.433
So now is the last part of the problem
that we have, so we have our button,

2
00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.811
our button is doing what we want it to do.

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:11.630
Our table is loading here,
it's doing exactly what we want it to do.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.124
But it's a little bit skinny, we really
would like this a little bit wider so

5
00:00:15.124 --> 00:00:16.934
we can actually read what's in there.

6
00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.721
And we of course have lots of little
styling affordances that we'd

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.990
like to add to this.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.880
So how are we going to
make this container grow?

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.794
So right now we have our main grid,
it set to a width

10
00:00:32.794 --> 00:00:37.708
of 100 and 500 pixels, so 100 pixels for

11
00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:42.525
our button, 500 pixels for
our album cover.

12
00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:47.115
We'd like to have happen is that when
the button is clicked, I want that

13
00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:52.380
column to grow to 300 pixels wide and
so how can we go about doing that?

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.810
Once again, we can swap our classes and
use that same little bit of JavaScript.

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.430
So still on the same button click,
we're gonna swap this class as well.

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.765
And if we go back into our JavaScript,

17
00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:12.132
scroll on down to that,
little bit of a function here and

18
00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:15.524
we'll continue to add to it.

19
00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:24.776
So now we're gonna copy those
same couple of lines of code,

20
00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:30.898
drop that in place and so now what
we wanna do is take our main grid.

21
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:39.373
Main grid, which is where our
grid is declared with the 100,

22
00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:47.650
500 pixel columns and we're gonna change
this to a new class of main-grid-open.

23
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.940
So now we can redeclare the width of our
grid columns with this new CSS class.

24
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.886
Let's go back and do that.

25
00:01:57.184 --> 00:02:02.036
And I could put it right here in
our CSS just after the main grid

26
00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:05.210
class inside of media query here.

27
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.776
So we can say main grid open.

28
00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:19.712
And we're gonna say grid template
columns cuz of course we're

29
00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:24.790
gonna continue to carry down
the styling that we had earlier.

30
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.380
We just need to change what is
actually going to change here.

31
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.970
We'll change this to 300
pixels 500 pixels and

32
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.117
we'll have a max width of 800 pixels,
add them together you get 800 pixels.

33
00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:45.054
So now when we take a look
at our track list and

34
00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:50.797
we click,
you see that our track list gets larger.

35
00:02:50.797 --> 00:02:54.281
And it shifts a little
bit here on the page, so

36
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:59.339
if you watch the header here on
top you'll see that shift happen.

37
00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:04.261
You'll see that that jumps open like that,

38
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:08.128
making the navigation look good.

39
00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:09.059
Okay, great.

40
00:03:11.071 --> 00:03:13.970
So now comes the last little bits of fun,

41
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.390
let us add the extra little
bit of polish that's needed.

42
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.893
In order to really give this sizzle,

43
00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:24.537
now that we've got all of
the elements here in place.

44
00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:30.880
So, the first thing that I'm going to
do is I'm going to do some transitions.

45
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.841
Because as cool as this looks, where it
just sort of pops open and it shows and

46
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:39.174
all of that wouldn't it be
better if it actually had

47
00:03:39.174 --> 00:03:42.120
a little bit of animation with it.

48
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.537
And so, what I'm going to do
then is add here in my CSS,

49
00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:52.460
in a bunch of places I'm gonna
actually add the same line of CSS.

50
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.016
So here under main grid, I am going to say

51
00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:02.530
transition colon, all 0.5 seconds, ease.

52
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.720
So what exactly does that mean?

53
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.001
Well, the transition is we're going
to move from one state to another,

54
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:14.300
we tell it which properties we wanna have
transition and I'm saying all of them.

55
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.677
Just transition absolutely everything,
we could pick specific properties so

56
00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:24.580
for example I could say just grid
template columns or just the max width.

57
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.668
But it says easy enough just to say
all of them in this particular case,

58
00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:32.514
we're gonna do it over half a second and

59
00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:36.240
we're gonna do it via
the ease style of animation.

60
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.193
There's a whole bunch of different ones of
these that are described by various kinds

61
00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:42.430
of keywords.

62
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.655
There is a whole course here at Front End
Masters that goes into animations and

63
00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:47.504
transitions.

64
00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:52.147
That will talk about what's the difference
between Ease and Ease In and Ease Out and

65
00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:53.960
all the rest of them.

66
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.973
I thought this looked fine, so
this is the one that I chose,

67
00:04:56.973 --> 00:05:00.169
please feel free to play around
with all of these transitions,

68
00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.830
it's part of the fun part of
doing a design like this.

69
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.432
So you'll see the impact of this
immediately when I click my button,

70
00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:14.455
now you can see that it sort of
slides nicely there on the page,

71
00:05:14.455 --> 00:05:17.750
just with that little bit of animation.

72
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.435
So let's continue to add
this exact same line here,

73
00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:28.850
we'll put it on main grid.,
we'll put it on main grid open.

74
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.268
So we'll transition that as well
as we go back to our other state.

75
00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:36.472
We can put it on our table.

76
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.967
Whoops, sorry, rephrase.

77
00:05:45.108 --> 00:05:51.805
Let's put it on our button We want our

78
00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:57.508
button to move from its current location
up to the top of the page like that.

79
00:05:57.508 --> 00:06:01.724
So since we're transitioning
everything the background color,

80
00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:05.890
the rotation shows up,
everything shows up there, okay?

81
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.005
We can add that to
the closed state as well.

82
00:06:16.053 --> 00:06:20.695
And that gives us a very nice
polish to the whole thing, so

83
00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:25.047
it opens up very smoothly,
it closes very smoothly,

84
00:06:25.047 --> 00:06:29.805
really add a lot to that
particular design by adding that.

85
00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:34.804
All right, next let's take a look at
that table, it's all smashed up against

86
00:06:34.804 --> 00:06:39.599
the edges of the window here, so
let us take care of that particular issue.

87
00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:47.047
So, I'm going to say .tracklist table and

88
00:06:47.047 --> 00:06:53.488
I worked out the margin here for this,

89
00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:59.135
-4rem 1rem 0.5rem 1rem.

90
00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:03.964
And what this is gonna do obviously with
the negative margin, it'll pull it up

91
00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:08.072
here in space a little bit and
move things around here a little bit.

92
00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:12.840
And then for our last of type notice
that this is getting cut off here

93
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.980
all of the time at the moment.

94
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.840
So we'll fix that as well, so tracklist.

95
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.916
Table TD last of type.

96
00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:33.480
Padding right to REM, so
that will give us a little bit of space.

97
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.232
The scrollbar will sit on top
of this padding space and

98
00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:38.230
the numbers going to appear.

99
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.140
So, click on the tracklist and now you
can read the numbers there as well.

100
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.140
Very, very nice, looking incredibly cool.

101
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.447
The last thing to deal with is
that scroll bar and of course,

102
00:07:50.447 --> 00:07:53.840
this is the default scroll bar
that our browser gives us.

103
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.258
So it shows up white with a gray
bar because I'm on a Mac and

104
00:07:57.258 --> 00:07:59.690
I happen to be looking at this in Chrome.

105
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.115
If I'm looking at it on different
browsers, it will look a little bit

106
00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:06.830
different and again, that's just
coming from your browser styling.

107
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.598
Unfortunately, for
scroll bars at this point in time,

108
00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:14.057
there's not really
a standard that's accepted.

109
00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:18.776
So we're going to have style for
Chrome and will style for

110
00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:23.117
Firefox and so to set that up,
we're gonna do this.

111
00:08:23.117 --> 00:08:28.148
So, we'll say tracklist
double colon hyphen

112
00:08:28.148 --> 00:08:32.792
WebKit hyphen scrollbar and shockingly,

113
00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:37.824
this is for Chrome and
other WebKit browsers.

114
00:08:37.824 --> 00:08:43.501
They will allow you to style this
with a width, which is nice,

115
00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:50.281
so we'll give it a width of 10 pixels,
so it will be a narrow scroll bar.

116
00:08:53.113 --> 00:08:55.268
And that is showing up right there.

117
00:08:57.456 --> 00:09:03.220
We can then say .tracklist double colon

118
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:10.350
hyphen webkit hyphen scroll bar,
hyphen track.

119
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.483
This will give us a color, so

120
00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:20.178
our background color will be var cyan,

121
00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:28.889
So now I have a cyan bar
here instead of white.

122
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.855
And then we can style the actual little,
they call it thumb here,

123
00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:43.580
but the little item that you
use to move it up and down.

124
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.994
And so we'll call this .tracklist,

125
00:09:48.994 --> 00:09:56.437
double colon, hyphen webkit,
hyphen scrollbar,

126
00:09:56.437 --> 00:10:01.516
hyphen track, Hyphen thumb.

127
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.925
And this one will have a box

128
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:19.296
shadow with an inset of 0,

129
00:10:19.296 --> 00:10:23.966
0, 6 pixels, RGBA,

130
00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:27.713
0, 0, 0, 1.

131
00:10:30.173 --> 00:10:35.212
And so what that will do is give us our
scroll bar here, it looks kind of shadowy,

132
00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:40.050
blends in really, really nicely there,
looks pretty cool here on Chrome.

133
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.200
Now, those of you who are following
hereon Firefox are like,

134
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.815
well, my scroll bar
still looks pretty ugly.

135
00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:48.994
Well, scrollbars for

136
00:10:48.994 --> 00:10:54.020
Firefox are actually a lot easier than
what I just went through here for Chrome.

137
00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:00.245
So we can add to this a little comment,
scrollbar for Firefox.

138
00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:05.784
All we have to do is say HTML,
we set it globally,

139
00:11:05.784 --> 00:11:08.490
right at the head of the document.

140
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:14.315
And we'll say our
scrollbar-color is var cyan,

141
00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:20.000
so that'll be the background
of the scroll bar,

142
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.222
and var-gray, that'll be
the thing that moves up and down.

143
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:34.705
And Firefox will not allow you to have
a width associated with your scroll bar in

144
00:11:34.705 --> 00:11:37.235
terms of pixels, as I did before.

145
00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:40.664
But there is a keyword for thin, so

146
00:11:40.664 --> 00:11:45.415
we can just say scroll
bar hyphen width of thin.

147
00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:49.321
So here I am in Firefox just to show
you what this looks like when I

148
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:53.885
click on my tracklist here,
you'll see that I've set up a scroll bar.

149
00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:58.593
I actually give it a gray background and
with the blue scroll widget there,

150
00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:02.867
scrolling up and down on the page,
you could reverse those colors.

151
00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:06.856
You could make the widget gray
with the background of cyan, but

152
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:11.233
again with Firefox are a little bit
more limited as to what you can do.

153
00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:16.293
Notice that my scroll bar over here
on the side for the web page here

154
00:12:16.293 --> 00:12:21.830
in code pen Is also styled as well,
which was not true inside of Chrome.

155
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.778
Okay, so that's all done there.

156
00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:34.751
All right, so at this point, we now
have a wonderful working track list,

157
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:41.550
it collapses on mobile, it shows up here
really nicely in our tablet footprint.

158
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.909
On desktop, it will use the same
footprint which we are going to have

159
00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:49.910
another column of information
that'll be next to this.

160
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.698
So we just have those two states to style,
our mobile state and our tablet state.

161
