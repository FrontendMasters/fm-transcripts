00:00:00.028 --> 00:00:01.975
Welcome everybody to chapter 2.

2
00:00:01.975 --> 00:00:06.675
We are going to start today with
a warm up exercise just for you.

3
00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:10.276
So from practical.css.education,

4
00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:14.862
the course website,
you want to go to chapter 2.

5
00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:16.343
The link is there on the homepage.

6
00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:18.799
Scroll down,
you'll find it on the left side.

7
00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:23.293
And then if you scroll down here
under part 1, establishing colors,

8
00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:27.494
click on the link to the beginning
code pen, which is right here.

9
00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.944
That will open up in a new tab for you.

10
00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:31.951
And this is where we're starting from.

11
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.958
You can fork this code
pen to your own account.

12
00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.590
And then I'll give you some
time to work on this exercise.

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.883
So what I would like for
you to do is the following.

14
00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:48.276
I have set some things up for you here
inside of this webpage as you see.

15
00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:53.127
So to start with here we have a series
of what will eventually be colored

16
00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:57.998
boxes as you can see here they
are called by their various color names.

17
00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:01.484
And they're inside of a div
with a class of colors.

18
00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:06.378
Then we have some type down here,
so headings 1 through 6.

19
00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.395
We have a paragraph, a link.

20
00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:11.305
We have an unordered and

21
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:17.335
an ordered list along with some strongly
emphasized and emphasized text.

22
00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:19.403
I have a block quote.

23
00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:23.024
And we have a figure down here,
and of course the figure has got,

24
00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:25.116
I'll show you what that looks like.

25
00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:27.463
Here's the men of Magenta Lime.

26
00:01:27.463 --> 00:01:28.717
There they are.

27
00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:33.058
And they have a figure caption
that is associated with them.

28
00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:37.567
All right, so basically there is
not a class to be seen except for

29
00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.583
these initial color boxes.

30
00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:44.749
And so the goal here is to start with
a very, very basic page and we're gonna

31
00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.834
set up a bunch of variables that we
are going to use for all of our websites.

32
00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:53.571
And setting up a basic page like
this is an advantage because then we

33
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.453
can set up that basic
styling right from the start.

34
00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:59.248
We're starting at the very base of CSS.

35
00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:03.049
On top of this, we can build all
of our exceptions via classes or

36
00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.941
crazy selectors and
all kinds of other things.

37
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:06.656
But right now,

38
00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:09.791
we wanna get our base styling that
we're gonna use most of the time.

39
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:12.418
We wanna set that all up and
get it in place.

40
00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:16.590
So what I'd like for
you guys to do first is the following.

41
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.311
And I'll give this to
you as a comment here.

42
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:24.716
So first of all, one,

43
00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:29.019
I want you to establish these

44
00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.049
colors as CSS global variables.

45
00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.185
Think about that for a minute.

46
00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:37.362
Do you know what a variable is in CSS?

47
00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:38.605
Do you know how to establish it?

48
00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:42.942
Do you know how to make it quote global,
think about that for a moment and

49
00:02:42.942 --> 00:02:44.689
then I'll take questions.

50
00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:52.122
And then second, I would like you to
display these colors in a series,

51
00:02:55.315 --> 00:03:01.939
Of small boxes, and I'm gonna recommend
that you make them 3 rem by 3 rem.

52
00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:08.709
If you don't know what a rem is,
ask me and I'll explain rem to you.

53
00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.926
One color per box.

54
00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:18.994
And then, Put all of

55
00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:24.555
those color boxes in a row.

56
00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:31.853
With a 1 rem gap between.

57
00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:34.275
And I think those instructions are,

58
00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:39.990
when you're done you should have basically
a series of boxes that'll look like that.

59
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.541
The rest of these won't be done yet but

60
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:47.422
I want you to set up your color boxes
such that they look like that, okay?

61
00:03:50.873 --> 00:03:55.442
&gt;&gt; How do you declare
a global CSS property?

62
00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:58.959
&gt;&gt; I love it,
how do you declare a global CSS property?

63
00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.933
Wonderful question, let's start with that.

64
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:06.757
So here inside of your CSS,
I'm gonna address that in just a second.

65
00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:09.893
Notice that we have a little
bit of CSS here by default.

66
00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:13.329
Anybody know what this CSS is here?

67
00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.600
What is the CSS that you see here?

68
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.831
&gt;&gt; It's creating a barter box so that,
my understanding is that padding and

69
00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:24.708
margin don't cause the size
of the box to change.

70
00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.500
&gt;&gt; Correct, absolutely right.

71
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.932
Yes, though the border box,

72
00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:30.754
we've talked about this many
times before in my courses.

73
00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:35.978
This is such that when we start to
add padding and margin to our boxes,

74
00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:40.677
they don't get bigger on the page and
then break our layouts.

75
00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:43.545
So anytime you're working inside of CSS,

76
00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:48.976
this little incantation should start at
the beginning of your document, okay?

77
00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:50.938
By default, this does not happen.

78
00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:53.883
By default, as you add padding and margin,

79
00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:59.303
boxes get bigger because width property
is defined by the width of your content.

80
00:04:59.303 --> 00:05:01.431
So this is really critical.

81
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:04.465
You can just copy and
paste that anytime you want.

82
00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:05.479
It's called border box.

83
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.855
If you just google for border box,

84
00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.185
you'll find somebody who'll
give you this little snip.

85
00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:13.418
All right, so once that is,
that little bit of code is for,

86
00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:17.241
then how do we declare these
quote global variables?

87
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:21.219
We're going to start with
the root pseudo class.

88
00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.465
So root, :root.

89
00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:26.481
It's a pseudo class.

90
00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:28.978
Why root instead of HTML?

91
00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:32.084
Anybody have an idea why
root instead of HTML?

92
00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:36.447
Okay, so HTML is an element, right?

93
00:05:36.447 --> 00:05:38.896
Is there a before or an after on HTML?

94
00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:45.724
Are there nodes that come before and
after HTML?

95
00:05:45.724 --> 00:05:48.058
Just like their nodes
on every HTML element.

96
00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:52.308
There's a before and an after,
trust me on this, that is, in fact, true.

97
00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:55.816
So when we go to route,
we're going to select everything.

98
00:05:55.816 --> 00:05:57.330
What is another reason?

99
00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:05.593
&gt;&gt; You're allowed to pull them into other
selectors as opposed to them being nested

100
00:06:05.593 --> 00:06:07.402
inside of a particular selector.

101
00:06:07.402 --> 00:06:12.391
&gt;&gt; Exactly, you can pull these from root
into any part of your web page, right?

102
00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:15.202
That is sort of the definition of root.

103
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:20.805
What is the specificity of root as
opposed to an HTML element selector?

104
00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:26.881
&gt;&gt; Well, pseudo classes as a whole
are normally less specific than a class,

105
00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:29.698
but more specific than a tag
&gt;&gt; Close,

106
00:06:29.698 --> 00:06:33.589
they're exactly the same
specificity as a class, okay.

107
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:37.107
Pseudo classes and classes have
the same level of specificity.

108
00:06:37.107 --> 00:06:41.345
They take priority over an HTML
element like HTML or body or

109
00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:44.636
paragraph or
any of the rest of them, right?

110
00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:47.766
And since so many of us use so
many classes in our designs,

111
00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:51.692
it may be good to start with something
that is of a similar specificity.

112
00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:55.170
Yes, okay, so we're gonna use root.

113
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.212
Now we're gonna use this
to declare some variables.

114
00:06:57.212 --> 00:07:03.024
How do we declare a variable in CSS,
anybody?

115
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:03.829
&gt;&gt; Dash dash.

116
00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:07.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the name right.

117
00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:12.604
So I am super creative and
break all rules by calling my colors but

118
00:07:12.604 --> 00:07:16.396
the actual color that we're representing.

119
00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:18.438
We don't have to worry
about ever changing them.

120
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.948
In real life, usually you wanna
call these colors by whatever,

121
00:07:21.948 --> 00:07:25.007
primary colors, secondary color,
that kinda thing.

122
00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:30.181
So you don't wind up with a color called
lime, that is purple [LAUGH] right?

123
00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:33.845
But we're gonna start here with lime and

124
00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:38.062
the color from your
webpage will be A4FFA2.

125
00:07:38.062 --> 00:07:40.620
Okay, so that's how we declare it.

126
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.120
Notice nothing has changed on my page.

127
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.486
How do I actually apply this
variable to my webpage?

128
00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:50.013
&gt;&gt; You put it somewhere,
you assign it to an element or something.

129
00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:52.185
&gt;&gt; Exactly,
we have to assign it somewhere.

130
00:07:52.185 --> 00:07:56.256
This is just like in JavaScript
where you declare a variable.

131
00:07:56.256 --> 00:07:59.858
Good times, that's great, but
it just hangs out there and is,

132
00:07:59.858 --> 00:08:01.868
it doesn't actually do anything.

133
00:08:01.868 --> 00:08:04.440
Same idea here, so we need to apply it.

134
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.815
So what we'll do is we can
create a class called lime

135
00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:10.574
because we're super creative that way.

136
00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:15.132
And we can say background color of var,

137
00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:18.734
this is how we call it var lime.

138
00:08:20.822 --> 00:08:26.204
Okay, Now notice

139
00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:34.074
that we do have a div with
a class of lime here, right?

140
00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:37.556
So the HTML exists, it has a class on it.

141
00:08:37.556 --> 00:08:42.576
And we've created a style here
that corresponds with that div.

142
00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:45.368
But I don't see anything on this webpage,
why is that?

143
00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:50.779
&gt;&gt; The div is empty, there's no content
&gt;&gt; The div has no content, it is empty.

144
00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:54.302
So it will just not show [LAUGH].

145
00:08:54.302 --> 00:08:57.968
If we started typing in it, hello,

146
00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:02.503
something will show up
here on our web page.

147
00:09:02.503 --> 00:09:04.335
There it is, right?

148
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:08.586
But because there is nothing in that div,
it will not show here on the web page.

149
00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:12.760
How do we get around this
problem if we want no content?

150
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.222
&gt;&gt; Set a width and a height.

151
00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:16.963
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and
we're gonna set a width and a height.

152
00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:19.403
And so a great way to do this.

153
00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:23.623
Those of you who are fan of wacky
selectors, here's a nice way to do it.

154
00:09:23.623 --> 00:09:29.707
We're gonna say .colors &gt; *.

155
00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:30.800
What does that mean?

156
00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:36.717
Colors &gt; *.

157
00:09:36.717 --> 00:09:41.002
Remember that we write our
selectors from left to right but

158
00:09:41.002 --> 00:09:43.367
we read them from right to left.

159
00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:45.402
Read them from right to left.

160
00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:47.724
So what does star mean?

161
00:09:47.724 --> 00:09:48.361
&gt;&gt; Anything?

162
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:50.150
&gt;&gt; Anything at all, right?

163
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.331
&gt;&gt; What does that greater than sign mean?

164
00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:53.417
&gt;&gt; Direct descendants.

165
00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:56.022
&gt;&gt; Direct descendants.

166
00:09:56.022 --> 00:09:59.569
Okay, so that might be new to some of you,
direct descendants.

167
00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:04.565
So in other words, lime, magenta,
magenta 50, white, tan, teal, cyan, black.

168
00:10:04.565 --> 00:10:09.953
All of those are direct descendants
of that outside div called colors.

169
00:10:09.953 --> 00:10:14.623
Which we call here so we're saying all of
those descendants, we wanna do something.

170
00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:19.221
What could we do with 3 rem?

171
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:21.612
Height 3 rem?

172
00:10:21.612 --> 00:10:25.772
Yeah, we did that.

173
00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:28.453
We made a box.

174
00:10:28.453 --> 00:10:35.436
Where did that giant space just come from?

175
00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:37.532
&gt;&gt; Are they arranged vertically right now,
all the divs?

176
00:10:37.532 --> 00:10:39.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
all those divs are arranged vertically.

177
00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:41.811
Andrew, you're burning it up here.

178
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:44.120
Awesome, yeah, those are all those divs.

179
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.384
They're right on top of each other, yep.

180
00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:50.217
Okay, so
now that you know those sorts of basics,

181
00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.858
I'm gonna turn you loose
on the rest of these.

182
00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:57.481
Set up some more variables,
okay, so set up those variables,

183
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:01.772
just like I said here, and
then display those on the page.

184
00:11:01.772 --> 00:11:06.148
Those will be a series of boxes, and
then make them go in a row, all right?

185
00:11:10.217 --> 00:11:12.544
All right, so how did that go?

186
00:11:12.544 --> 00:11:18.001
Did everybody get something similar
to what you see on my screen here?

187
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:19.978
Maybe you have sort of a missing hole.

188
00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:22.584
That's because you have a white
box on a white background.

189
00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:27.804
I put a little border on mine just so you
can see that it's actually there, okay?

190
00:11:27.804 --> 00:11:33.425
So for anybody who got stuck, let's
just take a quick look at the code here.

191
00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:38.382
In the CSS, we have our root declarations
as are all the colors that came from

192
00:11:38.382 --> 00:11:40.635
the website that I told you about.

193
00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:46.355
And then I have all of my individual
declarations for all of those classes.

194
00:11:46.355 --> 00:11:49.331
Like I said, I put a border
around the white box just so

195
00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:52.321
that we can see that there
is in fact something there.

196
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:55.916
And then we made this
display using Flexbox.

197
00:11:55.916 --> 00:12:02.422
So we simply took colors,
why did I take colors?

198
00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:06.644
Why did I take colors here to display for
Flexbox?

199
00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:08.735
Anybody know?

200
00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:10.733
&gt;&gt; Put flux on the parent?

201
00:12:10.733 --> 00:12:16.284
&gt;&gt; Right, so all about parents and
children all about containers and items.

202
00:12:16.284 --> 00:12:20.778
I'll only say that 1,000 times
in the next two days, okay?

203
00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:24.358
So colors is the container or
the parent right for

204
00:12:24.358 --> 00:12:27.512
all of those individual divs inside of it.

205
00:12:27.512 --> 00:12:32.365
So the parent is where we're
going to put a display flex or

206
00:12:32.365 --> 00:12:35.307
eventually display grid, okay?

207
00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:40.158
And then we can say exactly what
we wanna do with that flex.

208
00:12:40.158 --> 00:12:42.560
In this case,
we're going to do a row wrap.

209
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.893
Those are kind of the, well, not wrapped,
but row is a default value so

210
00:12:46.893 --> 00:12:48.998
you actually won't see a change.

211
00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:52.669
And then I put in a gap, gap of 1 rem.

212
00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:54.800
You don't need to do padding or margin.

213
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.360
You can use gap instead.

214
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.316
&gt;&gt; If anyone is confused about magenta 50,
50 means 50%.

215
00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:03.868
&gt;&gt; Yes, great, good catch, yeah,

216
00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:08.804
what is this magenta 50 thing and
this weird looking hex number.

217
00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:11.979
Anybody notice that hex had eight digits?

218
00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:16.034
Okay, so this is magenta 50% and

219
00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:20.234
that is the hex code for RGB, right?

220
00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:26.313
Remember those are two digits,
R, two digits G, two digits B.

221
00:13:26.313 --> 00:13:28.551
And then the last two
digits are the alpha.

222
00:13:28.551 --> 00:13:30.997
So this is the same thing as RGBA.

223
00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:33.040
We're just writing it in HEX format now.
