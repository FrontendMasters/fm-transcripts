WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.290
So where are we are at this point,
we've got a page that looks like this.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.270
We've got our colors in place.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.420
We've done our type scale,
we're missing a couple of things.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.400
We need to set our background color
on our body and our text color.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.110
We need to get that set and
we need to set up our font family.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.465
So let's do those three things right now.

7
00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:27.405
What I need to do is make the background
of this webpage I need to

8
00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.080
make it teal color.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.458
Anyone have any idea how I could set
the entire background of this webpage to

10
00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:34.440
the teal color?

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.266
Yes.

12
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.322
&gt;&gt; Use a body selector.

13
00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:42.070
&gt;&gt; Exactly,
we're gonna use our body selector.

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.970
So we'll scroll on down to find
our body selector here it is.

15
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.899
And we will give this a background

16
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.301
color of var(""teal) and

17
00:00:55.301 --> 00:01:00.490
that should set it to this color.

18
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.337
Now if I wanted to change all of
the colors of the text here all together,

19
00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.080
how would I go about doing that?

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.115
In one single declaration How
can I change the color for

21
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:15.162
everything that's here on this page?

22
00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:16.590
&gt;&gt; In the body.

23
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.680
&gt;&gt; In the body?

24
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.753
Yep, you can set it right
here color is var(""white),

25
00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:30.998
everything changes Whoops,
type the right thing.

26
00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:36.070
Everything changes, Except for one thing.

27
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.653
What didn't change?

28
00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:38.642
&gt;&gt; The link.

29
00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:39.880
&gt;&gt; Why didn't the link change?

30
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.810
&gt;&gt; It's defined by pseudo classes.

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.303
&gt;&gt; It is definitely
defined by pseudo classes,

32
00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:51.370
but where does that blue
underline style come from?

33
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.182
&gt;&gt; Text decoration.

34
00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:56.260
&gt;&gt; Text decoration is part of it
that's responsible for the underline.

35
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.764
But where does the blue
underline come from?

36
00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:00.264
&gt;&gt; Brower default.

37
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.415
&gt;&gt; It's the browser default, exactly.

38
00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:10.730
So, we need to set up some
link styling as well.

39
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.880
We can set that up here and often that
is just done with the letter A, okay.

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.825
So A is stands for
our anchor for our links and

41
00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:26.740
we can set that up with a color and
I'm going to say var.

42
00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:30.210
I think I said lime.

43
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.750
Maybe I had lifted magenta.

44
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.290
I don't quite remember.

45
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.400
Lime, okay, so there it is.

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.180
You can roll your mouse over it.

47
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.020
Nothing happens.

48
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.522
Should we have a hover state?

49
00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.394
Yeah?

50
00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:51.615
Let's have a hover state, so
we're gonna say a colon hover.

51
00:02:51.615 --> 00:02:55.027
And you want that to go after the A,

52
00:02:55.027 --> 00:03:01.020
always do not put it before the A,
put it after the A.

53
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.230
There's an order for these things in
order for your cascade to work correctly.

54
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:13.093
And so here we can say our
color will be var(""cyan).

55
00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:16.137
It's one of the colors we set up earlier,
and

56
00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:20.640
when you roll your mouse over it,
you'll see that happen.

57
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.330
Now, for those of you accessibility
people looking at this and saying, that

58
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.365
color contrast doesn't look like it quite
squares with accessibility standards,

59
00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:30.320
you are absolutely right, it does not.

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.259
However we will not be using this
link on this particular background.

61
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.614
So don't worry about it right now.

62
00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:45.155
[LAUGH] It will work eventually, and that
is something that you should think about

63
00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:49.097
make sure that you have adequate
contrast between your background and

64
00:03:49.097 --> 00:03:53.665
your link colors, but this is not the
ultimate way we'll be using these colors.

65
00:03:55.595 --> 00:04:00.535
Okay, and then we need to
set up our font family here.

66
00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:02.765
Remember, we had said we
were going to use poppins.

67
00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:06.485
And I'm gonna go through this process with
you because we're doing this in CodePen.

68
00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.515
I'm sure most of you know how
to do this with Google Fonts.

69
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.940
You go in, you get a little bit of code,
you drop your code in.

70
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.306
The fonts apply.

71
00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:19.750
But we're a little bit different
here in inside of Code Pen.

72
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.610
So let's go through this.

73
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.422
We're gonna go to fonts.google.com.

74
00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:30.520
And we can search for our font,
which is called Poppins.

75
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.405
Okay, and there it is.

76
00:04:38.052 --> 00:04:46.130
And it will show you all the different
types and variations of the Poppins font.

77
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.770
How many of these should I use?

78
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.502
Should I add all of these to my web page?

79
00:04:51.502 --> 00:04:53.420
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.

80
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.250
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily why?

81
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.190
&gt;&gt; Because they're different
styles like extra lighter light.

82
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.300
So if you only want some of them,
you only need to import some of them.

83
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.220
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, if I'm only using some of
them, I should load only some of them.

84
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.940
But why?

85
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.390
Why wouldn't I just load them all?

86
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.040
Especially if I don't quite
know what I'm gonna do.

87
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess if you wouldn't use them,
it's not really necessary.

88
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.626
&gt;&gt; Right?
If you're not gonna use them,

89
00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:24.740
it's not necessarily and all of these have
a file size associated with them, right?

90
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.938
So if you stack them all up, then you
wind up degrading the performance of your

91
00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:32.118
webpage, so we only want to
use the ones we're gonna use.

92
00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:35.095
In this case, we are going to use light.

93
00:05:35.095 --> 00:05:37.630
So Light 300, we can select that.

94
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.497
Just click on the little link over here,
it'll add it over here on the side,

95
00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:46.830
and we are going to use 600 semi-bold.

96
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.789
So down here, normally we'd either
use the link or the ad import and

97
00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.410
you would copy this code
into your web page.

98
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.570
But we're in Codepen, so there is
a different way of doing this for CodePen.

99
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.700
What I want you to do is in the third
item here, where it's the last link.

100
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.933
So there's a link with a pre-connect,
a link with a pre-connect, and

101
00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:08.230
then there's a link
here with just an href.

102
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.170
That's the one we want.

103
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.730
You wanna copy the href part of this.

104
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.020
So I'll highlight that and
leave that there for you to see.

105
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.709
You wanna copy just that part of it.

106
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.870
Basically, the things between
the quotes at the href.

107
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.430
In that last link, we're gonna copy that.

108
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.200
And then we're gonna
come back to our CodePen.

109
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.510
And here in our CodePen, we're gonna
go to Settings up here on the top.

110
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.659
We're at CSS here.

111
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.889
Scroll down to External Style Sheets and
Pens, click in the box here underneath,

112
00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.420
not the search box, but
the one that's underneath,

113
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.869
and you can paste in that
URL that you copied, okay.

114
00:06:57.762 --> 00:07:00.615
So that's under Settings, under CSS, and

115
00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:04.870
then down under add external
style sheets or pens.

116
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:14.663
We paste in that URL,
say Save &amp; Close, And it should apply.

117
00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:16.119
Did it work?

118
00:07:18.317 --> 00:07:21.073
Font looks a little bit different?

119
00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:23.112
Little rounder.

120
00:07:23.112 --> 00:07:25.330
Okay, and why is that?

121
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.325
Why did it just apply?

122
00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:34.540
We actually copied over this
code from our type scale.

123
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.520
It was already set up for us with Poppins.

124
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.640
Okay, so we could leave it like that
if we wanted, but, as you know,

125
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.070
type is something that changes a lot.

126
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.090
So this is another thing that works
really well for adding to our variables.

127
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.460
So let's add a variable.

128
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.230
And I am usually super creative this way.

129
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.680
I call it sans-serif,
because that's what this font is.

130
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.460
It is our sans-serif font.

131
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.652
And we can put in this is Poppins.

132
00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:14.395
,sans-serif.

133
00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:17.710
All right, and then we'll add that here.

134
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.693
Inside of our body element
instead of calling for

135
00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:29.002
pop in san-serif,
we can just say var(""san-serif) saref.

136
00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:33.217
We have just a couple of extra styles
that we wanna set up and apply here.

137
00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:38.099
I am going to add two more
items that we're going to use

138
00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:41.799
momentarily and that is a class of club.

139
00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:47.218
We can set that up here and
we want club anything with

140
00:08:47.218 --> 00:08:52.530
a class of club to have
a font size of 1.25 rem.

141
00:08:54.330 --> 00:09:00.918
Which of my variables should
I use to get 1.25 rem?

142
00:09:00.918 --> 00:09:06.115
H5, right, h5.

143
00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:11.280
So, our font size here will be var h5.

144
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.140
Back in our body element.

145
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:22.210
Something that's always good
to set padding 0, margin 0.

146
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.714
And what this does because some
browsers do it with padding,

147
00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:27.647
some browsers do it with margin.

148
00:09:27.647 --> 00:09:31.798
See how my text is now shoved up
against the edges of my web page here?

149
00:09:31.798 --> 00:09:34.996
Okay, because body has a little
bit of either padding or

150
00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:38.886
margin on it by default, so
we'll just turn that off really quick.

151
00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:43.766
The last thing, it's just a good
practice to set when you are just

152
00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.799
starting to work here on your web pages.

153
00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:51.104
If we made our web page a little
bit smaller here with this image,

154
00:09:51.104 --> 00:09:55.310
notice that it just starts to get cut off,
right?

155
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.880
It's not resizing.

156
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.446
Images are the size that they are.

157
00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:03.930
They don't wrap,they don't change.

158
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.640
They display at whatever
dimensions that they have.

159
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.080
So one of the little hacks,
because it's a hack,

160
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.640
that we can add to this for
images is the following.

161
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.450
We'll just say image, generic images.

162
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:25.600
We're gonna say with 100% max width 100%.

163
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.690
Now ideally you're loading the right
size image for the situation.

164
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.590
So if you wanna a big image,
you're gonna load that big image in, and

165
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.594
if you want a smaller image,
you're gonna load that smaller image in.

166
00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:41.123
But if you want something to be flexible,
file size is relatively small,

167
00:10:41.123 --> 00:10:43.400
this is how we make a flexible image.

168
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.430
See how that works?

169
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.360
Now that image will flex.

170
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.732
So this is another little bit of code that
you can just drop in any web page that you

171
00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:54.080
put together.

172
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.104
So that your images are flexible for
responsive design, and

173
00:10:57.104 --> 00:10:58.830
it doesn't all in one fell swoop.

174
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.650
And then you can make adjustments for
those images a little bit later.

175
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.267
So let me point out to you
that from the web page,

176
00:11:05.267 --> 00:11:09.800
we should have worked through pretty much
everything that's here at this point.

177
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.818
If you scroll to, right here,
I've got it highlighted,

178
00:11:13.818 --> 00:11:18.330
just before the picture,
there is a link for the ending CodePen.

179
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.730
You can take a look at that ending
CodePen, that is the way your code should

180
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.370
be looking when we are done with this,
which we are.
