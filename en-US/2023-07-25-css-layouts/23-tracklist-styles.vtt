1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.487
All right, let's move on then.

2
00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:08.679
So that was our album,
let's make another layer,

3
00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.802
and I'm gonna call this the tracklist.

4
00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.012
Because that's what this is,
it's a tracklist.

5
00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:22.178
Okay, so
our track list is gonna look like this.

6
00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:27.421
Anybody have any suggestions,
how should we start?

7
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:35.719
And, I recommend that we start
on the outside and work in.

8
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:36.768
&gt;&gt; So let's start with the table.

9
00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:40.678
&gt;&gt; So we'll start with the table,
great place to start, table.

10
00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:44.723
Table, okay?

11
00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:48.951
So one of the things I'd recommend that
you do, since we have our box on the top,

12
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.050
we gave it a max width of 500 pixels,
let's do the same for our table.

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.681
Max width.

14
00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:00.130
500 pixels, okay?

15
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.570
But we'll say our width 100%.

16
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.927
So why would we do both of those things?

17
00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:10.905
The widths a hundred percent but
the max width is 500 pixels,

18
00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.130
does that make any sense?

19
00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:17.871
&gt;&gt; So from a breakpoint standpoint,

20
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:23.511
if you're on mobile it's always gonna span
a hundred percent of the viewport width.

21
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:24.521
&gt;&gt; Right.

22
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.893
&gt;&gt; But it cannot extend beyond 500 pixels.

23
00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:30.847
&gt;&gt; Correct, right?

24
00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:33.388
So it can't go past 500 pixels, but

25
00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:37.637
it can occupy all of the space up
to that point in time, all right.

26
00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:38.706
What should we do now?

27
00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:44.935
Center it, we need to center it, right?

28
00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:50.206
So, it'll look nice under that box,
so our margin is 0 auto again.

29
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.259
Okay, good.

30
00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.451
Let's see, in our design.

31
00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:12.200
The track numbers here that specific row,
the song name that specific row,

32
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.620
the time that's our sarafan,
Qumran Garamond, right?

33
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.920
And this across the top,
the heading that is poppins.

34
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.108
So since we use Pacific go on to things,

35
00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:28.625
let's set that up as our
default font here on the table.

36
00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:33.767
So I'm going to set my font family,
to var cursive and

37
00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:39.273
then we can override that font
family a little bit later on

38
00:02:41.823 --> 00:02:45.391
Actually, it looks pretty
good already right, okay.

39
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040
All right,
one last thing that we need to add.

40
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.040
Now, in the table by default, if you go
back to the bad old days of the web in

41
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.388
the beginning, there was always, if you
put it actually I'll show it to you.

42
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:07.729
If in the table HTML, you put in a border,
I think it was border is 1.

43
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.280
Does that work,
yeah border equals 1, you get this.

44
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.330
Anybody vibing back to the 90s,
yeah cuz it was everywhere, right?

45
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.357
So, modern browsers don't
display that anymore, but

46
00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:23.676
the space for it is still there.

47
00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:28.472
No okay, so let me take out
that border one, all right so

48
00:03:28.472 --> 00:03:31.650
remember that space is still there.

49
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.435
So the way we get rid of that space,

50
00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:43.700
is we're gonna say
border-collapse:collapse.

51
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.551
And you'll see it twitch just a little
bit, that's that default border,

52
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.476
90s border disappearing.

53
00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:54.221
So it doesn't cause us problems later.

54
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:59.174
So that border collapse collapse might be
something you wanna put on every table,

55
00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:02.276
cuz nobody goes back to the 90s anymore,
right.

56
00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:04.726
Okay, let's move on to our caption.

57
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:14.295
So for our caption, we actually don't
want it to display on the table or

58
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:19.396
on our web page at all, because to
a sighted user this is obvious, right?

59
00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.460
Let's somebody's using a screen reader,

60
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.919
they are the ones that need
to have this identifier.

61
00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.211
So, what we'll do here is
we can say visibility,

62
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:35.889
collapse, not display none but
visibility collapse, okay.

63
00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.511
And the reason why we do it this way is
that it will still be accessible to screen

64
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.990
readers, although it's not visible
on the webpage to sighted readers.

65
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.984
All right, so that's why we choose
visibility collapse for that.

66
00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:55.307
Sweet, we're actually almost done
with this, believe it or not.

67
00:04:55.307 --> 00:04:58.394
Let's address those headings, actually,

68
00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:02.546
let's address the headings and
the cells right now TH,TD.

69
00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:07.581
Let's put a little bit of
padding on these, one rim zero.

70
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:12.196
So give us a little bit of space
here on the page, easier to read.

71
00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:14.177
Remember padding is additive, so

72
00:05:14.177 --> 00:05:17.949
we wind up with a two REM gap between
each of our track names right.

73
00:05:21.285 --> 00:05:23.170
All right, what about my headings?

74
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.635
Somebody give me some some styling
that we need to do to our headings

75
00:05:30.273 --> 00:05:33.450
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; We need to as text align left.

76
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.632
What else?

77
00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:38.587
&gt;&gt; Color, new font family.

78
00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:42.281
&gt;&gt; New font family, right poppins.

79
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:43.673
There is definitely a new colo,

80
00:05:43.673 --> 00:05:47.138
we actually don't have it in our variable
list, so we're gonna need to add it.

81
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.781
That gives us that gray color there.

82
00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:51.984
Anything else?

83
00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:52.518
&gt;&gt; Border.

84
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:57.205
&gt;&gt; That border, that bottom border,
right gives us that line.

85
00:05:57.205 --> 00:06:00.786
All right, so let's write that code.

86
00:06:00.786 --> 00:06:04.988
So here on our th text align left,

87
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.358
Font family, var sans serif.

88
00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:17.241
Okay.

89
00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:26.727
Border-bottom, 1px solid var,

90
00:06:26.727 --> 00:06:30.864
we're gonna call it grey.

91
00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:35.771
Nothing is gonna happen, because we
don't actually have grey set yet, but

92
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:37.311
we'll put the code in.

93
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:40.308
And color, will be var grey.

94
00:06:46.164 --> 00:06:51.790
Okay, Everybody, alright.

95
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.656
Okay, so let's set that variable then,
if we go back up to our base,

96
00:06:57.656 --> 00:07:04.050
let's set our variable here in our colors,
and I'm gonna call this gray.

97
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.229
And the value is adb0c0.

98
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.924
And then all that styling should apply.

99
00:07:16.924 --> 00:07:20.867
We have one more thing to do,
does anybody see it?

100
00:07:20.867 --> 00:07:25.431
Take a look away our page looks good,
take a look at this

101
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:30.209
what's the last thing we need
to do time that time right?

102
00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:35.153
What do we need to do with time
&gt;&gt; Change the color and

103
00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:38.487
font family
&gt;&gt; Change color and the font family.

104
00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:42.819
Did anybody have any suggestions of
how we could change the color and

105
00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.570
the font family for those?

106
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.225
Not Jason.

107
00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:51.263
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Should we make a class and

108
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:52.880
go apply it to all those cells?

109
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.559
Who wants to have the joy of doing that?

110
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.954
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You don't?

111
00:07:58.954 --> 00:08:00.350
What is another way we could do it?

112
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.134
We have a pattern in our HTML,
can we leverage this pattern?

113
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:12.599
Somebody told me what
the pattern is in the HTML.

114
00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.730
&gt;&gt; The tracking number is a title and
then the time.

115
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.960
&gt;&gt; It's the track number, the title and
the time over and over again, right?

116
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.764
So that last column, is always the time.

117
00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:28.399
That means we there's probably
a CSS selector for it.

118
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.693
Yeah.

119
00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:32.028
&gt;&gt; Selector or last selector.

120
00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:35.819
Yeah, something with last in it, right.

121
00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:37.923
And so let's do that.

122
00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:43.321
So it's gonna be a TD last of type,

123
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:47.242
the last of the td types.

124
00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:52.756
And that would mean we can
apply the font family,

125
00:08:52.756 --> 00:08:58.503
of var serif, And

126
00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:01.661
the color of var magenta.

127
00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:11.681
And a font weight of 600,
just to make it a little bolder and

128
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:14.785
make it stand out a little bit more.

129
00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:20.735
How sweet is that, how many of
you would have made a class and.

130
00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:25.298
Spend an hour, like, yeah, Andrew's,
Andrew's brave enough to admit it.

131
00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:31.300
Spend an hour going through and labeling
all those classes and blah, blah, right?

132
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.813
Way better solution here.
