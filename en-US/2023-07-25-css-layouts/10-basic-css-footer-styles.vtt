00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.085
All right, so let's go back now
to our footer, so in the footer,

2
00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:10.567
let's take a look, we have a big space
between the end of our last review and

3
00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:14.855
the start of our footer, and
it's in uppercase, right?

4
00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:18.527
Let's take a look at our current code pen.

5
00:00:18.527 --> 00:00:23.850
That is a much smaller space and
it's not an uppercase.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.767
So what suggestions do I have for
styling the footer?

7
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.776
&gt;&gt; There is an uppercase text property,
but I can't remember what it is.

8
00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:36.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.599
So footer, right?

10
00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:43.157
We need to make it uppercase and
if we google for

11
00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:48.190
that we would find text-transform
is the one we want uppercase.

12
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.020
Especially if I spell it right, transform.

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.059
There we go.

14
00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:04.440
Okay, X transform.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.590
What else?

16
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.260
&gt;&gt; Could put a big top margin on footer.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.410
&gt;&gt; We can put a big top
margin on the footer, right?

18
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.740
So let's do that.

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.474
And I think I said margin-top 5rem.

20
00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.510
There we go.

21
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.432
We got a big space.

22
00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:33.152
Congratulations, we've built the mobile
version of our first website.

23
00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:38.190
Yay, [APPLAUSE] What
questions do we have on this?

24
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.280
The mobile version of the Easy website,
we are done.

25
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.549
&gt;&gt; Is It common convention to
organize your globals in the top, and

26
00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.513
then I guess your HTML selectors and
then your class names?

27
00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:56.770
Yes, yes, and the reason you do that
has to do with the cascade part of CSS.

28
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.048
So you put those global selectors
on the top before anything else.

29
00:02:01.048 --> 00:02:04.496
You put in all your HTML elements
that have low specificity and

30
00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:06.088
are easily overridden, and

31
00:02:06.088 --> 00:02:10.147
then you can get into your more specific
styles later in the style sheet.

32
00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:11.840
Yep, absolutely.
