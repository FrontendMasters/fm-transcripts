00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:05.640
Congratulations everyone, you managed
to build three very different, but

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.460
related websites for this band project,
and you should be very proud of yourself.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.754
I'm sure there was a ton of learning that
happened for you here along the way,

4
00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:17.420
it is amazing what CSS can do.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.424
And how we can approach all
of these by thinking about

6
00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:24.700
centralized styling from the beginning.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.615
This is where we started in the course,
we started with a page, with no intention

8
00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:34.625
of will ever publishing it, but it's set
up in introductory kind of style guide.

9
00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:39.508
We establish all of our colors,
we establish type sizes and type phases,

10
00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:43.585
we establish basic styling for
some of our HTML elements.

11
00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.139
And it wound of saving
us a ton of time later,

12
00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:49.965
because this is carried into
all of our future designs.

13
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:53.866
We then went on to design
an easier layout here.

14
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:58.599
This may be on par with what you already
are designing as you came into the course,

15
00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:01.802
but maybe you haven't worked
with CSS layers before or

16
00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:05.791
maybe you haven't worked with these
kinds of style guides before.

17
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.941
So we wound up with a page that
looks like this on desktop.

18
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.759
And as we reduce the size
of our browser window,

19
00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.295
we wound up putting our tour underneath,
our main leading picture,

20
00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:24.180
and then wound up collapsing
things even further on mobile.

21
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.912
This was a straightforward project, but
it was a great way to get started, and

22
00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:33.623
get thinking about how we could
make interesting layouts with CSS.

23
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.040
We then moved on to a slightly
more interesting page here.

24
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.005
We have our tour page where we have
these interesting sold out buttons with

25
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.167
the diagonal line across them,

26
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:52.236
as opposed to our buttons where we can
still buy tickets for various shows.

27
00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:55.156
So, that is a little
pattern that maybe you want

28
00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.570
to pull into some of your next designs.

29
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.565
That concept of that
diagonal line when and

30
00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:05.138
the button is not clickable if
something is no longer available,

31
00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:08.726
that of course also led
into our other design here.

32
00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:11.730
For our medium-difficulty website,

33
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.917
we wound up with our hamburger button
here at the top of the page, and

34
00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:21.930
as we made our page larger,
we had some exciting changes happen.

35
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.150
We skinned our audio player here,
a working audio player.

36
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.715
Underneath of that,
we have these wacky reviews that went from

37
00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:39.270
four simple reviews with stars to
an interesting layout with photos.

38
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.371
And then when we went to desktop,

39
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:45.030
all of that moved over here
to the left hand column.

40
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.350
We also wound up with some styling for
our boxes and our track list.

41
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.625
And there's some patterns here that you
may carry into your future work, and

42
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:58.099
I would encourage you, particularly the
interesting little bit that we did here

43
00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.078
with our reviews and their different
layouts and that audio skinning.

44
00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:05.710
That may be very helpful
to you in another project.

45
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.787
Finally, we went on to our
most difficult website, and

46
00:03:09.787 --> 00:03:14.510
this one contained some really
interesting elements to it.

47
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.060
We wound up with our diamond based
image layouts here on the page.

48
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.074
We wound up with our very interesting
track list presentation, where we

49
00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:30.160
can open and close that track list, and
of course, our icons move around as well.

50
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.851
They go from right on the album cover to
the edge of the album cover, all while

51
00:03:34.851 --> 00:03:40.950
maintaining our working audio player, our
working hamburger button, and so forth.

52
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.622
So, these are patterns that you may want
to use in some of your next designs,

53
00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:50.360
I encourage you to think about
the approach that I've presented here.

54
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.249
Start with good HTML,
semantic HTML, well structured and

55
00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:59.648
well formed HTML,
move on to generic CSS that carries

56
00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:04.300
over very easily into all
kinds of other styling.

57
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.994
And then and only then,

58
00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:11.350
later on just enough JavaScript In
order to make your page function.

59
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.369
In this case, we have JavaScript
associated with our audio player,

60
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.281
a tiny bit associated with
our hamburger button,

61
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:23.250
and some very simple JavaScript that
just switches some classes on click.

62
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.125
And using CSS,

63
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:28.470
we managed to lay out all of the rest
of everything else that we needed.

64
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.973
So our JavaScript wound up
being very minimal for this and

65
00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:34.260
we didn't even need a framework
in order to build it.

66
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.630
So, I hope you carry away some of
these lessons into your future work.

67
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.132
I have several classes at front end
masters, if you love this course,

68
00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:48.090
you may wanna take a look at my course on
Grids and Flexbox, where I go into much

69
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.650
more detail about how grids and Flexbox
work, if you haven't watched that already.

70
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.820
I also have a course on Intermediate CSS,
which drills into how selectors work,

71
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.645
some of the selectors here have intrigued.

72
00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:05.380
I'll talk about all of
those in more detail, and

73
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.584
I'll also talk about how the cascade and
inheritance work as well.

74
00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:14.566
Thank you all so much for watching, and
I hope to see you in another course soon.
