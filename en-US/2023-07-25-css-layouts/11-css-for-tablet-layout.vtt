WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.140
All right, fantastic.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:09.750
So we are going to move on
here to our tablet design.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.552
So we are at section 3D that is
Chapter 3 Section D, tablet design.

4
00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:20.780
And so I have a lot of blah, blah here.

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.812
Basically what this says is, what you
wanna do is you wanna take a look at your

6
00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:28.844
current mobile design, take a look at
your tablet design, and talk about,

7
00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:33.640
write it down in plain English, what
are the differences between these two.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.350
We can go back and refer to those
PowerPoint slides I had earlier.

9
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.200
So let's talk about these, all right?

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.360
So we have coded what is on the left-side,
here.

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.501
We've coded that mobile design and
this is the spec for

12
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:52.530
our tablet design, so
does anybody wanna give me what

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.033
are the differences,
what do we need to think about here?

14
00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:02.647
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Right, so for the tour,

15
00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:06.883
the actual name tour itself
goes all the way across, and

16
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:10.690
then we have three columns of tour dates,
right?

17
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.055
So that's one thing, what else?

18
00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:20.271
&gt;&gt; Images are in a row instead of a column
&gt;&gt; We have got the images going

19
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:26.044
across in a row instead of stacked
in a column, okay, anything else?

20
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:27.350
&gt;&gt; The font is bigger.

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.996
&gt;&gt; The font looks, well,
it definitely looks a little bit bigger,

22
00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:35.969
I think that's actually an artifact of the
fact that we've squashed our mobile, yeah,

23
00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.319
but that was a good eye.

24
00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.940
Yes, absolutely,
I can see why you think that.

25
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.650
What else?

26
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.260
How about that image of the guys,
the Magenta line guys?

27
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.750
It's probably bigger on tablet
than it is on mobile, isn't it?

28
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.900
Okay, so we probably have to
think about that a little bit.

29
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.092
Okay good, so now you have those pictures
in your head you know what you're aiming

30
00:02:01.092 --> 00:02:03.590
for, let's start coding that.

31
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.530
And as I say here in the notes,

32
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.790
we've talked about what
changes between the layouts.

33
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.514
We also need to think about some of those
layout changes happen within a section of

34
00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:16.600
the Web page, whereas some of them
are the whole Web page, right?

35
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.581
So we kinda work from inside out, so
we just like we worked through here,

36
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:24.692
like the tour section,
we might work on that in isolation and

37
00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:27.160
then apply it to the larger page.

38
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.018
And always you can't,
if you can't see it you can't style it,

39
00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:34.519
so put on those borders put in
those background colors, so

40
00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.816
you can see what you're doing is
always a really important thing to do.

41
00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:46.486
All right, [COUGH] so I'm gonna start
with my appropriate CodePen here,

42
00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:52.030
the link is in the Website
we can make a fork for that.

43
00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:59.711
Okay, so we've got all these layers here,

44
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:03.131
you can add media queries
to each of these layers, or

45
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.127
you can add a big media query at the end
of the layers, whatever makes sense.

46
00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:12.196
I will probably put the media queries
inside of the individual layers.

47
00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:17.737
Okay, so I'm gonna go back to
my base layer here momentarily,

48
00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:20.780
and in here we had a Wrapper style.

49
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.280
Where's our wrapper style?

50
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.610
Or we didn't have a wrapper style.

51
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:32.411
We didn't have a wrapper style.

52
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.226
&gt;&gt; It's in the next layer.

53
00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:35.049
&gt;&gt; It's in the next layer, okay,

54
00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.162
so we have this wrapper
style that's available here.

55
00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:40.752
And the header banner tour layer,

56
00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:45.575
which I think I originally might
have just called it header, and

57
00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:49.704
you'll see that we have it
set to a max width of 375.

58
00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:54.224
So now we're gonna talk about a larger
screen, so we wanna change that, and

59
00:03:54.224 --> 00:03:56.001
we do that with a media query.

60
00:03:56.001 --> 00:04:00.416
So down here in this layer,
we will add @media,

61
00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:07.080
that's how you start a media query,
and then we will add parentheses.

62
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.253
This is, again,
part of the media query, and

63
00:04:11.253 --> 00:04:16.820
we can say our min-width will
be 800 pixels, why this?

64
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.460
Why 800 pixels?

65
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.044
This is what happens to
work with the design,

66
00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:24.994
this is the spec that came from
the designer, etcetera, etcetera.

67
00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:28.427
But you notice that,
that takes that structure of @media,

68
00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:30.998
we have the parentheses and
there's a test.

69
00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:34.249
So we can do a max-width,
you can do a min-width,

70
00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.100
you can do testing for portrait or
landscape, that is something you can do.

71
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.220
You can test for aspect ratios, you can
test for Black and white versus color.

72
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.326
There are a lot of things that
media queries will test for, but

73
00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:51.496
generally speaking,
when we're working here with layouts,

74
00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:55.233
we're pretty commonly doing a min-width or
a max-width, make sense?

75
00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:56.525
Okay?

76
00:04:56.525 --> 00:05:01.269
Notice that with a min-width, we're seeing
these tiles that are inside of this

77
00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:05.330
media query will not apply unless
we're at 800 pixels or bigger.

78
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.800
So we're adding styles on to what came
before which apply to everything, right?

79
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.956
So sometimes we're gonna
override what came before,

80
00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:20.250
sometimes we're writing additional styles
that will only apply at 800 pixels, yeah?

81
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.397
So this is mobile first,

82
00:05:23.397 --> 00:05:28.250
anytime you see a min-width media
query like this, that is mobile first.

83
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.281
Pro-tip, anytime you see a max-width
media query, what is that?

84
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:41.565
&gt;&gt; Desktop
&gt;&gt; Desktop first, okay, good.

85
00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:45.066
All right, so right here inside of this,

86
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:50.730
we can put in our wrapper, and
now we can change our max-width.

87
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.710
So our max-width will go to 800 pixels,
okay, and

88
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.860
the screen mirror may not change.

89
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.813
Why didn't it change?

90
00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:05.707
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Not there yet,
we are not at 800 pixel.

91
00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:12.180
&gt;&gt; Actually it did change, we just can't
see it because we have this wrapper and

92
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.861
our styling actually works
just fine at 375 pixels or

93
00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:20.870
lower, and you may have your screen open.

94
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.351
If you notice down here at the bottom,
it will give you a little number and

95
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.050
tell you exactly what your
screen width is here in CodePen.

96
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.680
Look down there by the JavaScript pane
that I have minimized there, see that?

97
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.559
So whoop, there we go [LAUGH] boom,
I'm over 800 pixels now, so

98
00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:44.686
if your screen looks like mine,
you're over 800 pixels.

99
00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:47.645
&gt;&gt; So then when does
the breakpoint come into play, and

100
00:06:47.645 --> 00:06:51.545
I guess I wanna know the difference
between when to use media query and

101
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:55.129
when to use breakpoint, and
how are they alike and different?

102
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.792
&gt;&gt; They are exactly the same thing.

103
00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:58.615
People talk about breakpoints,

104
00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:03.890
that is sort of that concept of things are
going to change at a certain dimension.

105
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.499
Media query is how we
implement a breakpoint, yap?

106
00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:12.676
&gt;&gt; Is there a standard number for tablets?

107
00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:16.820
&gt;&gt; I would look at what Bootstrap
does because they're Bootstrap,

108
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.619
they establish standards for everything.

109
00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:25.852
But I think you'd find like 767,
800 something like that is usually tablet.

110
00:07:25.852 --> 00:07:26.883
&gt;&gt; Okay.

111
00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:29.978
&gt;&gt; But it can be whatever you want,
and you don't have to have three,

112
00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:32.758
you can have four, you can have 12,
it doesn't matter.
