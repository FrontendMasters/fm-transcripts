1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.321
Here is the next part.

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:06.314
We're gonna go to the hamburger menu,
all right?

3
00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:09.930
And over lunch,
I'd like you guys to try working on this.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.454
We have an article with the original code,

5
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.642
That talks about how to make
a hamburger menu, all right?

6
00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:22.154
So you can go through and look at that.

7
00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:30.979
We have the original code pen,
which I've stripped down a little bit.

8
00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.351
Well, this is the original code pen,
just to show you what that looked like.

9
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.295
It was a whole web page.

10
00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:43.085
Notice that the menu up here on the top
has that hamburger button, right?

11
00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:48.713
Okay, and
then I gave you a beginning code pen here.

12
00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:55.505
So I stripped out all that extra stuff and
I gave you just this part of it here.

13
00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:58.436
So we have pretty much
something that starts and

14
00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.445
behaves exactly as we want it to behave,
right?

15
00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:03.189
We have different links.

16
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.692
We have a logo that should be
going in here for site title.

17
00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:11.005
I believe everything is up here
in this page for you to work on.

18
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.894
All the JavaScript is here and working.

19
00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:14.985
What I'd like for

20
00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:18.994
you to do then is I'd like you to
make a thing that looks like this.

21
00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:22.259
So we have our icon.

22
00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.396
The icon is here at mobile dimensions,
just the icon.

23
00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:30.490
And the hamburger button,
and when we get to desktop,

24
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.209
looks like this is gonna be what's
here for tablet and mobile.

25
00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.062
When you get to desktop it
should look like this, okay?

26
00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:43.723
And I've given you some things to
think about as you walk through it.

27
00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:46.169
But I'd like you to give this a shot and

28
00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:49.386
see if you can at least
build this part for mobile.

29
00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:54.191
The audio player exercise,

30
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:59.212
we had the same process where we picked
out an audio player from the Internet,

31
00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:04.561
we forked it, we looked at the code, we
added a little HTML for styling purposes.

32
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.782
And made sure we didn't
break any JavaScript, and so

33
00:02:07.782 --> 00:02:10.940
forth in order to get our
audio player put together.

34
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.953
We're gonna use the same methodology
now for our hamburger button.

35
00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:19.766
We've found a hamburger button online, and
now we're gonna go about styling that.

36
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:23.238
So let's start with a few questions.

37
00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.530
So first of all, hopefully,

38
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.036
you've had a chance to take
a look at the HTML and so forth.

39
00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:36.339
And you can of course can get your
code pen and practical.css.education.

40
00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.986
This is Chapter 4E, the hamburger menu.

41
00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:42.879
We are looking at our beginning code pen.

42
00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.279
The opening code pen here,
the HTML is pretty simple.

43
00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.933
We have a header, e have a site title,
we have a button.

44
00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:54.723
This is gonna eventually the hamburger
button or it's hidden from view,

45
00:02:54.723 --> 00:02:57.125
depending on the size of our window.

46
00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.760
And then we have our navigation, right?

47
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.465
Okay, so pretty easy to understand.

48
00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:08.700
Then underneath, down here we have some
css, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

49
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.853
And then we have a media query
with a max width of 48 REMs, okay,

50
00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:19.314
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
that that one media query there.

51
00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:22.523
Okay, so my first question to you is this.

52
00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:26.945
Is this mobile first, or
is this desktop first?

53
00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:28.888
&gt;&gt; Desktop.

54
00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:30.839
&gt;&gt; Why do you say desktop first?

55
00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:35.232
&gt;&gt; Because instead of going up in
our media queries with min-width,

56
00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:38.292
we're actually taking all of our styles,
and

57
00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:42.072
then only applying things
when a max-width is reached.

58
00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:42.780
&gt;&gt; Correct.

59
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.537
&gt;&gt; Just scaling down the browser
as opposed to scaling up.

60
00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:47.235
&gt;&gt; Correct.

61
00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:49.763
So what's outside of the media query here?

62
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.263
All these styles.

63
00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:56.907
These are the desktop styles which is
the opposite of what we have been doing.

64
00:03:56.907 --> 00:04:01.322
And what's inside the media query,
all of these are the actual mobile styles.

65
00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:02.935
Make sense?

66
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:06.250
Okay, so
anytime you run into desktop first,

67
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.268
that doesn't mean you can't use it
with your mobile first approach.

68
00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:15.034
It just means maybe your hamburger
menu is desktop first and

69
00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:18.812
everything else is gonna wind
up being built mobile first.

70
00:04:18.812 --> 00:04:20.676
It is really not a tragedy.

71
00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:23.330
But you can rewrite the code if you want.

72
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.885
So if you want everything to be mobile
first, or you have that rule at work, you

73
00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:32.787
could go through the process of rewriting
this, take things out of the media query,

74
00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:36.262
put other things into media queries,
yada, yada, yada.

75
00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:37.688
We aren't gonna bother with that.

76
00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:42.684
We're just gonna keep it desktop first
because it works just fine the way it is.

77
00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:46.551
All right, sounds good.

78
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.764
How about comments on the HTML structure,

79
00:04:49.764 --> 00:04:54.235
what do people think about
the structure of this document?

80
00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:56.938
Anything we need to fix here?

81
00:04:56.938 --> 00:04:58.753
Does it look semantic?

82
00:04:58.753 --> 00:05:00.714
Does it look reasonable for a navbar?

83
00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:06.758
So if you don't normally use an unordered
list for your navbars, you should.

84
00:05:06.758 --> 00:05:12.739
Navigation is a list of links and
they can be visited in any order.

85
00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:14.993
So, therefore, it is an unordered list.

86
00:05:14.993 --> 00:05:16.893
That is why we do that.

87
00:05:16.893 --> 00:05:19.310
I know a lot of people just put in links,

88
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.110
and then they just
magically line up in a row.

89
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.877
This is the correct way to
mark up a navigation bar.

90
00:05:25.877 --> 00:05:30.170
And of course, that button there is
going to be our hamburger button, and

91
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.202
then we have our site title which
we'll need to swap out for our logo.

92
00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:37.734
Fair enough, okay.

93
00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:41.616
Let's take a quick peek at our JavaScript.

94
00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:46.440
And this JavaScript is lot simpler
than the audio JavaScript, right?

95
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.654
We're just gonna look at it just real
quick to see what it's selecting here and

96
00:05:51.654 --> 00:05:55.131
what we can not change in
order to keep this working.

97
00:05:55.131 --> 00:06:01.174
So you see here in line two it says
getElementById main menu open.

98
00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:04.241
So we definitely need to keep
that ID in place in order for

99
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.688
this JavaScript to work.

100
00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:10.721
Anything else here on this JavaScript
that we need to worry about?

101
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:16.933
Anybody?

102
00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:19.214
Looks pretty clear, right?

103
00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:20.216
Pretty clear.

104
00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:26.503
That's the only thing that gets selected
is that main menu opens, so very good.

105
00:06:26.503 --> 00:06:28.820
And we see it show up
here in the code a lot.

106
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.463
And then these icons.

107
00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:35.398
So there is an icon here for
this hamburger button, right?

108
00:06:35.398 --> 00:06:41.104
Where is that coming from because
it's not coming from the HTML, right?

109
00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:45.791
We take a look here,
there is nothing here that calls for

110
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:48.294
any kind of image, is there?

111
00:06:48.294 --> 00:06:51.706
So let's take a look and
see if we can find it.

112
00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:54.305
It's probably gonna be
in our mobile styles.

113
00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:58.657
And sure enough right here on line 71,

114
00:06:58.657 --> 00:07:03.650
there is this content, this funky/630.

115
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.003
That's a Unicode code
[LAUGH] Unicode code.

116
00:07:08.003 --> 00:07:12.654
That indicates that is a hamburger button,
so that's where that's coming from.

117
00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:20.826
When we click the hamburger button and
our menu slides in view,

118
00:07:20.826 --> 00:07:27.006
we have an odd box that shows up here,
that should be the closebutton.

119
00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:30.662
For whatever reason,
I don't know if it's the font or whatever,

120
00:07:30.662 --> 00:07:33.357
the closebutton never
seems to work correctly.

121
00:07:33.357 --> 00:07:39.420
And I am not sure where that
shows up here in this code.

122
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.820
Which might be the whole
problem come to think of it.

123
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.325
[LAUGH] It just never shows up.

124
00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:48.876
So that is something we'll wanna fix,

125
00:07:48.876 --> 00:07:51.904
we'll want them have
a working closebutton.

126
00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.774
So this is the approach that this
particular author has taken.

127
00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:59.704
They're using Unicode codes to call for
some of these icons.

128
00:07:59.704 --> 00:08:02.500
So just something again to keep in mind,

129
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.792
that we don't need to come up with SVGs or
anything like that.
