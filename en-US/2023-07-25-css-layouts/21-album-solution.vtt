00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.590
So I hope you did well
with that markup exercise.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.550
And let's take a look at your markup and
see what you got.

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.640
So we talked about it a little
bit before we started.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.920
Let's start up here at the top
with the new album stuff.

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.680
So, in my markup, I put a section around
that, this is a section of the web page.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.611
I gave it a class of album, and
then there's the H2, new album, the H1,

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.550
it was all a dream.

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.920
And then you can put in
your link to order now.

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.447
And of course, you can give it that class
of button primary, which already exists,

10
00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:38.230
we know that that's how that
button is gonna be styled.

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.530
You may have used a div instead of
a section, that's probably just fine.

12
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.627
For accessibility purposes, section really
doesn't have a whole lot of impact on web

13
00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:50.010
pages at this point, but semantically,
it may be a little bit better.

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.330
All right, then we have our table.

15
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.781
So let's talk about that,
I wrapped a section around our table, and

16
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:01.230
then we start with the table element,
right?

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.380
So table starts at the beginning,
ends all the way down at the end.

18
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.860
And now I will ask the question, how many
of you added a caption to your table?

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.369
How many of you have ever
even heard of a caption?

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.705
Great, so caption is really important.

21
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:23.692
Anytime you use a table, you need to
tell people particularly as this in

22
00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:28.920
the accessibility world, what is this
table that they're about to look at?

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.854
So to this I've added the caption element,
the HTML and

24
00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:37.310
the correct way to write it must
be the first child of table.

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.820
So in other words,
table Followed immediately by caption.

26
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.320
And the title here is,
It Was All A Dream playlist.

27
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.170
That was just,
it's a playlist for the album.

28
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.927
The album name is It Was All A Dream,
so there we go, okay?

29
00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:55.400
We can eventually hide that.

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.554
We'll go through that when we get to the
CSS, but you'll want to add that to your

31
00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:04.350
table if you don't have it, and I gave
you a reference there to look at MDN.

32
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.660
Okay, next up, we have our track,
our song, and our time.

33
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.350
How did you mark that up?

34
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.769
We put a row around it, right TR, and
then for each individual element,

35
00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:16.862
what did you use?

36
00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:17.707
&gt;&gt; th.

37
00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:19.898
&gt;&gt; th, anybody used td?

38
00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:24.187
Nobody will admit it?

39
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:27.546
Okay, so th stands for what?

40
00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:28.442
&gt;&gt; Table header.

41
00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:29.600
&gt;&gt; Table header.

42
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.004
So this is the headers for
our columns, track, song, and time, so

43
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.170
we'll use that here for those headers.

44
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.098
And then the rest of it is pretty
straightforward cuz it's the same thing

45
00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.920
over and over again, right?

46
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.608
We're gonna have each row gets a tr,

47
00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:49.490
and then each of the elements in
that row get a td, td/td, right?

48
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.429
One casino of tricks, 201, and so on and
so forth all the way down the page.

49
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.414
And it goes on forever [LAUGH],
and then it ends.

50
00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:01.647
Sound good?

51
00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:04.869
Everybody cool?

52
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.850
All right.
