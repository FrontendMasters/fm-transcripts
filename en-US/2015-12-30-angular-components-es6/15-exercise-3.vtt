[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:06.172
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you go to step 3.

3
00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:17.114
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Check out step 3.

4
00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:25.480
Boom and what you're going to be
doing is creating a component.

5
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.820
So if you look in the components folder.

6
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.460
There is a blog folder and it's got like
some stuff that's kind of filtered out.

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.990
So that's kind of not filtered out but
tons of instructions,

8
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.290
tons of CSS stuff going on here.

9
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.710
What you need to do is just follow
the instructions, really what you're gonna

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.240
do is just putting the pieces
together to finish this component and

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.190
you can look back to home to kind of
figure out what's going on because I

12
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.026
changed home to match this new formats.

13
00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:54.320
If you go at the home component out,
it's not what we just had on step 2.

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.325
It's a completely different format,

15
00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.320
completely changed it to what
you're going to use in for blog.

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.260
So use that as a reference to help
you because home.js is like pretty

17
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.476
much exactly where you're gonna be doing.

18
00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.370
So you need to make the block component.

19
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.750
There's some instructions in there,
some to do.

20
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.370
So if you run the command, the to do's
will print out on the command line for

21
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.600
you and you can see what's going on but
ultimately what you should see when you're

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.484
done is
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Something like this.

23
00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:22.984
Let's see.

24
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.450
Tell me what this looks like.

25
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.590
So I think the cat's on,
that's why I had that cat.

26
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.710
Yeah, I remember now.

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.560
So now if you come look at this thing,
you should see.

28
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.590
So this will be your home, I made this for
you, so don't worry about this.

29
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.441
You'll see this already and then if you
click on blog you'll see these cats.

30
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:49.420
All right, so this is what you see.

31
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.960
These things,
they shouldn't do anything yet.

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.060
But you see cats, you hover over cats,
and they'll like zoom in, or whatever.

33
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.390
Right, so this is what you
should see when you're done.

34
00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.890
Cool.
