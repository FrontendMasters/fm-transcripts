[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:09.326
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right so, the next step,
if you join me, will be step six.

3
00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:11.910
Check out step six.

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.040
Whoa, and this one, what is this one?

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.710
This was is block components I think.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.180
Yeah, so this one we're gonna
do like just creating, you're

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.980
gonna be going through and
creating a components again.

8
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
But there's a little less in there for
you this time and a little more for

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
you to do, and some extra stuff that
you didn't get to do before we created

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.640
the home component in the blog component.

11
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.670
So you're gonna be making
the blog post component.

12
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.270
And like I said, there's less here,
more to do, and new stuff to do as well.

13
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.510
I added a whole bunch of new stuff.

14
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.970
Yeah, there's no to dos?

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.590
Here we go, there's some to dos.

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.850
Yeah, there's like four of them.
&gt;&gt; Scott: If you're not getting to dos,

17
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.450
maybe do a pull from GitHub to see
if you have the latest branch.

18
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.383
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What plugin is that?

19
00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:10.561
&gt;&gt; Scott: The todo plugin?

20
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.661
That is gulp todoist.

21
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:18.325
Yeah it's okay, you can probably
just make your own and be better.

22
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:24.160
This one's fine, but I really have
like it's like very hard to read.

23
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.289
I wish I was a different color.

24
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.820
Yeah so, what you're gonna be doing
is making a blog post component.

25
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.780
There's a blog post folder already
there with the files already there.

26
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.520
But again, there's more to do.

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.380
Less hints and new stuff as well.

28
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.150
Especially in a blog-post.js,
some new, if you don't know angular,

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.770
you're probably going to get lost here,
which is fine.

30
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.477
You should definitely struggle a little

31
00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:53.629
bit.
&gt;&gt; Scott: But

32
00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:57.100
there's some funky stuff going
on in there, I promise you.

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.232
So, what that will look
like if you are done.

34
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.415
&gt;&gt; Scott: Would be this.

35
00:02:18.853 --> 00:02:21.462
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oops, did I not, cool, so

36
00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:27.180
you get like,
it's orange now I changed the color.

37
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.920
Now if you go in and you click on one of
these little buttons on the kitty card,

38
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.670
you get to go see the blog.

39
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.160
That's what that should look like.

40
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.893
Alright, so
if you click that you see the blog.

41
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.311
&gt;&gt; Scott: So, I don't think I made it

42
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.426
too hard for you as far as like trying to

43
00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:56.640
figure out how to get this slug in
the URL, I think I did that part already.

44
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.640
Because that would just been really,
really torture.

45
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.270
But yeah, you pretty much just have to
fill in the holes in the component.
