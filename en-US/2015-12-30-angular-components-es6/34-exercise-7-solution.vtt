00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.906
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:06.471
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This one was kind of tough,
especially if you, I just found out,

3
00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:09.075
if you go down the testing route,
it's going to be really tough.

4
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.700
[LAUGH].

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.280
Really tough.

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.450
So if anybody started writing test, you
will immediately run into some problems.

7
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.355
Which will be resolved, and you'll
immediately run into other problems.

8
00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:20.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH].

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And more problems and

10
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.999
more problems.

11
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.496
So let's just get to it.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let me see.

12
00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:32.740
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Dash.

13
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.230
All right, so let's look at the fix.

14
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.006
So again,
this is what it should look like,

15
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.769
you're done.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I just

16
00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:48.464
started.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

17
00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:50.343
the code looks like this.

18
00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.800
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So let's start an app.js.

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.450
I think we know we need to do here.

20
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.990
Boom.

21
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.370
Register the admin.

22
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.840
Alright, I think everybody
knows that by now.

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.970
Then on to app.js.

24
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.200
I think this stuff was already here first,
so

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.680
all you have to do is
register the directive.

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.940
Alright so nothing new,
we've done that before.

27
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.520
See these patterns here and there.

28
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.290
Getting used to it.

29
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.020
Everybody's feeling it.

30
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.590
Alright, and
then because that's importing directive,

31
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
let's move over to the directive, and then
we get our styles, we get our controller,

32
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.070
we get our template, and
then we make the dregs.

33
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.270
I think this is the file that you
have to fill out completely, right.

34
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.999
So things to remember here again, place
your controller, your template in there.

35
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.890
Use controller ask.

36
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.811
If you add a controller you
don't use controller ask,

37
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:45.370
then you can't reference the controller.

38
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.345
I mean yeah,
you can't reference the controller.

39
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:54.560
You can reference the scope of the
controller, but not the controller itself.

40
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.540
Scope, isolate it.

41
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.860
This is up to you.

42
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.860
I do it and then restrict E.

43
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.529
By default it's gonna be A for
attribute, but

44
00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.892
you could also use C for comment.

45
00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:11.257
Or I'm sorry, C for class, so
you can have a directive as a class.

46
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:13.371
That's really confusing.

47
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:16.371
You really mess somebody up if you
did that, so just don't do that.

48
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.291
And you can also have a comment for
M or a combination of whatever.

49
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:21.298
Whatever you want.

50
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:27.729
Originally it was E.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Everybody

51
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:28.583
good on this file?

52
00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.970
This is like the meat and
potatoes of what you were doing.

53
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.210
And then in the controller

54
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.090
we have some stuff here that I'm
like making a fake post for it.

55
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.290
And then, there's like this new
thing in here that you might or

56
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.400
might not have noticed.

57
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.910
But right here on line 14, I'm doing
an assignment inside the arguments.

58
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.200
Does anybody know what that is?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's the default.

59
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.830
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's the default.

60
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.030
That's exactly what it is.

61
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.180
I'm saying, post is gonna be post or

62
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.310
it's gonna be this.post,
which is going to be this up here.

63
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.280
So, that's actually, I think it's pretty
cool that you can do the default.

64
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.460
Which you could have done a Carter script.

65
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.220
Carter script allows you
to do that stuff now.

66
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.270
Or does it?

67
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.000
Does Carter script do that?

68
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.920
I can't remember.

69
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.790
I haven't used it in so long.

70
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.150
But I think it was really cool,

71
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.620
that I was able to use a keyword this and
then reference this.

72
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.500
I thought that was pretty cool.

73
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.650
It's not what I expected.

74
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.290
I thought this is really like a window or
something or whatever.

75
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.990
I thought it was going to be whatever this
scope was on this iffy that's around here.

76
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.950
But no, it was this.

77
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.170
Which is really, really great.

78
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.410
So you guys had to use the create post,
right.

79
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.386
That’s what you have to do.

80
00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:44.240
So this .post.create passing in the post,

81
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.460
which is either going to be an object or
this.

82
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.030
And then I just go ahead and
empty out the actual post object.

83
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.080
It's set to equal to another object,
if you have all those values, and

84
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.730
then I just say this I
state I go back to blog.

85
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.350
So you click on it.

86
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.850
This goes back.

87
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.693
Right.
So if I'm like, it'll go back

88
00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:15.432
here.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

89
00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:20.580
make sure you do your injections and
export your controller and you're good.

90
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.980
So style is pretty simple and
for the spec.

91
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.750
I guess I just forgot to write specs,
but I'll talk about it.

92
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.610
So specs are pretty much
the same except for one thing.

93
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.580
And that one thing is gonna be,
if you go to sources.

94
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.693
Let's look at a blog.spec.

95
00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:45.560
So blog.spec, we wrote this file,
the spec file before

96
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.330
we changed over to using real data,
we wrote it when we had static data.

97
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.700
So the controller had nothing to inject.

98
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.890
But I anticipated this, so
I set up make control of this function to

99
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.850
take in things to inject, because I knew
that we were going to inject stuff later.

100
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.290
So now if we were to run this test,
it would fail.

101
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.600
Because the blog controller is
actually expecting post, so

102
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.950
it would fail as soon
as it gets like here.

103
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.370
It'll run this .get post,
this .get post, would run this post.get.

104
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.730
So to say this .undefined,get, and it'll
like, there's no method get of undefined.

105
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.890
That's the error you
would get immediately.

106
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.214
You can just bring in
post.JS into the test.

107
00:05:31.214 --> 00:05:35.727
That will resolve an error, and
then you'll hit another error,

108
00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:40.580
because post.js needs $HTTP, API,
and if you used my version, Q.

109
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.480
So, then you have to mock
those things out, too.

110
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.535
So, what you could do instead is one,
you could just before each

111
00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:54.770
register the shared

112
00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.060
module here, or you can just go ahead and
add the shared module here.

113
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.323
So it's up to you but you, but either
way you have to add that shared module,

114
00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:10.827
or you just have to keep chasing
the dependencies if you're

115
00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:13.840
going to use the raw JavaScript
versions of not angler.

116
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.850
This is why I was like, yeah you
can just import your factories and

117
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.224
services into files and use them.

118
00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:23.390
But as you can see, you start running into
problems, because those regular factories.

119
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.270
So the first post is
a regular JavaScript but

120
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.179
because it's relying on
dependency injection.

121
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.542
If you don't tell angler about it, as you
can see we run into those problems of

122
00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:36.260
chasing down these dependencies,
like okay you need this.

123
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.060
Well you need this.

124
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.858
And now you're like chasing
this tree of dependencies,

125
00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:41.410
whereas if were just add it to the module,
you can just import the entire module.

126
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.190
If you don't know what I mean,
run the tests and

127
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.440
start going through all the errors.

128
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.080
You'll see the error
after error after error.

129
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.160
We just did it, trust me.
