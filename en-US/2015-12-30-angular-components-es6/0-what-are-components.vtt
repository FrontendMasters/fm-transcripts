[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.050
&gt;&gt; Scott: So, super stoked to be here.

3
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.320
Teaching at Frontend Masters.

4
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.725
As a student or really like what
Frontend Masters is doing and

5
00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:50.900
being an instructor here it is
even just makes me feel better.

6
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.792
So I'm also excited cuz I get to teach
something I'm really passionate about and

7
00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.710
that's just the future of
JavaScript in general.

8
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.825
So we're going to be talking about today
is just going to be getting started

9
00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:07.710
with ES2015 now and Angular 1.x
with like a component approach.

10
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.189
So before we dive in,
a little bit about me,

11
00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.010
I'm an engineer at Udacity in
Mountain View, California.

12
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.670
So I do a lot of front-end there.

13
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.040
On my free time, I do things like this.

14
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.457
I do training, I talk at conferences and

15
00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:24.881
stuff like that because this
it's just what I like to do.

16
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:28.021
I go and volunteer at schools and
teach people how to program, and

17
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.885
stuff like that.

18
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:32.627
Because I'm just really passionate about
it because that's pretty much how I learn,

19
00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:33.860
is that way.

20
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.580
So that's what I do on my free time and I
can't think of anything else that I would

21
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.840
like to do, other than maybe going to
the gym or something, I don't know.

22
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.810
But, yeah I love teaching people to
program, because it makes me learn a lot

23
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.770
better, a lot faster, and
it's a lot more solid for me that way.

24
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.310
So, let's get right into it.

25
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.930
So, if you don't have this repo already.

26
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.319
If you haven't pulled it out and
looked at it, I'm just gonna, there it is.

27
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.120
Go ahead and fork or clone or
whatever your process is for that repo.

28
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.460
And go ahead and pull it down.

29
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.406
And then this is the link to the actual.

30
00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:13.890
So I don't like slides.

31
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.760
I just can't do slides anymore.

32
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.940
So what I did was I just like made
a static site with all the content of

33
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.400
the slides that I had, and
I put it on the site instead.

34
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.220
So I can scroll and
not have to go through slides.

35
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.390
So, cuz we all like scrolling, right?

36
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.050
So, meet me here and this is where
we'll go through the notes and stuff.

37
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.550
Sweet.

38
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.750
So let's get started so, yes?

39
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.053
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's that link?

40
00:02:39.053 --> 00:02:41.740
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, sorry about that.

41
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We have the link
posted in the chat, yeah.

42
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.427
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: All links
are posted in the chat.

43
00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:46.234
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Oops.

44
00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:48.923
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,
all the links should be in the chat, yeah.

45
00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:54.790
&gt;&gt; Scott: Great.

46
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.330
So if you see typos in here, that's fine.

47
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.930
Let me know, I'm really bad at spelling.

48
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.240
[LAUGH] I say it every time I give a talk,
so if you see typos, just let me know.

49
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.210
I won't feel bad, trust me.

50
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.480
Sweet, so let's get started.

51
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.073
What are these components, right,

52
00:03:12.073 --> 00:03:17.170
we're talking about building
Angular 1.X with components.

53
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.105
Does anybody know what I mean by that?

54
00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:20.694
Wait, don't read this.

55
00:03:20.694 --> 00:03:22.902
You know what, don't even look at it.

56
00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.286
Yes.

57
00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:27.416
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You want me explain it.

58
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:32.698
So components are like small
bits of your front end

59
00:03:32.698 --> 00:03:37.629
that you compose together
to create your app.

60
00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.814
They're, a concept that's being thrown
around a lot in the new router to

61
00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:50.525
kind of an Angular 2 they're kind of as
a replacement of sorts for directives.

62
00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:55.337
And they're basically just bits
of linked HTML in JavaScript,

63
00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:58.020
is that a reasonable explanation?

64
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.128
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah it's a loosely used term
to describe bits of functionality in

65
00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:08.154
our application that come together and
compose an application.

66
00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:11.500
Hence the name components,
because they're composable.

67
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.040
So the component approach
in Angular is simple.

68
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.610
So basically we're gonna be removing like,
the way we use to write Angular 1.x was

69
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.720
like we have our controllers and
they're bound to like these views.

70
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.020
We're just gonna get rid of that,
we're just not gonna do that anymore.

71
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.339
So if you're not gonna have standalone
controllers bound to some template

72
00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.831
somewhere, we're gonna load it up with
UI router or whatever router you use.

73
00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:32.255
We're just gonna get rid of that and

74
00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:35.800
instead what we're gonna do is we're going
to start with the directive, all right?

75
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.150
And a directive are gonna be
treated like first class citizens.

76
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.350
They're gonna be our our entry point for
our controllers and our views now.

77
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.380
And along with other
pieces of functionality,

78
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.840
we'll be able to create a component,
and these components are gonna

79
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.970
allow us to have better flexibility,
reusability.

80
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.190
We can share these components.

81
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.510
I can take it from my application and
stick in your application and

82
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.350
it should work the same if we have
the same built system and dependencies and

83
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.420
stuff like that.

84
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.510
And it's really great for
better organization and

85
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.950
collaboration with teams and stuff.

86
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.125
Because you can have different people
working on different components without

87
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.130
conflicting each other or
waiting on each other.

88
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.040
So it's a little a bit easier there.

89
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.450
So any questions on that?

90
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.900
So it's very loose,
this is not web components, all right.

91
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.728
So it's not like, we're not gonna be here
building Shattle Down and Polymer and

92
00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:32.440
X-Tags and all that stuff.

93
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.440
So this is not web components but
the concept is very much the same.

94
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.620
All right, so
it's a very loosely used term.

95
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.300
Although web components do
adopt the same principle

96
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.550
with like a extra feature of CSS closure,
which we don't have with this.

97
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.630
So components in Angular.

98
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.780
That doesn't mean web components,
like I just said.

99
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.860
Since when I wrote this proposal for this
course it was ES 6 and now it's ES 2015.

100
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.331
So you'll see that you see me
use those words interchangeably.

101
00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:07.622
Probably ES 2015 is the name for
it now but it used to be ES 6 so

102
00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:11.361
now it's ES 2015 and
we'll talk about why that is.

103
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:17.210
So ES 6 2015 makes it really really easy,
first to build with components.

104
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.380
And you'll see why in a minute.

105
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.976
We can build with components in ES 5,
there's nothing wrong with that.

106
00:06:21.976 --> 00:06:26.848
But it's just gonna be a lot
of extra work we have to

107
00:06:26.848 --> 00:06:30.690
do to get that flow that we really want.

108
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.522
And we all know directives, right?

109
00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:34.620
Everybody, no [LAUGH] kind of, little bit?

110
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.188
Well, if you do you know
directives then you're like,

111
00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:42.310
you're there cuz that's like
the hard part in my opinion.

112
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.110
Is like just learning directives which
everybody knows in Angular 1.x is

113
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.030
kind of tough, but if you know directives
then you're pretty much already there

114
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.230
as far as the approach
of building components.

115
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.610
If you don't know directives, that's fine.

116
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.770
I'm gonna show you how to like use the
directives and a way of using components.

117
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.590
We're not gonna get into like advanced
drag and drop physics directly.

118
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.010
We're not gonna do all that stuff.

119
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.710
But, I will show you what
a directive looks like as a entry

120
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.480
point for a component.
