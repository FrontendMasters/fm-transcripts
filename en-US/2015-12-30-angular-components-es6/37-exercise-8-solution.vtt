[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:05.316
&gt;&gt; Scott: Does it feel
good to automate things?

3
00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:10.455
Now you understand why we wrote the same
thing ten times and I had you go

4
00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:16.390
to different levels of difficulty of
writing the same thing ten times.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.424
So you understand exactly how that works.

6
00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:20.998
If we were sort of automated stuff, you
really wouldn't had any clue of why you're

7
00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:23.206
even automating that stuff or
how that even works.

8
00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:26.053
So now you've got some context,
even building components.

9
00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:31.250
Let's look at the solution here.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.049
already have that here.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool, so

11
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:40.410
yeah, so
as far as the control names and stuff.

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.260
UpCase here, right next to the controller.

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.800
So that looks kinda weird, right?

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.440
Cuz you're thinking like JavaScript,
so you're like that just looks weird.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.280
But when you write these
template interpolation,

16
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.480
you have to think it just
like it's just a text file.

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.560
This is just text.

18
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.850
Forget about the colors, forget about
the indentation, forget about the spacing,

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.590
the keywords, it's just text.

20
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.450
So, replace this text with
whatever variable there is and

21
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.604
put it right next to this text,
which is exactly what we want.

22
00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:11.130
So, that would be whatever the name is,
uppercase, controller.

23
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.005
So, that's how you have to think
when you write these templates.

24
00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:16.565
&gt;&gt; Scott: Same thing here,

25
00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:17.860
import the style.

26
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.490
Just the name.style.

27
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.995
Boom.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Right?

28
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.567
&gt;&gt; Scott: Component js,

29
00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.190
input our directive.

30
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.033
Tricky thing here, is make sure
we keep the brackets around it.

31
00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.820
&gt;&gt; Scott: Got the name, got the directive.

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.635
Same thing here.
Name.directive and then down below,

33
00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.597
just double up, name, directive.

34
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.100
&gt;&gt; Scott: And the spec was already there.

35
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.014
And the component.style is already there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a couple

36
00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:06.503
errors I found.
&gt;&gt; Scott: A couple errors, where at?

37
00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:11.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So component.directive

38
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.950
touches,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes.

39
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.322
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If to your upCaseName

40
00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:17.313
you need that,

41
00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:21.903
it's upCaseName control, as controller.
&gt;&gt; Scott: That is so

42
00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:26.630
true, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

43
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.322
then, in component.spec.js.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Component.spec,

44
00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:32.723
uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is a stupid one.

45
00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:35.619
Directive needs to be uppercase.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, that's also true,

46
00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:44.029
good eye.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Suite.

47
00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:50.880
So now, let's test this out so
if we say gulp, I already have it.

48
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.868
Gulp, component I wanna use compund again.

49
00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:56.070
Run that, boom.

50
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.150
I'm not even gonna look at it just to
see that if it works the way it should.

51
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.850
I was just gonna go to app.js.

52
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.198
So it copy one of these,
we're gonna change it from admin to about.

53
00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.595
&gt;&gt; Scott: I'm gonna come now here and

54
00:03:11.595 --> 00:03:17.130
we're gonna say about.name and
then if I redirect or

55
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.082
I do npm start.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Now

56
00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:28.050
if I go to slash about I should see
something, if everything works.

57
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.725
So, let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You didn't change the path

58
00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:33.834
of the navigation.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I didn't change

59
00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.227
the path?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In

60
00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:37.257
the navigator.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

61
00:03:37.257 --> 00:03:37.886
I'm doing it right now.

62
00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:38.590
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

63
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Boom.

64
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.020
Hey, from the AboutController.

65
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.230
That's pretty awesome,
I didn't have to look at the folder.

66
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.080
It just works.

67
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.059
Thanks for those fixes.
It wouldn't work without those fixes.

68
00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.454
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

69
00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:54.006
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, so that's how awesome

70
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:58.415
automation is, that's look like I don't
know, three key strokes to do that versus

71
00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:02.263
15 minutes of copying and pasting,
cuz I found out that as I was like,

72
00:04:02.263 --> 00:04:05.713
it's the same thing,
I just copy paste from another component.

73
00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:11.800
I found out I actually got stuck at
this one error for like five hours.

74
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.090
I gave up on it.

75
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.020
I had copied a components module
into another components module.

76
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.620
I forgot to change the name of the module
and what happens was whichever

77
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.310
one got registered later will overwrite
the previous one, and I couldn't figure

78
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.260
out what was going on and it was because I
forgot to change the names of the modules.

79
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.700
Copy and paste is dangerous.

80
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.787
So that's why this
component thing is pretty

81
00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:35.764
legit.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now,

82
00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:38.734
if you wanted to add some extra
functionality, you come here and

83
00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:42.034
you know add your extra functionality
wherever whatever whatever, or

84
00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:45.290
if you wanted to you could come
down here with some other ideas.

85
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.240
You can extend this task to
take in other flags to be like,

86
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.440
maybe you want to enable routing,
yes or no?

87
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.240
So yargs.routing, so
you can have routing on or off.

88
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.440
By default we had it on, but
you can come in and cut it on or

89
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.987
off and then when you go into your
file which is like component.js,

90
00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:10.860
you can do an if statement here too.

91
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.635
So you can come in here and
say like only if they want routing.

92
00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:18.605
So you can come here and you can say,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Or

93
00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:20.920
how does this work in here?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

94
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I and O equals thank

95
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.530
you.
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's exactly right.

96
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.307
So you can say like if
&gt;&gt; Scott: Routing and

97
00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:35.297
you do something like,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's weird.

98
00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:37.554
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah it's really weird right,

99
00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:42.401
but yeah, you can do something like this,
so if routing, do this and

100
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.335
then something like that.

101
00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:45.294
I don't exactly that's what this.

102
00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:50.614
I usually change interpolation to not use
the less than, greater than equal sign.

103
00:05:50.614 --> 00:05:52.006
I use it to change the interpolation.

104
00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:55.452
You can change the low dash interpretation
engine to use whatever you want.

105
00:05:55.452 --> 00:06:00.657
I usually use that E61, I change it to use
that one instead so it's better to me.

106
00:06:00.657 --> 00:06:03.503
But yeah you can say no if routing
then do this routing here.

107
00:06:03.503 --> 00:06:06.412
And in fact when you start doing is
you're building something like yeoman.

108
00:06:06.412 --> 00:06:07.776
This is how yeoman works.

109
00:06:07.776 --> 00:06:09.470
It works just like this.

110
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.870
If you're build a yeoman scaffold,
just like this.

111
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.070
I use the same theme to get it.

112
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.756
So you can do that.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Pretty cool, or

113
00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:21.816
if you really want to get advanced, you
could do exactly what Yeoman does and you

114
00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:25.831
could have like commands that pop up in
the terminal that ask you what you want.

115
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:29.263
So if you type in gulp component and you
want to pass it on the flags, you can say,

116
00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.838
gulp component, and it will ask you,
do you want routing?

117
00:06:31.838 --> 00:06:33.380
Yes or no?

118
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.640
What's the name?
Type in the name.

119
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.469
What's this?

120
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:36.946
Type that, hit enter and be done.

121
00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:39.611
So that's not gonna turn out to pass and
it flags like this.

122
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:42.660
So it's up to you.
&gt;&gt; Scott: But

123
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.480
there are plugins for
that just like gold commander.

124
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.470
I think this is a thing.
