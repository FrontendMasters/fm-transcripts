[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So now what we're
gonna do is write some tests.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.182
So if you go to blog_spec.js,
everybody's like no tests no,

4
00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:19.482
no it's gonna be fine, its gonna be fine.

5
00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:26.913
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So what I want you to
do in here, there's a couple to dos.

6
00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:31.696
I already wrote like one test and
I'm showing you like mock stuff out.

7
00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:33.634
So I'm gonna show you how to
run the tests and what not.

8
00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.835
But what I want you to do
is you're gonna go in and

9
00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.303
you're gonna write some tests for
the directives, for the controller and

10
00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.290
yes you're going to write a test for
the template.

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.220
How you do that, I don't know.

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.850
But you're going to do it.

13
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.920
Figure it out, get crazy.

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.670
It's a string, you have a string with some
with HTML in it, make some assertions.

15
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.424
I know you can do it.

16
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.240
I know you're capable.

17
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.688
So, how to run the test if we go here and
type in npm test, did I set that up?

18
00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:03.322
Yeah I did.

19
00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:08.134
No, what happened here?

20
00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.751
Let me do an npm install, okay.

21
00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:21.271
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, it looks like
I forgot to install some stuff.

22
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:26.542
Also of yours doesn't work I'm gonna
have to come sit down with the exam,

23
00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:32.333
I know the latest version of karma breaks
everything so I have to revert back.

24
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.962
No don't do that again.

25
00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:37.122
I guess it is install one more time.

26
00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:39.849
Yeah, so the latest version of
karma breaks everything I found it

27
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:40.599
out two days ago.

28
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.642
It's took me a while but it will not work
on any of the stuff that were using.

29
00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:52.667
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay let's see, no.

30
00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:56.474
Where is this,
yeah of course it doesn't work.

31
00:01:56.474 --> 00:02:00.615
That's, yeah it doesn't work and that's
because this is the solution branch.

32
00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:05.250
Yeah you got to fix this stuff, so
how it will look if it did work.

33
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.432
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Step-4-fix is this.

34
00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:17.679
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So if you run npm test,

35
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.694
you'll see that karma
starts spitting stuff out.

36
00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:22.879
It's sitting there,
it's bundling all the test files,

37
00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.454
which in this case I think is just one and
then it ran all the tests.

38
00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:29.360
So I have like six or seven tests in
that file, and it ran it and was like,

39
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.720
here's the results.

40
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480
But it actually ran it in Chrome,
and I'll show you.

41
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.730
So if I had to run it again,
let me back up.

42
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.270
You'll see Chrome pop up there's Chrome.

43
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.650
That's running our tests in the browser.

44
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.610
Boom, and it's done and it closed Chrome.

45
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.390
All right, kind of scary, right?

46
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.620
But yeah, that's what's happening.

47
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.850
So once you see all green here,
you're good.

48
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.028
So not only do you have to write some
tests, but if you go into karma,

49
00:02:57.028 --> 00:02:59.222
conf.js, that's a solution.

50
00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:01.478
I don't want to show you that.

51
00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:04.850
If you go to karma conf.js, there's some
stuff in there that you have to fix.

52
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.690
Yeah this files kind of scary looking.

53
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.492
Yeah it's a scary looking file I know but
you need to fix this file, and I have.

54
00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:21.670
So the first thing you need
to do is in this files array

55
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.570
to figure out what files
to pass in right here.

56
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.990
So remember,
I said Webpack bundles all your files.

57
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.310
So remember that.

58
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.510
There's also a new file in
the rules application somewhere.

59
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.570
You should look for it.

60
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.120
It's right here, spec.bundled.js.

61
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.117
So if you look there that's
part of the file you need and

62
00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:46.260
then you also need to,
there's a hit right there too.

63
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.820
You also need to hook
up these loaders here.

64
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.590
So we're literally making a new
web pack config just like we did

65
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.780
in webpack config.js but for our tests.

66
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.680
So, think about everything
the test is going to use.

67
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.140
So, lets go look at blog.spec.js.

68
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.890
It's using all this, it's importing blog,
blog directive, template.

69
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.620
It's import everything our app imports.

70
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.620
It's the same loaders.

71
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.190
It needs the styles, it needs everything.

72
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.726
Except there's a small difference and
at webpack config.

73
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.089
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I put this in to ignore all
JavaScript files, so we can't use this

74
00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.540
config cuz it won't work or
in fact we can't use this test assertion.

75
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.140
So our webpack config.

76
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.306
Inside our karma.js or karma conf.js
is gonna look very similar to this,

77
00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:38.100
except it doesn't exclude spec files.

78
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.820
So that's a little hint.

79
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.871
And then.

80
00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:48.111
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah it's
all you have to do in here.

81
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:51.689
So do that, write yourself some tests and

82
00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.778
run in npm tests to test it and
see if they pass and

83
00:04:55.778 --> 00:05:00.910
if you can't get them to pass,
write the code make it pass.
