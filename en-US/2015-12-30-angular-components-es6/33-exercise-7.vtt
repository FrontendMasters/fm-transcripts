[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.114
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Question in terms of,

3
00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:08.310
the next thing is going to be
writing our own component.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.330
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes, it is.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.460
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Okay, I guess my question
is around, how do you start doing that?

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820
Do you start from the top to the bottom?

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.930
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There's some notes in
there, but yeah, we can talk about that.

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.466
So let's jump right into it then.

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:27.222
So if you go to,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Check out step seven.

10
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.407
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And actually, I'll just
show you what you're gonna be making.

11
00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:43.938
That way, you have an idea.

12
00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:55.637
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There's one more thing I
wanted to show you too before we move on

13
00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:58.080
that I think is pretty cool.

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.769
So what you're gonna be making is
notice there's another link up here

15
00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:03.967
that says admin.

16
00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:06.719
And if you click on it,
it takes you to this app, and

17
00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.980
it allows you to create a post.

18
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.904
So you can say hey hey.

19
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:15.750
And you can write this post here,
and then you can just hit done.

20
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.110
And it'll post it.

21
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.717
And if you go search for
it, it's right there.

22
00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.732
All right, so you're gonna be making that.

23
00:01:24.732 --> 00:01:28.851
So it's a lot of stuff, but the UI stuff
is there, so don't worry about the CSS and

24
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:32.377
the UI and all the interaction,
all that stuff's there cuz you'll be

25
00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:34.871
making all the JavaScript and
the connections.

26
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:41.238
So as far as getting started with it,
the way I approached it,

27
00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:45.043
let me check back out to the regular.

28
00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:50.880
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The way I would approach
this is start at the very root.

29
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.310
So we know this is like a sibling.

30
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.480
If you go look in the components,
we know this is gonna be a sibling.

31
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.330
It's already right there, it says admin.

32
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.120
It's a sibling of blog,
blogpost, comment, home.

33
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.640
So that means it's probably
gonna be resonate app.js.

34
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.070
So I go there, and
I registered there first.

35
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.080
And then if I was lost, I'd run it.

36
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.246
I'd run the code and see what it says.

37
00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:11.920
It'll throw an error, I'll fix the error.

38
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.850
But if I know what I'm doing, I'd go into
admin, and I'll start the entry file for

39
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.840
that, which is admin.js.

40
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.513
I start there, I'll do some stuff.

41
00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.248
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then depending
on what admin.js wasn't importing,

42
00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:28.432
I go to that file that's being imported.

43
00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:32.705
And I'll start there, and then from
that file, whatever is being imported,

44
00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:35.500
I'll work on that stuff,
just like the way JavaScript reads it.

45
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.410
It will start at the root,
it will go through all the imports.

46
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.010
That's exactly how I would do it.

47
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.650
Start at the very, very root, go through
all the imports, run it, keep running it

48
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.089
until there is no more errors and until
it looks the way it's supposed to look.

49
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.330
And then that's how I know I'm done.

50
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.780
Whereas if you just jump in and
start messing around with different files,

51
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.250
you might get kind of lost.

52
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.256
So if you followed the way
JavaScript follows it,

53
00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:57.519
then you know that's the way
you're supposed to do it.

54
00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.940
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So again, you're gonna
come in here, you're gonna do some stuff.

55
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.560
Yeah, the directives are not
even there on purpose.

56
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.015
There are some tests in here,
make some tests, please.

57
00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.337
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you don't
know how to do the test,

58
00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:17.420
just literally go copy the blog one,
and make some tests.

59
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.005
We did the blog one yesterday,
so it's a good starter.

60
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.460
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then, what else,
there's some other things in here.

61
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.470
Yeah, I wanted to show you one thing from
the last step that I didn't show you,

62
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.560
which I thought was pretty cool.

63
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.460
Which was, if you go to blogPosts,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, where did I do it?

64
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.515
Hold on.

65
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:46.750
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm importing it,
image somewhere.

66
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.970
I thought I was, maybe I'm not.

67
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.421
Or is it blog, yeah, it's blog.

68
00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:56.825
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There it is.

69
00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:00.345
So if you go to blog.controller.js,
I changed something around.

70
00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:04.897
Before, I just put the images as sources
on an image tag, those cat images,

71
00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:07.295
these things, as source tags.

72
00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:11.968
Or actually, if you go look at it now,
you inspect the element.

73
00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.925
It's not,
that's definitely not the source of it.

74
00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:17.840
I didn't write that in there.

75
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.750
Where did that come from?

76
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.980
That was computed, obviously.

77
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.032
That's a computed value.

78
00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:22.370
I didn't type that in there.

79
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.320
So how did that happen,
and why did I change it?

80
00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:27.807
If you also go look at
the output of webpack,

81
00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:30.075
it says it created these three files.

82
00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:36.167
It created this jpeg file,
it created bundle.js and bundle.js.map.

83
00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.725
And then if we go look at the disk folder,

84
00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:41.205
you'll see there's an image
right there with a long name.

85
00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:49.750
So webpack made this, and it's because
in blog.controller.js, I imported it.

86
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.460
I imported the image.

87
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.855
The reason I did that is because I
just wanted to do it because it was

88
00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:55.592
pretty cool.

89
00:04:55.592 --> 00:04:59.845
But yeah, [LAUGH] I imported the image,
and I just attached it to this.

90
00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:05.870
And then inside the template,
I just say vm.catpic imgsource, right?

91
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.598
So just an example of how you can import
other things other than HTML, CSS, and

92
00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:11.929
JavaScript files,
you can also import images.

93
00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:15.688
And this value right here,
the variable, will be the name,

94
00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:19.094
the computed name of that
image that webpack creates.

95
00:05:19.094 --> 00:05:20.237
Pretty cool.

96
00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:27.060
But anyway, you will be working
on the admin stuff, so get to it.

97
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.702
A little less hand-holding here, I mean,
the directive's like not even there.

98
00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:35.168
And in admin.html, it says don't touch.

99
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.996
So unless you really like HTML, and
you're just like really into that,

100
00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:40.205
just don't touch it.

101
00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:44.510
Cuz it's some really sensitive stuff
going on here with the forms, and

102
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.170
the forms have to be right.

103
00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.938
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: For instance,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There's validation

104
00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:59.330
on the forms, so you can't submit unless
you type in a title and an actual post.

105
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.050
So if you start changing stuff around,
you'll mess that validation up.

106
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.128
If we go over here,
see the button's like all grayed out?

107
00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:08.860
You can't really press it.

108
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.000
But as soon as you start typing and
it's correct, it'll fade in.

109
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.260
So it'll mess this up if
you start doing that.

110
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.070
So go ahead, work on the admin stuff.

111
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.450
And then after this,
we'll get into automation,

112
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.369
which is gonna be really awesome, I think.

113
00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:33.098
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We should totally turn
this into a blogging platform though.

114
00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:35.911
[LAUGH] I would write a blogger,

115
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:42.600
I need some more editor's buttons up here,
but it could be a blog.

116
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.240
Or maybe this was a mark down.

117
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.526
That's what I should have done.
I should have made this mark down and

118
00:06:46.526 --> 00:06:47.080
not text.

119
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.380
That would have been better.
