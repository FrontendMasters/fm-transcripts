00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.827
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:09.542
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What's next is,
if we go to the repo and

3
00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:15.431
you do a git checkout, let me do a stash,

4
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:19.071
checkout step-2, and

5
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:24.286
if you do this and you run npm start.

6
00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:28.592
You'll see that there's a lot of
stuff that's printed out on TODO.

7
00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:32.947
It says, TODO, do this, TODO, do this, and
it tells you what file that TODO is in, so

8
00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:35.299
it's telling you exactly
what you need to do.

9
00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.379
So let's just walk through
what we need to do here.

10
00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.462
What we're gonna do is, we're gonna
learn how to import dependencies.

11
00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:43.339
We talked about how to do that
with npm and Node modules, so

12
00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.947
we need to import Angular and stuff,
we need to register those modules.

13
00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.819
And there's also some other
stuff that we need to import.

14
00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.031
All the files have the comments in
them that tell you exactly what needs

15
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:54.060
to be done.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.370
So you can check it out.

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.930
So let's just go look at
some of that stuff now.

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.570
Yes, reload.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.235
So you might have noticed
that in the app folder,

20
00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:03.510
there's a lot more files in there now.

21
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.290
There's a app.styl file.

22
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.350
There's a components
folder with a home folder.

23
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.180
What's going on in here?

24
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.230
So if we go look in app.js,
we see some Angular boilerplate.

25
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.240
It's got a TODO in here, it's like,
you need to do this stuff.

26
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.276
So, import angular, and
other dependencies like app.styl,

27
00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:25.574
normalize.css components/home, ui-router.

28
00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:27.575
And then we need to register
that stuff on here.

29
00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:28.953
This one's gonna be pretty tricky.

30
00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:31.683
I'm curious to see what people do here.

31
00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:36.571
And then home.js, this is also saying,
we need to import required modules.

32
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.264
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is
the branch that you went to?

33
00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:42.688
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: step-2.

34
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:49.320
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
we also need to export the stuff.

35
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.190
And then don't forget index.html.

36
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.610
It's still Angular, and
we still need our Angular stuff.

37
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.397
So don't forget about ng-app and
all that other stuff.

38
00:01:59.397 --> 00:02:01.059
So remember that,
we still need that stuff too.

39
00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:13.855
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So again, if you look,
if you run npm start on step-2,

40
00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:18.535
the branch step-2, you'll see a list
of todos that you need to do, and

41
00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:20.796
what file, on what line they are.

42
00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:27.372
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes, you can just look
at step-2-fix and see the solution, but

43
00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:31.874
that would be cheating, and you just won't
be doing yourself service if you did that,

44
00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:33.720
so don't do it.

45
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.063
So I highly recommend just struggling for
a little bit and asking me so

46
00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:37.994
I can help you out.

47
00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:44.460
Because I promise you,
that's how you gonna learn.

48
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.167
So what that's gonna look like,
if you completed it, would be this.

49
00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:09.581
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It would be,
you should see this if you completed it.

50
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.959
You'll see, Welcome to the blog, and

51
00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.550
then a list of items on the page.

52
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm totally sorry,
but I had to fix something.

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.484
Where did you say to find our
list of todo's, basically?

54
00:03:23.484 --> 00:03:25.917
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, so
are you on the branch step-2?

55
00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:26.552
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

56
00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:28.696
then from the command line,
if you run npm start,

57
00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:31.212
it'll print them out right
there in the terminal for you.

58
00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:34.968
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

59
00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:37.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No problem.

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.302
So yeah,
this is what you'll see if you're done.

61
00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:44.438
You'll just see a page that says,
Welcome to the blog!, and a list of items.

62
00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:49.354
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How long
would be the exercise?

63
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.942
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exercise is 30 minutes,
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting that, yes.

64
00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:04.246
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You're exporting
the style sheets as a module?

65
00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:07.703
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so remember,
webpack treats everything as a module.

66
00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:09.830
So here's a clue.

67
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.435
Here's a clue.

68
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:13.790
So this question was,
we're exporting style sheets as a module.

69
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.577
If you go look at webpack.config.js,

70
00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:24.362
there is a loader for
Stylus files and CSS files.

71
00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:27.378
All right, so what's happening here is,
it says, hey, if you check,

72
00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:30.350
if anything comes in as a style file,
this is what I want you to do.

73
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.470
First, I want you to run it through the
Stylus loader, which compiles it to CSS.

74
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.470
And then I want you to run
it through the CSS loader,

75
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.660
which resolves any URLs there might
be in there like font URLs or

76
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.310
whatever URLs you might have in there,
image URLs.

77
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.791
And then I want you to run
it through the style loader,

78
00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:48.625
which sticks it on the head of the page.

79
00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:49.654
That's what that does.

80
00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:53.639
So just by importing a styles file,
it will do all that stuff, and

81
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.817
you don't have to write a link tag.

82
00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:56.715
It's pretty trippy.

83
00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:58.209
But yes.

84
00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:01.007
But importing it is gonna be really,
really hard, cuz I didn't tell you how.

85
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:02.264
I did that on purpose.

86
00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:05.559
[LAUGH].

87
00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.684
Cuz if this thing is gonna
be placed in the head,

88
00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:11.263
then why do you need a variable to import
it, what are you doing with a variable?

89
00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:12.076
And what do you call it?

90
00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:12.887
It's not a module.

91
00:05:12.887 --> 00:05:16.409
But like, woah, yeah, it's really trippy.

92
00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.971
But if you look at the documentation,
you'll find out in two seconds, so.

93
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:25.300
Yeah, so it's a little new concept, and
you start bringing in CSS files into your

94
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.773
JavaScript and start bringing in
HTML files in your JavaScript.

95
00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:31.086
You're like, wait,
this is a little backwards.

96
00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:33.347
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [INAUDIBLE]
JavaScript modules,

97
00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:37.146
but [INAUDIBLE] I didn't even
know you could [INAUDIBLE].

98
00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:39.794
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
anything, like, even images.

99
00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:41.820
We'll start importing images too.

100
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.790
And you'll see, wait,
how does that even work?

101
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.370
You'll see.

102
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.154
I didn't realize until I started using it,
I was like, wow, this is amazing,

103
00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:49.010
this is amazing.
