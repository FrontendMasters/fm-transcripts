00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.827
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:09.542
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What's next is,
if we go to the repo and

3
00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:15.431
you do a git checkout, let me do a stash,

4
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:19.071
checkout step-2, and

5
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:24.286
if you do this and you run npm start.

6
00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:28.592
You'll see that there's a lot of
stuff that's printed out on TODO.

7
00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:32.947
It says, TODO, do this, TODO, do this, and
it tells you what file that TODO is in, so

8
00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:35.299
it's telling you exactly
what you need to do.

9
00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.379
So let's just walk through
what we need to do here.

10
00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.462
What we're gonna do is, we're gonna
learn how to import dependencies.

11
00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:43.339
We talked about how to do that
with npm and Node modules, so

12
00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.947
we need to import Angular and stuff,
we need to register those modules.

13
00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.819
And there's also some other
stuff that we need to import.

14
00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.031
All the files have the comments in
them that tell you exactly what needs

15
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:54.060
to be done.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.370
So you can check it out.

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.930
So let's just go look at
some of that stuff now.

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.570
Yes, reload.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.235
So you might have noticed
that in the app folder,

20
00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:03.510
there's a lot more files in there now.

21
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.290
There's a app.styl file.

22
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.350
There's a components
folder with a home folder.

23
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.180
What's going on in here?

24
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.230
So if we go look in app.js,
we see some Angular boilerplate.

25
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.240
It's got a TODO in here, it's like,
you need to do this stuff.

26
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.276
So, import angular, and
other dependencies like app.styl,

27
00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:25.574
normalize.css components/home, ui-router.

28
00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:27.575
And then we need to register
that stuff on here.

29
00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:28.953
This one's gonna be pretty tricky.

30
00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:31.683
I'm curious to see what people do here.

31
00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:34.273
And then home.js, this is also saying,

32
00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:39.726
we need to import required modules.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What

33
00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:42.688
is the branch that you went to?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: step-2.

34
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:48.551
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And we also need to

35
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:49.320
export the stuff.

36
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.190
And then don't forget index.html.

37
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.610
It's still Angular, and
we still need our Angular stuff.

38
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.397
So don't forget about ng-app and
all that other stuff.

39
00:01:59.397 --> 00:02:01.059
So remember that,
we still need that stuff too.

40
00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:11.707
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So again, if you look,

41
00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:15.314
if you run npm start on step-2,
the branch step-2,

42
00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:19.302
you'll see a list of todos that
you need to do, and what file,

43
00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:24.226
on what line they are.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes,

44
00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:28.667
you can just look at step-2-fix and see
the solution, but that would be cheating,

45
00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:33.720
and you just won't be doing yourself
service if you did that, so don't do it.

46
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.063
So I highly recommend just struggling for
a little bit and asking me so

47
00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:37.994
I can help you out.

48
00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:44.460
Because I promise you,
that's how you gonna learn.

49
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.167
So what that's gonna look like,
if you completed it, would be this.

50
00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:03.916
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It would be,

51
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:09.581
you should see this if you completed it.

52
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.959
You'll see, Welcome to the blog, and

53
00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.405
then a list of items on the page.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm totally sorry,

54
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:20.080
but I had to fix something.

55
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.484
Where did you say to find our
list of todo's, basically?

56
00:03:23.484 --> 00:03:24.091
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, so

57
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:26.399
are you on the branch step-2?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

58
00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:27.471
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then from the command

59
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:30.945
line, if you run npm start, it'll print
them out right there in the terminal for

60
00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:34.968
you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

61
00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:37.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No problem.

62
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.302
So yeah,
this is what you'll see if you're done.

63
00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:43.554
You'll just see a page that says,
Welcome to the blog!, and

64
00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:47.886
a list of items.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How

65
00:03:47.886 --> 00:03:50.727
long would be the exercise?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exercise is 30 minutes,

66
00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.942
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting that, yes.

67
00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:02.223
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You're exporting the style

68
00:04:02.223 --> 00:04:04.643
sheets as a module?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,

69
00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:07.703
so remember,
webpack treats everything as a module.

70
00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:09.830
So here's a clue.

71
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.435
Here's a clue.

72
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:13.790
So this question was,
we're exporting style sheets as a module.

73
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.577
If you go look at webpack.config.js,

74
00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:24.362
there is a loader for
Stylus files and CSS files.

75
00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:27.378
All right, so what's happening here is,
it says, hey, if you check,

76
00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:30.350
if anything comes in as a style file,
this is what I want you to do.

77
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.470
First, I want you to run it through the
Stylus loader, which compiles it to CSS.

78
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.470
And then I want you to run
it through the CSS loader,

79
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.660
which resolves any URLs there might
be in there like font URLs or

80
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.310
whatever URLs you might have in there,
image URLs.

81
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.791
And then I want you to run
it through the style loader,

82
00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:48.625
which sticks it on the head of the page.

83
00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:49.654
That's what that does.

84
00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:53.639
So just by importing a styles file,
it will do all that stuff, and

85
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.817
you don't have to write a link tag.

86
00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:56.715
It's pretty trippy.

87
00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:58.209
But yes.

88
00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:01.007
But importing it is gonna be really,
really hard, cuz I didn't tell you how.

89
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:02.264
I did that on purpose.

90
00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:05.559
[LAUGH].

91
00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.684
Cuz if this thing is gonna
be placed in the head,

92
00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:11.263
then why do you need a variable to import
it, what are you doing with a variable?

93
00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:12.076
And what do you call it?

94
00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:12.887
It's not a module.

95
00:05:12.887 --> 00:05:16.409
But like, woah, yeah, it's really trippy.

96
00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.971
But if you look at the documentation,
you'll find out in two seconds, so.

97
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:25.300
Yeah, so it's a little new concept, and
you start bringing in CSS files into your

98
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.773
JavaScript and start bringing in
HTML files in your JavaScript.

99
00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:29.793
You're like, wait,

100
00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.621
this is a little backwards.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [INAUDIBLE] JavaScript

101
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:37.146
modules, but [INAUDIBLE] I didn't
even know you could [INAUDIBLE].

102
00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:38.390
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, anything,

103
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.794
like, even images.

104
00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:41.820
We'll start importing images too.

105
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.790
And you'll see, wait,
how does that even work?

106
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.370
You'll see.

107
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.154
I didn't realize until I started using it,
I was like, wow, this is amazing,

108
00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:49.010
this is amazing.
