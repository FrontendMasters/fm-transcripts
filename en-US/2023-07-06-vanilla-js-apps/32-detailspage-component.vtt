00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.364
So the next step is to fill
DetailsPage.js, okay?

2
00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:09.440
That right now is empty, but this is
another case where we can copy and paste,

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.461
because it's more of the same thing.

4
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.713
So we can go forward.

5
00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:22.679
This is the one where we
can copy this code and

6
00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.710
then maybe analyze the code,

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.590
that's details page code.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.220
So they see because it's a page,
we're going to use shadow DOM.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.509
We are reading the template,
cloning the template, loading the style.

10
00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:44.339
So you can see this is the same
code as we did for the menu page.

11
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.539
And then what I have
in connectedCallback,

12
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.986
is a call to renderData and
render data is just this code,

13
00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:59.342
that will check if we do have
a product ID set in dataset.

14
00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:03.869
We are going, and by the way let's
check if we call this product ID or ID.

15
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.270
How do I check that?

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.635
When we verify the body here.

17
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:18.173
Let's go to the home,
I think it's the default one,

18
00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:21.447
I don't know why it's-
&gt;&gt; I think it's an app.js go to

19
00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.172
the brackets we import.

20
00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:26.308
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know why I
have it a different way, but

21
00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:28.773
I just can delete the default as well.

22
00:01:28.773 --> 00:01:30.904
Let me check if that works.

23
00:01:30.904 --> 00:01:35.474
Yep, so I'm going to paste the code,
and in this case,

24
00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:40.748
because I didn't use default export,
I will just delete that.

25
00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:44.522
If not, I need to change my app.js,
it's not a big deal.

26
00:01:44.522 --> 00:01:46.642
And the code seems pretty straightforward.

27
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:50.552
This constructor,
even if it feels like a lot of code,

28
00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:54.972
it's the same code that we had
in menu page for, in this case,

29
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:59.905
creating a shadow DOM,
loading the template, and loading the CSS.

30
00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:04.701
And then we have a renderData
that is verifying for

31
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:09.607
a dataset.productId,
that we can check if we have it.

32
00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:13.913
So you can see it's giving me
an invalid product ID in an alert,

33
00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.795
that is kind of this alert.

34
00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:16.787
Why is that?

35
00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:19.750
Because we didn't call it product ID.

36
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.317
If you remember when we were inspecting
the DOM, this was actually ID.

37
00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:28.217
How do I know that?

38
00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:35.134
Well, you can actually inspect here and
see that it says data-id.

39
00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.190
That's actually set in the router.

40
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.706
If we want to define this as product ID,
well we go to the router,

41
00:02:46.134 --> 00:02:51.519
And we match that instead of ID, productId.

42
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.441
Make sense?

43
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:56.556
So now, when we are here.

44
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:04.535
We can click in the details and
we get into a details page.

45
00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.753
The details page has a button,

46
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:12.225
Add to Cart that right now is doing
nothing more than sending us to the order.

47
00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.327
In fact, it has at one point,

48
00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:20.926
when we get into the details page,
it has here a todo.

49
00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:30.102
So now we have a homepage with a list of
products, and we can get into the details.
