00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.945
So for Shadow DOM then we go to menu
page JS and we create the shadow DOM.

2
00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.714
Typically you create the shadow
DOM in the constructor, okay?

3
00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:17.486
So one way is to create
a property in your own object,

4
00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:22.150
in your own class,
that says this attach shadow and

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.257
it receives an object,
where we set mode open or close.

6
00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:30.408
Remember, this is a way to define,

7
00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:36.650
if you want the outside to access
your inner DOM or not, okay?

8
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.979
And then after I've done this,
it's important to change.

9
00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.210
Where are we appending the content?

10
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.117
Now, it shouldn't be this,
it shouldn't be this route, that's all.

11
00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:55.070
In fact now, you can go back and
put this if you want in the constructor.

12
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.669
You don't need to,
it's up to you where you wanna do this.

13
00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:03.220
Because now you are not adding children
to yourself, but to the shadow DOM.

14
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.110
That is like a different document,
a different thing, Okay?

15
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.472
Now, you can see that the best coffee in
town is still black, the default color.

16
00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:18.754
And violet, it doesn't look nice I know.

17
00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:23.654
Violet is only applied to H2,
to my web component.

18
00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:30.211
And let me show you how it looks
like here in the Elements tab.

19
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:33.390
Now, when you open main and
menu page, look at that.

20
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.577
There is like a special,

21
00:01:36.577 --> 00:01:41.523
like situation here that says we have
a shadow root here that is open.

22
00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:46.800
And if I open that one,
we can see its own little DOM.

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.952
It's an isolated document
within my whole document,

24
00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:56.545
that's a web component with Shadow DOM,
okay?

25
00:01:56.545 --> 00:02:01.180
Where the styles are only
applied to that element.

26
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.162
That's a web component with Shadow DOM.

27
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.898
I'm going to delete the style that violet,
you were expecting that, right?

28
00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.040
You don't like the violet?

29
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.233
Yeah, we have a question.

30
00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:19.353
&gt;&gt; Why don't you put
the template in the JS file, and

31
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:22.260
then just use some kind
of render function?

32
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.349
&gt;&gt; So the template is HTML, so
I'm not sure what you were thinking about

33
00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.378
how to put this in JavaScript,
maybe in a string, you were saying.

34
00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:34.698
So maybe something like this.

35
00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:41.279
Can we, yes, if you're doing this,
you don't need the template,

36
00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:47.532
you can just put this and
then use inner HTML, it's another way.

37
00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:51.230
And then you don't use the template
elements at all, it's another way.

38
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.263
But yeah, this is not HTML, so

39
00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:57.500
you don't have validation from
the IDE because it's a string.

40
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.350
But if you wanna do that,
go ahead, so you can do that.

41
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.327
Yeah, sure, or you can load it from from
an external file using the Fetch API.

42
00:03:10.327 --> 00:03:13.087
Remember, we are not in JSX, so

43
00:03:13.087 --> 00:03:18.090
I cannot write HTML like
directly in JavaScript, okay?

44
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.229
Can we use JSX with this?

45
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.430
Yeah, you can use JSX without React.

46
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.478
But yeah, in that case,
you will need a build process anyway and

47
00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:33.889
set up the JSX factory to work
with the DOM, but you can.

48
00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.694
So you can mix, so you can make your own
decisions here, that's the good part,

49
00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:39.933
also the bad parts.
