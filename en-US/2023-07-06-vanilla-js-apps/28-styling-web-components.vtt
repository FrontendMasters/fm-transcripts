00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.534
Okay, so now we know Shadow DOM and
all the stuff.

2
00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:05.857
What about the style sheets?

3
00:00:05.857 --> 00:00:09.874
Because I do have a CSS file for

4
00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:14.385
the Menu Page, MenuPage.css.

5
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:19.448
How can we load this and
apply it to my web component?

6
00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:24.810
Well, believe me that after all these
parts, everything will work magically.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.019
So we need to load the CSS,
where community constructor,

8
00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.796
in connected callback, how?

9
00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:35.110
Using the Fetch API.

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.033
So let's say the best way to do
that is to create a function.

11
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.575
That we can call that load CSS.

12
00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:50.720
By the way can I create the function
inside the constructor in JavaScript?

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.302
Yeah, yes, I can, no problem.

14
00:00:56.302 --> 00:01:00.054
Remember functions are just different
kinds of objects in JavaScript.

15
00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:06.703
So it's a variable, in fact, if you don't
like that syntax, you can use this one,

16
00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:12.152
you can use const load CSS equals to,
and it's just the same, okay?

17
00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:17.208
But anyway, I just wanna force your
brain in to see something different.

18
00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:23.706
Why I'm creating a new function,
because I'm going to use fetch,

19
00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:28.494
I'm going to use await,
so I'm going to fetch for

20
00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:32.716
components/MenuPage.css, like that.

21
00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:37.146
I'm going to get that set request and
because it's await I need a sync.

22
00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:41.108
And I cannot convert my
constructor into async so

23
00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:46.626
that's why I need Another function
that by the way, I need to call.

24
00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:51.211
I can also use the little anonymous
function if you want, but anyway.

25
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.172
And when I have that request,
I need to get the text from it.

26
00:01:55.172 --> 00:02:02.355
So I will say something like, okay,
the CSS, it's what text is returning.

27
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.075
That is actually also another promise.

28
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:08.257
Now I'm not reading JSON,
I'm reading text.

29
00:02:08.257 --> 00:02:13.143
What I'm going to do is that I
need to create a styles object

30
00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:18.902
somewhere, For example, here.

31
00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:24.218
I'm going to create a styles
with create element.

32
00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:32.337
Style, and I'm going to attach that style
to my shadow DOM, appendChild(styles).

33
00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:39.511
But it's empty, but now we can fill
the text content of it with our CSS.

34
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.957
It's a little hacky.

35
00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:43.436
Yes, it works.

36
00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:46.084
Do we need to do this on every component?

37
00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:51.060
If you want to use this technique of
loading CSS from an external file, yes.

38
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.196
But remember, this is OOP.

39
00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:59.686
So I can create my base class that will
do this for me on every web component.

40
00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.892
It's not really complicated.

41
00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:07.110
So if this works, and
we hope that it works,

42
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.532
now we have within the shadow DOM and

43
00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:15.909
a style declaration with the style for
that component.

44
00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.033
And again, if you're thinking well,
but we are loading the CSS file,

45
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.904
far away the loading timeline.

46
00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:27.143
So maybe we will have
problems like visual issues

47
00:03:27.143 --> 00:03:33.784
with this you can if you want use
link rel you can use prefetch or

48
00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:38.028
preload and you can pre load that file.

49
00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:42.349
I'm not saying you have to do this,
but just explain that you can do that.

50
00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.967
Components Details page CSS,
as stylesheet.

51
00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:54.977
If you do that, then the browser will
start downloading that CSS as soon as

52
00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:58.545
possible, even if he doesn't know
why you will need that later.

53
00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:02.711
So then when the web component asked for
it it's already there.

54
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.457
Okay so
you can improve that performance later.

55
00:04:07.457 --> 00:04:13.351
Or you can check the style directly in the
template or wherever you wanna use here.

56
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:17.576
If you can use your imagination or
at one point you say I feel that I can use

57
00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:22.225
a library well if you find a library that
targets specifically that problem and

58
00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:24.710
you like it and it's lightweight go ahead
