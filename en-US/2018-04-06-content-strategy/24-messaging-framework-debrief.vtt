00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.140
Okay, so I'm wondering how your
messaging architecture went.

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.080
Who is willing to share?

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.582
I need somebody willing to share.

4
00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:16.360
There's a free donut in it for
you, anybody?

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.670
Well, okay, let's start with this,
what product or service did you work with?

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.860
I'm gonna go,
everybody needs to tell me, yes.

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.150
&gt;&gt; I worked with my own travel website.

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.500
&gt;&gt; With your own travel website.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.740
Tell me about that a little bit.

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.310
&gt;&gt; It's just a silly blog that I do for
fun.

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.510
&gt;&gt; I was noticing all of
the stickers on your laptop

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.660
from all the different
national parks you've been to.

13
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's just over the years, yeah.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great.

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.480
Good, would you mind walking
us through your framework?

16
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.375
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

17
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:47.940
&gt;&gt; Great.

18
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I
have this correct but-

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.791
&gt;&gt; I'm sure it's off to a great start,

20
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:52.710
regardless.

21
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.179
&gt;&gt; So
the first impression is from my users,

22
00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.010
is that I want them to say
I'm entertained by this.

23
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.680
I would like to know more.

24
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.830
My value statement is,
I want them to say to themselves,

25
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.780
this will continue to be interesting, I
would like to continue to visit this site.

26
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.940
And then my proof is that there will
be just improved site traffic overall.

27
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what you've described
is a little bit more of a blog.

28
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.260
I'd say, potentially even a little
bit of a tactical approach, where

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.170
I'm gonna put up a blog, and the primary
goal of this is to entertain people,

30
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.500
right, not to teach necessarily but
it sounds like it's more storytelling.

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.155
&gt;&gt; That and also saying, hey,
I went to this restaurant, whatever,

32
00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:51.432
this place, and
it was great while I was there.

33
00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:52.062
And then for

34
00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:56.048
the person to say, I should also maybe
go there [INAUDIBLE] this place.

35
00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, yep, great, okay.

36
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.634
So it's also to inform, to,

37
00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:07.330
Teach, right?

38
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.660
And then to go and to say,
your proof points would be,

39
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.410
what you were describing your
proof points that it was working.

40
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.610
So you're actually more talking about
your plan for your blog versus messaging.

41
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.490
So what we can do is we can
walk through messaging for you,

42
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.530
because this is actually a great
example that we can use.

43
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.674
So first impression of somebody,
so you do travel and food?

44
00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:32.620
&gt;&gt; Just travel, I happen to eat sometimes.

45
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.175
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Eating is delicious.

46
00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:38.075
Okay, great.

47
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.525
So but the primary is,
it's your travel blog.

48
00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:41.213
Okay, great.

49
00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:44.885
Sometimes I eat.

50
00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:50.056
Okay, so when people hit that blog,
so I'll put myself, I'll be the user.

51
00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:56.060
If I hit a travel blog, my first
impression is typically, what would

52
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.220
make me wanna return to that blog is if
I immediately am like, I wanna go there.

53
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.191
Whatever place is featured that I think,

54
00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.793
I wanna know more about that
place cuz I wanna go there.

55
00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:09.312
So it may be that the first impression
that you're looking for is,

56
00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:14.380
let's say this is an example,
I want to go where she's been.

57
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.652
Okay, that that's the first impression.

58
00:03:15.652 --> 00:03:17.722
Because if that's my first impression,

59
00:03:17.722 --> 00:03:20.320
then I'm gonna wanna
come back to the blog.

60
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.620
Okay, so that matches up kind
of with your tactical plan.

61
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.104
The value statement
could be anything from,

62
00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:34.990
she has similar priorities
when it comes to travel or

63
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.086
for your target audience.

64
00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:43.111
Or she seems to understand how different

65
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:49.480
types of travelers
prioritize different things.

66
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.016
Or she,
I follow a blog called thrifty traveller,

67
00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:58.060
she is always looking for the best deal.

68
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.290
And I know that I can trust her, because
of all the affiliations or whatever, okay?

69
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.580
So then proof points.

70
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.360
What will we demonstrate that we want
them to know or believe is true?

71
00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:14.915
So under those circumstances,
what might be a proof point?

72
00:04:14.915 --> 00:04:17.420
A proof point might be, here's an amazing
in depth review for restaurants in,

73
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.000
here's an amazing in depth review for

74
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.850
restaurants where she has traveled.

75
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.580
Or she has her trips categorized
by different priorities,

76
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.600
like family travel or traveling as
a single person or good for groups, right.

77
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.890
She is speaking in an authoritative
first person, authentic manner,

78
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.520
which means that I feel like I'm
getting to know her and can trust her.

79
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.690
So those would be some proof points to
consider within a messaging architecture,

80
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.030
within a content strategy.

81
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.110
Does that make sense,
the difference between those two things?

82
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.690
Great.

83
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.400
Who else, one other example.

84
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.796
What product or service did you go with?

85
00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:11.626
&gt;&gt; I can share if you want,
but I wrote mine in analogy.

86
00:05:11.626 --> 00:05:13.324
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

87
00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:17.510
&gt;&gt; All right, I saw audience and
first impression, so

88
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.778
I kinda put it in a-
&gt;&gt; Sorry, what's your product or service?

89
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:21.517
&gt;&gt; Like I said,

90
00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:24.270
I wrote the whole thing in an analogy,
&gt;&gt; Okay, in an analogy.

91
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.350
&gt;&gt; Which makes sense for me.

92
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.286
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.
&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like the play,

93
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:29.480
say you're watching a play.

94
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.930
The opening scene that captures
the audience before the slow reveal is,

95
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.405
well, you don't maybe, nevermind.

96
00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:38.693
&gt;&gt; That's why I this.

97
00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:40.130
&gt;&gt; You go for it.

98
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.200
&gt;&gt; I'm always interested to hear different
takes on stuff, so you go ahead.

99
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.090
&gt;&gt; First impression is the opening scene
that captures the audience's attention,

100
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.553
something dramatic or something
entertaining, that initial spark.

101
00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:57.550
And then our value [INAUDIBLE] is now,
I want them to

102
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.480
be engaged and entertained as they browse
throughout the entirety of my website.

103
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.320
So yes, that's what I'm talking about.

104
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.115
And the proof will be finally
finishing the whole slow reveal.

105
00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:14.043
Because I want them to ultimately think,
okay, this seems very sleek and

106
00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:17.890
calm on the surface, but
it's actually extremely engaging and

107
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.350
complex, as you go through
the whole of it at the end.

108
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.220
So that's kind of the-
&gt;&gt; That's really interesting.

109
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.400
Yeah, that seems like it's a good
kind of almost a design philosophy or

110
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.190
content philosophy for how you want people
to enter and experience your content.

111
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.258
Yeah, that's great.

112
00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:41.175
Yeah, right on.

113
00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:43.424
What was difficult about this exercise?

114
00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:49.300
&gt;&gt; The proof was most difficult for me.

115
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.800
&gt;&gt; Why?

116
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.810
&gt;&gt; Because in a way, I kinda kept thinking
more with time, what would be the proof?

117
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.782
So for example, with her site, I would
almost think that the proof would be

118
00:07:00.782 --> 00:07:03.094
I went to this place that
she talked about, and

119
00:07:03.094 --> 00:07:05.493
I agreed with her based
on her recommendation.

120
00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:10.542
But that's not by visiting the site,
and it feels more like what

121
00:07:10.542 --> 00:07:15.515
we're striving for is what the proof
is when I land on the site.

122
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:17.797
&gt;&gt; It's the proof in the content.

123
00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:19.655
&gt;&gt; That's right.

124
00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:21.915
What content are we
delivering to demonstrate?

125
00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:23.148
That's right.

126
00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:28.249
&gt;&gt; And so that was challenging for me to
kinda put it in that context, cuz I kinda

127
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:33.070
wanted to look more results as opposed to-
&gt;&gt; Yep, so

128
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.560
to differentiate in your head,
maybe it's proof that it's working

129
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.910
versus proof that the product or
service is right for me.

130
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.900
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's interesting.

131
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.290
That's a good way to put it.

132
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.605
&gt;&gt; Okay, and that doesn't
necessarily mean product benefits.

133
00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:56.340
Cuz it can also be proof that this
is a company I wanna work with.

134
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.360
So we're not talking necessarily
about proof in the results,

135
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.720
we're talking about proof
points within the content.

136
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.060
Make sense?

137
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.860
&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, that helps a lot, actually.

138
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.360
&gt;&gt; Great.

139
00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:15.672
That's actually very useful feedback and

140
00:08:15.672 --> 00:08:20.410
I will make sure to articulate that
next time I do this exercise, okay?
