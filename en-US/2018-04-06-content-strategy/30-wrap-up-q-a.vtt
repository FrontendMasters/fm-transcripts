1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.564
Anyone else?

2
00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:09.878
&gt;&gt; When kind of piggybacking off that,
I think it's important to recognize,

3
00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:11.968
if you're not going to
maintain your content.

4
00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:15.191
if you're like, starting a blog
will help me find a job, or

5
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:16.886
get traffic to my personal site.

6
00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:22.450
And then you write two blog posts,
and then they sit there.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.030
&gt;&gt; Right.

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.570
&gt;&gt; Forever, and
a new one never comes along,

9
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.450
I think that's really important to
note [LAUGH] and to planned for.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.120
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.556
I mean, that is a really good thing,
is your goal to set up a blog?

12
00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:44.858
Or is your goal to get hired at a new job,
and the blog as part of your

13
00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:48.875
tactical approach, or
your blog is your strategy, right?

14
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.820
That is a key strategic initiative,
to build up your areas of expertise.

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.260
And if you're thinking about that, and
you're thinking about, this is going to be

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.610
a key area for me to build up my IP and
to be able to shop that around.

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.000
Think about whether or not you're gonna be
able to sustain that, and what that means,

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.940
what kind of a time commitment you have.

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.000
And so those are good questions to
ask yourself before you launch it,

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.080
because otherwise, it might just sit
there, and how are you gonna promote it?

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.250
How are you gonna get it out there?

22
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.090
So, I think you're exactly right,
again it comes back.

23
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.130
That's why we spent so
much time early on in the workshop,

24
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.792
talking about setting that up and
doing the situation analysis, is so

25
00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:30.470
much of content success lies and
asking the right questions up front.

26
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.635
So much with, anybody else?

27
00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:36.454
How to go?

28
00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:41.741
All right, well, guess what?

29
00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:43.687
Yay, you can do content strategy now.

30
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:47.160
I really go back and
become a content strategist today.

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.100
What remaining questions do you have,
if any, about applying some of this stuff?

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.954
Things that you wish you knew more about,
walking out of here,

33
00:01:57.954 --> 00:02:00.714
open questions for me, anything.

34
00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:06.131
&gt;&gt; What about time frame?

35
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:11.029
Is there time frames that it's better
to release content, that kind of thing,

36
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.306
is that fall into content strategy?

37
00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:16.596
When is it more effective to launch
a blog post, or what are how frequently?

38
00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:20.940
I mean, of course, I'm sure that
also does vary business and so on.

39
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.720
&gt;&gt; It does, and
I don't know the answer to that.

40
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.893
I think that part of what I have seen
in my career is that people want,

41
00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:30.690
it's best to, I mean, I want this, right?

42
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.028
It's best to send an email
at 10:00 AM on Tuesdays,

43
00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.672
because that's when people are gonna
be most likely to open it.

44
00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:41.180
Or if you can't publish to a blog once
a week, you shouldn't have a blog at all.

45
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.391
I mean, and those silver bullets
just don't exist, they really don't.

46
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:49.525
I mean, there may be some data to
back up the 10:00 AM on Tuesdays,

47
00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:51.764
but if you are, I don't know.

48
00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:56.309
If you're sending it out to working
parents or stay at home moms, or

49
00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:01.290
whatever, maybe that's not the best
time to send it out, I don't know.

50
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.860
But it's very, very rare,
that there is sort of a one size

51
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.860
fits all guideline when it
comes to publishing content.

52
00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:11.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a lot of
experience with blogging and

53
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.490
that kind of thing, but
if you're kind of news oriented,

54
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.880
you're talking about the latest
trends in the industry.

55
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.303
You need to be on a continual basis,
releasing stuff, but

56
00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:27.548
if you're gonna go deep on a particular
subject, that's gonna last for a while.

57
00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:32.000
You don't have to be cranking,
you could do one every couple of months.

58
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.347
If it's a deep article about
grappling with something technical,

59
00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:38.200
or-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

60
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.849
&gt;&gt; Whatever, and so that's kind of,
I know it's really general and vague, but-

61
00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.980
&gt;&gt; No, but it comes down to purpose,

62
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.429
comes down to brand identity and mission,
editorial mission, and just your purpose.

63
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.610
Why do you exist?

64
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.580
What is this content for
in the first place?

65
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.070
And with content marketing,
a big problem that people get into is,

66
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.030
we're gonna publish
content to drive leads.

67
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.700
Well, they didn't know why they were
publishing content, who it was for,

68
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.850
what the outcome was.

69
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.860
I mean, it's just so
there's just so much junk.

70
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.760
&gt;&gt; Do you do actively like really try and
talk companies out of doing blog because I

71
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.840
might estimate is probably 90% of
the company blogs are just fluff.

72
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say that we push
companies to answer why they have blogs.

73
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.750
I think that a lot of companies just
feel like they have to be players,

74
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.570
the way that we sort of decided we all
needed websites to be players, and

75
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.550
I'm just like blog website
not the same thing.

76
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.640
I will actively try to talk
companies out of content marketing.

77
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.899
I've been trying to talk companies out
of content marketing for 10 years.

78
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.960
&gt;&gt; How can we help?

79
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.471
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I've seen so many bad ones that

80
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:46.430
are just you know, yeah, we had Taco
Tuesday yesterday in photos and like,.

81
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

82
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.090
&gt;&gt; Who cares other than you guys
&gt;&gt; I know.

83
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.220
That's the mantra the content is not for
us.

84
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.860
Content is not for me,
content is for my audience.

85
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.560
What else Chris, do you have a question?

86
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.111
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wanted like
to the most voice and tone,

87
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:07.634
because I find that very interesting and
but I've never seen other

88
00:05:07.634 --> 00:05:12.237
clients who don't want to be smart and
innovative in their voice and

89
00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:16.090
tone of voice work with
the client that wants to be not.

90
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.268
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean financial services
clients, they want to be smart and

91
00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:22.037
respectful, they don't want
to be innovative, perse.

92
00:05:22.037 --> 00:05:26.403
I mean, these are examples I pulled,

93
00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:29.440
I think that innovative is a,
I think that some

94
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.030
of these brand values can be difficult
to translate into voice and tone, right?

95
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.760
I think that some clients would rather
come off as accessible than smart, right?

96
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.220
Or they'd rather come off as
problem solvers than inspirational.

97
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.040
And so, some of these,

98
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.182
yeah, there are some clients
that wanna be all these things.

99
00:05:47.182 --> 00:05:50.519
But then we have to kind of
talk them down [LAUGH] and say,

100
00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.726
show me what that looks like,
for example, right?

101
00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:58.000
Or show me who is it that
you think is like this?

102
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.090
Who do you wanna sound like?

103
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.450
Nobody's like, we wanna sound like apple.

104
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.020
Well, apple is primarily plain English,
right?

105
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:12.700
So, yeah, it depends, and a lot of voice
and tone is informed by brand values.

106
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.250
I mean, that's important to remember to.

107
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.440
Any other questions?

108
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.290
&gt;&gt; Do you have any, I don't know,
I guess tips or resources?

109
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.498
So, for folks who haven't
thought about content strategy,

110
00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:33.722
and maybe don't know they do some
freelance sites for small businesses.

111
00:06:33.722 --> 00:06:39.095
And I can make you a nice WordPress site,

112
00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:43.521
but if you don't have content for

113
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.860
it, what's the point?

114
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.320
And some of those business owners just
don't have the budget or the time, and

115
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.880
they just don't.

116
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.672
Haven't really thought it through, and

117
00:06:56.672 --> 00:07:02.532
it's apparent that it has not
been considered at all, really.

118
00:07:02.532 --> 00:07:03.340
&gt;&gt; Yep.

119
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.900
&gt;&gt; But you don't wanna be mean, and be-
&gt;&gt; Right.

120
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.039
&gt;&gt; Your website is terrible, right?

121
00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.067
&gt;&gt; Well [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Right.

122
00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:12.485
&gt;&gt; But what's the point of this website?

123
00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:13.640
In a nice way.

124
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

125
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.779
&gt;&gt; I mean, a couple of things.

126
00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.650
So you asked how to communicate that, and

127
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.910
then you also asked for resources.

128
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.830
So, we actually just relaunch
contentstrategy.com.

129
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.900
So you can send them there, and
that has links to our blog and my book,

130
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.000
and we're going to launch
a podcast in the conference.

131
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.200
And so, we're just for them to see that,
this is a thing worthy of attention and

132
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.890
it's a real thing.

133
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.841
I actually, I wrote my book for

134
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.954
people who had never thought
about content before [LAUGH] so.

135
00:07:39.954 --> 00:07:43.407
And you can download chapter
two on contentstrategy.com,

136
00:07:43.407 --> 00:07:46.270
which is literally for businesses going.

137
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.060
This is a gigantic pain point, and
you can relate to this pain point.

138
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.378
So that is a free resource,
that can get people really thinking about,

139
00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:56.811
I should be paying attention to this more.

140
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.762
If you wanna get them excited
about content marketing,

141
00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:02.713
which sometimes is a gateway
drug to content strategy,

142
00:08:02.713 --> 00:08:06.118
you can send them to
Content Marketing Institute.

143
00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:09.570
And there are 1 million articles
about the value of content,

144
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.730
and ideas around content,
and all that good stuff.

145
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.105
I caution you with that, but
you can send them there.

146
00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:20.352
I've never called content marketing
a gateway drug into content strategy.

147
00:08:20.352 --> 00:08:26.060
I mean, it is the best possible thing,
I think in terms of communicating

148
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:32.253
to a client that their website sucks,
because their content is crap, right?

149
00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:33.268
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] yeah.

150
00:08:33.268 --> 00:08:34.040
&gt;&gt; Sorry?

151
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.139
&gt;&gt; It's a delicate.

152
00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.700
&gt;&gt; It's a delicate thing.

153
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.764
But I think that, to say,
talk to me about your users.

154
00:08:39.764 --> 00:08:42.182
Work to get them into
the mindset of that user,

155
00:08:42.182 --> 00:08:45.469
work to get them into tell me why
people are coming to your site.

156
00:08:45.469 --> 00:08:48.071
Not why do you want them
to come to their site, but

157
00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:50.680
why would they wanna come to your site?

158
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.605
Start the conversation there, and see if
that can start to sort of spark like,

159
00:08:56.605 --> 00:09:02.633
people don't care about my vacation photos
on our blog page, or whatever, right?

160
00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:06.414
Okay, anyone else?

161
00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:09.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I just wanna
kind of a little bit off, so

162
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.643
you know the whole concept of minimalism?

163
00:09:12.643 --> 00:09:14.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; That's recently really come up.

164
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.230
Have you had issues with people coming
clients coming to you and saying,

165
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.010
I want a minimalist website.

166
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.030
But then kind of battling
with it a little bit,

167
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.880
trying to make sure that the appropriate
content is on there without?

168
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.130
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question.

169
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.850
We have not had that
challenge in particular, I

170
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.530
have the mindset that typically
less content is better anyway.

171
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:45.009
So it might be like, great minimalist
[LAUGH] yes, we'll go with that.

172
00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:51.060
But we always, always, always lead with
user needs, user needs and business goals.

173
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.270
If your content is not meeting
one of those two things,

174
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.440
then there's no point in having it.

175
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.720
If your beautiful minimalist website
is not meeting your user needs and

176
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.590
expectations, then it's gonna
fail no matter how pretty it is.

177
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.060
So, that's what I would tell somebody,
yeah.

178
00:10:10.015 --> 00:10:12.180
Okay?

179
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.350
&gt;&gt; It's a bit general of a question, but
for specifically online product based

180
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:23.060
businesses, are there particular
KPIs that you've felt really

181
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.140
kind of turn the knob or
turn the corner for business?

182
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.535
&gt;&gt; I think they're pretty standard,
newsletter signups,

183
00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:37.205
online conversions, repeat visits.

184
00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:41.876
I think decreased customer support calls,
they're pretty standard,

185
00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:45.330
nothing super secret or
exciting that I can think of.

186
00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:51.693
All right, anyone else?

187
00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:57.996
Okay, you are hereby proclaimed, yes,

188
00:10:57.996 --> 00:11:02.690
now I know all the things about
content strategy individuals.

189
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.620
Good work, good work, team.

190
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.606
All right, thanks a lot for
joining us today.

191
00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:10.225
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
