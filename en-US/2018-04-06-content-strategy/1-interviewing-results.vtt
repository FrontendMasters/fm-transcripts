1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.906
As you were interviewing,
what did you notice?

2
00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:11.144
&gt;&gt; One thing I noticed that I thought
was fascinating was that when I started

3
00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:16.074
interviewing Russell, I didn't ask him
about the details of what industry he

4
00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:20.705
was in and that actually helped I think,
because suddenly we were talking

5
00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.187
about it more broadly as opposed to
specifically what is your product or

6
00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:28.224
where to use the size 12 or
size nine product.

7
00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:31.900
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; I'd no idea is that software hardware,

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.855
heavy industrial or office wear and so
that was actually very interesting.

9
00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:39.820
So by doing that way it was able
to really focus on the pain and

10
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.040
it almost feels like a lot of what he
told me could probably relate to a lot of

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.150
other industries and scenarios.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So yeah, so

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.600
I thought that was very interesting.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.100
&gt;&gt; Great.

15
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.999
What did you notice about the way
that you were interviewing?

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.255
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I was really self conscious.

17
00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.230
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

18
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.730
&gt;&gt; Yes.

19
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.040
It's like my goodness, am I being
quiet enough, are you listening in and

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.020
thinking Jeez, he's asking too many of
those questions instead of those but

21
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.480
I did really like some of the things
he said before and I'm just reading

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.100
the notes about not trying to relate
cuz I think I do that naturally.

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.130
&gt;&gt; Sure
&gt;&gt; So instead what I was doing and I don't

24
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.060
know if this is helpful or not, but
I was reframing some thing that he said.

25
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.910
&gt;&gt; Yes
&gt;&gt; But reframing it so I understood it.

26
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.127
&gt;&gt; Sure
&gt;&gt; So he I think kinda maybe sometimes use

27
00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:27.422
some of his experience but
in a way that didn't make sense but

28
00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:31.166
I was able to say wait do you mean that
it's a little more like [SOUND] and

29
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.581
he responded yes or
no or explain more, so.

30
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:34.498
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.

31
00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:38.310
&gt;&gt; I have to admit I wasn't
sure was that then leading or?

32
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.240
&gt;&gt; Well, it depends, right?

33
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.310
I mean, I think that what I will often say
to people if I'm not quite following them

34
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.910
because not everyone is super articulate,
[LAUGH].

35
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.500
What I will often say to them is just
let me make sure that I'm understanding

36
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.470
what you're telling me, let me
reflect back to you what I'm hearing.

37
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.820
So then even if I'm reframing it so
that I understand it or whatever,

38
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.850
if I just repeat back to them what
I'm hearing and sometimes I'll just

39
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.400
read directly from my notes to make
sure that I've captured it correctly.

40
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.050
They'll either be able to say actually,
no, let me put that a different way.

41
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.270
Or, yes, you've got it exactly or
whatever,

42
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.210
but the primary purpose is to make sure
that they are being heard correctly.

43
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.377
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Makes sense?

44
00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:19.248
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense.

45
00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:21.019
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
What else did you notice,

46
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:24.249
As you were interviewing?

47
00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.037
Did people have trouble not
immediately jumping in and

48
00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:34.632
relating to what was being said?

49
00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:35.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

50
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.211
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

51
00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:44.079
Did you feel like people were
addressing actual content pin points or

52
00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.594
was it more just sort of
general here's about my role.

53
00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:50.523
&gt;&gt; Little of both.

54
00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:51.322
&gt;&gt; Little both.

55
00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:54.640
Tell me about your conversation.

56
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.550
&gt;&gt; We're kind of in pretty similar
roles like he does more engineering and

57
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.930
I do more UI UX.

58
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.430
&gt;&gt; Sure.

59
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.230
&gt;&gt; So we actually thought communicating
pretty easy, we spoken the same language,

60
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.254
so-
&gt;&gt; Great, that helps a lot, isn't it?

61
00:03:09.254 --> 00:03:11.590
&gt;&gt; Which is why our conversation
kind of happened pretty quickly.

62
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.160
&gt;&gt; That helps a lot.

63
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.630
&gt;&gt; And we're able to identify
each other's pain points,

64
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.420
even though they're similar but different.

65
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.044
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
we both took it from different sides.

66
00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:23.966
&gt;&gt; Sure, what were some of the shared
pain points that you identified?

67
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.698
&gt;&gt; Not enough control over our process.

68
00:03:28.698 --> 00:03:29.440
&gt;&gt; Sure.

69
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.276
&gt;&gt; He had some of the services that he
relies on he doesn't really sometimes he's

70
00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:39.063
held accountable for them but he's not,
he doesn't have any real power to.

71
00:03:39.063 --> 00:03:39.660
&gt;&gt; Sure.

72
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.160
&gt;&gt; Or
able to hold other people accountable.

73
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.520
And I don't really deal
with content at all.

74
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.971
Sometimes I don't even know what
the content really is before I start-

75
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:49.480
&gt;&gt; Right.

76
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.567
&gt;&gt; And I don't have control over that.

77
00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:51.193
&gt;&gt; Right.

78
00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:53.506
&gt;&gt; So
that seemed to be a pretty similar one.

79
00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:58.666
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure,
anybody else share that pain point?

80
00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:02.990
Like having to start before you have
the content, not knowing what it is?

81
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.260
Yeah, sometimes, how is your conversation?

82
00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.160
&gt;&gt; It was good.

83
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.860
I think like you mentioned before,

84
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.420
my biggest problem is not
relating that's just such a.

85
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.480
&gt;&gt; Not jumping in.

86
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.210
&gt;&gt; That's such a natural reaction.

87
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.

88
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.585
&gt;&gt; I get that or I get you.

89
00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:25.372
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.

90
00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:29.265
&gt;&gt; So that was something
I had to keep reining in.

91
00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:34.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's funny is, it makes me
think about because content strategy

92
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.240
can be so deeply rooted in forging
relationships between different roles.

93
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.960
One thing that I sometimes
think about is and

94
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.520
one of the things they tell you when
you're communicating with a partner or

95
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.520
a spouse in that sometimes they
just need you to listen, right?

96
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.890
They don't need you to jump in and
solve the problem where they're just like,

97
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.230
I just want you to hear me and
know that I've been heard.

98
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.070
So that can be sort of a shared principle

99
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.740
when you are working to get information
that's gonna help you do your job better.
