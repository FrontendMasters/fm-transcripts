WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.750
All right, so now I wanna introduce you to
some of the artifacts that are associated

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.135
with this and we're gonna learn
how to do a few of these today.

3
00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:14.205
So within content design,
these are sorta the primary artifacts

4
00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:19.195
that we associate with these with
these parts of the framework.

5
00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:24.310
There's an editorial mission,
which is why does our content exist?

6
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.410
What does it exist to do?

7
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.910
A style guide, which, what I find
oftentimes is that organizations have

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.510
very, very detailed style guides
around design, and fonts and

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.360
sizes and buttons and
design patterns and all that stuff.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.560
But they're content style guide or
style guidelines are often like we

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.150
use AP English and
don't hyphenate this word,

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.950
versus really talking about what voice and
tone mean to our content as we create it.

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.482
So we'll take a look at a few
good examples later today.

14
00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.030
And then messaging architecture.

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.190
Which is really about what is it that
we are trying to communicate about our

16
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.470
product and service and how does that
play out across our digital content and

17
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.980
then a publishing calendar
which just identifies cadence.

18
00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:21.480
On the experience side,
content folks are always very,

19
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.290
very interested in needs based personas,
not just, Christina is a 46

20
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.110
year old mom with two kids and
no time on her hands and whatever.

21
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.470
But instead, when Christina goes online,
here are the decisions she's looking

22
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.841
to make or the tasks that she's looking to
complete specifically that we can serve.

23
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:47.055
Page templates and tables,
which we'll talk about and

24
00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:50.830
then any microcopy or
UI copy to consider, okay?

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.650
Yes.

26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.260
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in your
perspective of which tools do

27
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.070
you think apply to like small
teams versus big teams?

28
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.370
Do you recommend all these tools
across the board or is it?

29
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.530
&gt;&gt; No, not necessarily.

30
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.770
It really comes down to organization
goals and project constraints.

31
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.100
When we start talking about which
tools we kind of recommend and

32
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.410
project goals as well.

33
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.093
So if you're doing a website
with eight pages versus

34
00:02:22.093 --> 00:02:27.212
reconfiguring a CMS
400,000 pieces of content.

35
00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:31.700
I'm going to have very different opinions
about what's more important here.

36
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.826
You can go super lightweight
on a lot of this stuff,

37
00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:38.260
especially if you've got a team of two or
three people.

38
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.362
But I think that the most important thing
is that everybody's working from the same

39
00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.820
content playbook.

40
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.850
And then you've got shared standards and
understanding.

41
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.340
So for example, at brain traffic, we redid
our primary website and then we just

42
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.890
launched content strategy.com and there
were three or four of us working on it.

43
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.467
We work together to map out site map, page

44
00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:06.510
tables, it's hard because voice and
tone is kind of my voice [LAUGH] and tone.

45
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.629
But we loosely identified sort of
what worked and what didn't there.

46
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.131
And then I worked closely with a designer
on the site nomenclature, right?

47
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:21.680
But we didn't have a formal
messaging architecture.

48
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.800
We did have a publishing
calendar because we needed that,

49
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.210
we have a publishing calendar now with
regard to the podcast episodes that we're

50
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.960
doing and
the blog posts that we're creating.

51
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.220
We did map out needs based personas, but
again, it was like in working sessions,

52
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.130
it wasn't like we had formal artifacts
that we passed among the team.

53
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.930
But that was all stuff that we
didn't need to create, right?

54
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.310
Does that make sense?

55
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.920
Okay, so I think to answer your question,

56
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.650
not everybody needs all this stuff for
sure.

57
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.920
I think that it more comes down to when
you find yourself with a question.

58
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.951
Ask all of those tough questions as
early on in the process as you can and

59
00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.793
then this is your toolbox, right?

60
00:04:00.793 --> 00:04:04.083
You pick and choose from these, okay?

61
00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:06.107
Does that make sense to everybody?

62
00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:08.098
Okay, great.

63
00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:10.138
Did that answer your question?

64
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:11.611
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yeah, okay, great.

65
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:13.002
So then in systems design,

66
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.150
these are some of the common
artifacts that we'll see there.

67
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.120
Who's working with SharePoint?

68
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.083
So you've got content models and

69
00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:26.063
taxonomies that you're
wrangling I would assume?

70
00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:27.516
&gt;&gt; No, we're pretty much just
storing everything up there.

71
00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:28.551
&gt;&gt; You're just storing
everything up there?

72
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:29.708
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Okay, great.

73
00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:31.062
I have some other workshops
to recommend to you.

74
00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:37.980
[LAUGH] So taxonomy is
basically like using a library.

75
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.690
How are we categorizing content and
keeping track of it so

76
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.100
that it can be well managed and
and searched.

77
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.460
Content models are how are we
basically chunking out our content so

78
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.140
that it can be presented in
a variety of different ways or

79
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.570
across a variety of different
platforms from a single source.

80
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.750
CMS authoring interface and then thinking
about that content reuse strategy, and

81
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.080
then process we kind of talked about,
okay?

82
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.030
So we're gonna learn about some of these
artifacts that kind of picked out the ones

83
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.980
that hopefully will be
of most use to you or

84
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.460
at least to familiarize yourselves with.

85
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.470
And then if it doesn't fall on your plate,

86
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.436
you can start asking other
people [LAUGH] for them, okay?

87
00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:22.482
Look at that fancy transition.

88
00:05:22.482 --> 00:05:26.809
All right, so he has sometimes their
leftover from other presentations.

89
00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.861
I don't think I have any flame
transitions in this one but

90
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.966
I can put some in over lunch if you want.

91
00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:35.017
So essentially content
strategy then is a practice or

92
00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:38.950
a content strategist is working
diligently to kind of prioritize and

93
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.680
integrate all of these
different activities.

94
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.590
Because again, when you make
a decision in one of those areas,

95
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.540
it has a ripple effect
on all the other ones.

96
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.990
So, if you make a decision to change
over the person who's responsible for

97
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.790
defining content requirements,

98
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.560
from someone in marketing to someone on
the user experience team for example.

99
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.310
That's going to have a significant effect
on how those requirements play out.

100
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.510
If you make a decision under
editorial that you're going

101
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.920
to up your publishing cadence from
twice a month to four times a month.

102
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.160
Well now you're looking at
additional resources for

103
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.090
who's gonna be tagging that content is,
the stuff that's being created?

104
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.091
Does it fit within
the current content model?

105
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:22.617
How is this going to have an impact
on find ability of content throughout

106
00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:23.200
our site?

107
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.950
Do we know what section it's going to
go in from an experience standpoint,

108
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.230
who's going to be responsible for
it from a process standpoint?

109
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.870
So it's pretty interesting to watch
the relationship of those areas,

110
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.757
begin to sort of surface

111
00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:43.130
and the opportunities then to kind of
create those shared conversations.
