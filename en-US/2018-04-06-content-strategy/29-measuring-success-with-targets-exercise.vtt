1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.880
Okay, so we are coming up on

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.770
how do we know if we have been
successful as content strategists here.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.620
And this is where we begin to talk about
targets, which are quantitative or

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.370
qualitative data, that measure whether or
not our objectives have been achieved.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.962
How many of you all have
performance targets?

6
00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:23.650
Besides, I already have asked this
question and you said it was delivery for

7
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.240
example.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.740
So, okay, having targets and
knowing what you're being measured,

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.140
what your performance is being measured
by beyond just I got this stuff done,

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.780
can be really useful.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.133
And that's where asking for

12
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.186
that kind of vision mission goals
strategy framework can help.

13
00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:41.732
It's where you begin to understand,

14
00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:46.663
like where your contributions are having
an impact on bottom line stuff,

15
00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:51.370
whether it's customer satisfaction,
product user satisfaction.

16
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.920
You are working with internal
employees on SharePoint whether or

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.910
not they quit complaining to you [LAUGH]
like we were just talking about.

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.420
So it can be any end audience that
our content is having an impact on.

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.940
So here are a bunch of sample metrics,

20
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.040
if the KPI is a Key Performance Indicator,
and

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.080
if the business key performance
indicator is acquiring new members,

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.480
then content priorities
are demonstrating the value.

23
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.850
In this instance, we're talking about
a nonprofit association provides for

24
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.950
professionals just entering
the professional industry.

25
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.112
And describing the benefits of
becoming an associated member,

26
00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:39.118
if those are our content priorities within
a page or a section of the website,

27
00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:42.830
what are the metrics that we
can use to describe success.

28
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.150
We can see who's signing
up in the website.

29
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.488
We can measure top houses sign up page.

30
00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:54.770
We can make sure

31
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.900
that we've got clear membership related
calls to action where they're appropriate.

32
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.465
We can measure messaging about the value
for early career professionals,

33
00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:06.515
we can measure user satisfaction
with our website content.

34
00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:10.455
We can measure user comprehension
of benefits, membership benefits.

35
00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:13.395
In here we have whether it is
quantitative, which is it's basically,

36
00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.695
yes or no, one or zero, right?

37
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:19.865
Or qualitative,
where we are actually getting personal or

38
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:25.840
personalized input that is objective,
methods, how is it that we're accessing

39
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.680
this metric and measuring it and
how often are we measuring it?

40
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.420
So this would be an example metrics plan
associated with content performance.

41
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.720
Okay?

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.960
Wouldn't it be lovely to have this?

43
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.790
I don't know very many organizations
that have something like this,

44
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.660
but this is part of what
we call governance.

45
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.060
Okay, this is part of how somebody owns
this, and owns the performance measurement

46
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.530
for content and is continually providing
this information as a way to shape and

47
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.210
prioritize any kind of improvements or
iterations.

48
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.800
Okay.

49
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:11.370
Okay, this is the last exercise I was
gonna have you guys do, which is heuristic

50
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.930
key performance indicator, a business
goal that you can influence with content.

51
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.125
What I'd like to have you do instead
just to get you into this mindset,

52
00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:24.410
is let's make it a little
bit broader from content.

53
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.670
And let's have you think about your job
activities, whatever your priority roles

54
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.560
are within your organization and how can
you influence a primary business goal or

55
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.050
key performance indicator with
your activities, with your role.

56
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.960
Like why do you exist?

57
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.194
Within your client team or
organization or how wide do you,

58
00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:48.557
what kind of a role do you want
to play within an organization,

59
00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:52.073
where you can have a direct impact
on a business goal or KPI, so.

60
00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:58.792
And then I'd like you to think about
sort of either content or design or code

61
00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:03.475
objectives, that will help you influence
the goal or the KPI that you've listed.

62
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:07.727
So can we just take a minute, this will be
a nice thing to send you guys off with,

63
00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.167
is to sort of continually look for
that meaning within your work and

64
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:15.097
to understand how and
why you exist at your organization.

65
00:04:15.097 --> 00:04:18.717
How you want the role that you want to
play within a client team or organization.

66
00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:23.437
And kind of get this information down,

67
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:26.370
at least just to get your
brains thinking in this method.

68
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.570
Okay, if you're able to do it
from a perspective of content,

69
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.570
awesome, that's great.

70
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.290
But I just wanna open it
up a little bit for you,

71
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.722
recognizing that not everybody is
primary roles is content here.
