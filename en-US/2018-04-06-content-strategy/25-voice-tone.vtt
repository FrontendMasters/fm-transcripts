1
00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.741
All right, let's talk voice and tone, this
is one of the most exciting, I love this.

2
00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:13.376
All right, so I'll explain why I've
like underlined these lines in a second.

3
00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:17.071
So here is an example of a brand
personality spectrum you can be personable

4
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.182
and friendly all the way over
to corporate and professional.

5
00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:23.757
You can be spontaneous and high energy
all the way over to careful thinking and

6
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.308
planning.

7
00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:28.921
Modern or high tech classical and
traditional and so on, so

8
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.918
think about your organization or
your personal voice and tone.

9
00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:36.802
Where might you fall on this spectrum?

10
00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:42.285
Do you feel like your company or
personal writing it has put enough

11
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:47.465
of a stake in the ground to have
any of these qualities one way or

12
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.870
the other anywhere along the spectrum.

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.588
Does anyone know about your
company's voice and tone?

14
00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:59.503
Are you thought about your own voice and
tone in your own work?

15
00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:00.835
&gt;&gt; Actually, I might,

16
00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:05.205
what I'm working on is kind of like
how you are I'm working on my site.

17
00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:10.871
And I actually got some very cutting
feedback recently that a lot of my

18
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:16.447
language sounded very robotic,
which wasn't very yeah, right.

19
00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:17.163
&gt;&gt; Wasn't a good thing.

20
00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:18.160
&gt;&gt; You were not feeling good.

21
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.101
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
this is fantastic in a way and and

22
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:26.143
it's interesting because actually for
me then it is a real challenge,

23
00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:30.358
like, do I wanna be cutting edge or
fun or more accessible?

24
00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:34.865
So there's that challenge
of I want to appeal to all,

25
00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:40.889
I want it to be accessible but
also I wanted to reflect me properly, so.

26
00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.859
&gt;&gt; I'll give you a good piece of advice
there, try to write like you talk.

27
00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.125
So write what you want to say and
then read it aloud, and

28
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.953
if you stumble or if it feels weird or if
it doesn't like you, take a deep breath,

29
00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:57.005
say it the way that you would say it
capture that in writing and then-

30
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.056
&gt;&gt; So don't have Siri, write my copy.

31
00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:03.441
&gt;&gt; Maybe don't have copy AI is not
going to deliver this copy for you.

32
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:08.049
That's what marketers are excited about
AI creating content for them, and

33
00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.206
I'm just like no.

34
00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:12.380
&gt;&gt; Categorizing content, I think is,-
&gt;&gt; That is possible

35
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.024
&gt;&gt; Yes.

36
00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:16.307
&gt;&gt; But you have to have good data
&gt;&gt; Yes, for it'll do that.

37
00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:19.046
See I learned that clean data.

38
00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:24.824
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Dirty data will destroy AI, okay?

39
00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:30.873
The reason I have these underlined is
that these words mean different things to

40
00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:36.662
different people so, personable and
friendly to me, it's just like hi.

41
00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:39.149
How can we help you?

42
00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:44.627
Thanks for your form submission, some
people personable and friendly might be

43
00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:50.281
hey there welcome to our site, super glad
you could come by lets get going, okay?

44
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:55.176
Winky face, so we wanna make sure that
we are very clear on what we mean and

45
00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:59.933
what we don't mean by this brand,
by this voice and tone statements.

46
00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:04.842
Okay, I was gonna give
another example of and

47
00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:12.088
I would have screen cap this to show but
it was a client so I didn't.

48
00:03:12.088 --> 00:03:16.966
I was gonna give an example of
there is a product available

49
00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:21.846
to basically protect you if
your identity is stolen, and

50
00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:28.573
the whole site is like one in three
Americans will have their identity stolen.

51
00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:32.899
And here's the nightmare that you will
look forward to if your identity is

52
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:33.470
stolen.

53
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.413
And here's this horrible story about
this woman whose identity was stolen,

54
00:03:38.413 --> 00:03:40.781
and then you got to the About Us page.

55
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:46.121
When the bios were like so and so as an
avid skier and dog lover who lives in so

56
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:51.653
and so with his three kids and he came
to this after a storied career Mbalula.

57
00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:56.319
I mean like the bios were super
personable, super friendly,

58
00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.073
a little bit like jokey in some of
them and I was just if I'm gonna

59
00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:05.831
give you $1,000 for
insurance against identity theft or

60
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:10.138
whatever, I wanna know that
you are serious business and

61
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:15.108
that you have my back, and
that you've got depth of experience.

62
00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:19.485
I don't wanna hear about your hobbies,
and so

63
00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:25.547
this was an instance in which they
had figured out their voice and

64
00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:30.037
tone throughout the site,
which was serious,

65
00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:35.561
not quite threatening [LAUGH] but
very, dire a little bit.

66
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:38.531
And it worked for them it worked for
what they needed,

67
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:42.097
which is to get people to call
them to find out more information.

68
00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:47.096
But then it was so jarring to get
to their corporate profiles and

69
00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:52.184
have them be so upbeat, and so
we just rewrote them to be just very

70
00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:57.182
professional, very astir not mean or
snotty or anything, but

71
00:04:57.182 --> 00:05:02.690
just we do serious business here and
we take our jobs very seriously.

72
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.416
They thought they were being like
personal accessible because they wanted

73
00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:12.441
people to know the faces behind the phones
so that they would trust them about and

74
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:15.835
I was just like that's not
the kind of trust you want.

75
00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:20.821
You can chat with them about their hobbies
once you get them on the phone but

76
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.681
not in the website, okay?

77
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:25.298
All right, so this is super,

78
00:05:25.298 --> 00:05:30.867
super powerful to have the like this,
not this little phrase.

79
00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:33.974
So if your voice is empowering,
let's say that that.

80
00:05:33.974 --> 00:05:36.374
I don't like that is a voice and
tone thing, but

81
00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:40.335
whatever let's say that it's empowering,
right, like this when posting or

82
00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:44.537
advertising ask yourself have you selected
newspapers, journals, websites and

83
00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:47.680
mailing list that reach diverse
pool of applicants, right?

84
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.523
Not like this morning you must select
the appropriate media to reach a diverse

85
00:05:52.523 --> 00:05:57.305
pool of applicants failing to do so,
will jeopardize your home for talent.

86
00:05:57.305 --> 00:06:00.305
Your mandate is to assist applicants
in achieving their goals so

87
00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:02.476
it should feel inviting and
not threatening.

88
00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:08.385
So that's empowering,
don't empower via shame,

89
00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:13.755
okay, here's another we
call this the brand,

90
00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:16.723
the voice and tone wheel.

91
00:06:16.723 --> 00:06:22.573
In this instance the client decided
they were innovative, straightforward,

92
00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:27.287
reliable, experienced and smart,
and we sort of did a weighted

93
00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:32.458
average of what percentage of their
voice we felt that they should be.

94
00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:37.614
And you'll see, it was largely smart,
experienced and straightforward that those

95
00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:42.123
were sort of the three things we were
able to write content that was smart and

96
00:06:42.123 --> 00:06:45.934
straightforward that really
highlighted their experience.

97
00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:50.621
So, but people love this, they just
love wheels and pie charts and things.

98
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.536
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right so

99
00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:58.377
if you go to voiceandtone.com even if you
will never in your career define Voice and

100
00:06:58.377 --> 00:07:02.268
Tone, this is still just a wonderful
lovely site to take a look at.

101
00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:08.060
This is by a company called MailChimp
is an email services company,

102
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.836
and they have actually created
their entire style guide

103
00:07:12.836 --> 00:07:17.019
online open source for
anybody to take a look at.

104
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:22.434
And what's wonderful is that they have
really identified your voice is who you

105
00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:27.521
are as an organization, your tone shifts,
depending on the situation,

106
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:31.788
and the audience, so for
example, I'm Kristina and sorry,

107
00:07:31.788 --> 00:07:36.159
I'm Kristina and my voice is me
like I'm always going to be me.

108
00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:40.198
But my tone speaking with you right now is
gonna be a lot different than when I have

109
00:07:40.198 --> 00:07:43.514
an opportunity to call my kid back
who's called me three times and

110
00:07:43.514 --> 00:07:47.157
is texting me going, please call me
right now what are you doing right?

111
00:07:47.157 --> 00:07:51.614
That's gonna be a different tone of voice,
so it does depend on audience,

112
00:07:51.614 --> 00:07:53.543
it depends on context and so on.

113
00:07:53.543 --> 00:07:57.481
And so this site is beautiful
in that it helps us see,

114
00:07:57.481 --> 00:08:00.444
how can we write for success messages?

115
00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:02.052
How do we write for public site?

116
00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:04.331
How do we write for Twitter and Facebook?

117
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:07.997
So here's an example company newsletter,
the user mindset is, I love

118
00:08:07.997 --> 00:08:12.213
reading news from MailChimp office, I
always look forward to the experiments and

119
00:08:12.213 --> 00:08:14.370
stories they share in their newsletter.

120
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.890
So users feelings up here admiration,
curiosity,

121
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.695
trust, interest and surprise, right?

122
00:08:20.695 --> 00:08:25.522
So tips our most loyal users read the
company newsletter treat them like friends

123
00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:29.067
be casual but helpful, so
then here's some sample copy.

124
00:08:29.067 --> 00:08:35.808
So this is the tone that they take,
all right, so here's the success message.

125
00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:43.666
User finish this week's campaign I can
enjoy the weekend there had relief,

126
00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:45.594
pride, joy, anticipation.

127
00:08:45.594 --> 00:08:51.955
And MailChimp always has like because
when you press send on 100,000 emails,

128
00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:57.162
it's like then you do it and
MailChimp is always just we love you,

129
00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:02.403
you're amazing great work,
go take a break, have a drink whatever.

130
00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:06.359
This was the other example
that I had failure message,

131
00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:10.401
all right users feeling confusion,
stress and anger,

132
00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:14.534
what went wrong,
I really need to get this campaign out.

133
00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:15.552
So offer a solution or

134
00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:18.841
a next step be straightforward
explain what's going on right away.

135
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:23.624
This is not a time to just be like
hey whoa now, what's going on?

136
00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:25.538
Let's get in there and
see if we can fix that for

137
00:09:25.538 --> 00:09:27.849
you, we experienced a problem
one of our data centers or

138
00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:30.820
engineers are on the case,
we'll have things back to normal shortly.

139
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.299
Still speaking like a person,
still super kind of friendly and

140
00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:38.174
authentic, very straightforward,,

141
00:09:38.174 --> 00:09:43.257
an example of like failure of voice and
tone that I can give you as delta.

142
00:09:43.257 --> 00:09:47.527
Delta makes me an insane person,
and in fact, I think that I have,

143
00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:53.594
I don't know if I have it up.

144
00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:56.961
But two of their slides
that makes me crazy,

145
00:09:56.961 --> 00:10:02.148
one of them is after you've been idle for
a while, and you go back and

146
00:10:02.148 --> 00:10:06.257
you're now I'm gonna finish
doing what I'm doing.

147
00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:10.298
They have this screen that says get back
in there you've been logged out due to

148
00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:14.337
inactivity which A I'm mad that I was
logged out due to inactivity, B get back

149
00:10:14.337 --> 00:10:18.458
in there, it's I don't wanna get back in
there, [LAUGH] you get back in there.

150
00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:22.642
That makes me crazy, another one that
came up that was new recently is,

151
00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:24.943
I was trying to change a ticket online,

152
00:10:24.943 --> 00:10:28.730
and I wasn't able to change it
cuz it wasn't within 72 hours.

153
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.323
The error message that I received was,
let's try that again,

154
00:10:33.323 --> 00:10:36.800
it literally said that and
I was just you jerks.

155
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.923
Yeah, exactly so anyway, be very careful
with tone in those instances, okay, but

156
00:10:42.923 --> 00:10:49.243
anyway, I encourage you guys to dig around
on voiceandtone.com, it's really fun.
