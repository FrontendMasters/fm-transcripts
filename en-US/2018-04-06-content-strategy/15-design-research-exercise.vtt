00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.796
So let's go ahead and
take ten minutes to go ahead and

2
00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:08.473
design our own research.

3
00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:11.824
So grab a piece of paper
if you need one or

4
00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:16.000
open up an excel spreadsheet and
get going here.

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.615
We wonder,

6
00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:20.907
list the questions you'd like to answer
through user research activities.

7
00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:25.280
Describe how those answers will inform
your strategy and recommendations.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.080
List the assumptions you've
made related to that question.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.470
And list any related data or

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.920
conclusions you've drawn based
on current data and research.

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.666
So what I would start with is
I would just start with what

12
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.169
are questions you have about your users?

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720
List three, four, and

14
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.360
then slowly take yourself through
each of these steps, okay?
