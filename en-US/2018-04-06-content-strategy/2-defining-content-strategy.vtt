00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.100
All right, excellent work,
let's jump in and

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.250
talk about what is content strategy, okay?

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.070
So, this is me this is last
time I will quote myself, but

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.890
this was a definition that I put
forward in my book in 2009 and

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.190
it has pretty well stuck
within the industry.

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.680
There are lots of different ways to think
about and talk about content strategy.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.600
This is a little bit of a catch all,

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.383
which is,
that content strategy as a practice and

9
00:00:30.383 --> 00:00:35.238
as a thing guides the creation, delivery
and governance of useful, usable content.

10
00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:41.055
So, here's the difference
between content strategy and

11
00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:45.578
often times what we see
in design workshops.

12
00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:50.262
Is that design workshops oftentimes
end up with a lot of post it

13
00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:55.309
notes up on the wall about excite,
ideas about topics and labels,

14
00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.010
and so on and then what we end
up with is this list, right?

15
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.108
But it can often be pretty disjointed and

16
00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:06.760
there's a lack of actual
substance behind it.

17
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.218
So that the labels and the ideas and
the brainstorm those do not translate or

18
00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:16.376
have a real bridge to the actual
content and substance and

19
00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:20.620
experience that is going to be
crafted on or across pages or

20
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.752
within even an application when
we're talking about UI copy, okay?

21
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:30.486
So what happens then is we end up with
just like a calendar of a bunch of

22
00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:35.490
artifacts that need to be delivered and
that's not content strategy.

23
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.270
So what I wanna do is walk you through,

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.200
this is sort of complex, but
we're going to walk through it, list of

25
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.675
activities that a content strategist
might participate in, and

26
00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:55.680
that oftentimes will fall into the lap
of a writer or a content strategist.

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.110
You'll see some of these overlap with UX,
stuff that

28
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.220
the Dev Team might end up doing especially
around like metadata and interface copy.

29
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730
But let's just take a look at this,
so this first piece

30
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.800
happens early in a project where we're
assessing the content ecosystem.

31
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.610
So, we are auditing existing content,
which is another thing that

32
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.690
an information architect might do,
if he or she is trying to figure

33
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.680
out what content is gonna be required to
keep what we might be able to get rid of.

34
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.150
Usually when we are auditing content
upfront, we're looking for redundant,

35
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.890
outdated or trivial content or what I call
content rot because we know that that's

36
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.640
not gonna need to be worked into any
sort of a new site map or ecosystem.

37
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.690
Conducting stakeholder interviews,
which you're all brilliant at now.

38
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.480
Analyzing and validating content
ecosystems, this becomes more and

39
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.390
more important as the months and years
go by, because obviously you can have

40
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.130
a single source of content that's being
distributed across multiple platforms.

41
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.321
You've got responsive site design,
of course where you are viewing

42
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.360
content in all different
kinds of screens and

43
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.960
you're gonna wanna look at
that ecosystem as well.

44
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.244
You need to understand how your content is
connected between all your social channels

45
00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:19.268
and potentially marketing platforms,

46
00:03:19.268 --> 00:03:21.539
digital asset management systems and
so on.

47
00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.253
So the larger client or
organisation you are working with,

48
00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:25.561
the more complex these are.

49
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:30.425
We're gonna learn a little bit about how
to map those ecosystems where if you've

50
00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:34.800
done any work in designing systems,
you will recognize that approach.

51
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.950
So we get into the strategy piece,

52
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.170
we're gonna be talking about strategy at
a higher level here and a little bit.

53
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.130
But this is really where
we are kind of identifying,

54
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.720
what direction are we going to go in?

55
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.640
How are we gonna get there?

56
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.870
And how are we gonna take care
of that content over time?

57
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.880
So we're determining who's responsible for
the content.

58
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.980
Defining the content recommendations,
defining our voice and tone, and

59
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.854
preparing what we call
a content governance model.

60
00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:03.641
And this is essentially
understanding who owns what content,

61
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:08.428
who's responsible for what parts of
the content lifecycle, and ultimately,

62
00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:12.371
who gets to say no to things like
really stupid content requests.

63
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.370
Which I'm sure none of you
have ever seen before.

64
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.690
So here's where the content
strategist can and

65
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.390
should be participating
in the design process.

66
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.670
And what I hear quite often
from design teams is,

67
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.350
I would love to have
a content person in the room.

68
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.210
I would love to be able to partner with
that person early in the process but

69
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.190
there's no budget, or
I don't get that person.

70
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.890
And here we are really,
really talking about a shift in

71
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.240
perspective with how our teams
are created and structured.

72
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.140
And really the only people that can
advocate to have that person in

73
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.730
the room is you.

74
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.657
So here's an opportunity for

75
00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:51.663
you to start thinking about how
you might be partnering with or

76
00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:56.920
what might be happening alongside of you
as you're working without knowing it.

77
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.546
Preparing staffing record recommendations,
determining editorial calendar, etc.,

78
00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:04.546
that really falls more on
the process side, but the content

79
00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:08.585
strategist can be working with the team
to develop taxonomy and nomenclature.

80
00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:13.472
Design any kind of CMS authoring interface
customization that would allow for

81
00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:18.284
guidelines to be included in the process,
for example, developing content

82
00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:23.335
models as needed, preparing metadata
strategy, developing migration plan.

83
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.581
This is also where we start talking about
page tables and templates, and how we

84
00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:33.152
sort of can wrap in content requirements
there, but we'll address that later today.

85
00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:36.829
And then we have the content creation and
typically this is where

86
00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:41.116
we call the writer but as you can see,
there's so much work and thinking and

87
00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:44.480
planning that needs to be done
prior to content creation.

88
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.325
When we dump them into this process
into this phase without involving

89
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:54.252
them earlier on, this is what we
call kind of the 11th hour nightmare

90
00:05:54.252 --> 00:05:56.860
where things can really fall apart.

91
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.590
I've seen content break large
projects more times than I can count.

92
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.761
In fact,
we call those projects at my company brain

93
00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:07.909
traffic rescue mission projects where
we're called in during this phase and

94
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.525
they're like, content, it's so complicated
and I never knew well, surprise.

95
00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:15.314
So here's where we're actually creating

96
00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:18.961
content assets writing a copy
deck if that is relevant.

97
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.708
Reviewing for brand compliance and SEO and

98
00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:26.369
implementing our governance model and
workflows throughout the team.

99
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.712
Here's another role that
the content strategist takes

100
00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:34.262
that oftentimes post launch we are or
pre launch we are not thinking about and

101
00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:37.407
this stuff is what comes
back to bite us post launch.

102
00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:41.680
Where I often talk about how content,
we say that content and sites go live for

103
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.579
a reason because once they are alive,
they require care and feeding.

104
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:50.542
And content is the biggest pain
point I see with organizations

105
00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:55.506
where once a site goes live that
content dies on the vine very,

106
00:06:55.506 --> 00:07:00.010
very quickly if there's no
one assigned to care for it.

107
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.920
So planning for periodic auditing, how
are we caring for this content and keeping

108
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.030
track of it over time, using analytics,
and adhering to an editorial calendar.

109
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.150
So, those are a lot of activities we are
not going to learn how to do all of these

110
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.380
today, because otherwise I would have
you here for a week and a half, yes.

111
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.560
&gt;&gt; Two questions,
one is what about amount of content?

112
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.310
When does that come into play cuz one
thing I found is a lot of times within,

113
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.460
about us page or something, a client will
end up saying that they've got a sentence

114
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.630
and that's it, you've got
a whole page allocated for that.

115
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.910
So it almost feels like how much you've
got, versus there are other times too or

116
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.270
could be, a truckload of content.

117
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.123
&gt;&gt; Sure, so that is a perfect example
of needing to talk about content

118
00:07:43.123 --> 00:07:47.034
requirements and
purpose very early in the project.

119
00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:51.871
Because in a site mapping exercise,
it's really easy to assume that they

120
00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:56.254
need an about us and so that goes on
a post it note goes up on the wall.

121
00:07:56.254 --> 00:07:59.923
And then it appears in the sitemap, well,
then it comes time to create the content

122
00:07:59.923 --> 00:08:02.851
that's been designed into primary
nomenclature and they're,

123
00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:06.890
we don't really have any of this we don't
need it, it could go on another page.

124
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.840
Well, if we had talked to them earlier on,
when they're what do you mean

125
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.200
an about us page and we'd ask, okay,
let's talk about the purpose of that page.

126
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.830
Substantively, what will it include?

127
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.900
Who is it for and why do we need it?

128
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.197
That's where it could have been caught
that, we actually don't have a whole lot

129
00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:27.134
to say there or this is really
reflected in a different page.

130
00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:31.830
So that's a perfect example, another
example that you gave is what about when

131
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.262
there's a whole truckload of content.

132
00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:39.490
I can say it's almost never a good idea to
have a whole [LAUGH] truckload of content

133
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.189
but again, if we can have that
conversation very early in the process.

134
00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:48.709
Where we are defining content
recommendations beyond just that site map,

135
00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:51.660
then we'll be able to dig
into a little bit more.

136
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.510
Okay, what is the content purpose?

137
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.410
Who is the audience?

138
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.030
What are the goals of this or
the objectives of this page?

139
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.200
What are we gonna measure
its success by and so

140
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.510
on, because then what we
might determine is that.

141
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.100
There's a lot of unnecessary content
here that doesn't actually serve any

142
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.260
audience needs whatsoever and our content.

143
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.070
That's a good thing to remind people
all the time is this content is not for

144
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.690
you the organization unless
it's legal to cover your butt.

145
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.940
But this content is not for you,

146
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.580
as an organization's content is for your
user and so it's really important that

147
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.830
whatever content we're delivering
is meeting those user needs.

148
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.435
And if it's extraneous or nice to have
get it out of the digital experience,

149
00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:31.230
cuz it's just going to get in their way,
right?

150
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.980
So setting up that frame of mind

151
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.100
as early as possible in the project
will help us prevent some of that

152
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.452
disconnect once it comes time to design or
get the content that, did that help?

153
00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:45.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

154
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.870
&gt;&gt; Okay great.
