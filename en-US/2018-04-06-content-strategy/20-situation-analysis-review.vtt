1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.174
How did that go?

2
00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:07.536
&gt;&gt; I thought it was very difficult because
I sometimes found myself trying to answer

3
00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:11.500
opportunities as opposed to answering
the questions that are posed there.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.041
So opportunities being hey if I do this
and I might be able to reach that map but

5
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:21.123
that kind of just it felt distance for
those questions.

6
00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:22.673
Sure.
&gt;&gt; And those questions actually,

7
00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:24.139
I think kind of brought
me back to reality.

8
00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:26.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good, good.

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.900
Yeah, it is easy to spin off into,
we can do this, and what about this, and

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.070
this would be a great idea.

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.986
And this would be so nice, versus coming
back into and really thinking about, like,

12
00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:40.561
what are our current strengths and
what are our real threats.

13
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.061
Yeah.

14
00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.075
What else?

15
00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:54.124
A huge part of this exercise,
especially for you all,

16
00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:58.744
is that it's just to get you thinking
about opportunities for content,

17
00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:03.158
to your point, differently than
we've thought about them before.

18
00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:06.841
And to think about them on
a broader scale than just,

19
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.120
I need to fix the wording on
this confirmation page, right?

20
00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:17.490
So hopefully it gave you a chance to
just sort of like relax your brain into

21
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.830
thinking in new ways around content.

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.470
Okay, All right,
we'll go ahead and move on here.

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.260
So when you are ready to frame
up your situation analysis,

24
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.710
this is what the outline will look like.

25
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.020
We went through early on,
project scope and purpose, business and

26
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.880
team goals, your priority audiences.

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.726
And what their needs are,
we usually recommend keeping

28
00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:51.789
priority audiences to four or
fewer, three, maybe two.

29
00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.636
Sort of the themes that you were able
to identify that kept coming up,

30
00:01:56.636 --> 00:02:02.570
which would also include sort of your SWOT
pieces, any proof points that you have and

31
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.099
what the risk is of not
addressing those threats.

32
00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.526
And then, recommended next steps.

33
00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:12.951
Which might include,
what we usually will say is,

34
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:17.255
there's not enough user research for
us to make really informed

35
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:21.489
recommendations around what
content we are going to include.

36
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.860
So we recommend that.

37
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.270
If you don't do that,

38
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.174
the risk is that we're not gonna meet
the true needs of your primary users, and

39
00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:34.729
so we'll just include that to kind of
cover our butts as we move forward.

40
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:35.936
And then sign off.

41
00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:37.940
Okay?

42
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.221
&gt;&gt; One other thing too that I'm
noticing you're doing a lot of, and

43
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:45.339
this is really awesome is that when like,
under themes when you say outdated CMS,

44
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.218
that's something chances are,
visitors to the site aren't gonna notice,

45
00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:51.687
that's actually kind of
maintaining the site.

46
00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.545
&gt;&gt; That's structure and
process, basically.

47
00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.241
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

48
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.722
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:56.722 --> 00:03:02.241
Yeah, and that is the editorial and
experience is the content design and

50
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:06.416
that is the stuff that people
are going to see, right?

51
00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:10.482
Systems design is the stuff
that makes the content go.

52
00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.470
So it's almost like
the behind the scenes piece.

53
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.440
But that is what is gonna have the
greatest impact on your content itself.

54
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.870
And that's why even if it,

55
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.270
we aren't necessarily empowered to make
decisions about it ourselves, it's so

56
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.180
important for us to pay attention to it
and identify it like where are the cracks?

57
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.250
Where are the gaps, where are
opportunities for me to shift a mindset or

58
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.130
to ask for something a different way or
to connect with

59
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.670
somebody I haven't spoken with before
around content requirements or my needs.

60
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.676
I mean, one example that I often
give about a conversation that

61
00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:54.629
can have a terrific impact on content
quality after it's been published or

62
00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.817
as it's been maintained.

63
00:03:56.817 --> 00:04:02.604
Is that oftentimes, what the writer, we'll
talk about text here, what the writer

64
00:04:02.604 --> 00:04:07.493
hands off and what the developer receives,
the developer does not have

65
00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:13.160
the information they need to appropriately
code and publish the content.

66
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.470
So there are a million open questions that
they have that are not covered off on

67
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.710
in the document.

68
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.630
A really simple example is metadata.

69
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.240
Right, so the developer ends up writing
their own metadata for the page.

70
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.448
Or there are 14 different fields and
buttons and

71
00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:37.408
interface copy that
hasn't been accounted for

72
00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:41.132
either in the design or in the deck.

73
00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:43.010
And so the developer ends
up having to write that.

74
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.890
And so a conversation that has to be
had early on is we want to talk to

75
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.430
your developers to make sure that what
we're delivering, the way in which we're

76
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.020
delivering it, whether it's in
a Word doc or in the CMS or

77
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.440
in some other kind of format, the way
in which you're delivering it works.

78
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.640
For them, right?

79
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.190
Because if we deliver
documentation with holes, or

80
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.160
with inconsistencies, that's gonna have
a significant impact on the output.

81
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.890
And it also has an effect
on our developers' time.

82
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.760
It's more respectful to be able to deliver
what they need the first time around.

83
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.771
So that's an example.
