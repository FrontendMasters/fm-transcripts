00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.930
This is an example of
an annotated wireframe.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.300
I don't know if you guys
have used these per se, but

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.650
this is where you're specifically calling
out purpose of each content component.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.390
And the hierarchy is laid
out on the wireframe itself.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.380
Okay, so these are examples.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080
This is a lot of work.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.110
I do not recommend doing this for
every single page of your site.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.799
I do strongly recommend doing this for
key pages.

9
00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.899
So the homepage, all the landing pages,

10
00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.290
any other high traffic page,
page that is going to lead

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.933
people directly to conversion,
or to get them as a lead.

12
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:47.058
All right, those are all key pages that
we do wanna create either page tables or

13
00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.430
these annotated wireframes for.

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.069
I really would like to encourage

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.590
the designers in the room to get away
from lorem ipsum, as much as possible.

16
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.250
It's really easy to design for
character counts and font sizes.

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.190
It's much more difficult to design for
content substance.

18
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.022
But that's where you're
going to get quality design,

19
00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:11.968
that where the form follows the function.

20
00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:16.414
Okay, this is not to suggest that
you're never going to need copy to

21
00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:21.406
support design requirements,
because sometimes that just happens like,

22
00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:25.072
but what the typical thing that
I see a lot of times is that

23
00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:29.143
every page will require a subhead,
and then a sub, subhead.

24
00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.136
And you end up just being redundant, and

25
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:35.128
it's a design element that ends up just
getting in people's way, for example.

26
00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.687
So where if you had designed
with real content to begin with,

27
00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:40.010
you would have saying no,
they're being redundant.
