1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.470
So here is a larger framework for
content strategy beyond activities,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.040
this sort of divides
things up a little bit.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.030
So if we think about it in terms of
content design and systems design,

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.650
where systems design is really
providing the foundation

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.930
of our content strategy activities.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.650
The role of content strategy throughout
any project process and throughout,

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.940
in fact, the content life cycle beyond
project which is in terms of maintenance

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.180
is to define content.

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.500
Make content recommendations,
prioritize the content in terms of how and

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.585
when it will be presented
in the digital experience.

11
00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:38.780
Integrate the content activities
that are happening across teams.

12
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.030
Systematize those activities so

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.320
that we know what to expect, when to
expect it, whose roles are responsible.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
And from a content perspective,
what kind of model we're using for

15
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.790
content reuse, and
then measure its success.

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.570
So let's dig into that
just a little bit more.

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.150
So content design is a relatively new term
that was introduced by Sarah Richards

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.430
in the UK.

19
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.840
If you visit gov.uk ever,
just as a sort of point of interest,

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.150
this was the British
government made a decision

21
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.959
that they were going to
completely digitize.

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.390
Or make government services
digital friendly, basically.

23
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.540
So if you've ever tried to like, go and
figure out can I renew my driver's license

24
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.630
online or how do I do this
thing through the government?

25
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.240
It is a nightmare experience
just about anywhere in the US.

26
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.280
And the UK determined we are, and

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.670
they had sponsorship from this right from
the top, that we are going to completely

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
redesign our digital services
around user needs specifically.

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.180
So if you go to gov.uk, what you will see
is that everything is based on tasks.

30
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.250
And this has become sort of like the holy
grail for content strategists everywhere

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.600
because now we're not looking
at this like gorgeous marketing.

32
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.680
The UK's super awesome website.

33
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.740
It is all around the user experience.

34
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.590
So Sarah introduced this term,
content design, to mean using data and

35
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.390
evidence to give the audience what they
need, at the time they need it, and

36
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.020
in a way that they expect.

37
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.980
Which, as far as I'm concerned, is how we
should be approaching the ideal digital

38
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.120
experience in any platform for
any tool anywhere on the internet.

39
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.690
So when we think about the editorial side
of things, this is really when we're

40
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.010
talking about what the content is,
what is the substance of that content.

41
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.840
What's the meat in our content sandwich.

42
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.059
These are questions that you,
that often times in marketing and

43
00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.930
brand will tackle, what is their mission?

44
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.760
Who are our target audiences for
this content?

45
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.450
What's our point of view with the content?

46
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.070
What are brand and

47
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.540
language standards or legal
requirements do we need to comply with?

48
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.360
What's our voice and tone?

49
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.880
And then what's our publishing cadence?

50
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.900
So that was a question about amount of
content if we are gonna be regularly

51
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.800
publishing content, like news or
blog posts, or system updates.

52
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.100
How often do we need to be
thinking about content changes?

53
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.700
And what kind of resources do we
need to allocate towards that?

54
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.470
And on the flip side, if we don't have
resources to allocate towards it,

55
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.620
then how does that have an impact
on our publishing cadence?

56
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.190
Okay?

57
00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:24.180
And then this is from
the experience design perspective.

58
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.870
And hopefully, folks that work
with experienced designers,

59
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.050
who do experience design
recognize some of these questions.

60
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.280
What are users needs and
preferences, not just who are they,

61
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.730
but what do they need and what do
they prefer when it comes to content?

62
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.710
What does our ecosystem look like?

63
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.680
What are their journeys?

64
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.000
Not necessarily just
the journeys that we design, but

65
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.460
the journeys that they're actually taking.

66
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.040
What formats will our content take
across the digital experience?

67
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.700
How will our design
patterns shape our content

68
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.070
across different screen sizes and beyond?

69
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.159
And what metrics will we use
to measure our performance?

70
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.846
So these are all questions that content
strategy in the center as a practice and

71
00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:08.587
with all those activities that we
discussed begin to tie together

72
00:04:08.587 --> 00:04:11.019
the answers to these questions.

73
00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.058
Because when you make
a decision about experience,

74
00:04:15.058 --> 00:04:19.848
you're having an impact on editorial and
vice versa, okay?

75
00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:21.730
All right, let's look at systems design.

76
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.960
This is the dictionary
definition of systems design,

77
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.370
which is the process of defining
the architectural modules and data for

78
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.410
a system to satisfy
specified requirements.

79
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.340
So, if in content design,
the requirements are being set.

80
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.940
We also need to have systems designed to
make sure that they're being delivered

81
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.590
upon as needed.

82
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.120
And that requires architecture,

83
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.160
it requires appropriate data
to be attached to it, etc.

84
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.210
So, this is where we come
into our contents structure.

85
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.640
How are we organizing the content for
browse-and-find?

86
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.340
This is also a part of experience.

87
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.098
But it is a structural question that can
and should be addressed in addition or

88
00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:03.620
in concert with what
are the metadata frameworks,

89
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.350
taxonomy and
content models that we're using.

90
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.560
To categorize and reuse content so that
the machines can pay attention to it and

91
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.730
do what they need to do with it.

92
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.340
What tags are we using on our
content that are most intuitive for

93
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.880
users as they are sorting
through the content?

94
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.580
How are we going to structure it for
future reuse?

95
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.910
And then what requirements do we need
to be considering for our content for

96
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.680
personalization, dynamic delivery, or AI?

97
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.320
We can have a little chat about AI
later if you want to in preparation for

98
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.860
all the stuff I knew
was gonna be thrown at.

99
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.210
Did some learning about it and

100
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.065
I came to the conclusion that no
one I know is ready for AI [LAUGH].

101
00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:47.180
And then finally the systems
that we discuss in process.

102
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.341
One of the things I hear a lot from the
folks in my workshops is that they really

103
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:55.306
have little to no control over what
the process looks like when it comes to

104
00:05:55.306 --> 00:05:55.906
content.

105
00:05:55.906 --> 00:06:00.744
The very least that we can do is try to
map our workflow to identify where content

106
00:06:00.744 --> 00:06:02.798
is falling through the cracks and

107
00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:06.189
begin to have that conversation
with our larger team.

108
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:11.830
And we're lucky at because we're often
called in to design systems like this.

109
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.250
Where we are making recommendations about
workflow, and models, and roles, and

110
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.350
responsibilities, and
governance frameworks and so on.

111
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.780
So that is a part of
the content strategy process.

112
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.140
I'd say nine times out of ten.

113
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.620
When I talk to folks in workshops,
they are focused more on the front lines

114
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.670
of content and
not necessarily responsible for

115
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.410
what's happening to move it
through the organization.

116
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.230
Which can be frustrating.
