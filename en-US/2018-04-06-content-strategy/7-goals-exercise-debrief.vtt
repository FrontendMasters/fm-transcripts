1
00:00:02.531 --> 00:00:05.941
I got to the mission part and got wrapped
up in the metaphysical question and

2
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.687
I was like, my god, I don't know.

3
00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:12.636
[LAUGH] So I just stopped.

4
00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:17.242
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Were you doing a mission for
your organization or for?

5
00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:19.237
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,
I was trying to do it for myself.

6
00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:20.279
&gt;&gt; For yourself.

7
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.103
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's a secret.

8
00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:23.494
&gt;&gt; Why do I exist?

9
00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:26.581
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's what I should do.

10
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.020
[LAUGH] That's a tactic.

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.606
All right, so sorry,
you said the strategy was tough.

12
00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:33.415
Tell me a little bit about that.

13
00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:36.062
&gt;&gt; I didn't know how to define it.

14
00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:39.049
I guess I need more examples or

15
00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.836
I don't know what the key
initiative would be.

16
00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:48.114
I mean, would you kind of describe that as
this is the number one thing you should do

17
00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:51.064
if you do nothing else or-
&gt;&gt; It can be a series of key initiatives.

18
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:56.079
There doesn't just have to be
one organizational strategy.

19
00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.407
Here's the thing is that there
are different levels of strategy.

20
00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:02.532
There's like operational strategy,
there's functional strategy.

21
00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:07.511
So a lot of times when people talk about
strategy, an example they often use

22
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:11.701
is Southwest which is to deliver
the best flying experience for

23
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:14.088
the least possible money, right?

24
00:01:14.088 --> 00:01:16.799
That was their operating
strategy that they went after,

25
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.330
it's there- it infuses their brand,
it infuses everything.

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.217
But from a functionalist perspective,
we're never involved in

27
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:28.963
the operating strategy unless maybe we're
a part of a two or three person team.

28
00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:31.906
But if we're contracting
in with someone or

29
00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:37.154
if we're with an organization with
more than 30 people, or 20, or 12,

30
00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:42.345
or whatever, we in our roles are likely
not involved in operating strategy.

31
00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:45.953
What we tend to deal with is more of
a functional strategy where we work

32
00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:50.140
within a team that serves this very
specific function within an organization.

33
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.320
And so we may have different key
initiatives over the course of

34
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.990
a 9 months, or a year, or 15 months or
whatever that we're focused on.

35
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.258
A website launch can be a key strategic
initiative that we've decided from

36
00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:10.465
a strategic perspective that we have to
just burn our website to the ground and

37
00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:10.998
redo it.

38
00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:15.647
We can decide from a key strategic
initiative that we are going to

39
00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:20.136
enter into interactive digital
experience production and-

40
00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:21.792
&gt;&gt; So it can be short term.

41
00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.798
&gt;&gt; Strategy is usually goals or
longer term strategy.

42
00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:30.264
When you think about you're getting to
your goal as a marathon, strategies

43
00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:34.939
are like your sprint, so they are key,
meaningful- they're key initiatives

44
00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.373
to create meaningful change that will
move you along your path to the goal.

45
00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:40.385
Okay, great.

46
00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.230
What else besides existential crises?

47
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.352
How many of you know what these
are within your day to day work?

48
00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:55.738
You do?

49
00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:56.579
Well, there's only four of you.

50
00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.659
[LAUGH] Great, have you guys actually
documented these and defined them?

51
00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.588
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have a number of
documents when it comes to sort of

52
00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:12.629
the overall mission where we
have kind of the marketing plan.

53
00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.825
And so we also have a quarterly
planning session where we say,

54
00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:19.930
what are our objectives this quarter?

55
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.680
And then a monthly check in that says,
okay, our objectives this quarter for

56
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.640
Q1 were all of these things,
where are they?

57
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.070
Who is responsible for them?

58
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.580
What are blocked?

59
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.940
And then so every month we kind
of check in with those quarterly

60
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.540
objectives as a team, and
make sure they're in the right hands.

61
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.270
That slipped by, and so, the key for

62
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.560
us is at the beginning of the quarter,
what can we realistically accomplish?

63
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.989
And then what do we have to push into Q2,
and

64
00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.642
then on the monthly check ins,
we kind of check things off.

65
00:03:57.642 --> 00:04:01.683
Make sure they're in the right hands and
then bump certain things to Q2 or

66
00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:05.332
take things off of Q2 and
put them back into Q1 because actually,

67
00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:09.205
they're more- we've decided as a team,
they're more important.

68
00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:12.429
It's sort of like breaking things
into quarterly objectives.

69
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.249
Then monthly check ins.

70
00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:20.965
And then we have a weekly standup
where we kind of are kind of say-

71
00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:22.253
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty steady cadence.

72
00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:23.572
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

73
00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:26.540
&gt;&gt; Do other people have that
sort of regular cadence?

74
00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:30.287
No?

75
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.145
Where do you guys met?

76
00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:36.351
How many of you are full
time with organizations?

77
00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:38.621
Just a few of you.

78
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:40.841
Do you know what your
performance is measured on?

79
00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:47.267
No?

80
00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:48.489
&gt;&gt; Delivery.

81
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.187
&gt;&gt; Delivery, whether or not you deliver.

82
00:04:50.187 --> 00:04:53.189
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; A lot of this actually does fall under

83
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.750
kind of the Agile process.

84
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.611
So when I was with the company that that's
what we did in a kind of blinders way,

85
00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:01.770
I mean, for specific projects.

86
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.308
This is a lot of things that we did do,

87
00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:06.736
especially the way that was described here
too, that we did have daily meetings,

88
00:05:06.736 --> 00:05:09.980
what are your pain points where you're
trying to achieve that kind of thing.

89
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.250
So, that's one thing I find really
interesting about this is it does kind of

90
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.650
feel like the Agile process.

91
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.639
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

92
00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.597
&gt;&gt; But at the last company
that I was at then, no.

93
00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:27.405
It was all that, what you just described
for me then that was a big secret

94
00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:31.431
that was kept in a locked box and
I had no access to, so yeah.

95
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:35.579
&gt;&gt; That for me makes it tough
to go to bed in the morning.

96
00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:38.832
If I'm just like, why am I doing this?

97
00:05:38.832 --> 00:05:42.593
I have eight employees and
we hit a total- I mean,

98
00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:46.805
we're a really happy,
fun group of people but we did and

99
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:52.716
especially because it was winter kind of
hit a slump until I kind of went back and

100
00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:56.858
took the time to our team
because it's cobblers kids.

101
00:05:56.858 --> 00:06:02.353
I spent the go barefoot, I spent all
my time talking about this stuff.

102
00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:04.092
And then when it comes
to my own organization,

103
00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:05.436
I'm just like, I'm too tired.

104
00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:09.153
But it wasn't until I went back and
sort of said, here's what I'm seeing for

105
00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:12.069
the next 12 to 18 months that
people started to pick up and

106
00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.343
feel reinvested I think.

107
00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:23.147
Let's move on because I wanna talk
a bit- wow, well, we already did this.

108
00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:31.135
So this is sort of my message here is
that if you don't know, it's okay to ask.

109
00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:33.550
It's okay to say, hey, have manager,

110
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.184
has leadership shared anything
with you around this stuff?

111
00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:39.492
It would be helpful for me to know,

112
00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:44.745
as I'm continuing to kind of push myself
in performance, or to think about how

113
00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:49.916
I can use my work to sort of help move us
in a good direction as an organization,

114
00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:54.404
or even our team, what are our
larger arrows pointing us towards?

115
00:06:54.404 --> 00:06:57.099
And maybe they have it, maybe they don't.

116
00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.790
And if they don't have it, I guarantee the
response is gonna be like, I know, right?

117
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.060
Or even to suggest, hey,
I think it might be a cool exercise for

118
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.850
us to go through this as a team.

119
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.120
Just because we know we
have all of this stuff.

120
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.570
It's all a bunch of moving parts, but

121
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.410
sometimes just to see it all in one
place can be extremely satisfying, and

122
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.090
give you kind of like- shore you
up in your day to day performance.
