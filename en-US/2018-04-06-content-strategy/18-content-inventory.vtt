00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.010
All right, who here has
conducted a content inventory?

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.010
Anyone?
Chris,

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.830
Chris has conducted a content inventory,
okay?

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.580
So content inventory is essentially
identifying the content that exists.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.236
Most of the time it's for
a website specifically'.

6
00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:22.587
You can do content requirements for
a product for sure.

7
00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:24.061
From a micro-copy standpoint,

8
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:27.680
sometimes this content requirements
are just captured in the designs.

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.100
But in this instance, we usually do
a content inventory to take inventory of

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.862
current state content that can
inform future recommendations.

11
00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:40.840
Or infact can also as I mentioned
earlier on, identify for us redundant,

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.180
outdated, or trivial content that
can be scraped and scrapped.

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.270
Okay, so the reasons that we do an
inventory are to build a business case for

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600
content strategy, that is one option.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.650
Sometimes we'll run an inventory to say,

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.960
this website is a complete disaster, and
you thought there were only 100 pages, but

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.780
there are actually 600,
which we see happen all the time.

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.200
In preparation for re-architecting
the site, preparing for content migration,

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.550
to sort of inventory all your content
assets, to determine who owns what, and

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.850
then that redundant outdated and
trivial content analysis, okay?

21
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.210
There are some tools that will run.

22
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.750
Here's what a content inventory
looks like, it's super awesome.

23
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.590
We'll take a closer look at it here.

24
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.020
A content inventory can
basically play whatever

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.790
role you need it to play in your project,
or content management process.

26
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.670
I will say that there are two tools
that we recommend that can do

27
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.660
an automated content inventory.

28
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.340
It's not perfect necessarily,
we bet, ten years ago,

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.320
we used to have to do these by hand.

30
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.260
One of them is the Content analysis tool,
and the other is called Screaming Frog.

31
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.530
And those will actually
spider your websites,

32
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.632
spit out something that looks like this,
so it's pretty fancy.

33
00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:58.700
All right,
let's take a closer look at this.

34
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.120
So we have, in this instance, they decided
this was a project that we worked on

35
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.087
where they were consolidating a number of
different sites into one Primary.com URL.

36
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.430
And so we had to, and it was
a migration process project as well.

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.690
And so our content inventory
became our master matrix,

38
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.320
where we were keeping track of the pages
that had been reviewed, and approved for

39
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.790
migration or needed to get reviewed, and
we're going to have new content etc.

40
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.940
So we had the primary source,

41
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.800
which they were showing based
on the location on the website.

42
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.650
We had a page ID for every single URL,
to keep track of in the migration and

43
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.810
also to map to the new site map.

44
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.640
We had the existing URL.

45
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.930
We had some analytics that were associated
with it, that informed whether or

46
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.770
not we were gonna keep it or kill it.

47
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.460
We had search engine
importance wait there.

48
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.540
And we literally had a column
called Keep or kill.

49
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.580
So you'll see that, and that was literally
are we going to migrate this, or

50
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.308
can we just delete it
from our entire matrix.

51
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.900
With the page title, the existing
page title, which is we migrated it,

52
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.940
we rewrote the metadata there so
that it was consistent.

53
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.880
But as you can see, this is completely
inconsistent as it started.

54
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.840
And then notes in this case from
brain traffic specifically.

55
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.889
So these are just any notes
that we need to be aware of.

56
00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:31.828
Again, this can be whatever
it is that you need it to be.

57
00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:36.861
If you don't need analytics
associated with them, don't use it.

58
00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:41.869
If you need to have a column for
somebody's approval to keep it or

59
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.671
kill it, great, add that column.

60
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:47.600
If you don't need a Keep/kill column,
and you need a redundant outdated or

61
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.330
trivial column, or
just a notes column, great, add that.

62
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.430
But this is a tool for you to wrangle
content or content requirements.

63
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.529
And this way it's incredibly helpful
to have in conjunction with a sitemap,

64
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.550
for when you are moving forward with
new content requirements as well.

65
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.030
This can also be a very useful tool for
writers who are looking for

66
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.710
source content.

67
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.895
So that incentive digging through
the site, they can just go here and

68
00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:20.729
do a quick find for a certain keyword, or
whatever, and then just go straight to

69
00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.569
the URL Okay,
In the olden days I used to make

70
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:30.700
people inventory their websites in this
workshop, but I'm not going to do that.

71
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.700
Okay, so those are some of the primary
areas where we want to dig

72
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.350
out information, for to sort of
identify and measure a situation.

73
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.994
Are there any questions?

74
00:04:47.094 --> 00:04:48.144
Or comments?

75
00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:49.878
Yes.

76
00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:54.448
&gt;&gt; So after you do a content inventory,
and you say, hey,

77
00:04:54.448 --> 00:04:58.934
this is for random content,
or are giving it to point.

78
00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:03.505
I guess my question is, what do you do
with a content inventory, if you just

79
00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:08.381
bring it to a team at a meeting about
the content inventory of the stakeholders?

80
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.816
Or how to use it as a tool,
i guess effectively?

81
00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:10.730
&gt;&gt; Yep, so how do you use it as a tool?

82
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.675
That's a great question.

83
00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:14.574
You only use content inventory if,

84
00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:17.560
you only do it if you need one
in the first place, right?

85
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.010
So you identify the need for
the tool first.

86
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.191
So on that first slide, I sort of
mentioned you can build a business case.

87
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.134
So if you are like our
website is complete mess, and

88
00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:30.262
we have a million pieces of content.

89
00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:32.574
A content inventory sometimes
just has a really great,

90
00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:35.669
what I call a funk factor, where you can
bring it in and you can just be like,

91
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.620
here's all the content on our website.

92
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.730
And it is redundant, and it is a mess, and

93
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.900
it's way more than the three
of us should be managing.

94
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.040
And then you just pass it over, and

95
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.611
then it becomes just a scary document
that can spur somebody into action.

96
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:55.131
If you do it, and you are preparing for
a content migration,

97
00:05:55.131 --> 00:06:00.005
then it does become a point of
reference for the project manager,

98
00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:02.944
the migration manager, the writers.

99
00:06:02.944 --> 00:06:05.628
Potentially the lead editorial person,
the strategists,

100
00:06:05.628 --> 00:06:08.950
any of the folks who are actually gonna
be working with moving the content.

101
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.105
If you are creating an inventory,

102
00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:18.857
it can be used by an Information Architect
to map current pages to a new site map.

103
00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:23.240
For example, it can also be used to
capture new content requirements.

104
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.880
In which instance, it would get handed
largely to the project manager and

105
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.420
the writers.
