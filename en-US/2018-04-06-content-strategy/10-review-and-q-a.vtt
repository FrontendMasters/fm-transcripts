1
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.430
All right,
here's where content strategy sits here.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.678
So the goal should be shared
with the larger organization.

3
00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:13.090
Our work has to ladder up to
some kind of a common goal.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.678
Now whether or
not that means the huge company goal, or

5
00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:21.055
team goals for the year,
whatever you guys have been asked to hit.

6
00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:24.890
The content strategy that we define
has got to ladder up to that.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.350
It has to make a difference there, okay?

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.860
Content strategy also needs
to provide a constraint.

9
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.580
So it will define what direction
the content will and will not take.

10
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.660
Objectives are the content related
outcomes the team has to work to achieve.

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.560
And then the tactics are activities and

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.790
tools that we're gonna
undertake to achieve it, okay?

13
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.700
Here's why I talk about this,
especially with marketing folks.

14
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.090
A lot of times people, you guys familiar
with this idea of content marketing?

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.390
Content marketing is where you
create a bunch of content and

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.200
then you promote it in
the hopes that people will

17
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.900
feel loyalty towards your brand and
buy it and recommend it to others.

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.356
Okay, there's been a ton of hype
around this over the last six or

19
00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:13.381
seven years or so.

20
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.001
And yes.

21
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.890
&gt;&gt; Can you give an example?

22
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.600
&gt;&gt; Yes, I can,

23
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.690
I will give an example of the content
marketing that we do at Brain Traffic.

24
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.530
So we at Brain Traffic produce
blog posts every other week.

25
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.320
We are launching a podcast.

26
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.120
We do talks and publish our slides.

27
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.670
And we do conferences and
all of these, we're creating content

28
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.790
to position ourselves as a leader
in the content strategy industry.

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.420
We will work to promote that content.

30
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.550
We use Twitter, we use Facebook,
we use LinkedIn, we use email newsletters.

31
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.320
So we're promoting that content that
we create, so that's content marketing.

32
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.660
It's also, it's born out of brand
publishing, which is really all it is.

33
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.130
But then there was the marketing
pundits sort of latched on to it.

34
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.880
They were like,
everybody should do content marketing.

35
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.640
I'm talking toilet paper companies
should do content marketing.

36
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.680
Every industry,
they were like this is a mandate.

37
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.100
This is the only kind of marketing left,
everybody needs to do it.

38
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.270
And that is, I don't mind
the concept of content marketing,

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.410
especially because we do it.

40
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.400
I do mind the idea that it should be
a mandate for every organization.

41
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.840
And then that's where it
comes back around to this.

42
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.350
A lot of people mistook content
marketing as a strategy.

43
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.200
So they would say, okay,
our goal is to increase revenue by 5%.

44
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.011
And our strategy is to
do content marketing, so

45
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.320
that we can help to reach that goal.

46
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.430
When in reality, the idea of doing content
marketing is a lot more tactical, right?

47
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.390
Where we can say,

48
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.430
we're gonna start publishing content
on a regular basis as an objective.

49
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.460
And the content marketing activities
themselves are very tactical, right?

50
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.986
And so what happens is that we have
toilet paper companies publishing

51
00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:04.710
dumb content that doesn't,
like five ways to store your toilet paper.

52
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.220
This is real, I just presented on this
at South by Southwest, it's really true.

53
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.780
So we want to be really, really
careful that we are, or for example,

54
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.724
A website will say, we want to really lead

55
00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:25.250
with our product descriptions.

56
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.090
And then that it's going to be our goal
is to get as many products descriptions

57
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.180
upfront and in as few clicks as possible.

58
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.722
I mean, I'm just making this up,
this is kind of dumb.

59
00:03:33.722 --> 00:03:38.320
But that's actually a very tactical
decision where the strategy has been

60
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.205
to start with us and
not with user needs, necessarily.

61
00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:45.070
Because we haven't asked our
users what they want and

62
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.260
how they would prefer to kind
of navigate through our site.

63
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.920
And what their top tasks
are as they get there.

64
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.907
We put our own needs first, okay?

65
00:03:53.907 --> 00:03:58.695
All right, so
we're gonna start digging into

66
00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:03.863
some of the tactics within
content strategy now.

67
00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:07.791
Some of the tactical activities that
we undertake in order to achieve

68
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:09.220
strategic objectives.

69
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.220
All right, any questions before we start?

70
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.642
Actually, I'd like to open it up for
a little bit right now,

71
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:19.080
just to sort of general questions.

72
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.503
So I know we had kind of a general
question from the team around your own

73
00:04:23.503 --> 00:04:24.810
content strategy.

74
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.310
I think that we had a question here.

75
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.650
So do you want to start
with your question?

76
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.166
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; I mean,

77
00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:34.638
this is just open to stuff that you guys
have maybe been thinking about about your

78
00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:36.519
own projects or organizations.

79
00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:40.057
Or let's take five to ten minutes to
kind of just take general questions.

80
00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:43.168
&gt;&gt; So my question is that a lot
of this feels very geared towards

81
00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:45.840
text based content,
maybe even image content.

82
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.590
But a lot of what we do on the web now
is beyond that, either audio or video or

83
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.320
even further, it can be more interactive.

84
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.952
And I'm kind of wondering how that would
fit into a lot of what you're talking

85
00:04:57.952 --> 00:04:58.460
about.

86
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.370
Especially because then it feels like
the content itself is questionable.

87
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.194
I mean, to write a paragraph about us,
that's one thing, but to do an interactive

88
00:05:08.194 --> 00:05:12.040
slideshow to tell about us, that feels
like then you've got two hurdles to cross.

89
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.110
Not only will it meet your objectives,
but also, will it work?

90
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.430
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So just any thoughts on that?

91
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.303
&gt;&gt; I would love to use interactive
timeline of yout organization under

92
00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:25.020
About Us as an example.

93
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.830
I actually use that a lot
almost as a joke, right?

94
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.870
Because what happens is we
fall in love with the format.

95
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.695
We fall in love with, ooh, we can do
this now because it's the web, right?

96
00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:41.405
And so the question is, in this instance,

97
00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:46.870
we need to be sure that form
is following function, okay?

98
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.933
So in this instance, if I as the user
going to go to the About Us section.

99
00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:56.234
Likely, I have, again,
I'm just making this up, but

100
00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:58.940
I'm kind of one of three personas.

101
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.130
I am somebody who's interested
in applying for a job.

102
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.130
I am a new customer who

103
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.880
just wants to see what is this company all
about, or what is this website all about.

104
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.330
Or I am potentially an investor who
wants to know who is looking for

105
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.200
stock information, or whatever.

106
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.120
In all three of those instances
those personas have very specific

107
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.820
things they want to do.

108
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.030
I want to decide whether or
not to buy something from this company.

109
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.790
I want to decide whether or
not to invest in this company.

110
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.390
I want to decide whether or
not to apply for a job with this company.

111
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.634
And so it's our job as content
strategist to ensure that

112
00:06:36.634 --> 00:06:41.410
the content that they're looking for is
there in a way that they are expecting it.

113
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.323
Remember we talked about content designed
in a way that they're expecting it and

114
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:47.980
in a way that is easy for them to consume.

115
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.733
So for example, if I think about
the number of job searches or

116
00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:54.392
research that's done on mobile, right?

117
00:06:54.392 --> 00:06:59.590
Is an interactive timeline with something
that you can drag that changes,

118
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.375
sort of the graphics or the imagery or
it launches video or whatever,

119
00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:09.795
is that the best thing for us to deliver
to help them learn more about us?

120
00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:16.790
If it is a potential shareholder, right,
do we need to have 16 videos documenting

121
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.970
all of our most recent shareholder updates
or meetings that they have to dig through?

122
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.010
Or is it appropriate to have one that
provides a three minute overview

123
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.826
of the company and past share
performance and word from the CEO?

124
00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:34.240
I mean that there's all
these different functions

125
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.430
that we need to identify
as being meaningful and

126
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.220
useful before we can determine
how we're gonna make them usable.

127
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.870
So a lot of times I'll get
questions like where do you

128
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.180
think video should fit
into a content strategy?

129
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.526
And my question back is always,

130
00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:49.450
well what is it that you're
trying to do and for whom?

131
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.870
So in my opinion,
content strategy is absolutely a function

132
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.290
to help us decide when and where to use
some of these extraordinary tools and

133
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.090
opportunities that we have available
to us now in 2018 and beyond.

134
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.292
But the technology is
almost never the thing.

135
00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:11.307
&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,
you gave a lot of good, bad examples but

136
00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:16.100
in New York Times I think there's
a wonderful example of using it.

137
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.830
&gt;&gt; They do.

138
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.701
&gt;&gt; When there's a an earthquake
to show the damage,

139
00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:24.847
they have a slider that you
can see the scene before and

140
00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:29.193
the scene after the earthquake
in Japan many years ago.

141
00:08:29.193 --> 00:08:31.681
I remember just seeing
the shoreline change,

142
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:35.970
that just felt like that told the story so
much more than reading about it.

143
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.239
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; And even more than a before and

144
00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:39.130
after shot.

145
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.959
So to me, I totally agree with you
that it's like does it make sense.

146
00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:46.390
Because there's that desire to go the
bells and whistles because it's brand new.

147
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.609
One of my pet peeves is how many companies
actually have a commercial from TV on

148
00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:52.902
their website.

149
00:08:52.902 --> 00:08:53.620
&gt;&gt; Sure.

150
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.820
&gt;&gt; Who wants to watch a commercial?

151
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.750
I don't want to watch it when it's on TV,
why would I want to watch it there?

152
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

153
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.450
&gt;&gt; Some people think it is worthwhile,
but.

154
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.060
&gt;&gt; Well in that, I think a lot of
times what we see is people like,

155
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.945
I have content.

156
00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:04.993
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I have content,

157
00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:06.810
I'm gonna put it on my site.

158
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.650
&gt;&gt; Which goes into the other thing
I asked about, about quantity.

159
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.121
That in a way, it's like,
well, let's pad this out with,

160
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:13.540
that's something I've
encountered a lot of times too.

161
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.743
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; But if that makes sense,

162
00:09:15.743 --> 00:09:19.850
is it useful and
does it actually help tell the story?

163
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.008
&gt;&gt; And the two examples that you gave
from the New York Times, absolutely.

164
00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:26.930
Form followed function,
people want to see how bad it was.

165
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.970
Well, here's a gorgeous, amazing,
shocking way to show how bad it was.

166
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.220
What else?

167
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.779
&gt;&gt; Just maybe a general kinda overall,
I see this happen a lot.

168
00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:47.320
Where the tech person goes to the designer
and says, we need to design this thing.

169
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.226
And the designer's like,
well, what am I designing?

170
00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:52.957
Or the tech person and
the CEO or whatever are like,

171
00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:53.526
to the designer, what am I designing?

172
00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:58.187
And then the conversation needs

173
00:09:58.187 --> 00:10:03.250
to go back to the content first.

174
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.370
And so it's like educating
the tech side that like, hey,

175
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.510
look, it's got to start with the content.

176
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:14.250
It's got to start with the copy first,
and then that can be the source of truth.

177
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.540
So I'm excited about the artifacts that
you're kind of talking about the tools.

178
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.810
Because we can apply that and
say okay, well, where's x artifact?

179
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.330
Or where's the source?

180
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.430
Because then that can be what the designer
can actually design something.

181
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.420
&gt;&gt; Yep.

182
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.360
&gt;&gt; In this case.

183
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.991
&gt;&gt; It really is therapeutic actually.

184
00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:36.687
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I told you, yeah.

185
00:10:36.687 --> 00:10:39.250
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's content therapy.

186
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.310
But I feel like that I
just see that a lot.

187
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.024
Where the tech person's like,
just make it happen and no,

188
00:10:47.024 --> 00:10:53.092
you need to in our case, Christopher is
a lot of the source of truth for this.

189
00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:55.956
He puts together the content and

190
00:10:55.956 --> 00:11:01.060
then that is the source of truth,
the material the copy.

191
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.262
And then that the designer can
take the intent of the copy and

192
00:11:05.262 --> 00:11:10.308
the content and actually design
something that carries that through,

193
00:11:10.308 --> 00:11:14.580
carries that messaging through
verses like the tag icon.

194
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.781
Hey, where is the design,
I need to build this.

195
00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:22.410
It's like well, we kind of need it,
walk before you run.

196
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.604
&gt;&gt; I had a variation of that,

197
00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:27.260
except what I usually encountered is just
make it pretty, which is even worse.

198
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.448
Here's the content, it's just text on
a screen, just make it pretty, with no

199
00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:33.810
concern for anything, just design and-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

200
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.743
&gt;&gt; That's just infuriating.
[LAUGH]

201
00:11:37.743 --> 00:11:39.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny is that I still

202
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.519
run into that with my designer,
where I'm just like,

203
00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.670
I just want to announce this one thing.

204
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.412
Why can't you just,
let's just make it attractive.

205
00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:48.981
I mean, after I've been working
with him for nine years,

206
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:50.560
he wants to throttle me every time.

207
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.000
And so it's an easy thing to slip into.

208
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.690
But it is, I think, on the flip side, it's
like designers coming to the writer or

209
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.260
to the content person and saying,
I have some boxes for you to fill.

210
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.990
Can you replace this lorem ipsum?

211
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.500
It's the same thing,
we're both looking for a shared purpose.

212
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.186
And I have some documents in here that
we're gonna talk about later that sort of

213
00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:13.100
help identify what that
purpose of the thing is.

214
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.047
Because it is that question, why, that we
come back to over and over and over again.

215
00:12:17.047 --> 00:12:18.700
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

216
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.760
&gt;&gt; Sure.

217
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.987
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if this is the proper time
for the question or not, but I was just

218
00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:30.310
amazed looking over all the goals that
are associated with kind of strategy.

219
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.754
How much is this relates to
governance in the organization and

220
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.147
how much that kind of takes over,

221
00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:42.206
it almost takes over an organizations
development period, I guess.

222
00:12:42.206 --> 00:12:44.093
And getting things done,

223
00:12:44.093 --> 00:12:48.566
those two relate to each other
in content strategy hearings?

224
00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:52.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure I mean, and we'll talk about
content governance a little bit as well.

225
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:58.091
But again, the idea of content governance
is not top down bad content police,

226
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.915
you will do this, right?

227
00:12:59.915 --> 00:13:03.307
I really talk about governance as sort
of a shared framework within which

228
00:13:03.307 --> 00:13:06.180
everybody can make smarter decisions.

229
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.450
So a lot of times our artifact for
content governance is

230
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:14.380
a content playbook that includes things
like that vision mission goals framework.

231
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.780
And the different tools that everybody
uses to create or plan for content.

232
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.900
For example, an audit,
worksheets and so on.

233
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:31.890
But that framework really can show,

234
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.430
these are the values and the articulated
goals and the strategy and so

235
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.010
on that we've used to make choices about
how we're gonna do content moving forward.

236
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.480
So I think that it really does matter and
can matter so

237
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.710
that people aren't necessarily like, well,
you've made this arbitrary rule for me.

238
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:53.220
And that it seems weird and not like it's
respecting my work at all [LAUGH] right?

239
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.360
And then that comes back
around to the very beginning.

240
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.120
Before we make any decisions to make
sure that everybody feels heard so

241
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.440
that decisions that are being made are in
the context of the constraints and

242
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.550
realities of everybody's job.

243
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.330
Okay, what other questions?

244
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.266
Anything online?

245
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.722
No, I've answered everything.

246
00:14:17.722 --> 00:14:19.600
Brilliant, okay.
