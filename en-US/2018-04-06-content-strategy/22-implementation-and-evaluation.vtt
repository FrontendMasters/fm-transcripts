1
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.796
All right, so now we're gonna move
into implementation evaluation,

2
00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:09.939
really when I talk about implementation, I
am talking about tool design, and I really

3
00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.820
should change the way I talked about that,
but this is a solution design, okay?

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.484
So these are the tools that we need for
implementation, okay?

5
00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.290
So let's start with our project
prioritization scorecard.

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.339
So now is when we are digging into
tactics specifically, tactics are okay.

7
00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.318
Now we have our activities framed by
our objectives as content strategist,

8
00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:34.495
we need to identify what tools and

9
00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:39.733
tactics we are going to undertake in
order to achieve these objectives, okay?

10
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.516
So now you can have all the tactics.

11
00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:46.120
So here are see rewrite
about associate section.

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.778
So here are sort of the list of projects
that are, this is the list of projects

13
00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:53.670
that we've been identified as content stir
that we have been assigned as content

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.580
strategists or that we have identified
as necessary to achieve our objectives.

15
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.501
So we know we need to rewrite
the About Us section we know

16
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.876
we need to develop a taxonomy for
thought leadership content.

17
00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:07.697
We know we need to create a single
source for product details and

18
00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:12.038
we need to develop an interactive
timeline of the company's history.

19
00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.254
What did I say?

20
00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:14.972
It's all over there.

21
00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:16.052
Yep, yep.

22
00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:18.575
&gt;&gt; That's clever.

23
00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:23.267
&gt;&gt; Yeah so here we have,
where one is least

24
00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:28.399
important, and three is most important.

25
00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.421
We have kind of added up how valuable
these are to both the business and

26
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:34.208
the user.

27
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:38.836
This is a pretty straightforward
approach that you can use for

28
00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:43.998
kind of any project or any task or
activity by simply boiling it down to

29
00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:49.783
how is this gonna have an effect on our
business, whether it's our process or

30
00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:53.613
output, and
how is this going to benefit our user.

31
00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:57.459
And it is pretty stunning how you
can make a huge list of projects and

32
00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:04.267
come up with a bunch of
tools This could also

33
00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:09.439
be very useful when talking to management
about project prioritization, right?

34
00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.781
Okay.

35
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:12.770
&gt;&gt; The new setup, it's just 1, 2, 3?

36
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.511
&gt;&gt; Yep.

37
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.252
&gt;&gt; Okay.

38
00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:21.353
Yeah, if you've got a huge list of
projects, you might do 1 through 5,

39
00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:26.060
to better differentiate,
&gt;&gt; When would because some of these even

40
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.080
in this example are a lot
bigger projects than others.

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.772
&gt;&gt; Sure.

42
00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:39.136
&gt;&gt; And so obviously, if you're thinking
about resources, they're finite.

43
00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:41.122
So when would that come in?

44
00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:43.617
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's an excellent question.

45
00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:48.505
Part of working within strategy is
acknowledging and setting constraints.

46
00:02:48.505 --> 00:02:53.974
And so if you're a content
strategy is to deliver content for

47
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:59.122
in market car shoppers to help
them make the best decision

48
00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:06.433
about purchasing a car within the next 6
months and you have two people, right?

49
00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.026
You may wanna revisit your strategy.

50
00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:14.183
Where your strategy may come back
to create single source of truth

51
00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:19.058
blog that we then spend money
to promote and relevant industry

52
00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:24.137
type magazines for in market car
average shoppers for example.

53
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:28.894
Or you prioritize podcasts, right,
or you prioritize like there's

54
00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:33.499
a shift in either strategy or
tactics acknowledging constraints.

55
00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:38.604
But that has to come for,
you could add that to this chart too.

56
00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:43.563
You could add resource constraints,
like is it realistic, rewrite about

57
00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:48.127
us section maybe has a low business
impact and the low user benefit but

58
00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:53.579
we have somebody that could take care of
that in an afternoon, low hanging fruit.

59
00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.307
Let's just get that off of
this list all together, right?

60
00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:00.590
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
