00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.380
So that is all pre kickoff.

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.990
That's before we even formally kickoff.

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.760
So let's talk about kicking off.

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.720
So this is what everybody should be.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.560
Typically what we like to do is we
like to get as much of the team

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.990
in the room as possible,
whether virtually or otherwise, and

7
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.980
we want to hear from everyone,
who they are, what their role is and

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.160
what their expectations are around this
work that we're going to be doing.

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.250
What is this gonna solve?

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.260
What is this gonna benefit?

11
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.690
Whether it's for the larger organization
or even for just for themselves?

12
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.695
Okay?
We wanna be sure that we review

13
00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:36.175
project scope.

14
00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:40.965
Managing stakeholder expectations is
a huge ordeal no matter who you are, or

15
00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:42.475
what your role is.

16
00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.665
And the best way that you can do that
is to stay in constant communication

17
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:51.195
with them almost to the point that
you're gonna be annoying, okay?

18
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.265
Clear up any kind of lexicon questions.

19
00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.550
This is a huge deal as well.

20
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.810
For example, when I say content
strategy versus content marketing or

21
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.564
when I say wireframe versus page
template versus page table,

22
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.470
when I say metadata versus tags, right?

23
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.105
We wanna make sure that any of
those things that people are gonna

24
00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.425
be asked weigh in on that we are really
clear on what, when I say this,

25
00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.315
this is what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:18.135
The word content is something that we
often have to kind of get out there.

27
00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:20.815
So for
example part of it that we are working on,

28
00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:25.441
we're working to standardize marketing
content across a global organization,

29
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.830
the processes and the guidelines.

30
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.730
We are not going to touch their
product description content or

31
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.810
their corporate communications content.

32
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.318
So we had to be clear right up front,
or I'm working with another company,

33
00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:41.756
a hotel company where we're working
with their website, we are touching

34
00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:47.080
the property description content, but not
the rooms and rates content, for example.

35
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.210
Okay, so when you say content,
tomato tomato.

36
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.460
Explain how you're going
to be sharing documents.

37
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.610
And then this is a huge thing that
took me a while to figure out,

38
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.155
if people ask me questions that I don't
have answers to I'm really good now

39
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.748
at saying I don't know or
I know enough about that to be dangerous.

40
00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:10.630
And especially in project kickoffs,
if they say things like,

41
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.645
how many pieces of content
will you be auditing?

42
00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.000
And I've estimated between 2 and 500.

43
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.640
I can say I don't know
the answer to that question yet,

44
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.620
we won't know until the situation
analysis is complete, for example.
