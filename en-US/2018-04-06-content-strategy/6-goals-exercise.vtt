00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.980
So we're gonna talk about
goals quickly here.

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.514
How's that for a slide transition?

3
00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:05.650
I'm just keeping you guys on your feet.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.480
When we talk about goals, and

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.060
I don't set as many goals in
my personal life as I should.

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.890
I mean, I'm usually just like a roll
with the punches kind of a gal.

7
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.570
But when we are talking about goals,
we like to talk about them as SMART goals.

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.030
So a goal, when we set it, for our team,
for ourselves, whatever the case may be,

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.680
it's gotta be specific,
it has to be measurable,

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.822
it has to be actually attainable,
something realistic.

11
00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:39.276
So a goal, it's one thing to have a vision
of our security system in every house.

12
00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.794
It's another thing to say, we have a goal
of our security system in every house,

13
00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:44.470
cuz that's not reasonable, right?

14
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.220
We need to have a goal of like
move 100,000 units by the end

15
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.160
of Q4 or whatever.

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.416
It has to be relevant to the long-term
success of our team or organization, and

17
00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.525
it has to be bound by a time constraint.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.999
Okay?

19
00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:08.598
Relevant, when it comes to content is
especially key, because so much of content

20
00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:13.160
is just nice to have or kind of dumped
out there into the digital sphere.

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.360
So when we are talking about goals for
our digital products, websites,

22
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.530
mobile apps,
video interactive experiences etc,

23
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.790
we need to make sure that there's
that relevancy piece, okay?

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.557
All right, so a goal is an end
point then for your organization,

25
00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:36.869
website, or product, okay?

26
00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.465
This is my little acronym, which I should.

27
00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:43.818
[LAUGH] I was like, there's no acronym for
this vision mission goal situation.

28
00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:47.190
My friend was like, well, you can just do
this and then add the little umlaut over

29
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.078
the O, and you can pretend that
it's a foreign word, but it's not.

30
00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:53.926
Okay, so
what I'd like to have you do is to sort

31
00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:57.560
of see if you have this stuff in place.

32
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.530
I want to open it up to,

33
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.030
whether it's your organization,
if it is the team that you're working on,

34
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.360
or even if it's just for you personally
within the realm of your career.

35
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.030
All right, what is your ideal future
state, what do you exist to do?

36
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.926
And then do you know what
the goals are for 2018, okay?

37
00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:25.099
If you haven't been handed these,
I would like to have you,

38
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.350
we're just gonna do five minutes on this.

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.033
I'd like to have you take five minutes and
sketch out some ideas, okay?

40
00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.415
And it's whatever resonates
the most with you.

41
00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:38.666
If it's for your team, if it's for a
project, if it's for your organization, or

42
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:42.795
if it's just for your career, I'd like you
to take a few minutes to sort of sketch

43
00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:45.380
this out to start thinking
about this framework.

44
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.906
I'm gonna go back on this framework here.

45
00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:56.219
Okay, so we're gonna start here.

46
00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.523
Because it is in being able to identify
these things that's what gets us up

47
00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:00.760
in the morning.

48
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.350
This is what brings meaning to our work.

49
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.940
This is what can and should fuel us.

50
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.090
This is what takes all of our objectives,
tactics, and

51
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.800
targets to the next level by integrating
them into something with larger meaning.
