00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.550
Okay, content ecosystem map.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.820
So when we talk about our content
ecosystem, we're essentially talking about

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.350
where bless you content exists within our
organization or within our digital sphere.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.970
So this is a very, very simple
example of a content ecosystem map.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.642
And we'll look at this
a little bit more closely.

6
00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:24.000
So you'll see that there's
an ownership key up there.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.670
Marketing sales, product development,
and customer support.

8
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.220
This is pretty common delineation
between who owns what.

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.554
Product development is oftentimes
their subject matter experts,

10
00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:41.990
and customer support is like
the Help site, sales is,

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.781
I guess sales can be either on the site or
within an intranet, for

12
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:50.630
example, if there were
the sales presentations.

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.154
Live and then it shows one way or two way
to determine whether or not content is

14
00:00:55.154 --> 00:01:00.140
being published and delivered one way or
if it's a share scenario.

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.200
So here we have the example
of the member community,

16
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400
content is being generated there and
people are publishing it but

17
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.090
we are not pulling content from it and
sharing to other sources.

18
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.850
Support Twitter account is
connected with user guides.

19
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.851
Over here we've got Customer Support
site which is feeding into User Guides.

20
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.680
We have the proposal email, site, sales
presentations that are all owned by sales.

21
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.600
And then this information is
fed into the main website,

22
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.100
which then goes to what
used to be the mobile site.

23
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.446
But now of course, it's responsive
design and it's all the same, right?

24
00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:45.076
Yes, fantastic.

25
00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:51.590
Okay, so this is a useful,
sorry, let me get back here.

26
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.338
This is a really useful tool when you're
trying to get your arms around what

27
00:01:55.338 --> 00:01:59.149
content you're going to be managing and
working with, the project level or

28
00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.310
where you actually get to have influence.

29
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.457
A lot of times, what we see is that folks
only have influence over the site or

30
00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:08.390
a section of the site.

31
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.183
But they are not actually reaching out
to other areas of the organization where

32
00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:18.060
content might be redundant and this can
be in a very small organization as well.

33
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.912
Where, why are we repurposing?

34
00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:24.729
I mean, for example,
on a conference website,

35
00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.990
a lot of times we have like convince
your boss content and then we wanna send

36
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.550
an email about convince your boss,
why wouldn't we repurpose that content?

37
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.485
Well, one person over here
wrote the content for

38
00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:37.775
the website,
another one is responsible for the email.

39
00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:41.054
And sometimes they're just
not like meeting up to say,

40
00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:43.515
we can just repurpose or
share this content.

41
00:02:43.515 --> 00:02:48.221
So in mapping this ecosystem, you're able
to kind of identify who your potential

42
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:52.122
content partners might be and
where you need to go to get one, okay?

43
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.760
I am not gonna have you guys just
because we've got folks online.

44
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.510
I am not gonna have you guys map
out your content ecosystems, but

45
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.900
it is a useful tool that
I encourage you to try.
