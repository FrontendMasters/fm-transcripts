WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:07.546
So I'm Kristina, and I had my start
as a copywriter back in the mid 90s,

2
00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:10.925
and when the web became
commercialized in about 97,

3
00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.982
I decided that I was going to double
down on writing for websites.

4
00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:19.844
And so I started working with a lot
of agencies who were also very

5
00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.067
excited about this thing called the web.

6
00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:26.620
So, I very, very quickly came
to realize that writing for

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.037
websites was not at all like writing for
sure a catalog.

8
00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:34.887
I did a lot of studying around usability
testing and information architecture and

9
00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:36.156
experience design.

10
00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:42.362
And what I found was a complete lack of
knowledge or instruction around writing,

11
00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:46.298
or creating content for
the digital environment.

12
00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:53.945
And it was one thing to worry about
how do you write for online readers?

13
00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:55.906
And how do you structure content
on the page for online readers?

14
00:00:55.906 --> 00:01:00.600
It was quite another thing to try to
find information about how to get and

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.463
plan for content that was gonna be
useful and usable to the online reader.

16
00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:09.097
And so what would happen is that
I would walk into these teams and

17
00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:13.693
they would say things like, okay,
we've been on the project for nine months,

18
00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:17.145
and the design is done,
the AI is done, the coding is done.

19
00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:19.940
And now we've got our dev team sitting
on their hands waiting for the content,

20
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.052
and that's where you come in.

21
00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.022
And I get handed a sitemap
with a bunch of labels.

22
00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:27.691
So I'd go in and I'd make a content
inventory which we'll talk about just

23
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.184
a list of content requirements
in a spreadsheet.

24
00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:33.838
And I tried to start writing but I would
have no idea what the page objectives are,

25
00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:37.063
who the core audiences were,
what the core what the key messaging was,

26
00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:40.570
how the pages were linked together
in the user experience journey.

27
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.606
I wouldn't know anything
about the search strategy,

28
00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:48.095
who is gonna write the metadata, where
the error messages were gonna come from.

29
00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:51.719
I had just a million questions and
nobody could answer them for me, or

30
00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.667
nobody wanted to answer them for me.

31
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.817
Because I had Microsoft Word and
I was a writer, so

32
00:01:56.817 --> 00:02:00.125
I was just supposed to be
able to create the content.

33
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:04.594
Just like they expected the client was
going to just magically create the content

34
00:02:04.594 --> 00:02:08.617
and handle the content over, and
that just never ever, ever happened.

35
00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:12.180
We'd be missing all the H tags, and
I mean, it was just a disaster.

36
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.114
And so I ended up kind of backing into
this thing called content strategy,

37
00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:19.038
which I didn't really
realize was content strategy.

38
00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.540
But I just started inserting myself
into these meetings earlier and

39
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.542
earlier in the project process,
which of course, nobody wanted to pay for.

40
00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:31.509
Because they'd already spent their $96 and
they had $4 left for

41
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.172
content, all thousand pages of it.

42
00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:39.094
So I imagine my delight when I found
out that this was a thing called

43
00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:40.626
content strategy.

44
00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.850
So I wrote a book about the topic in 2009,

45
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.430
it was the first book that was published
on content strategy for the web.

46
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.278
And that has served I think
the community and writers and

47
00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:58.003
content strategists and experienced
designers and developers for a while.

48
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.960
So I've done a ton of
teaching on the process.

49
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.411
We also host a content strategy conference
here in town every year called Confab that

50
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.056
welcomes folks from all
different disciplines.

51
00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:12.461
Which is kind of always been the vision of
the conference that everybody that does

52
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.634
all the things related to
the internet across now all of its

53
00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:19.522
glorious platforms and screens would
kind of come together to have real

54
00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:22.790
conversations about
the complexities of content.

55
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.930
So we're gonna dig into
those complexities today.

56
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.790
We're also gonna talk about the strategy
part of content strategy, which will get

57
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.760
us out of I think our day to day sort of
to dos that we have in project mindset.

58
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.740
And so even if some of this is not
directly applicable to your day to

59
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.990
day work, what I find I really enjoy
just sort of thinking about it,

60
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.970
getting my brain wrapped around it, and
pushing myself to think in different ways.

61
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.610
It's good for the elasticity of my brain.

62
00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.640
So hopefully you guys will have some good
takeaways and some good thinking time.

63
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.230
Okay, great.

64
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.670
So, what is the single most important
skill for a content strategist?

65
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.340
It's not what you think and I'm not gonna
make you try to answer because you're all

66
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.678
still waking up and none of you will.

67
00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:17.100
It is listening.

68
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.370
And this is the first and last you'll
see a PowerPoint clip art guy, but

69
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.630
I came across him and
I just couldn't resist.

70
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.460
The very, very early part of
any project is exactly when we

71
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.800
need to start talking about the content.

72
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.110
And as a content strategist, it's our
job to ask really good smart questions

73
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.480
that will help people see the complexities
of content that they are committing to.

74
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.885
Or that it's not just a brainstorm and
it's not just an outline that we're

75
00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:51.150
gonna create, that it is more than
just post it notes up on a wall.

76
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.849
Because we can start that conversation
early is going to lay the foundation for

77
00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.588
much smoother process later on in the
project, and people will be more invested.

78
00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:07.855
The secret of conversation is that the
more you can get the other person to talk,

79
00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:10.670
the more that person is gonna
trust you and like you.

80
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.554
So, it can be extremely difficult
when we're sitting in meetings and

81
00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:20.852
people are questioning our work, or
have different priorities than we do,

82
00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:25.280
or are just saying dumb things
that are making us crazy.

83
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.255
But if we can listen actively and
reflect back to people what it

84
00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:35.040
is that they're saying,
it actually creates pathways for

85
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.365
them to be able to listen to us and
to our perspective.

86
00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:44.106
So we're gonna start today
by interviewing each other,

87
00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:47.472
which I know you're all excited about.

88
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:53.528
If you're at home, you can interview
yourselves [LAUGH] or your cat.

89
00:05:53.528 --> 00:05:58.408
So this is, I don't know how much,
one of the things that I see in content

90
00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:02.968
is that a lot of the disconnects
that happened are because content,

91
00:06:02.968 --> 00:06:06.248
we'll talk about this
two content activities,

92
00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:10.339
are really spread out throughout a team or
an organization.

93
00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.088
It's very rare that we have like this
beautiful centralized content strategy

94
00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:17.679
team that is connecting all the dots
between all the different functions.

95
00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:20.910
They usually there are conversations
happening about content in IT, for

96
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.662
example, and conversations happening in
marketing and conversations happening in

97
00:06:24.662 --> 00:06:28.450
UX design, and conversations happening
within the subject matter experts.

98
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.160
And there's no connective tissue
between those things, and

99
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.560
that's the role that
content strategy can play.

100
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.520
So, if there are pain points that
you are experiencing with content,

101
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.690
the best way to begin to solve them is to
sit down with somebody over coffee and

102
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.350
just say, tell me about what your pain
points are, where you see opportunities.

103
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:54.390
So, here are the questions that I would
like to have you guys think about.

104
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.850
We don't need to go on to what do you
think will make this project a success

105
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.910
necessarily.

106
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.630
What I would love to do is have you
just sit with each other, ask about

107
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.500
what your role is, either within your
organization or this time in your career.

108
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.640
If you can just give observations
about what you have seen and

109
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.150
his primary pain points in the development
part or design process with content,

110
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.190
that would be terrific.

111
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.640
If you haven't had that much experience
working directly with a writer or

112
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.730
with a content strategist at all,
maybe you wanna talk

113
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:34.440
about just general pain points you as
a web user experience with content online.

114
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.080
There are so much pain and
suffering around the topic of

115
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.550
content [LAUGH] that I just encourage you
to sort of explore that with each other.

116
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:50.480
And then what I'd like to have you
do is try to differentiate between

117
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.620
what the symptoms are and the cause.

118
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.220
But here's why we're gonna do this,
is that one of you is going to be

119
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.350
the interviewer and
one of you is going to be the interviewee.

120
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:05.980
And as the interviewer,
here are your directions, okay?

121
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.770
One thing that happens when we
are interviewing is that our own

122
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.070
perspectives and ideas and
thoughts start to bubble up.

123
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:19.100
And we either want to add our two cents or
empathize or jump in with a solution.

124
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.620
This is a huge thing that I see especially
with experience consultants is that

125
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.360
I often say that there
are 1,000,001 content symptoms, and

126
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.780
a very finite number of
actual problem causes.

127
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.360
I want to go back and
talk about that real quick, too.

128
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.400
So, I feel like I've seen just
about everything there is to see

129
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.810
when in terms of dysfunction content
within teams and organizations.

130
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.960
But it's very important for me not to jump
in and go, yeah, I've seen that before,

131
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.040
and you know one thing that we should
talk about is, and jump to solution.

132
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.660
So, your first job as an interviewer
is to just be quiet and listen.

133
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.610
If you have to take notes, ask permission.

134
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.090
Before you do start taking notes, I want
to encourage you all to take notes in

135
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.220
these mock interview sessions,
because the art of listening and

136
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.400
writing at the same time is something
that needs to be kind of developed.

137
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.461
I typically we'll take notes by
hand just because it allows me

138
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:22.225
a more personal connection with
the person that I'm interviewing, but

139
00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:26.774
I certainly will let you do whatever
you're most comfortable with.

140
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:27.668
Don't finish sentences.

141
00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:29.108
Don't try to relate.

142
00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:30.628
Don't offer solutions or
insights on the spot.

143
00:09:30.628 --> 00:09:35.606
And then this is like one of the most
magical things that can happen especially

144
00:09:35.606 --> 00:09:38.985
when somebody is feeling defensive and
shuts down.

145
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:42.406
Or just says yes or no or
gives a very abrupt answer,

146
00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:45.748
is to be able to just say
these like magical words,

147
00:09:45.748 --> 00:09:49.748
which is tell me more about that and
it just really opens up.

148
00:09:49.748 --> 00:09:54.010
This is a magical phrase, I use with
my children when they're just like, no.

149
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.080
It just helps people open up and again,

150
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.718
the more you can get them talking,
the more you're going to be able to

151
00:09:59.718 --> 00:10:02.245
establish kind of that trust with them,
okay?

152
00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:09.114
All right, what I wanted to talk
about with symptoms and causes.

153
00:10:09.114 --> 00:10:12.016
So let me give you a few examples.

154
00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:18.855
So, we earlier before we started streaming
a question had come up came up very,

155
00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:23.958
very quickly around legal, and
how difficult it can be when

156
00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:29.878
you craft this gorgeous content and
it is onpoint, it's readable,

157
00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:34.698
it's scannable,
it's the messaging is consistent.

158
00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:36.964
It serves user top tasks,
all this great stuff, and

159
00:10:36.964 --> 00:10:40.272
then you hand it off to legal and
legal just completely destroys it, right?

160
00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:41.769
And it comes back and it's crap.

161
00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:44.424
So we can say, that's the problem.

162
00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:48.706
But there is a difference between
a problem symptom and a problem cause.

163
00:10:48.706 --> 00:10:52.972
And actually legals coming back
with a bunch of legal lease, and

164
00:10:52.972 --> 00:10:57.726
us being frustrated, and being in pain,
that's actually a symptom.

165
00:10:57.726 --> 00:11:02.485
The cause of this,
is that legal does not understand,

166
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:06.726
or does not care about
the ultimate usability and

167
00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:10.667
findability and relevancy of that content.

168
00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:14.592
And so,
if that then is our actual problem cause,

169
00:11:14.592 --> 00:11:20.853
there are a couple of solutions to it, one
of which is simply to get them educated

170
00:11:20.853 --> 00:11:26.567
through a series of meetings or
interviews, or tell me more about that.

171
00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:31.589
I'll actually give you a metaphor that I
use quite a bit about when we're sick.

172
00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:35.319
So, if I have a sore throat,
I'm like, my throat is sore, well,

173
00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:37.076
that's not my problem, right?

174
00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:42.140
I mean, that's a symptom,
that is a symptom.

175
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.452
To find out the cause of that symptom,
we go to the doctor.

176
00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:49.774
And the doctor will give a diagnosis and
say, well, okay you have strep.

177
00:11:49.774 --> 00:11:52.704
So then there is a treatment plan, and

178
00:11:52.704 --> 00:11:56.929
then there is follow up
throughout on that treatment.

179
00:11:56.929 --> 00:12:00.443
And a lot of times this is really
effective way to think about it when we

180
00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:03.179
are diagnosing our content
problems as well, okay?

181
00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:07.259
So as you're interviewing,
try to differentiate in your own

182
00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:10.794
mind the difference between
what a symptom might be.

183
00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.961
And then part of our role as content
strategists is digging in and

184
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:15.465
identifying the root cause so we can
come up with a treatment plan, okay?

185
00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:20.633
All right, so I am going to actually

186
00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:27.016
list those three things as your questions.

187
00:12:27.016 --> 00:12:31.217
So if you guys can partner up and
anybody that's available, I think that we

188
00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:35.835
have an odd number of, no, we don't we
haven't even number of folks here now.

189
00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:37.242
So, let's take about five
minutes on each side,

190
00:12:37.242 --> 00:12:38.647
you can decide who's gonna
be the interviewer and

191
00:12:38.647 --> 00:12:40.000
who's gonna be the interviewee,
and we'll go
