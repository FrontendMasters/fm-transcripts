00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.611
All right, so document and
content requirements.

2
00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:10.284
This is probably the single most
important tool that a content

3
00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:15.959
strategist can use to hand off
to a designer, or a developer,

4
00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.420
or a stakeholder who is going to be
responsible for creating content.

5
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.130
So this is an extension of the wire frame
that is gonna provide more specific

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.980
details to subject matter experts,
stakeholders, and writers.

7
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.195
You're going to wanna include
directional and content and messaging,

8
00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:38.115
you use it to get
alignment on page contents.

9
00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:40.095
It gives writers the context they need.

10
00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.645
It lets stakeholders let go of the words
if we're asking them to fill it out and

11
00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.605
it can be built to fit your process.

12
00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:49.785
So, but I'm gonna read these two at the
left because I'm not sure if you guys can

13
00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.049
see them, but this is it.

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.840
Some people can look at this
like an annotated wireframe.

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.330
But this is really less about like
specific component requirements and

16
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.800
more about really defining and
getting out the substance of content,

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520
either within the page or
the application or product, okay?

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.270
So we have page title.

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.970
If there is an associated template,
we want to call that out specifically so

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.270
we know what the components are that
are required for the content.

21
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.900
Want to make sure that the meta title or
description is in there if the writer is

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.940
responsible for it, primary user story and
this is where we say I want as a blank.

23
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.220
I want this so that I can blank, okay?

24
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.965
So as a mom,
I want to check my daughter's symptoms so

25
00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:46.933
that I can decide whether or not I need
to call the doctor, for example, okay?

26
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.940
So that's our primary user story.

27
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.350
Any key questions that the user may have,
like, is this life threatening?

28
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.390
Should I call the doctor?

29
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.130
Are there home remedies that I can try to
alleviate these symptoms, for example?

30
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.920
Any proof points that we want to include,
as we discussed in the content

31
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.280
specifically and
then priority pieces of content.

32
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.770
What are key here, okay?

33
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.034
So for example, a priority piece of
content in this scenario I provided might

34
00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:26.080
be, if you're experiencing an emergency,
please call 911, right?

35
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.110
Or it might be, call a doctor, let's see.

36
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.265
You don't necessarily want to say
these symptoms might be cancer.

37
00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:38.300
[LAUGH] Right?

38
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.890
You might want to say these symptoms
are most often related to a virus or

39
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.960
just strep throat or whatever,
that you want to put that first before

40
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.300
you would go into here are the other
42 possible things that this could be.

41
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.400
Who is your content or owner?

42
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.270
How often does this need
to be taken care of?

43
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.540
And what questions does the content
strategist or designer have?

44
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.540
That needs to be considered, okay?

45
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.810
So this is an incredibly valuable tool to
introduce into any designer build process.

46
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.580
So no matter what your role is,
hand this off to your designer,

47
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.570
hand this off to your project manager,
hand this off to a subject matter expert.

48
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.550
And just say how might we incorporate
this to better sort of streamline and

49
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.328
focus our content?

50
00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:23.914
Okay?

51
00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:28.263
It's lovely.
