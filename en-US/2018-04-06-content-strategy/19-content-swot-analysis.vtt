00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.440
Great, let's move on to the analysis
part of situation analysis.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.800
So, in many ways, what we've been doing up
until now is just absorbing information.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.190
Now we're gonna synthesize
that information and

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.380
make some decisions about what it means
and what's relevant to our strategy.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.690
Okay?

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.970
So a findings report is a record
of all the information you learned

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400
during discovery.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.180
And we used to deliver findings
reports and not analyses.

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.730
And when we would do the findings report,
we would deliver here's what we heard and

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.500
the client would go.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.290
Well, yeah,

12
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.520
we know all that because we're the ones
that told it to you what use is this?

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.410
We're like, well,
it's all together and they're like,

14
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.860
we want to know what you think about it.

15
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.830
Right?

16
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.980
So this is our feedback on around what it
is that we think is important and why.

17
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.878
So we'll pull out themes, for

18
00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:53.698
example that we heard a lot of people say
that there's not enough time to create

19
00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:57.734
the amount of content that is
currently required on the website.

20
00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:02.253
Or we heard people say that they
are worried that the content isn't

21
00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:07.337
appropriately structured to be able to
be managed by the new mobile app that

22
00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:13.090
we are launching that is supposed to give
a superior experience, whatever, okay.

23
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.410
All right.

24
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.020
So we're gonna try out this framework.

25
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.296
So I don't know if you guys have ever
done a SWOT analysis yet, or at all.

26
00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:28.260
There are only a very few sort of
traditional consulting tools that

27
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.190
I use that I find a value I find
a lot of them are just kind of

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.160
crank out a bunch of crap, but
this one is actually really good.

29
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.880
Where it helps you identify strengths,
opportunities, weaknesses and threats,

30
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.510
although I just noticed that
opportunities and weaknesses

31
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.080
are swapped in the labels there,
that is a terrible content strategy.

32
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.200
All right, so strengths provide
an area to list everything done right,

33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.430
either individually or
as an organization with content.

34
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.750
Okay, that's how we adapt it.

35
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.800
Weaknesses are aspects of your business
that detract from the value you offer

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.549
place you're at a competitive
disadvantage regarding content.

37
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.960
Opportunities are factors that represent
reasons your business is likely,

38
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.670
reasons within content or reasons that
your content is likely to prosper.

39
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.370
In fact, if you would just
replace business with content,

40
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.910
then I think that that
works throughout here.

41
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.790
Threats include external factors beyond
your control that can place your

42
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.340
strategy or content at risk.

43
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.650
You have no control over these.

44
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.290
Okay, so thinking about content strengths,
content weaknesses, content opportunities

45
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.710
and content threats can really assist
with sort of getting out okay,

46
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.560
from a strategic perspective, what should
we focus on to make our content better?

47
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.090
Okay?

48
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.680
See all these nice moving things.

49
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.180
Okay.

50
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.890
So for example, weakness,
you're creating half as much content for

51
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.830
your primary audience as you are for
less important audiences, okay?

52
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.842
So you are ignoring your
primary audience and

53
00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:01.733
really trying hard to cater
to your secondary audiences.

54
00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:06.570
Threat or risks,
misuse of writings resources.

55
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.880
Perception that you don't care as
much about the primary audience, or

56
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.860
the primary audience is unable to
find content relevant to them.

57
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.030
The opportunity is to do user research,

58
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.180
we find that this is often
an opportunity that we offer up in

59
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.160
our analyses to better understand users
needs along the customer journey.

60
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.512
So that you can better
allocate your resources.

61
00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:30.380
Make sense?

62
00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:38.977
Okay, so what I'd like to have you do is,
and you can take several steps back,

63
00:03:38.977 --> 00:03:45.390
you can think about either content that
exists within your product or website.

64
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.970
You can think about content on a certain
site that you go to regularly that you

65
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.980
wish were better.

66
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.070
Think about content on your own site.

67
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.875
And what I'd like you to do is just draw
the graph for strengths, weaknesses,

68
00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:03.595
opportunities and threats, and
try to answer some of these questions.

69
00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:06.265
Does everybody have sample content

70
00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:10.205
that they can think of that they can
use to sort of analyze like this?

71
00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:13.865
Or does somebody need
a recommendation on a website?

72
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.290
Okay, I'm gonna assume you all
have some sample content then.

73
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.770
So I'd like to go ahead and take about 10
minutes and have you guys think through

74
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.500
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats around content quality or process.
