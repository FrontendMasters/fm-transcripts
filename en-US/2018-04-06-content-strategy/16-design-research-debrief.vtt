1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
So, I'm really interested to hear,

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.070
some of the questions that you
all have about your users.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.240
So let's have one.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.349
Somebody shoot one over to me.

5
00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:16.335
Somebody.

6
00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.610
&gt;&gt; What sections of the site do
you use most on a daily basis?

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.760
&gt;&gt; Great, what sections of the site
do you use most on a daily basis?

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.880
Okay, great.

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.005
Do you have users that
are coming to your site daily?

10
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.310
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Merchants.

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.970
Okay.

12
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.570
Great.

13
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.070
Great.

14
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.190
Good, do you have assumptions about that?

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

16
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.810
&gt;&gt; And do you have, and
why do you care about that?

17
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.930
&gt;&gt; Cuz we wanna optimize and improve
the performance of the tools of the site.

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.140
&gt;&gt; Great.

19
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.500
And, do you have information about this?

20
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.680
&gt;&gt; We have, we do have some metrics.

21
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.460
&gt;&gt; So you're using behavioral metrics?

22
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.530
Great, okay.

23
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.300
Do you have any access to your users,
your end users or

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.100
do you have a user research team?

25
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.106
&gt;&gt; I've a product owner who
does most of that stuff.

26
00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:17.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Good.

27
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.590
Okay, great.

28
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.935
So you do have some first hand
knowledge of what they're looking for?

29
00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.148
Great.

30
00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.384
All right, who else,
who else has a question?

31
00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:35.334
&gt;&gt; So I actually got stuck on the,
we know, because we don't know.

32
00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:36.309
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

33
00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:41.270
&gt;&gt; And so you get to that point and
it's like, okay.

34
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.627
And in my example, I have a portfolio
site and I'm in a job search right now.

35
00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:51.590
And so it's just me, it's my little sight.

36
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.445
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

37
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.450
&gt;&gt; And I hooked up Google Analytics but

38
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.080
I haven't I done anything besides
checking on that here and

39
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.640
there
&gt;&gt; Sure.

40
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.850
&gt;&gt; And so I think it's just,
There's so many question marks.

41
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.189
&gt;&gt; That's all I have as questions.

42
00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.670
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Good, good.

43
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.350
That's great.

44
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.690
What that says to me is that you have
a real opportunity for some user research.

45
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.140
And I think a really great easy way to
get at that user research would be to

46
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.120
identify some friends or
some past colleagues,

47
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.490
who have done any kind of hiring
anywhere close to your field.

48
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.700
And just ask them what do you look for,
what's most important to you, or

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.240
ask them to look at your site and
give you their honest opinion, and

50
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.450
not just from does it look okay?

51
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.760
But does it give you the information and
quickly that you would need,

52
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.580
as a potential employer,
to get in touch with me or

53
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.760
to make a decision about whether or
not to interview me, right.

54
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.730
So, in that instance, you don't need
to get in touch with very specific

55
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.200
potential employers, but,
even just like reaching out and

56
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.210
getting feedback from folks who've had
that experience can be enormously helpful.

57
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.960
And we have huge blind spots
when it comes to our own thing.

58
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.800
I mean, you guys know the typical example
of the restaurant that doesn't have

59
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.530
the phone number or
the hours on the homepage.

60
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.090
Like, why do you go to a restaurant?

61
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.670
You guy to see what time or
the location to see where they're located,

62
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.160
and it's buried in the footer or
something.

63
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.750
That becomes a blind spot for
the restaurant,

64
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.610
cuz they think, we need to feature our
food and we need to feature our menu.

65
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.200
Well if I can't call you, or
make reservations, or get there,

66
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.979
then it's a problem.

67
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.080
Okay, so that's exciting.

68
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.210
That to me says you don't have you
do have a lot of question marks and

69
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.270
that's an opportunity to
do some user research.

70
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.032
One more,
one more question we had about our users.

71
00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:53.970
&gt;&gt; In our case,
what type of person are you?

72
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.830
Are you a manager?

73
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.760
Are you somebody looking
to get into the profession?

74
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.560
Are you looking to learn
a specific skill set?

75
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.330
So, I wouldn't know exactly how to frame
those questions coming onto the site,

76
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.010
but I definitely have a question of,
are you a designer looking to code?

77
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.590
Do you have an existing profession that
you're trying to transition to coding?

78
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.800
You know, there's all these different kind
of personas and kind of clarifying that.

79
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.330
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; So

80
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.750
we kind of do that with
our learning paths.

81
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.163
We try to split it into
different pockets of potential,

82
00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:37.397
beginner versus intermediate
[INAUDIBLE] whatever [INAUDIBLE].

83
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:37.966
&gt;&gt; Yep.

84
00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:40.890
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; How many visitors do you have on your

85
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.833
site daily?

86
00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:45.335
&gt;&gt; Well,
I just did some cursory analytics,

87
00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:50.710
I think it's 150,000
unique visitors a month.

88
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.220
&gt;&gt; A month?

89
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.920
Okay, so that's too many to have an open
ended survey about who people are, for

90
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.530
that to be at all meaningful.

91
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.890
I mean, you could do some keyword analysis
but in that instance, it seems to me that

92
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.810
you do have an opportunity for
some closed ended research.

93
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.650
Even if it is just a I am a blank, who
wants to blank, so I can blank, right so,

94
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.030
I am a designer, coder,
writer, manager, freelancer.

95
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.250
Where they can pick one or more,
who's interested in learning to code,

96
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.220
learning to design, bettering my career,
so they can pick multiples, so

97
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.070
that I can find a new job,
get a promotion, go out on my own.

98
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.703
So, that's a one way that you could help
fill in your blanks for your personas.

99
00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:43.666
That exercise of I am a blank,
who wants to blank, so that I can blank,

100
00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:46.624
is very,
very common among UX design communities,

101
00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:51.100
that they'll use to start narrowing
down and prioritizing personas.

102
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.060
So, but that's a good question,
who's coming to my site and why?

103
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.160
That's pretty fundamental.

104
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.782
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yup.

105
00:06:00.782 --> 00:06:09.374
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

106
00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:11.710
&gt;&gt; Well, you know what?

107
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.250
You may not care about
the other audiences.

108
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.880
You may not care about the people who
aren't the right audience for you, and

109
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.840
that's perfectly reasonable.

110
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.590
You know, because that's I think we've
done a bunch of workshops where people

111
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.180
are like, We have like for nonprofit.

112
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.930
We have members, we have potential donors.

113
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.570
We have mega donors and
we have potential employees.

114
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.730
Then there's also the media and
there's people that just, you know,

115
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.670
accidentally click through a link and
their students and their I mean,

116
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.770
they named like, 40 audiences.

117
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.975
We had to say you get four to prioritize.

118
00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.830
Because, if you try to prioritize and

119
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.780
serve all 40 audiences, your site's
going to end up being just a mishmash of

120
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.200
irrelevant stuff that ends up being for
nobody.

121
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.848
&gt;&gt; That makes sense cuz in our case,
our core audience is essentially

122
00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:04.081
people who are already professionals
who want to further and

123
00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:07.160
have ongoing advancement in their career.

124
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.110
So, they want to pick up a specific skill,
like CSS grids or

125
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.960
whatever to apply to their job.

126
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.360
So, it's very specific skill
oriented to get a specific result.

127
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.940
And so that's kind of who we focus on, we
kind of assume you already have a job, and

128
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.360
you want the latest, particular
skill to apply to your job today.

129
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.490
And so
that's kind of where our whole site and

130
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.250
everything we kind of
focus on that persona.

131
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:45.010
But, there are other personas like
a manager looking to sign up their team.

132
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.380
There are people who are looking
to get into the profession

133
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.575
that we should probably have
catered to them but it's.

134
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:59.950
&gt;&gt; Or not, I mean we have someone who's
transitioning right now, here in class,

135
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.830
and your offer continuing education,
right?

136
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.010
And that can be to
somebody who has a job or

137
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.432
who is looking to grow into a different
job, you know, and is in between.

138
00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:17.470
So, yeah,
that might be an interesting exercise for

139
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.670
you guys to go through to figure out
who you prioritize and who you let go.

140
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.290
You know.

141
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.640
&gt;&gt; Can you go down,

142
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.660
too far down the rabbit hole in
terms of trying to define personas.

143
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.410
With what you're describing It
almost feels like you know,

144
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.130
what if I don't fit into any of those
buckets, but I just want to learn more,

145
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.690
you know, I'm just curious or whatever
just and you don't have that bucket,

146
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.090
it just feels like you can almost
go too far the other direction.

147
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.740
&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.

148
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.340
You can go down the rabbit hole for sure.

149
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.590
And that is where the we care because,
like if you can't come up with a better

150
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.430
reason than just we might miss out on
this people or we want to serve everyone,

151
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:58.460
then probably that persona is a persona
that you don't need to care about.

152
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.970
&gt;&gt; I mean the thing just
even further back, I mean,

153
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.180
as opposed to you're
offering education for

154
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.780
job seekers, as opposed to, we offer
education for whoever's interested.

155
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.980
It's one thing I guess for something like
this when you're trying to define your

156
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.360
material that would make sense.

157
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.580
But otherwise, I guess,
if it's actually the site,

158
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.690
I would think you'd want to make it,
anyone wants it, here's our stuff.

159
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.320
&gt;&gt; Well but

160
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.450
I often say that if you make your site for
anyone it often ends up being for no one.

161
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.530
Do you know what I mean?

162
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.910
&gt;&gt; And I get that, I guess when
you're building and designing it,

163
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:36.210
I mean more just don't turn people
off in a way, that kind of thing.

164
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.880
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; So, in other words, if I landed on your

165
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.530
site and this is a great site for people
to excel in their jobs, I'm unemployed,

166
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.946
I might, so I just wonder because
in a way that's not actually what-

167
00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:50.310
&gt;&gt; That comes down to messaging,

168
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.300
doesn't it?

169
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

170
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

171
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.290
And brand and product placement and
product design and yeah.

172
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.620
Oftentimes I will say oftentimes
as a content strategist,

173
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.350
we kind of get handed brand strategy.

174
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.960
That content strategy does
not inform brand strategy.

175
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.020
It's the other way around.

176
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.824
And so in this instance,
if brand strategy were,

177
00:10:10.824 --> 00:10:16.351
we help further people's careers
with online and in person education,

178
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:21.695
for example, then yeah, one of our
primary audiences would be well,

179
00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:25.793
probably we'd have people in transition or
anyway.

180
00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:26.293
Yeah.

181
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.906
So this book, Just Enough Research,
is worth its weight in gold because

182
00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:38.970
it is realistic about user research on,
I got this wrong, play, teach learn.

183
00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:43.580
That doesn't-
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

184
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.804
&gt;&gt; Play, teach, deliver,

185
00:10:44.804 --> 00:10:46.145
I did play, teach, learn.

186
00:10:50.352 --> 00:10:53.466
It's realistic about user research
that real people can conduct and

187
00:10:53.466 --> 00:10:56.955
not like when a lot of times when people
hear research, they're like, ooh,

188
00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:00.444
big fancy research firm, that there's
going to cost us a million dollars and

189
00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:01.750
that's not the case at all.

190
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:08.920
She provides some really very
specific useful tools for research.

191
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.350
So, this is worth picking up and
reading and familiarizing yourself with,

192
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.820
because every single one of us needs to
be able to empathize with an end user,

193
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.090
at the end of the day, so.
