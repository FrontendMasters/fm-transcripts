00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.857
Okay, we are actually coming up kind
of on the end of our tools here.

2
00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:12.291
So I want to introduce some
content review tools that your

3
00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:20.114
stakeholders can use to review content as
it comes in and as it gets turned around.

4
00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:23.420
And then I think that we'll
talk about workflow briefly,

5
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.196
and then we'll have time for
questions, okay?

6
00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.452
Is that all right?

7
00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:28.114
All right, great.

8
00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:38.430
So if you are going to stakeholders
with content that they need to review,

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.273
whether it is current state content
that they need to review to see

10
00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:45.490
what changes need to be made.

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.450
If it is future state content that they
need to review before it goes to publish.

12
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.221
These are for, for example, attributes
that you might ask them to take a look at.

13
00:00:55.221 --> 00:01:00.226
And this can appear in, here,
I'll show you wait, what is happening?

14
00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:04.897
There we go.

15
00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:10.633
And this can be delivered
in sort of a review sheet.

16
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.588
So the attributes that have been selected
here are audience, voice and tone,

17
00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:14.722
clarity, and readability.

18
00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:18.914
And when we talk about cell values,
this is essentially we're including it in

19
00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:22.229
the content inventory,
asking them to review this content.

20
00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.780
And we're giving them
a little drop down menu of,

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.743
tell us what you think about this content
right within the inventory, okay?

22
00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:32.414
So the question that we wanna ask is, who
does the content appear to be written for?

23
00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:33.853
And then they'll tell us,

24
00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:37.242
this is what we're seeing in
the current state content, okay?

25
00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:42.256
And then this is what you'll look for
as a content reviewer.

26
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:46.702
So let me give you an example
of how this looks.

27
00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:52.047
So, Here are two different review tools.

28
00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:56.235
One is for the subject matter experts that
we're asking to review source content.

29
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.721
And one is for actual writers and

30
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.621
editors that we're asking to review for
new content.

31
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.590
Okay, so

32
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.273
if you are, Let's see,

33
00:02:11.273 --> 00:02:14.618
does anyone here actually have to go to
subject matter experts for source content?

34
00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:19.420
No, okay, so
this might not be as relevant.

35
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.950
This is something to share with
your project managers, potentially,

36
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.750
because they are the ones typically
that have to go out and get the content.

37
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.546
So this might be a gift
that you give to them.

38
00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:35.192
Where you say here are some tools for
you to go and talk to the subject matter

39
00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:41.225
experts to see if the content that is
out there is valuable, useful or usable.

40
00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.798
So that they're not just randomly
flipping through pages and going,

41
00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:47.592
yep, we need to keep this,
yep, we need to keep this.

42
00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:49.799
This way we have some informed
feedback on it, okay?
