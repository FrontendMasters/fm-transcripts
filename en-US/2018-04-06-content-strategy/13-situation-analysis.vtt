1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.326
So we're gonna kick it in
with situation analysis.

2
00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:07.512
You will notice that we spent the first
half of the day talking about

3
00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:12.461
the strategy part, the kickoff part,
prepping everybody with interviews.

4
00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:17.321
Really setting up our greater, broader
context and understanding for content and

5
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.944
content strategy to kind of
identify the complexities of it.

6
00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:25.318
We're gonna be digging into tools now for
the next couple of hours,

7
00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:29.242
which will involve a few more
exercises for you guys as well.

8
00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:31.567
So if I can ask you to all sort
of within this framework, and

9
00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:33.576
maybe you've already
been thinking about this.

10
00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.055
But think about a project
that you worked on or

11
00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:40.688
one that you're currently involved in that
is gonna help you kind of have context for

12
00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:44.426
some of the work that I'm gonna ask
you to do this afternoon, okay?

13
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:49.395
All right, so the situation analysis,
this is a core component of creating any

14
00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:54.292
kind of strategy where we are gonna
take a look at our content ecosystem.

15
00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:57.730
We kinda talked about this,
all these questions that we need to answer

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.330
about our content before we
can start making decisions or

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.980
recommendations around that content.

18
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.730
So, a situation analysis,
when we talk about it in content strategy,

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.470
is the gathering, synthesis, and

20
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.250
reporting of information that
impacts any kind of content choice.

21
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.810
So, remember that framework we went over,
editorial experience,

22
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.700
structure, and process.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.990
We want to dig into questions
about all of those things.

24
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.510
So let's focus on situation,
what's going on right now with content?

25
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.292
So this is some of the information that
hopefully you'll be able to get in that

26
00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:35.723
initial documentation dump or
through your stakeholder interviews.

27
00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:39.405
We wanna know what kind of mission,
vision, and related goals and

28
00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:42.900
strategies are in operation
before we get started.

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.070
Obviously, you'll do your
stakeholder interviews and

30
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.530
user research that you have access to or
that you can conduct yourself,

31
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.180
even if it's just kind
of guerrilla research.

32
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.880
Taking a look if it makes sense at
competitor websites or competing products.

33
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.060
Conducting a content audit, early on,
if that is something that is useful.

34
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.076
A technology audit that would have an
impact on content creation, delivery, and

35
00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:04.783
governance.

36
00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:09.515
Any kind of site analytics that
will inform what content people

37
00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.276
are interested in and why,
if you can get at that.

38
00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:16.694
Search engine optimization activities and
industry trends,

39
00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:19.213
if those are relevant
with regard to content.

40
00:02:19.213 --> 00:02:23.084
So again, if we think about how we've
maybe approached content the past,

41
00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:25.981
which is okay,
we've got to replace this lorem ipsum.

42
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.498
Taking a step back and
seeing all this stuff that can and

43
00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:35.150
should be informing content
recommendations is a big shift in mindset.

44
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.760
So you can take this slide and hand it
to somebody on your project team and

45
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.020
just say, we've got some more things to
talk about before we get to the writing

46
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.608
of the words or the creating of
the interactive company history timeline.

47
00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:48.470
I'm just gonna use that as a dumb example,

48
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.770
but you have to believe me when I tell you
I use it as a dumb example and have for

49
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.290
15 years, okay, all right.

50
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.330
So these are the four things that we're
gonna focus on this afternoon because I

51
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.540
find that these are kind of the four
areas where we usually get the most

52
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.745
information that's relevant to our
recommendations moving forward, okay?

53
00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:11.960
We kinda dug into stakeholder interviews,
at least techniques, early.

54
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.709
So we're gonna talk about
user research here.
