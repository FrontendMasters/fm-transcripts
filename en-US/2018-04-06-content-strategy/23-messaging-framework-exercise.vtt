00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.425
All right,
Let's talk about a messaging framework.

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.546
Wow, we might wrap up
a lot sooner than four.

3
00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.738
I'm used to having lots and lots of Q&amp;A.

4
00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:14.298
You guys are just so quiet.

5
00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:18.168
Okay, so in any messaging framework,
our first impression, what is our first

6
00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:22.970
impression that we want our audiences to
have when they interact with our content?

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.710
I would say a first impression that we all
want our audiences to have is like, good,

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.690
this is gonna be easy and help me make
a decision, or help me complete a task.

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.950
So that's pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.788
We don't want our audiences, a lot of
people talk about wanting audiences,

11
00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:44.501
To feel inspired or engaged or compelled.

12
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:48.852
But really, before we can do that, we want
audiences to hit our content and go, okay,

13
00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:50.474
this is not overwhelming to me.

14
00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:54.091
So, anyway, I just think that that
every time I use that example of, good,

15
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:55.793
this will be easy, I'm sort of like,

16
00:00:55.793 --> 00:00:58.210
this is pretty universal
to all content everywhere.

17
00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:04.063
What do we want our audience to know or
believe about the value that we provide?

18
00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.894
And the value statement here is, I know I
can be confident installing a Company X

19
00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:11.860
system I haven't worked with
before because they make it easy.

20
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.320
So that is an example of a value
statement, that I can be confident for

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.760
this because they make it easy.

22
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.020
See how that builds on the first piece?

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.150
What will demonstrate to them what we
want them to know or believe is true.

24
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.110
So these are the proof points that we
need to consider when we are developing

25
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.720
our content.

26
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.600
They get how I think about my work,
so there's no trial and

27
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.159
error when I'm looking for information.

28
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.160
People like me contribute to
their support content, so

29
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.700
I trust the information is accurate.

30
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.700
I don't have to read through long articles
to just get the bit of information I need.

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.982
And they've thought through the ways I
might use their products that weren't

32
00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:51.528
the original purpose and
help me configure them in new ways.

33
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:56.577
So these are examples of proof
points that clearly deliver or

34
00:01:56.577 --> 00:02:00.636
demonstrate and
manifest the value statement,

35
00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.503
which comes through in
the first impression.

36
00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:08.261
Okay?

37
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.167
&gt;&gt; So these are like testimonials, then,

38
00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.506
you kind of hear him in your head or
reactions?

39
00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:16.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is kind of how you,

40
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.953
this is the user mental model that
you want them to experience, okay?

41
00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:28.415
Here is a big messy one
that I will just keep and

42
00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.371
included in here that
you guys can dig into.

43
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:36.050
I'm not gonna take time to look at
each piece of it, but this was for

44
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.400
Code for America.

45
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.260
And it was a very sort of detailed, deeper
dive into their messaging that they used

46
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.970
across a variety of platforms and
content that had the desired impression.

47
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.407
Primary message, key concepts, proof,
related content, calls to action.

48
00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:58.618
And then their three things were
to convert people to the idea,

49
00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:03.385
to connect them with the solution,
and to empower them to go forward and

50
00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:05.143
make change themselves.

51
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:08.472
So those were the themes that
kinda connected everything.

52
00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:11.690
Anyway, it's a really cool case study for
you guys to take a look at.

53
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.694
What I would like to have you do now
is to take about ten minutes and

54
00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:24.287
identify, does everybody work
specifically with a product or service?

55
00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:28.830
Yes, sort of, yes.

56
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.010
Okay, I want you to use your portfolio.

57
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.439
Okay, and I'd like for
you guys to work through first impression,

58
00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.407
value statement, and
proof points for content around that.

59
00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:45.935
I'm gonna freeze my screen for
just a second, and

60
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:51.327
I will actually make this easier for
you to work with, hang on just a second.

61
00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:58.007
Does everybody have a product or
service in mind?

62
00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:06.945
All right, view navigator, play.

63
00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:10.387
Do you want me to leave the example
up there, that's up there right now,

64
00:04:10.387 --> 00:04:12.715
or do you wanna just see
the first top two pieces?

65
00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:13.989
I just don't want to confuse you.

66
00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:17.555
&gt;&gt; I like that example.

67
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:18.415
&gt;&gt; You like the example?

68
00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:18.928
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

69
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:22.118
&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll go ahead and
leave that up there then.

70
00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:26.100
Okay, all right, let's take ten minutes.

71
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.209
I want you guys to think
about a product or a service.

72
00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:30.945
And where we're getting to for

73
00:04:30.945 --> 00:04:35.506
proof points is that's part of what's
gonna inform our content requirements.

74
00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:38.810
Okay, but I would like for you to
think about it from the first person.

75
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.730
If it is easier for you to think
about it as the consumer yourself or

76
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.090
as the service recipient yourself,

77
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.650
then that's just fine if you don't feel
like you know enough about your users.

78
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.491
But think of a product or service, start
with that first impression that either you

79
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:59.123
want to have from the content or that you
did have the first time you saw them, and

80
00:04:59.123 --> 00:05:00.664
work your way through it.

81
00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:03.531
If you can do it for
your user with your product or

82
00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:08.057
service that you're working on with
your organization, that's ideal.

83
00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:10.164
Okay?
