1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.905
So now we're gonna take
several steps back,

2
00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:07.501
we're gonna talk about operating
frameworks within organizations.

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.503
Because this has a direct impact on your
content, it's a real trickle down effect.

4
00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:16.661
So we're just gonna have a little
lesson on strategy, okay?

5
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:20.147
All right, so,
I don't know if you guys recognize this,

6
00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:24.641
this is a pretty straightforward
business operating framework, right?

7
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:29.540
I will say that maybe 10% of organizations
that I work with actually have things

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.813
like this in place,
that are accessible or up to date.

9
00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:36.397
But I wanna walk through what
these words actually mean,

10
00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:41.037
because I think that they can have
an impact on how projects are framed up.

11
00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:45.577
On how teams function together,
how teams don't function together, and

12
00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:48.459
potentially even this is
a framework I have seen

13
00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:51.573
people using their own
careers in personal lives.

14
00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:52.996
So, okay?

15
00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:56.837
All right, so,
when we talk about a vision,

16
00:00:56.837 --> 00:01:00.587
we are talking about
an ideal future state.

17
00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:07.999
So, a vision might be a safer world for
all, or safer homes for all.

18
00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:13.075
A vision might be our
products in every house,

19
00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:17.899
I mean, it is an ideal future state, okay?

20
00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.303
Emission is what we exist to do,
so if I am a,

21
00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:24.433
I actually think I have an example here.

22
00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:29.776
So, but if I am
a Home Security Product Manufacturer,

23
00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:37.337
what we exist to do is we exist to keep
people safe with home security devices.

24
00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:40.046
That's why we exist, okay?

25
00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:41.031
Make sense?

26
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:42.090
Okay.

27
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.282
Goal is a long term measurable outcome,

28
00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:50.595
this is not like some clicks on a tweet,
or

29
00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:53.940
even like number of followers.

30
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.506
This is a long term measurable
outcome that has a direct impact on

31
00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.970
the success of our organization.

32
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.933
Or it might be a direct impact on
the success of our longer-term project,

33
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.383
for example, okay?

34
00:02:07.383 --> 00:02:11.783
So our goal is not get 50 subscribers for

35
00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:17.691
our newsletter,
our goal is raise our revenue by 5% or

36
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:22.735
decrease content operating expenses by 5%.

37
00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:28.397
Or achieve user satisfaction rates of 95%,
for example, okay?

38
00:02:28.397 --> 00:02:31.800
So this isn't anything that we can
accomplish in the next three weeks,

39
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.283
this is a longer-term thing.

40
00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:37.930
Okay, our strategy is what we
decide upon as a key initiative to

41
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.922
create meaningful change, all right?

42
00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:45.227
You might have multiple
strategies within a project or

43
00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:49.626
an organization, but
it has to be a larger initiative,

44
00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:54.414
that is meant to get us closer
to fulfilling our goal, okay?

45
00:02:54.414 --> 00:03:00.218
An objective is a shorter term measurable
outcome, a lot of times objectives

46
00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:06.305
are what frame our prior shorter term
projects, or our collection of projects.

47
00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.040
So, this is a shorter-term,

48
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.993
a longer-term strategy might
be to move CMSs, right?

49
00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.755
Replaced the CMS over the period
of 18 months, for example.

50
00:03:17.755 --> 00:03:23.240
A shorter-term outcome would be
vendor selection, for example, okay?

51
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.777
Makes sense?

52
00:03:23.777 --> 00:03:26.561
Which is still gonna take
us three to four months.

53
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:32.685
A tactic is the activities that we engage
in to achieve our objectives, all right?

54
00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:39.005
So a tactic might be to
increase revenue by 5%,

55
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:44.564
one of our strategies might be to conduct.

56
00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:49.134
I have examples, [LAUGH] I'm sorry,
I'm blinking, but

57
00:03:49.134 --> 00:03:53.704
a tactic might be to post blog
posts every other week, for

58
00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:58.483
example, that's a tactic
that's not a strategy, okay?

59
00:03:58.483 --> 00:04:01.241
And then a target is whatever
your metric for success is,

60
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.257
you'll usually have multiple targets.
