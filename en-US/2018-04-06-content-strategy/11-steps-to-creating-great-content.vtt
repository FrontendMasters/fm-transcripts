WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.152 --> 00:00:07.443
Okay, so we're gonna walk through, we're
gonna use a project process framework and

2
00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:10.050
it is a little waterfally and
I apologize for that.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.118
But this is the best
framework in which for

4
00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:14.434
me to introduce these tools to you all,
okay?

5
00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:16.172
So we're gonna start with kickoff.

6
00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:18.990
We're gonna talk through situation
analysis, the strategy and

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.890
the implementation for project work.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.890
And this can, a lot of these
artifacts are around website work,

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890
but many of them can be
included to product.

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.970
I tend to talk about a website
as a product anyway.

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.247
So, okay?

12
00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:39.205
All right, before we do any of that,

13
00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:45.540
there should typically be
kind of a pre-kickoff.

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.584
How many of you actually run projects?

15
00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:51.800
A few of you sort of, okay.

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.847
I wanna just talk through this really
quickly so that hopefully we know what can

17
00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:00.300
and should happen in these pre kickoff
meetings with core teams, okay.

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.520
So this is a time to revisit project scope

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.160
to make sure that everybody's on the same
page about what's actually happening.

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.250
To begin what we call
the documentation dump and

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.850
to review stakeholder participants.

22
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.350
So we as content strategists, when we
do projects that are really focused on

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.090
the content, there are typically
a number of documents and

24
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.880
artifacts that have an impact on our
ultimate content recommendations.

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.740
And these can be design artifacts,
they can be development,

26
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.920
they can be related to
the content management system,

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.650
they can be company strategy, they can
be marketing and brand guidelines.

28
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.342
They can be organizational charts.

29
00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:44.500
There are always,
they can be existing content artifacts and

30
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.580
whether if everything from brochures to
video to interactive timelines, right?

31
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.210
All that stuff we need to look at and

32
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.220
sort of categorize,
because in our situation analysis,

33
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.016
we're not just gonna report back on
here is the stuff that you gave us.

34
00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:03.290
But we're gonna try to work to identify,
okay, what pieces of information

35
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.370
are important as we start to shape
our decisions around content, okay?

36
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.860
So that's where that starts.

37
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.220
So when we revisit project scope, we wanna
know what the informing goals are and

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.650
what strategy was in place that
initiated the project itself.

39
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.040
What is the driving force behind this?

40
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.490
What are our project objectives?

41
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.800
What should this project
accomplish when it's done?

42
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.770
What's our timeframe?

43
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.001
What's our budget and
what are any known risks and assumptions?

44
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.272
So for an example a known risk that
we often have are constraints,

45
00:02:38.272 --> 00:02:40.300
resource constraints.

46
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.230
And that if we are working with
these resource constraints and

47
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.890
you want it done in 8 weeks but
it's gonna take 12.

48
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.440
Okay, and oftentimes you're like we'll
figure it out and get it done in eight.

49
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.320
Great, you can have it fast,
cheap, or good.

50
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.120
Pick two, [LAUGH], right?

51
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.436
So this is all stuff that's good to
know as you're launching a project.

52
00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:04.810
Here are, I kind of went through this.

53
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.320
These are some examples of
the documentation dump that you might

54
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.060
find useful.

55
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.010
I think that no matter what
your role on a project is,

56
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.080
the more context you have about decisions
that are being made, the better.

57
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.751
The more informed your choices can be.

58
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.509
Oops.

59
00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.360
So this is another thing is
understanding stakeholder participants.

60
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.250
So understanding who is
whom within your project.

61
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.880
I don't know if it happens sometimes that
you're working with even sometimes when

62
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.740
you're working on a small team that you're
not quite sure who's responsible for what.

63
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.930
Who needs to be consulted before
a decision is made versus just who

64
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.070
needs to be kept informed of decisions?

65
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.240
This is on project I will say in
projects within my own organization.

66
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.290
I try to take the role of someone
that just needs to be informed, but

67
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.210
there's sort of specific trigger
things that I need to be consulted on

68
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.600
that I need to kind of give my okay to.

69
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.410
So in this instance with roles too,

70
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.900
we have your owner, we've got the person
who's making final decisions.

71
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.880
Usually up above, there's somebody who
said, yes, I support this project.

72
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.520
Maybe I have given money for this project,

73
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.650
and I'm going to champion this
project among leadership.

74
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.470
People who influence outcomes and
then the derailer, and

75
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.510
I know you all are familiar
with the project derailer.

76
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.900
This is the person who maybe swoops
in halfway through the project and

77
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.040
says, that's not quite
what I was thinking.

78
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.140
Or didn't I tell you we're launching
a massive rebranding campaign,

79
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.040
or by the way,
we're switching our CMS in six months.

80
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.920
And so all the work that you're doing
to organize whatever on SharePoint for

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.190
example, that taxonomies not
gonna be supported on the new CMS

82
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.340
that we have in or we've got to roll it
into a corporate taxonomy or whatever.

83
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.770
So those are project derailers,
we wanna identify them.

84
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.130
And then we have the people who
are kind of leading strategy, whoever

85
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.680
the experts are subject matter experts
are who are gonna have an influence on

86
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.100
the actual substantive content or
functions within the application.

87
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.210
Who's actually doing the work,
the implementer to build the thing, and

88
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.250
launch it and then user proxy,
which are the people that we're in touch

89
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.060
with to understand about user needs and
expectations.

90
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.700
How many of you guys have actual
access to user research or

91
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.755
usability in your day to day work?

92
00:05:26.755 --> 00:05:29.110
Boy.

93
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.400
&gt;&gt; What type of things would fall under
that with a reason your research would you

94
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.396
usually expect?

95
00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:36.303
&gt;&gt; Well,
I think that the most straightforward and

96
00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:37.800
easy one are just usability testing.

97
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.471
Where it's like treejack testing online or

98
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:44.737
just being able to watch somebody
use the thing that you are building.

99
00:05:44.737 --> 00:05:50.110
Even just walking over to somebody in
marketing or in accounting or whatever and

100
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.773
saying, can you give me ten minutes
I want you to try to find x, y or z.

101
00:05:54.773 --> 00:05:58.629
Or I want you to walk through
the sign up process or

102
00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.560
I want you to try checking out
on this thing or whatever.

103
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.050
That's usability testing.

104
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.140
And that is giving you
insight into whether or

105
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.550
not what you're making makes any sense or
is doing what it's supposed to do.

106
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.940
There are a million different
ways to talk to your users.

107
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.680
I find that an easy shortcut in terms
of just being able to identify and

108
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.210
prioritize.

109
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.940
What people want is to talk to somebody in
sales or support and kind of hear what is

110
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.050
it that you're hearing over and over from
our end customers from either potential or

111
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.390
current customers that they're wanting or
that they're lacking?

112
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.530
Yeah.

113
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.216
&gt;&gt; Internally,
we use intercom or intercom.

114
00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:39.640
&gt;&gt; Sure.

115
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.790
&gt;&gt; So we can have these two way
conversations with our customers within

116
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.440
the website, within the native apps,
within our support email, and

117
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.470
it's all in one central hub Facebook.

118
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.330
And you can just basically
look through support and

119
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.240
see all the different conversations and

120
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.920
kind of pick out here the common themes
and put it into buckets and say, okay,

121
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.380
here are the top issues that kind of

122
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.030
feeds into our quarterly roadmap or
our actual roadmap.

123
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.690
So we have thousands of two
way conversations with our

124
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.680
customers to inform.

125
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.160
We don't necessarily create
a roadmap based on that.

126
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.300
But we-
&gt;&gt; They inform.

127
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it helps us have a perspective
of the pain points of the customers.

128
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.750
&gt;&gt; That's great.

129
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.510
&gt;&gt; The common issues.

130
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.130
&gt;&gt; That's great.

131
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.410
That sounds like a really useful tool.

132
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.090
&gt;&gt; Really?

133
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's like

134
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.340
basically how I built this business.

135
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Is on the conversations

136
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.616
with the customer.

137
00:07:37.616 --> 00:07:40.434
&gt;&gt; That's great.
&gt;&gt; Making sure that when you see a common

138
00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:45.441
frustration it's like, all right,
[CROSSTALK] eventually you just

139
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:50.792
once you solve it, you don't get that
concern anymore, that question or

140
00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:55.480
that, and then its customers happier and
your business grows.

141
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.453
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yeah, great.

142
00:08:01.432 --> 00:08:05.065
Would you guys like to know what your
users think about what you're building?

143
00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:06.660
[LAUGH] That'd be nice.

144
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.049
Yes, great, you can ask for that.

145
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.760
You can ask for it you can say,
this is like end user input is

146
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.880
what really is gonna inform
the success of our product long term.

147
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.950
We can't be making decisions just based
on our own assumptions forever, right?

148
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.859
No matter how well you know you
think you know your customer,

149
00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:34.479
your user, think about how
your own digital usage habits

150
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:39.400
have changed over the last 18 months for
example, right.

151
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.060
&gt;&gt; And also Code 42 locally made
their developers even be in support.

152
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.926
I think it was for like-
&gt;&gt; So smart.

153
00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:48.841
&gt;&gt; A month before they could write code.

154
00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:53.210
They had to do support so
they could feel the pain of the customer.

155
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.620
And then once they got into developer
role, they can be like, okay,

156
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.330
now we can actually address these things.

157
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:58.970
&gt;&gt; That's so smart.

158
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.620
Yeah, so
working with project stakeholders is

159
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:10.350
a huge oppportunity and
pain point as I like to put it.

160
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:16.100
I don't know necessarily how much contact
you all have with larger project teams or

161
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.210
working teams day to day.

162
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.300
But these are as a content strategist,
these are things that I need to

163
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.460
understand and
know as I go through building anything.

164
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.640
So how often do people need updating?

165
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.680
At what point do we need their feedback,
especially if you are delivering content?

166
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.820
When you start to deliver content, who
needs to provide feedback on that content?

167
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.510
What kind of edits should we expect?

168
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.600
Do different people need
to know different things?

169
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.520
Do we need to communicate with people
differently like some people prefer email?

170
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.710
Some people prefer Slack.

171
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.990
Some people prefer just to be updated
in monthly meetings for example.

172
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.770
And are we able to provide updates
through existing forms of communication?
