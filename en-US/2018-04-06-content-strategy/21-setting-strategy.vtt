00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.430
This is what I like to
call the groan zone.

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.340
And you guys have all been in
these meetings where there's

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.380
a new topic that's introduced, everybody's
like, yeah, great new topic, great.

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.769
And then the work begins and
people kind of diverge off and

5
00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.309
go on their own separate paths and
their own separate ways.

6
00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:23.104
And then we come back together,

7
00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:27.530
there comes this time where we
are overwhelmed by all this information.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.640
We keep going around.

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.370
We keep going around nobody
seems to be getting anywhere.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.000
I usually do day long consulting sessions
and I always show this slide first and

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.070
I'm always like, we're gonna hit the groan
zone sometime between 130 and 215.

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.929
And it is incredible how every single
time, but nobody ever knows it, but

13
00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.040
between 130 and 215 somebody will go
I just feel like we're going around

14
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.675
in circles and
not accomplishing anything here.

15
00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.569
And then people start
to converge again and

16
00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.310
then we get closer by the end of the day.

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.810
All right.
So

18
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.870
this can be this is something to just pay
attention to when you are doing a workshop

19
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.980
or discovery process or

20
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.630
even sometimes design that you will hit
that groan zone and just recognize,

21
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.440
that's what she was talking about,
and we're still going to move forward.

22
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.490
It's still going to be fine, but
I'm either going to sit back and

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.778
let this happen, which seems to me
many of you, that's your personnel.

24
00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:21.960
[LAUGH] Or I'm going to step in and
sort of say it's okay, we'll move forward.

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.375
Let's take this problem from
a different angle okay?

26
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:27.930
All right.

27
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.736
Now we're gonna talk
about setting strategy.

28
00:01:37.737 --> 00:01:40.370
Okay, first we're going to just
create a strategy statement.

29
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.110
And these are the first three
components for a strategy statement.

30
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.750
In x timeframe, we will address
weakness or pursue an opportunity.

31
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.560
By following this path, so
that we will achieve this or these goals.

32
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.827
So in this instance we are connecting
a goal to the strategy and

33
00:02:00.827 --> 00:02:05.106
including it in our core content
strategy statement, okay?

34
00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:10.107
So, in x timeframe, we will address
weakness or pursue opportunity.

35
00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:17.205
That's where we will play following
this path is how we'll win.

36
00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:18.690
And then we'll hit these goals.

37
00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.810
Okay, and then we can create our
strategic objectives after that.

38
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.470
So based on strategy priority projects and
our activity outcomes

39
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.530
will be and
then we can list out our projects.

40
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.443
Or specific things that we need
to do around content okay?

41
00:02:39.443 --> 00:02:40.460
All right.

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.760
So here's an example.

43
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.875
And this is where content
objectives come into play.

44
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:52.455
So by 2020, we'll rank in the top three
car insurance companies as rated by

45
00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:56.505
whoever, in 2018 will improve brand
perception by rebuilding our website

46
00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:59.185
putting user satisfaction at
the center of our efforts.

47
00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:01.685
So that's where we'll
play in how we'll win.

48
00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:05.745
Objective we need to conduct user research
objective audit content across all our

49
00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:08.799
properties and objective to find
new platform business requirements.

50
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.280
Does that framework make sense?

51
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.881
Yes.

52
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:20.897
&gt;&gt; I guess this is probably gonna be
related to a specific real goal, but

53
00:03:20.897 --> 00:03:23.320
I kind of got lost on
the X timeframe like,

54
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.010
I know different people perceive time
differently or measure time, differently.

55
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.180
How do you kind of arbitrarily assign a
timeframe based on whatever goal you have?

56
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.426
&gt;&gt; Well, you typically an organization
will have a goal set by a year,

57
00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:44.319
or like three year goals even right?

58
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.447
So we need to set strategy
within a timeframe like we

59
00:03:49.447 --> 00:03:56.180
can't just say we're gonna
relaunch our website sometime.

60
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.660
Right, we have to set an end date
will relaunch it by q1 of 2019.

61
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.371
&gt;&gt; I guess I personally have trouble
deciding what timeframe would be

62
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:05.240
appropriate.

63
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.097
Well, it is sort of our best guess
in terms of resource constraints and

64
00:04:12.097 --> 00:04:15.046
competing projects right, yeah.

65
00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.865
You can always just assume
shorter than is actually needed.

66
00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:24.663
[LAUGH] In less time than
it will realistically take

67
00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:28.324
to complete this work, we will okay?

68
00:04:28.324 --> 00:04:33.228
So in this instance,
we are working within the confines of

69
00:04:33.228 --> 00:04:38.560
a website strategy statement, And

70
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.750
identifying our related
content strategy activities.
