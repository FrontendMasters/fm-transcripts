1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.158
Okay, so
I'd like to have you take a look at this.

2
00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:09.660
You'll see that there are two axes lines,
a risk tolerance and confidence level.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.050
So typically what I see here
is up here in the upper left.

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.870
I don't really know what we
don't know about our users, but

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.970
I'm not that worried about it.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.490
I feel confident enough that we're just
gonna go ahead and make assumptions and

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.270
move forward with those assumptions.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.480
That's usually I'd say nine times out of
10 the the mindset that I see on a lot of

9
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.400
these projects that we go in and work on.

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.544
This is a huge risk in
that we risk going in and

11
00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:45.272
really having our own biases inform our
content recommendations and decisions.

12
00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:49.232
Our own internal assumptions that
when we've been navel gazing for

13
00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:52.578
a really long time can be
really skewed and misinformed.

14
00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:56.596
But if you are up for that and
okay with the risk involved,

15
00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:01.538
which is that you're not going to be
addressing your users top tasks or

16
00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:04.084
core preferences, then go for it.

17
00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.811
Down here we have least confident and

18
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:11.712
least risk tolerant.

19
00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:15.929
I'm not sure whether we know very much and
I'm uncomfortable not knowing more,

20
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:16.496
and so on.

21
00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:20.656
It's kind of helpful to be able to
see where you fall within this grid,

22
00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:24.380
it can help you almost sort
of sell end user research.

23
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.520
If you're saying to folks,
see where you're at to help people clearly

24
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.190
understand that not knowing about
what your users want is a risk, okay?

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.780
So this is just sort of useful
to have people step back and

26
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.890
go, I've never thought about not being in
close touch with our users as a risk to

27
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.340
user's satisfaction and task completion.

28
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.760
So, let's say that we've decided, yes, we
want to go and we wanna talk to our folks.

29
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.720
How do you find them?

30
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.201
The first is individual user interviews.

31
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:58.574
You sometimes don't need very many of
these depending on scope of product or

32
00:01:58.574 --> 00:01:59.199
project.

33
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.490
I think that we've done as few as six and
as many as 100.

34
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.550
I'd say that usually it's between 14 and
18 that we conduct and

35
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.740
this is for
large companies with large product sets.

36
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.980
So if you can get one of your customers or
users on the phone and talk

37
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.670
to them even for 15 minutes about whatever
digital product you're working on.

38
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.750
Or revising or redoing or the product that
you're building it's enormously helpful.

39
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.910
Focus groups, these are a little
bit more difficult to arrange and

40
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.100
organize obviously, I am not as big of
a fan of them because I find that people

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.710
either edit themselves or sort of try
to posture in front of other folks.

42
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.240
But they're still useful if you're trying
to get a lot of feedback in a shorter

43
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.450
amount of time.

44
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.180
And then obviously customer feedback form
which is either open ended which is a lot

45
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.080
of, what do you think or
what would you change?

46
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.167
Or closed ended which is where you're
just giving them very specific selections

47
00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:01.897
like on one through five rank, this or
this, or would you rather see A or B.

48
00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:07.129
And this often comes through
just a feedback link button,

49
00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.700
a form pop up, or an email survey, okay?

50
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.399
Three ways to get
information from your users.

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.670
Three more ways,
this is true intent studies.

52
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.780
I really love the simple thing of,
hi, why are you here today?

53
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.390
And getting an answer from them,
and okay, thanks.

54
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.579
Because that identifies kind of what
people are coming to your site for

55
00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.651
pretty quickly.

56
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:36.802
If you're able to measure their subsequent
behavior and then ask whether they were

57
00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:40.850
successful, it does require behavioral
analytics capabilities on a website.

58
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.550
But this is probably
the most powerful tool

59
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.190
that you can use when you're
measuring usability of a website,

60
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.760
or and trying to figure out
if your content is effective.

61
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.850
Intercept surveys.

62
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.450
Everybody's favorite survey when you're
trying to do something and pops up and

63
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.980
it's like taking a brief survey.

64
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.300
Has anybody ever said yes to that?

65
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.140
Anybody know?

66
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.300
No, I don't know what they're for.

67
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.699
And then email service Okay, so

68
00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.850
we're gonna talk a little bit about
designing research for your users.

69
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.770
Can everybody identify a user persona or
user group, or something

70
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.190
that they're working, on or have worked
on, or is somebody not able to do that?

71
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.090
Yes, yes,
yes you feel like the airline agent.

72
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.480
Are you able to perform the duties
assigned to you in the emergency exit row?

73
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.820
Okay, so, we wonder,

74
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.450
this is the question you hope to
answer through your user research.

75
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.380
What is the core question or

76
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.140
the couple of questions you
would like to have answers to?

77
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.100
Why do you care?

78
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.830
What do you assume to be true
before you ask this question, and

79
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.720
what do you actually know, okay?

80
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.640
So here's an example.

81
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.345
We wonder, do prospective students
graduating from high school care as much

82
00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:03.133
about money as their parents do?

83
00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:04.060
This is for financial aid section.

84
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.680
We care because it affects who we write
financing and financial aid messages for

85
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.850
and where we put that
information on our website.

86
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.120
We assume that parents who are paying for
college care more than their kids do.

87
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.500
We do know that kids who are paying their
own way need this information to even

88
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.370
consider a school, okay?

89
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.510
So see how this opens the door to some
really specific interesting user research.
