1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.380
So let's talk about objectives really
quickly because these are a series of

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.200
smaller targets that have to be
hit in order to reach the goal.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.610
Okay, so
let's walk through this really quickly.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.872
A definition of a goal is something
you try to achieve usually long term,

5
00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:20.440
actions, advance progress
in a very general sense.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.140
There are several ways to reach a goal.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.810
Specific outcomes aren't necessary.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.660
I don't agree with that.

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000
But understood I wanted to include it,

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960
because there is awareness that there
are several ways to reach a goal.

11
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.870
And that's how we are defining
strategy on an ongoing basis.

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.608
Goal, characterized as a change
of direction that will ultimately

13
00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:40.620
lead to a desired outcome.

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.470
Okay, let's differentiate
that from objectives.

15
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.040
A specific result that a person or

16
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.660
system aims to achieve within a time
frame and with available resources.

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.630
So oftentimes,
our objectives are projects, okay.

18
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.492
Time frame is a series of smaller
steps along the way to achieving

19
00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.280
a long-term goal.

20
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.380
The objectives are very specific and
measurable where a target is established.

21
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.010
That's a success metric, okay?

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.610
Sometimes, the target equals delivered or
done.

23
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.080
And then objectives tend to be actions
aimed at accomplishing a certain task.

24
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.830
All right, why do I have all these lines?

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.050
Okay, so here's an example of a goal and
objectives.

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.940
So Amanda Gobble answered the top
state related questions for

27
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.960
all Minnesota citizens.

28
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.190
Objectives, we have to prioritize and
conduct research on our website audiences.

29
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.030
That's an objective.

30
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.990
We have to create a website governance
plan to ensure ongoing adherence to

31
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.060
audience needs, also an objective, okay?

32
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.200
So goals tend to control objectives.

33
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.700
And an objective can modify a goal, for
example, if we end up doing the research

34
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.654
and we find out that what people actually
want is a travel brochure on mn.gov.

35
00:01:58.654 --> 00:02:03.525
But that also never happens, okay?

36
00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:05.821
All right, and then we get into tactics.

37
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:11.630
Tactics are what most of us have
our heads down in every single day.

38
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.872
And that is what it means to have a job.

39
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.430
It is the opportunity to sort of step back
and think from a strategic perspective

40
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.280
is many times a luxury for a lot of us.

41
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.020
Even I see at like the VP level, a lot of
times VPs are so heads down in email or

42
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.800
in meetings 24/7,
that they lose sight of their strategic.

43
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.596
Okay, are we taking the right
direction as a team or how or

44
00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.450
is what I am directing my teams to do?

45
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.980
Hoping further move us towards sort
of our larger organizational goals.

46
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.220
And in fact, I think a lot of
times I will find myself thinking,

47
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.010
why am I doing this in the first place?

48
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.150
Like I'll have my head in
a spreadsheet for example, and

49
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.440
then realize I've been staring at numbers
just because I feel like if I can get them

50
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.080
to add up to a certain number,
I'll feel better.

51
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.190
But that ultimately the half hour has been
a tactic without any kind of a strategy or

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.060
goal that it's just been
a complete waste of my time or

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.080
without that doesn't sit within,
I should say, an objective.

54
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.130
All these words, okay.

55
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.480
So now, remember I showed this earlier and

56
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.250
I said a list of stuff
to do is not a strategy.

57
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.770
Now that you've identified your core
objectives, now is when we get all our

58
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.410
tactics together to meet those objectives,
okay?

59
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.840
Yeah, you can't have these because
they don't map up to a strategy.

60
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.900
That's a little joke.

61
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.480
There's no specificity there.

62
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.240
And then success metric measures
the effectiveness of a tactic.

63
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.520
Okay, so
really easy example is open rate on email.

64
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.180
That is gonna, your tactic was
to send an email newsletter.

65
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.410
The open rate is the metric to define
whether or not it worked, okay?
