1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.252
So strategy, so

2
00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:06.826
now we're gonna talk about how this comes
back around to content strategy, okay?

3
00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.020
Are there any other questions there?

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.760
No, okay.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.720
So a strategy is a distinct path
you choose to reach a goal, okay?

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.980
Again, it's a key initiative
to create meaningful change.

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.430
Which, in this instance,
change means reaching your goal.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.840
So strategy, when we talk about strategy,
is essentially the definition

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.265
from Roger Martin who is kind of
considered the godfather of strategy.

10
00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:38.960
Is strategy is gonna identify where
we'll play and how we'll win, okay?

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.184
So the first part of your, and

12
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:46.320
then we're gonna talk about the content
strategy statement that can assist us.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.930
So the first part of your strategy
statement identifies where you're gonna

14
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.650
focus your efforts, okay?

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.720
And then the second part is how
you're going to win specifically.

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.206
So what general activities you'll take
within the constraints of how to play,

17
00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:00.296
where winning equals
moving towards the goal.

18
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.664
Okay, so strategy statement,
our Help content will

19
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:12.030
deliver a consistently delightful,
always satisfying experience.

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.869
So where we'll play,

21
00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.210
where we've decided to focus our
efforts are in our help content.

22
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.940
Okay, how we're gonna win is that
we're gonna deliver a delightful,

23
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.252
satisfying experience with Help content.

24
00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:26.189
Which will essentially help us crush the
competition because no one has satisfying,

25
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.140
delightful experiences with
their Help content, okay?

26
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.880
For example.

27
00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:37.200
Okay, so here's one thing.

28
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.850
This is a strategy and a goal, okay?

29
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.000
So where we'll play is gonna
be our new website and

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.780
how we think we're gonna
win is our redesign.

31
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.326
We're gonna deliver user centered content
that, one, increases leads, and two,

32
00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:50.012
improves site wide user satisfaction.

33
00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:55.435
Okay, so
our goals the measurable outcome there.

34
00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:59.669
Strategy is where we'll play, how we're
gonna win, how we'll win, I'm sorry,

35
00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:01.603
is to deliver user-centered content.

36
00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:07.570
Sorry, that's not very clear in
the way that I've noted at this.

37
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.910
So you can mush this up
together if you want.

38
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.770
It's just important to understand the
difference because a lot of times what I

39
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.318
see are tactics mixed up with strategy.

40
00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:18.972
Here, I think I have an example here.

41
00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:26.112
Okay, so if we have, for example,

42
00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:31.015
our About Us section will tell our company
story with engaging, compelling content.

43
00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:32.530
Have people seen this before?

44
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.580
It does define kind of where we'll
play from a strategic perspective.

45
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.980
And I've got this down to the project
level now, by the way, okay?

46
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.640
So that it relates directly to content and
helps us to sort of, so

47
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.420
this is not anymore the larger
functional operational.

48
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.847
This is more functional.

49
00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:56.000
What are our strategic objectives
within a project, for example, okay?

50
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.120
So this is super subjective because it
is difficult to measure engaging and

51
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.190
compelling.

52
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.660
It is not going to help you win,
it's not differentiating, and

53
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.691
it's just kinda generally lame.
