00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.016
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just have a

2
00:00:01.016 --> 00:00:01.543
quick question.

3
00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:05.048
Would it even make sense
to have a hot observable or

4
00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:08.440
have a set timeout as a hot observable?

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.590
Is that even possible?

6
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.760
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah, we could.

7
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.000
Anybody have an idea how we could modify
this to make it a hot observable?

8
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.933
So, well, you're asking us two questions,
is it possible?

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.530
And does it make sense?

10
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.200
Is it possible?

11
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.580
Absolutely.
Does it make sense?

12
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.960
Probably not.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

13
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.797
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: But you know what?

14
00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:27.511
Let's try it,
cuz that's what learning is, right?

15
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:33.120
And what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna pull this out, right?

16
00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:36.584
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And
this is a little harder

17
00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:39.150
without first talking to
you guys about subjects.

18
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.520
But we can think about how we might
accomplish something like this.

19
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.342
So if I pull this out and run it when we
call time out, this isn't gonna work.

20
00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:47.376
Why is it not gonna work
as it is right now?

21
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.095
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You don't have access to
observer within the, [INAUDIBLE] Function.

22
00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.680
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Why?
The observer is defined here, right?

23
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.447
Not up here, right?

24
00:00:57.447 --> 00:01:01.397
But what I could do is I could create,

25
00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:06.103
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: A function.

26
00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:08.125
Let's create a Boolean variable.

27
00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:20.467
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Right?
And when you subscribe,

28
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.544
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I can say if (fired ===

29
00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:31.303
true), then observer.next(); right?

30
00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:36.509
And observer.complete();
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And

31
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.026
I'm gonna create a handle for
our observer, which we don't have yet.

32
00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:45.367
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And
then once I get the real observer,

33
00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:48.012
I'm gonna assign it to this placeholder.

34
00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:01.809
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So
we're gonna see why that's gonna work.

35
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.460
So we create a little Boolean that tells
us, hey, has this fired yet, right?

36
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.606
And then once this fires,
we set it to true.

37
00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:13.686
If somebody decides to subscribe later,

38
00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:18.560
we just check if it's fired, and
then we send it to them, right?

39
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.600
But if they come in before it's fired,
they just set this placeholder to

40
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.900
their real observer, and then when we
come in, we fire at it, make sense?

41
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.730
So technically the interesting thing
is this is still a cold observable.

42
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.860
Why is it a cold observable?

43
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cuz the values
are the same on both next and complete.

44
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.560
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Well
the point is you're close,

45
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.540
we're never gonna miss the notification,
right?

46
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.640
No matter what happens, whenever we
subscribe, we're always gonna get

47
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.300
the notification cuz we're remembering,
restoring, that we've actually fired.

48
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.435
If I was to do something simple like this,
though.

49
00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.840
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Now we're not
a cold observable anymore, right?

50
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.190
Now we've got erase, unless we
subscribe before the timeout fires,

51
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.990
we're gonna miss it, and
now we're hot observable.

52
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.696
Does everybody understand the difference
between a cold and hot observable, right?

53
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.705
So the answer to, why would I
wanna create erase though, right?

54
00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:19.563
That's the question, right?

55
00:03:19.563 --> 00:03:22.730
I mean, why create a erase if you
don't have to create a erase?

56
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.758
So, that's why I probably wouldn't
view timeout as a hot observable.

57
00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:28.490
Make sense?

58
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.940
Now there might be some cases where
we do want a hot observable, and

59
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.270
we'll get into those later I think.
