00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.780
You talked about debugging observables,
but what about writing code to test them?

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.340
&gt;&gt; Testing them, yeah.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.312
Well, so I don't think testing an
observable is really any harder than any

4
00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:12.075
other asynchronous testing.

5
00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.716
Honestly, I think it's a little easier,
because observable outputs values,

6
00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.420
it's not just some callback
that does some stuff.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.250
So you can always test observables,

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.060
actually, if you wanna test observables
take a look at the RxJs unit test code.

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.271
Because in fact, it actually uses strings,
this convention of dot-dot-dot,

10
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.232
it actually uses dash-dash-dash.

11
00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:33.840
But it actually creates
a bunch of strings,

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.350
to represent observables, and
then a string to represent their output.

13
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.465
And that's how they unit
test their observables.

14
00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:42.072
So you can steal the same idea.

15
00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:45.156
I think it's exceptionally
easy to unit test and

16
00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:48.474
you got a framework like that,
but great question.

17
00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:49.412
All right, thanks a lot.

18
00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:50.421
This has been great.

19
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:57.061
