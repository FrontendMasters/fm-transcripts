00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.470
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Broken image.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.310
[LAUGH] Well, so that's an actual failure
case we have to deal with, right?

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.420
So we have to worry about broken images.

4
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.950
And one of the ways in which we can
do that is we can attempt to preload

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.740
the image before we display it.

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.590
Does that make sense?

7
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.370
Anybody out there know how to
preload images in the DOM?

8
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.416
You guys are front-end guys.

9
00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:19.002
Anybody?

10
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.240
&gt;&gt; Student1: Make an image
that is sourced to the thing,

11
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.920
and-
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Got you.

12
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.950
&gt;&gt; Student1: LoadEvent or an ErrorEvent.

13
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.800
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Somebody out there who
just doesn't go NPM install preloader

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.555
image, I like it.

15
00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:30.580
Old-school, very nice.

16
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.370
Yes, absolutely, that's the way in
which you can preload an image.

17
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.403
So we can create, and whenever you
wanna create a preloader image,

18
00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:45.110
you can go
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And

19
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.066
then go img.onload = function and

20
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.702
then img.onerror = function.

21
00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:56.280
Make sense?

22
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.650
So here we have a callback API.

23
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.790
How do we turn this into an observable?

24
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.490
Like how do I, I'm gonna express this
whole idea of preloading an image

25
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.820
as an observable, that I have either
fired that image or I guess doesn't.

26
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.940
In our case, we kinda wanna filter
out images that don't exist,

27
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.080
does that make sense?

28
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.280
We wanna filter them out, so how am
I gonna take, I have a source, right?

29
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.261
How do I remove it from the stream
unless it's successfully preloaded?

30
00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:31.570
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: It's a good
place to take a quick break.

31
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.000
I want you guys to think about that
a little bit, how would we take maybe

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.380
a function like this that does preloading,
and express that as an observable that

33
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.150
either fires on next or just on completes,
cuz the thing isn't an observable, right?

34
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.290
The thing isn't an image,
so we wanna filter over it.
