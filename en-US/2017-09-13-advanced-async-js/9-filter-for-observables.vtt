00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So we've written map,
I wanna do one more

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.480
function here just to drive home
building operators over observable.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.340
And then we're gonna move in some
problem solving with observable.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.170
My second favorite, maybe 3rd,
4th favorite after map is filter.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.581
Filter, can anybody help me write filter,
I'm actually just gonna copy and

6
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.503
paste map, because they're very,
very similar.

7
00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:34.518
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So let's say I want
to modify our program here, and

8
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:39.794
I'm only interested when
the offset x is larger than 10.

9
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.767
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Make sense?

10
00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.102
Questions?

11
00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.220
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So,
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's write our filter

12
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.740
function.

13
00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:55.615
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So
it starts out much the same way,

14
00:00:55.615 --> 00:01:00.119
in fact all of this is going to be the
same except what happens inside of next.

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.680
Anybody wanna help me out here,
how am I gonna implement filter?

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.961
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We can call the predicate
within an if statement and pass the value.

17
00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.028
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So, if and
only if my test function,

18
00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:22.831
my predicate succeeds on the value, will I
forward that value to next guy, all right?

19
00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:27.367
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And now we have filter.

20
00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:32.057
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So I'm gonna go ahead and
we're gonna run this, and

21
00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.488
then see what happen,
op, that didn't work.

22
00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:49.730
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Uh-oh, see what happens
when I'm near the top left of that button

23
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.140
and I'm clicking?

24
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.631
I'm within ten of the X and so
therefore it gets filtered out, but

25
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:59.185
as soon as I move out here,
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So

26
00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.840
we built a little rx, guys.

27
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.250
So hopefully now we have the solid
understanding of observable,

28
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.800
how it really works from the bottom up.

29
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm gonna keep this implementation around,
we might even come and

30
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.270
add to it later on as we instruct each
other on how these various operators work.

31
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.330
Thanks very much.

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.300
So that's the end of this section in
which we create a minimal observable.
