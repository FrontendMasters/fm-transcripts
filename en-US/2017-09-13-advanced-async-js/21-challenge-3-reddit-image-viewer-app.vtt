&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Next problem we're
gonna do is actually gonna be

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.710
a lot more practical.

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.934
We're gonna build out an app,
hopefully we have enough time today.

4
00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.922
It's gonna be a relatively simple app, but

5
00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.400
large size enough that we'll see
how powerful observables can be.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.680
And it's gonna be a Reddit image viewer.

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.264
Maybe some of you guys out there
have actually used it, but

8
00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.220
we'll sort of make an image viewer.

9
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.151
And actually before I break,

10
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:26.778
what I'll do is I'll put
the GitHub URL up on the screen,

11
00:00:26.778 --> 00:00:30.424
in case folks want to pull that repo.

12
00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:32.810
Cuz you're gonna be working
independently for most of this.

13
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.720
And then like we did previously with the
project, although I hope you guys actually

14
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
definitely work hard to try and make as
much progress on this one as you can.

15
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
And then we'll come back and
do it together.

16
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.130
So if you could kindly pull that repo and
give it a try, and

17
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.100
read through the exercise,
that'd be awesome.
