00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.625
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Let's
take a look at the exercise.

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.526
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Whoa.
What's going on there?

3
00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:16.320
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: All right.

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.970
So in here, we have TODOs in two files.

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.470
One is timestamp.elm.

6
00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.446
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: And it says,

7
00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:27.300
use the following function to
decode this time.pauseX value.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.140
And so it's a 1.2 time which takes
a string and a result time.pauseX.

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.620
I'm sorry turns the results.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.610
And if you are awake while
we're watching these slides.

11
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.030
This may be a familiar problem to solve,

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.360
because we just saw how to solve it,
using a good friend, decode.andthen.

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.140
So that's the first one,
is sort of recreating that here.

14
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.780
The other one in the readme
is sourceauthor.elm.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.990
And inside here, we have a TODO, Use this
profile and username to decode an author.

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.216
Hint, decoder help will help here, but

17
00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:03.102
slightly altering its type
may make things easier.
