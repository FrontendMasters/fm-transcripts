00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.815
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: That brings
us to the exercises for part 5.

2
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:15.230
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Okay, opening up the
readme, so we to-dos in Page.Profile and

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.254
Page.Home.

4
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.850
If you're remembering what we
just went through, there's

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.560
something that those have in common,
which is that they both have a feed.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.850
At the bottom of a feed is pagination, so
we talked about this in the intro course.

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.290
But we have not yet talked about
it at all in the advanced course.

8
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.470
Essentially the pagination goes with the
feed, and it's something that says when

9
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.469
you click on this particular page, I want
to load that part of the feed in there.

10
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.940
So here, we have an implementation of
pagination that is not being reused.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.714
We have duplicated code on both
the profile page and on the homepage.

12
00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:53.606
The same viewPagination function in both
places, and they're both using it in

13
00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:59.040
the same way, but sort of implementing
it in a bespoke way unnecessarily.

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.790
So the goal of this refactor is to go to
the profile page and the home page and

15
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.630
to extract this
viewPagination function out.

16
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.246
And also, you may notice that it depends
on a helper function called pageLink.

17
00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:12.922
And move that into
the PaginatedList module,

18
00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:16.764
which is a module built around
this PaginatedList type, which has

19
00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:21.519
this nice little slot at the end labeled
VIEW that currently has nothing under it.

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.190
So the goal is to relocate that to there,
and then refactor profile and home so

21
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.780
they're both reusing that same
logic from PaginatedList.
