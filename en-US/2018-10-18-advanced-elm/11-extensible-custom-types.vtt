00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: This is a sort of
a more concrete example of this obviously.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.650
Using it as a custom type we
can say type article extraInfo.

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.470
Usually, I'll call this

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.400
extraInfo because it's some extra
info that goes with the article.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.090
And it says article

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.420
which has some record about the metadata
that we know is always there.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.130
So, the title, the tags, and then in
the real version, there are several other

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.220
fields in there and then we have extra
info which is the second piece info that

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.670
goes with this variant and
we don't know what its type is.

10
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.650
So, in the case of a preview, it's gonna
be one thing and in the case of a body,

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.520
it's gonna be something else.

12
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.800
So here are the types that I've
defined for Preview and Full.

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.410
So Preview says type Preview = Preview and
essentially means there is no other info,

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.070
there is no extra info,
the extra info that is here is just empty.

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.320
And then we have type Full,

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.280
which has one variant which holds
onto the body of the article.

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.410
So the way this works out in practice is
we have for example, a decoder of article

18
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160
preview, which will decode into one
of these that has the metadata, and

19
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.390
then just this empty preview thing for
extra info.

20
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.510
Which is to say no other
interesting information, but

21
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.790
because I've named it preview,
this is more descriptive now.

22
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.550
It says that I'm decoding
a article that's a preview version

23
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.720
that doesn't have the full amount of info.

24
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.190
And the other one I have
Decoder (Article Full),

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.880
which both tells me that I have a full
article, including the body, and

26
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.260
also let's me extract that
once I have one of these.

27
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.760
So if I were to pattern match on this,

28
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.850
and I have a preview, there would
be no interesting stuff in here.

29
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.750
The pattern would match on Preview,
and I would say,

30
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.530
yeah, well there's no body inside
a preview, so can't do anything else.

31
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.740
But if I'm pattern matching on one of
these that is full, then I can say, I see

32
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.550
I have a body inside there, I can get
that, I can work with it, I can render it.

33
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.996
So on the page that renders the entire
article, we have a full which means we

34
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:46.472
have the body and
on the feed we only have the preview.

35
00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:49.867
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: We can still access,

36
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:52.795
we can write functions that let
people access these things.

37
00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.615
So I can say title which
takes an article a and

38
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.925
returns a string, which is to say any
article whether it's a preview article, or

39
00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.445
a full article,
I always have access to the title.

40
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:03.635
So this is a function that can
be used in either context,

41
00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.680
it can be used on the feed, or it can be
used on the view article page itself.

42
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.360
And then I can also do
the same thing with body.

43
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.010
But in the case of body,
I can only write this with this type.

44
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.670
I can only say I will give you a body
if you provide me with an article but

45
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.640
it has to be a full article.

46
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.620
I cannot give you a body if you
give me an article preview.

47
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.870
And also, I can't give you a body if give
me an article A with an unbound type

48
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.260
because I don't necessarily know
if I have a body to give you.

49
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.507
Only if you give me a full article
can I definitely give you a body.
