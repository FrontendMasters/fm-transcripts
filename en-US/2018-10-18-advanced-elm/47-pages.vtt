00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.270
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: So
that's the notion of a route,

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.520
and then separately we
have a notion of a page.

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.140
So when I say page,
I actually mean two different things, and

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.170
both of them have to do
with the page module.

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.120
So inside the page module,
we do have a completely exposed,

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.230
which is to say non-opaque, custom type.

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.640
And it looks like a little bit of
a shortened version of the route.

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.010
Notice that these things right here
don't necessarily have to do with URLs.

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.600
They have to do with displays.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.450
In other words, this is something that
we're going to display to the end user.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.180
What this type is used for is, oops,

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.180
is determining which if any of
these menu bar items to highlight.

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.766
So notice, I can tell I'm on the Settings
page in part because this thing right here

14
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.213
under Settings is highlighted.

15
00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:52.190
That's because the current page
is set to Settings right here.

16
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.990
If I had said move to Home,
it's going to be this,

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.570
which is how the nav bar knows
that Home should be highlighted.

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.068
Now the reason we need this in separate
module, is that each of these pages

19
00:01:05.068 --> 00:01:09.790
separately calls the view function
that renders this header bar up here.

20
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.140
So we need some shared notion
of what the other pages are, so

21
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.506
that each page doesn't have to go around
importing all the other pages to figure

22
00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:19.430
out wait, are we on this page, or
we are on that page, or we are etc.?

23
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.720
Instead, we just have this one single
source of truth for the different ones

24
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.900
that actually represent potential
highlighted things, followed by other

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160
in case you're on a page which doesn't
have any particular special highlighting.

26
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.560
So that's Page the custom type, but
that's not all that's in this module.

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.700
There's also view, and viewErrors.

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.122
Let's take a look at those.

29
00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:42.410
So viewErrors is actually
the simpler of the two.

30
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.020
Its job is to essentially just
to display a error message.

31
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.740
And this is something that is used
on pretty much all the pages,

32
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.710
because errors of all shapes and
sizes can happen, usually HTTP errors.

33
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.910
But any number of errors could happen.

34
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.415
And if that happens, we want to show
something interesting to the user,

35
00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.204
not just plain, old unstyled text.

36
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:04.824
So this is a helper that exists purely for
the purpose of rendering some text and

37
00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.534
also having a message for
how to dismiss that, in other words,

38
00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.570
to close the errors if you want to.

39
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.600
So all it does is it renders a div and

40
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.620
maps over the errors and
lists them all out.

41
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.363
So we use this in a bunch of different
places, okay, so that's one.

42
00:02:23.363 --> 00:02:25.350
The other one is view.

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.310
Now view is more complicated,
despite the fact that it is much shorter.

44
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.130
So what this is doing is it's
actually translating between

45
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.230
what the caller is going to give it,
which is to say maybe Viewer.

46
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.030
Actually, let me put
these on multiple lines.

47
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.750
So maybe Viewer, which is to say we may or
may not be logged in.

48
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.446
If we are logged in,
we want to take that user, and

49
00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:57.430
that's going to be used by this viewHeader
function that we're delegating to,

50
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.426
to either render this right here or not.

51
00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:03.358
Then we take the page, which is to say,
one of these things, and again,

52
00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:05.199
that's also going to
be used by viewHeader.

53
00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.870
And then we take the title and
the content of this thing.

54
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.440
So title is going to
go into document here,

55
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.840
which is what tells the single
page app what to render up here.

56
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.080
So we actually have
potentially different titles.

57
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.750
So when I switch to here,
the title changes to New Article,

58
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.640
when I'm on here it changes to Settings,
etc., that's what's set in here.

59
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.440
This is essentially,
I'm using this as named arguments,

60
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.630
not because I want to disambiguate between
those two, cuz they're different types,

61
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.430
so that's not really a concern.

62
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.630
But rather, because each of the pages I
already know is going to return something

63
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.780
that looks like this anyway.

64
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.993
So I'd just rather accept that as an
argument than ask them to sort of pull it

65
00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:45.940
out of the record that
they've already got.

66
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.781
Okay, and then the rest of the work
is done by viewHeader itself,

67
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:51.360
which renders all this stuff, and

68
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.550
including the logic for showing which
thing is highlighted, and which is not.

69
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.770
So essentially,
Page's job is to do three things.

70
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.510
One is to expose the notion of a page,
which is what you're potentially on.

71
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.040
And the other is to have common
helpers that pretty much all pages

72
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.030
are going to use.

73
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.480
The reuseable errors as
well as the Page.view,

74
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.240
which renders sort of the frame around
the page, the header, and the footer.
