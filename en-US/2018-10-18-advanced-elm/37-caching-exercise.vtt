00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.741
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Let’s move
onto the exercises for Part 6.

2
00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:10.395
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Okay,
inside our README,

3
00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:14.270
we have one page that we’re editing here.

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.017
It is the home page, once again.

5
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:20.903
All right, so this has to do with the very
first thing that we talked about there,

6
00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:23.552
the making impossible states
impossible situation.

7
00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:26.995
So this one is talking about how
we're going to render these tabs.

8
00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:30.194
So we want to change it so
that there is a single source of truth for

9
00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:31.278
which tab is active.

10
00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:34.165
I've copied out sort of a description
of the specification for

11
00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:36.736
how these tabs work in here so
there is a business logic.

12
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:40.568
If the user is logged in, you should
always render yourFeed as the first tab.

13
00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:44.778
So, for example, you might have
Your Feed followed by Global Feed or

14
00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:49.076
Your Feed followed by Global Feed
followed by the #dragons tag feed.

15
00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:52.559
If the user is not logged in,
do not render yourFeed at all.

16
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.032
So, for example, we would have just
Global Feed if we're visiting the page for

17
00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:00.646
the first time without logging in, or

18
00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:05.075
we might have Global Feed followed
by the tag's specific feed.

19
00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:09.514
If the active tab is a TagFeed,
render that tab last.

20
00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:12.723
Show the tag it contains
with a hashtag in front.

21
00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:16.620
So Global Feed #dragons, or
Your Feed, Global Feed, #dragons.

22
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.105
And finally,
if the active tab is not a TagFeed,

23
00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.573
then do not render a tag tab at all.

24
00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:26.412
So this would be Your Feed,
Global Feed, or just Global Feed.

25
00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:29.340
Okay so that's the business logic.

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.315
And essentially what we're going to do is,
we're going to re-factor this,

27
00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.340
such that it is actually using
that single source of truth.

28
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.028
We've already gone sort
of part of the way there,

29
00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:42.878
where we've already got the types
modeled out like we had on the slide.

30
00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:45.522
So YourFeed, GlobalFeed, and TagFeed.

31
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:50.126
And essentially all we have to do at this
point is implement that logic such that it

32
00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:52.777
ends up being this
effective source of truth.

33
00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:57.138
So this is a case where in order
to see it actually working,

34
00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:59.991
we're going to bring up the browser.

35
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.981
So if we look at how it looks right now,

36
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.541
we can see that we have no tabs,
whatsoever.

37
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.237
There should be some tabs up here but
currently there are not.

38
00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:13.430
When we're done successfully implementing
this, we should see two tabs here.

39
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.445
Sorry, first we should see only
one tab which is Global Feed.

40
00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:19.766
If we log in, we should see two
which is Your Feed and Global Feed.

41
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:23.772
And then we should be able to
click on some tags to see that

42
00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:26.091
the TagFeed has been selected.

43
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.719
Right now all we're getting is we're
actually seeing the tags doing

44
00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.688
the filtering, but we're not actually
seeing the corresponding tabs.
