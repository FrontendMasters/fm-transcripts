00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.546
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Let's
move on to the exercise.

2
00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:06.084
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: All right part4.

3
00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.183
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: All right so
about README and

4
00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.770
talks about TODOs in three files.

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.234
So we have three different files that are
each over overly broad, they're not narrow

6
00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:31.184
enough in terms of how they could be with
the types that they're working with.

7
00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:36.490
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: So
the first one is viewTabs.

8
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.910
Assistively it's only working with tabs
and yet it's taking the entire model which

9
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.020
means any time we're thinking about
making a change to the model we say yeah,

10
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.330
that change could potentially
impact viewTabs So

11
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.100
we're going to need to change it so
that it takes a narrower,

12
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.930
more specific type that gives
it sort of only what it needs.

13
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
On the settings page,
we have a similar situation.

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.520
This form again, is taking the entire
model, it does not need to be.

15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.480
And finally,
on the profile page In this case,

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.900
we have something that is
also sort of of the same,

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.770
it has the same problem where it's taking
the model and it doesn't need to be, but

18
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.380
it also has additional arguments that
give it something more specific.
