&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Here in our read-me,
we see,

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.630
and we're gonna open the source
route.elm and resolve the to-dos there.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.110
So this is going to be based on
the very first thing that we looked at,

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.660
which is to say mapping urls to routes.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.030
This is a very quick exercise, and

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.350
it's essentially just to get familiar with
this DSL for going from URLs to routes.

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.700
So we have a couple of these already
mapped out, to go from login and

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.580
logout in profile,
to the corresponding route.

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.840
And the goal is to sort
of finish the list off.

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
Is to handle these different scenarios for
settings, register, article,

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.655
which contains a slug, editor and
editor with a slug, and

12
00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:39.705
to map those to the corresponding route.

13
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:43.895
As a quick hint, article and edit article
work similarly to how a profile works.
