00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.827
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: So
we have a couple of different URLs here.

2
00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:04.850
We're going to map them to
various different routes.

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.570
First one is /settings.

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.980
Now, this is going to be one of those
hard-coded URLs, so not much to it.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.340
It's just gonna be s,
which is how we begin all of these.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.008
It's gonna be settings, and then we're
going to map that to Settings, the route.

7
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:23.650
Same thing with register,
same basic pattern here.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.500
Register and register the string.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.070
Article is going to be a little bit more
complicated because it's got the slug

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.290
associated with it.

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.000
So that one's going to be map to Article,
and then we have article followed by

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.298
the slug and instead of username.URL
parser, we're gonna have slug.url.parser.

13
00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:48.970
That's essentially article.slug, and
that follows sort of the same pattern of

14
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.565
exposing only the decoder and
a URL parser, and

15
00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:57.190
not the direct way to instantiate
this type so that it stays opaque.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.450
So that's the slug for the article.

17
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.223
Then we have the editor.

18
00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:07.527
I'm gonna try to remember is it,
right, so there's new article and

19
00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:09.885
edit article is the name of those.

20
00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:14.080
And I guess it's actually yeah, okay.

21
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.297
So for the one where we have no argument
here, we're gonna call that new article.

22
00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:28.310
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: And so that's gonna be
slash editor with no further arguments.

23
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.266
And finally, we're gonna have,
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: EditArticle,

24
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:39.734
which is actually going to have
editor followed by a slug.

25
00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:45.490
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Okay,
let's see how that looks.

26
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.490
Great!

27
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.620
Fantastic!

28
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.650
One more thing to note
as with all parsers,

29
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.860
if you ever have a parser
that covers the one below it.

30
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.020
Bad news,
it's never gonna hit the one below it.

31
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.007
So you have to be careful with things like
this, where if you have two of these in

32
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.555
a row, it's a little bit of danger
here with editor and editor/slug.

33
00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:10.650
That if we had these in the wrong order,
then maybe the top one might say

34
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.095
I always match first if it's got
a slash followed by nothing and

35
00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:16.650
then I could potentially mess this up.

36
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.720
Now in this particular case, we're good.

37
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.250
But it's worth noting that is something
that can't happen whenever you're

38
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.240
using oneOf.

39
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.460
The order definitely matters.

40
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.866
It's going to try them in this order.

41
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:28.785
Also that's an opportunity for
an extreme micro-optimization that's

42
00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:32.385
almost certainly never going to make
a difference in practice and performance.

43
00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:36.295
But theoretically, you might wanna put
the most common ones at the top just so

44
00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.365
it has to traverse
through less of the list.

45
00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:39.685
But again, really,

46
00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:42.515
really unlikely to make any kind of
performance difference in practice.

47
00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.645
Not something I would necessarily worry
about unless you really want to and

48
00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:47.275
you're sure it's gonna
solve a real problem.
