WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:02.836
So let's start the problem.

2
00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.696
So what's the problem?

3
00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:09.570
So if you're here, this is
an advanced web performance workshop,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.802
you already know some things.

5
00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:16.673
For example, you already know
that your users are actually sad.

6
00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:21.513
So you already know that you're losing
money, maybe not you, maybe the company

7
00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:25.803
you're working for or the customer
that you're making websites for.

8
00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:28.529
Someone is losing money.

9
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.330
Why?

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.241
Because the web is slow.

11
00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.569
What you're doing is slow.

12
00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:39.352
I'm sorry to be hard on this, but you're
making slow websites, that's the average.

13
00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:41.815
Don't feel so bad yet about that.

14
00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:45.570
So the web is slow, and
that has been proven.

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.360
I'm not going to take too
much time on that today, but

16
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.228
it has been proven that that
leads to less conversion.

17
00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:56.135
Whatever conversion means for your
website, it can be less users registering

18
00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:00.220
to the side, user buying less user,
playing with your content,

19
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.300
reading content, watching ads wherever,
wherever conversion means for you.

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.071
We have less of that,
if your website is slow, okay?

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.635
So and also it's mostly front end
responsibility that some people,

22
00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:19.280
when you're getting into web
development sometimes you feel that web

23
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.968
performance is not about the front end.

24
00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:27.219
Sometimes you feel it's above
the database, the cloud, the server.

25
00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.079
Of course, you might have server issues
because that's also possible, but

26
00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.182
that's not typically the case.

27
00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:37.693
When we have performance
problems in our websites,

28
00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:41.778
it's typically because of bad
front end decisions, okay?

29
00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:46.071
And that's I mean, in this,
let's talk about a discipline.

30
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:50.012
So web performance is a discipline
where performance optimization.

31
00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:54.214
That hasn't been in the web
development area for

32
00:01:54.214 --> 00:02:00.773
probably 15 years before HTML5,
let's say take one moment in history,

33
00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:06.205
when we were talking about performance,
it was about Apache,

34
00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:11.350
and how to make faster queries in MySQL or
things like that.

35
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.390
We're talking about the backend,

36
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.140
we go with thought that performance
had to do with server issues.

37
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.651
And sometimes that was a problem, but
it wasn't the biggest problem, okay?

38
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.239
And we will see why in a minute.

39
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.852
So and I know that you're
already doing a couple of stuff,

40
00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:30.077
that's why you're here, right?

41
00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:33.784
So for example, you're already
optimizing the network transfer.

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.825
If you know what that is,
we will see in a minute.

43
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:44.780
You're already working with TLS and
HTTP/2, at least TLS is HTTPS.

44
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.982
So you have like a secure origin, okay?

45
00:02:51.982 --> 00:02:54.701
We will get deeper on each
of these topics, okay?

46
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:58.134
So you have time to ask questions anyway.

47
00:02:58.134 --> 00:03:00.896
You're already using CSS as an appetizer.

48
00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:06.277
So appetizers should be first and
typically small.

49
00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:07.706
It's not the main meal, okay?

50
00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:14.486
So CSS should be first and small, and
we'll understand why in a minute.

51
00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:17.149
JavaScript is dessert.

52
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:21.780
So typically,
it should go after the main meal, and

53
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.689
also it typically also small
compared with the main meal, right?

54
00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.426
So I'm you're really optimizing images,

55
00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:35.870
like using the right format
with the right size, and

56
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.812
going through different compression tools.

57
00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:44.013
You're already defining a policy for
HTTP cache.

58
00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:46.947
I mean, that's because again,
you're in an advanced course, right?

59
00:03:46.947 --> 00:03:48.521
You're doing this, right?

60
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.431
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're already using

61
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:58.258
service workers,
because that's kind of a base today for

62
00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:02.207
websites that wanna run really,
really fast.

63
00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:04.266
You're doing all of this, right?

64
00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:07.239
Because I'm watching you.

65
00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.369
So if we are all doing this stuff
that that's kind of a standard,

66
00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:16.370
let's say checklist for
Web performance today.

67
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.600
What's the problem?

68
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.167
So where are we here?

69
00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:22.933
Why are we still talking
about web performance?

70
00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:26.440
So this data is actually really updated.

71
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.729
It's from yesterday.

72
00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.202
So today, the medium on mobile devices for

73
00:04:31.202 --> 00:04:36.219
time to interactive,
there is a metric that measures at which

74
00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.963
point in the loading process
the website actually works.

75
00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:44.728
So, I'm simplifying this,
but that means that,

76
00:04:44.728 --> 00:04:47.629
the website is ready for interaction.

77
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.099
Maybe you have seen this in action when
you're trying to use a website, and

78
00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.744
it doesn't scroll, you click,
and it doesn't click,

79
00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:55.690
that's because it's not interactive.

80
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.284
Well, the median,
on mobile devices, yesterday,

81
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:06.831
was 12.5 seconds to get into having
a website completely interactive.

82
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.829
I know that some people
here in the room or

83
00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:14.335
watching this video might be thinking,
that's fast.

84
00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:20.297
I don't know, because we don't know
what we believe is actually fast.

85
00:05:20.297 --> 00:05:26.088
So to prove if this is fast or
not, let's see in a timer,

86
00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:31.652
let's feel the pain of
12.5 seconds of silence.

87
00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:44.480
You feel it, right?

88
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.714
So, that's 12.5 seconds, and
that's actually the median on how much

89
00:05:49.714 --> 00:05:54.804
time it takes to get a website interactive
on a mobile device on real user.

90
00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.860
This is a real user metric.

91
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.823
So, this is measured on real devices,
on real network,

92
00:05:59.823 --> 00:06:01.875
with real users, with real websites.

93
00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:03.311
It's not in the lab.

94
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:10.115
So we have a problem because
that's a lot of time, okay?

95
00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:15.005
Also, the average time to load
the mobile landing page disease

96
00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:19.435
is actually from exactly
before the COVID pandemic, but

97
00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:23.419
it's not better now,
it's 22 seconds, okay?

98
00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:30.198
So on the mobile landing page most of
the time or sometimes comes from an app.

99
00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:35.104
So you have a company that is paying for
an ad and then for

100
00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:39.917
22 seconds no one is like
seeing the whole content.

101
00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:44.031
Of course, I'm not yet
explaining what's load,

102
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.622
because it's a technical concept,
loading a page, but

103
00:06:48.622 --> 00:06:52.939
we're not exactly sure what load means for
the user.

104
00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.853
We will talk about metrics
in a couple of minutes.

105
00:06:56.853 --> 00:07:00.440
There are a lot of
researches on this thing.

106
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.623
And for example, there is a nice
research that was done by Shopify

107
00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:10.147
thing where they did a research
with real people on tables

108
00:07:10.147 --> 00:07:14.859
like browsing websites, and
they realize that for users,

109
00:07:14.859 --> 00:07:19.974
they feel like the website is
loaded when the images are loaded.

110
00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:23.554
When all the images appears on the screen,

111
00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:27.838
users typically feel that okay,
now we can use it.

112
00:07:27.838 --> 00:07:31.181
So as web developers probably
we know that that's not real.

113
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:35.884
Actually you can start using the websites
before the machines are ready, but

114
00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:37.412
that's not important.

115
00:07:37.412 --> 00:07:42.049
What matters is what the users
are actually feeling, okay?

116
00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:47.455
So the same Google research says
that as page load time goes from

117
00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:53.881
1 second to 10 seconds, the probability
of a mobile visitor to bounce,

118
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:58.577
so to get out of that website,
increases by 123%.

119
00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:03.337
And again, think about that,
when we're talking about landing pages,

120
00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:08.480
that's your moment of truth, that's
the moment where you need to get that user

121
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.343
because the user is there, you already
paid the cost to get the user there.

122
00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:15.506
The cost can be real money on an ad.

123
00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:21.030
The cost can be a mental cost to actually
the user goes into typing your URL or

124
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.023
clicking on a link, so there was a cost.

125
00:08:24.023 --> 00:08:29.958
And then the user is getting there and is
going away because your website is slow.

126
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.962
There was also, it was like three or

127
00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:38.571
four years ago thought that there
was a nice research on ads on TV for

128
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:44.705
different like sport events like
really large sport events worldwide.

129
00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:52.328
It can be the FIFA World Cup or some other
events on each country that are important.

130
00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:57.365
So they analyze the URLs that were on ads,
and they realized that

131
00:08:57.365 --> 00:09:03.734
they were wasting money, because a lot
of those URLs were actually really slow.

132
00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:07.260
So users were actually
maybe getting into the URL,

133
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.379
and they were bouncing immediately, okay?

134
00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:11.910
So that's a waste of money.
