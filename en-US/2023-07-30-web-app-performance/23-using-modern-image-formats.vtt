WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.862
So now, let's say that the LCP is
already there as soon as possible.

2
00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:08.524
We have already hacked a little bit our
code to make our Largest Contentful

3
00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:10.414
content as soon as possible.

4
00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.442
What about the rest of the content?

5
00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:19.039
Well, first, we should use modern
image formats, not just PNG or JPEG.

6
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.570
SVG can be one, but
also we have WebP, AVIF or

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.822
A-V-I-F, Guetzli JPEG, Zopfli PNG.

8
00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.814
Okay, let's go one by one.

9
00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:35.234
WebP, it's called WebP.

10
00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:39.242
It's currently available in every browser,
including Safari, okay?

11
00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:44.196
And it's much better than JPEG and
PNG, it can replace both.

12
00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.904
It was created by Google,
it's open source.

13
00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:52.870
AVIF, it's like WebP 2.0 kind of.

14
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.398
And today,
it's only available on Chrome and Safari,

15
00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:04.407
but only on the Mac, not on iOS,
there is a mix there, okay?

16
00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:08.943
So Guetzli JPEG, by the way,
Guetzli, Zopfli, Brotli,

17
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:15.313
all these are German names used by Google
to define these compression algorithms.

18
00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:20.238
That's why it's so complicated if
you are not a German speaker, okay,

19
00:01:20.238 --> 00:01:21.622
Guetzli, Zopfli.

20
00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:25.374
Guetzli JPEG,
it's a new compression algorithm for

21
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:28.634
JPEG files that is using
the same JPEG format.

22
00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:32.128
That means that it can be rendered on IE6.

23
00:01:32.128 --> 00:01:35.218
It's not a special format
that is on a special browser,

24
00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:37.803
it's just a different
way to encode the file.

25
00:01:37.803 --> 00:01:40.730
And something similar
happens with Zopfli PNG.

26
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.742
It can compress normal standard PNG
that works everywhere even more.

27
00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:51.183
But AVIF and WebP are completely
different formats, different containers,

28
00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:54.622
so you need a browser compatible
with those formats, okay?

29
00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:58.772
How to deal with these image formats.

30
00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:04.301
By the way, before doing that,
if you're doing GIFs or

31
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:08.772
GIFs, it's a very bad
idea on your website,

32
00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:12.906
because that format come from 1989.

33
00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:16.374
It's actually really, really bad for
performance, it's not optimized.

34
00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:19.474
You can use animated PNGs,
animated WebPs, but

35
00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:24.550
the compatibility is kind of weird, and
it's much better to use in mute video.

36
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.261
You can do an MP4 mute,

37
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:32.004
there is a Boolean attribute mute that
works everywhere and it's much better.

38
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:39.146
There are many tools to work with images,
but I encourage you to try Squoosh.

39
00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:43.427
Squoosh is a progressive web
app created by the Chrome team.

40
00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:48.110
It's open source, and
it lets you convert images.

41
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.446
You can do it manually, like what I'm
doing right now or I will do right now.

42
00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:56.614
By the way, it's 100% PWA client-side.

43
00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.740
I can install it and use it as a Mac
application or a Windows application.

44
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.721
It is a PWA, and it's 100% client-side,
which means that your images are not

45
00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:10.866
being sent to the server, everything is
converted client-side with web assembly.

46
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.102
So I can drag and drop one image.

47
00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:20.104
For example, I can take my LCP image, that
is the one that I wanna compress first,

48
00:03:20.104 --> 00:03:25.091
and I'm going to take ancient-greece and
paste it here.

49
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:25.937
No, it doesn't work.

50
00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:29.709
Okay, let's try again.

51
00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.797
Let's look for the file.

52
00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:37.416
It's in public&gt; in gallery &gt;
ancient-greece, there we are.

53
00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:41.702
And here we can see the difference
when we are changing formats.

54
00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:46.222
So this is if you want JPEG,

55
00:03:46.222 --> 00:03:50.162
AVIF, okay, or WebP.

56
00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:53.500
So here, you can see the original and
how the new one looks like.

57
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.483
If you don't like it, well, you play with
the quality, or if you want lostless,

58
00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:04.857
you don't lose any, any details.

59
00:04:04.857 --> 00:04:08.536
And here,
you can see how much space you will save.

60
00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:13.596
So the same file, in this case,
I'm not even losing quality,

61
00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:17.230
and it's saving already 40% of the size.

62
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.891
So then you save it, and
I'm going to save this on

63
00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:26.891
the same file, public &gt; images,
but no, images,

64
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:31.230
no, in gallery &gt; ancient-greece.webp.

65
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.797
The problem is,
what should we do with the WebP?

66
00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:37.326
Should I change this to WebP?

67
00:04:37.326 --> 00:04:44.728
I can, but what if we still have some
users browsing with an old browser?

68
00:04:44.728 --> 00:04:47.283
Well, instead of doing this,

69
00:04:47.283 --> 00:04:51.730
what I can do is I can keep
my PNG there and use picture.

70
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.133
Have you used picture before for
responsive images?

71
00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.894
With picture, you need to put the IMG,

72
00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:03.839
and what you are going to set its
alternative sources for that picture.

73
00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.722
And I can set one for the type.

74
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.159
So if it support image/webp,

75
00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.516
I'm going to set the source as
gallery/ancient-greece.webp.

76
00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:17.276
And I can have also the AVIF version,
and many versions, and

77
00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:22.469
even when using media queries, one version
for mobile, one version for desktop.

78
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.314
And when doing this,
the browser will pick the right one.

79
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.734
Does it makes sense?

80
00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:36.968
And also,
I should add the fetchpriority as high.

81
00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:44.344
Fetchpriority there,
because it's our LCP image, right?

82
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.160
We want high priority.

83
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.755
But now, if the browser is WebP
compatible, it's going to take that one.

84
00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:53.690
That is 40% smaller, so
it will appear faster.

85
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.610
We are saving milliseconds, remember,
we wanna save milliseconds.

86
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.622
Does it make sense?

87
00:06:03.622 --> 00:06:10.085
Squoosh, remember, it's a free app, you
can use it as squoosh.app, squoosh.app.

88
00:06:10.085 --> 00:06:13.235
But also it has a version that is a CLI.

89
00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:17.166
If you search for
a squoosh cli, it's on NPM.

90
00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:23.830
You can request conversions
directly from the command line.

91
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.146
So you can even make a little
script that will do that for

92
00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:36.678
you in every image, converting into WebP,
resize it in different formats.

93
00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:42.486
So you have a nice tool, also open source,
to help with batch conversion.

94
00:06:44.282 --> 00:06:45.782
Does it make sense?

95
00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:49.842
Yep, so you can see that we are applying
a lot of techniques at the same time,

96
00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:54.030
but each technique is saving a little
bit more, a little more, a little more,

97
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.450
a little more,
until we get into our budget.
