WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.291
And I know that some people will say hey,
my website is fast because

2
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:09.938
we don't have a clear definition
on what's fast, okay?

3
00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.743
So how fast is fast, so
we had to define performance budget.

4
00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:19.476
And web vitals already set some
performance budget then you can

5
00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:20.640
follow or not.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.538
And you can define your own budget.

7
00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:25.725
I won't talk about budget a lot, okay?

8
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:26.676
You will see why.

9
00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:31.560
These are the current budgets for
the three core web vitals defined.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.675
If you are under green, you are good.

11
00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:37.704
If you are under yellow,
needs improvement.

12
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.399
If you are over the yellow,
you are pretty bad.

13
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.307
That's kind of the idea.

14
00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:47.247
So LCP, Largest Contentful Paint
should that pair in

15
00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:52.077
the page within 2.5 seconds for
at least 75% of

16
00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:57.259
your users in the real world,
that's kind of the idea.

17
00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:01.471
Not for everyone because you don't
know if the user is in 2g in

18
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.098
the middle of the apps.

19
00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:06.796
And yeah, well,
you can't do anything about that, so

20
00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:09.718
that's why it's for 75% of your users.

21
00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:13.742
And you can gather that
with real user metrics,

22
00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:17.969
you have to render
the Largest Contentful Paint,

23
00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.706
the image the title within 2.5 seconds.

24
00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:26.702
First input delay 100 milliseconds.

25
00:01:26.702 --> 00:01:29.262
So it's a metric, you get a metric and

26
00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:34.395
will tell you if you are within that
threshold, so within the budget or not.

27
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:36.892
And CLS content layout shift.

28
00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:39.791
That's a value that you don't
understand the value by itself.

29
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:43.084
But if it's 0.1, it means you're good.

30
00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:47.795
So you are not shifting
content while the page loads.

31
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.546
So we will start with this budget.

32
00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:55.722
And then when you know what you're doing,
when you know better your goals,

33
00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:57.823
you can create your own goals, okay?

34
00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:05.038
But these are the goals that the community
is trying to follow today, okay?

35
00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:12.364
So Chrome has something known as Chrome UX
that will actually tell you based on URL,

36
00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:18.448
they don't have the whole Internet,
but they have a lot of website.

37
00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:21.387
You can try your website and
see if it's there.

38
00:02:21.387 --> 00:02:27.234
It's a UX report, so that will give you
all the information for your website.

39
00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:28.940
Let's see this in action.

40
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.803
So if you search for Chrome UX report,

41
00:02:32.803 --> 00:02:38.488
you have all the explanation
about how it works, okay?

42
00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:42.875
And there is an API that you
can query about this, and

43
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:48.880
there are some tools available that
will let you search that database.

44
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.685
This is like a big data where you can
play with information about page load,

45
00:02:55.685 --> 00:03:00.454
information about metrics for
the whole Internet.

46
00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:05.883
So you can research on,
it can be travel websites,

47
00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:12.090
airlines, how airlines
are doing with page load, okay?

48
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.400
So, you can research using BigQuery,
for example, over this.

49
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.877
And there are some tools that
will let you see this in action.

50
00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:23.263
For example, one is PageSpeed Insights.

51
00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:29.579
PageSpeed Insights,
the URL is pagespeed.web.dev.

52
00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.381
Will let you type a URL,
I know this is my prefer website.

53
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.589
Analyze that.

54
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:40.408
You will create an analysis
of that URL but

55
00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:43.855
is not making a lab analysis.

56
00:03:43.855 --> 00:03:48.223
It's what your real users
are experiencing on Chrome.

57
00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:52.872
So this is data from Chrome users
browsing that website, okay?

58
00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:56.115
So I'm passing Core Web Vitals,
fortunately.

59
00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:58.555
And this is giving me, for example,

60
00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:02.274
the largest contentful paint is 1.7 for
my website.

61
00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.309
So it's under 2.5.

62
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.804
Then CLS is under 0.1.

63
00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:08.845
So it's pretty good.

64
00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:12.265
Time to First Byte is
actually pretty good as well.

65
00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:15.632
First Contentful Paint, interactions
you can explain we don't have data yet.

66
00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:18.696
This is the experimental one,
and that's a mobile,

67
00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:20.681
I can also see the same on desktop.

68
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:27.085
And you can see that most of the metrics
are always better on desktop.

69
00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:29.714
Unless you have a completely
different website,

70
00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:33.968
like you have a mobile website and a
desktop website, if it's the same website,

71
00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:36.673
typically you will get
better results on desktop.

72
00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:41.268
And that's because again,
more cellular networks, different CPUs.

73
00:04:41.268 --> 00:04:48.015
And also, I have some improvement
accessibility it seems like.

74
00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:49.385
We have that change in this.

75
00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:50.872
This is Lighthouse.

76
00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:52.449
Have you ever tried Lighthouse?

77
00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.962
No, okay.

78
00:04:54.962 --> 00:05:02.140
So Lighthouse is a tool that was
created by the Google Chrome team.

79
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.565
Originally it was a plugin and
then it was a CLI so

80
00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:11.001
something from the terminal,
now it's both.

81
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:14.128
It's an open source tool
created by the Chrome team.

82
00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:16.221
The idea was to create a lighthouse.

83
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:20.752
The lighthouse will point us into
the right direction about performance.

84
00:05:20.752 --> 00:05:21.579
That was the original idea.

85
00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:24.248
So actually,
it was originally for PWAs for

86
00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:27.652
progressive web apps to give
us in the right direction.

87
00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:29.435
But now it's also for performance.

88
00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:33.179
So it's a tool that you have for
example, if I load my website,

89
00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:35.239
I can also load Frontend Masters.

90
00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:39.903
If you go inspect,
if you open DevTools on Chrome,

91
00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:45.331
you have a whole category,
a tab with the name Lighthouse.

92
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:46.498
That's Lighthouse, okay?

93
00:05:46.498 --> 00:05:50.054
That's Lighthouse integrated
in Google Chrome.

94
00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:54.551
But Lighthouse is also integrated with
a lot of other performance tools,

95
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:56.371
such as PageSpeed Insights.

96
00:05:56.371 --> 00:06:01.158
That is just a cloud-based analysis tool

97
00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:05.544
where you can create here, a report.

98
00:06:05.544 --> 00:06:09.796
In this case it's going to
create a performance report and

99
00:06:09.796 --> 00:06:13.628
we will see that in action
today on different modes.

100
00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:19.298
I will explain these modes in a minute,
but navigation is the default

101
00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:24.674
mode that will analyze the page load,
it will refresh the page and

102
00:06:24.674 --> 00:06:29.404
it will give me an answer,
in terms of how good or bad I am.

103
00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:35.956
And you can see that right now it's giving
me 82 not 90 something that was here,

104
00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:40.915
here was 98, because it's
using my computer, my network,

105
00:06:40.915 --> 00:06:43.081
my plugins, it's a love.

106
00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:48.286
So maybe if I do another one,
it'll give me another result, okay?

107
00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:51.392
So that's why this is a love analysis, and

108
00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:55.965
PageSpeed Insights is taking
data from that Chrome UX report,

109
00:06:55.965 --> 00:07:00.732
from that Chrome UX Big Database,
that is not my computer today.

110
00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:05.262
If it's real users browsing that website,
okay?

111
00:07:05.262 --> 00:07:06.967
That's the difference.

112
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:12.003
Well, anyway,
these numbers are coming from these

113
00:07:12.003 --> 00:07:17.736
two lighthouse that some
developers are using as a metric.

114
00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:23.057
So it's common to see on Twitter,
hey, my website is 99 on Lighthouse.

115
00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:29.050
So they're using that performance
number as a metric, okay?

116
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.026
And that can lead to some problems.

117
00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:38.261
For example, that's not a metric,
actually, it's a score that the tool

118
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:43.427
is giving us, it's leading us into
the right direction, which is okay.

119
00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:46.145
But you shouldn't take that as
the most important metric for

120
00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:49.667
you, because if not, you're optimizing for
the metric and not for the user.

121
00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:52.749
You're optimizing for the score.

122
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:58.796
&gt;&gt; On that note [INAUDIBLE] Chat was
saying he's been to some websites and

123
00:07:58.796 --> 00:08:04.017
web apps that don't have a good score,
but they feel fast.

124
00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.892
&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's the point.

125
00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:11.063
So the score,
it can give you a bad score in any way,

126
00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:15.756
because it's an automatic
tool that is giving

127
00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:19.628
you a score based on a list of options.

128
00:08:19.628 --> 00:08:23.006
And each option has a different
weight over the score.

129
00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:24.662
And you can create your own score,
actually.

130
00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:29.216
The problem with the score is that there
are a lot of developers just optimizing

131
00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:33.092
for the score, and
they're not understanding web performance.

132
00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:36.878
They'll say, I have 99 there,
I'm good and maybe you're bad.

133
00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:39.503
Or the other way around,
as someone was saying on the chat.

134
00:08:39.503 --> 00:08:44.429
Maybe you have a bad score,
but you feel it's pretty fast.

135
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:47.670
So maybe the score is not so important.

136
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.724
So have that score there.

137
00:08:50.724 --> 00:08:56.003
It's okay to get it, but
it's better to understand the vitals

138
00:08:56.003 --> 00:09:00.494
behind that and
understand what's going on, okay?

139
00:09:00.494 --> 00:09:02.250
So have that in mind.

140
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:08.513
So, PageSpeed Insights again,
pagespeed.web.dev is

141
00:09:08.513 --> 00:09:14.516
a free tool that will give you
the chrome UX report data,

142
00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:18.880
that again, it's not just a love test.

143
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.828
It's actually testing with real users
on real networks which is actually

144
00:09:23.828 --> 00:09:28.311
pretty good, to get like a better
idea of what's going on, okay?

145
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:31.296
For example this is my speed index.

146
00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:35.882
Again it's been just 0.8
seconds is it good or bad?

147
00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:36.879
Well it is green right?

148
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:41.304
So we know it's good but
I don't know what that means in terms of,

149
00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:44.933
remember the speed index is
the area above the curve.

150
00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:48.547
So, the 8, 0.8, and this is good or bad?

151
00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:52.670
But actually, if it's below 2.5 seconds,
typically it's good.

152
00:09:52.670 --> 00:10:00.708
So, that's the amount of blank that the
user has seen over the page load process.

153
00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:07.606
Here, there are a couple of opportunities
to improve and we will see this later.

154
00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:12.490
Anyway, remember you have mobile,
you have desktop, and

155
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.779
you can see that on mobile you will
find more users under the red.

156
00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:22.149
This is the percentage of
users that were over the red.

157
00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:26.113
You can see it's typically
higher on mobile, why?

158
00:10:26.113 --> 00:10:27.817
Cellular networks.

159
00:10:27.817 --> 00:10:29.491
That's the latency.

160
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:34.699
On desktop, you don't have such,
I mean, you might feel latency

161
00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:40.754
problems on desktop on your Wi Fi if you
have a problem but it's not so common.

162
00:10:40.754 --> 00:10:42.580
You will probably see that there.

163
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.378
And you can try here any website.

164
00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:47.466
Fortunately, this is free,
PageSpeed Insights,

165
00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:51.955
because if you wanna use directly
the Chrome UX data, you wanna query that,

166
00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:54.846
it's open, but
you need to pay for the queries.

167
00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:59.523
So it's BigQuery, you have like a free but
then you have to pay for

168
00:10:59.523 --> 00:11:04.137
that in case you want to make queries,
even if it's on your own website.

169
00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:08.440
And today, some of that information,
not all of the information, but

170
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.397
some of that information also
appears under Google Webmasters.

171
00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:16.427
That's the place where you,
as the content owner of a website,

172
00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:20.244
you can see information about
how Google sees your website.

173
00:11:20.244 --> 00:11:26.059
For SEO, well, now, you have
a performance section there as well.

174
00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:29.139
But as a summary on PageSpeed Insights,

175
00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:34.121
you can see Chrome UX reports on
your own URLs, if it's a new URL,

176
00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:38.396
or if it's not indexed in Google,
you won't see that.

177
00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:41.360
And you will need to get
lab data in the meantime
