00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.148
Do you remember that I mentioned that
web performance is a frontend thing,

2
00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:07.720
not typical your backend thing.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.302
Well, now that we know what a waterfall
chart is and how it looks like,

4
00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:12.780
we can actually prove that.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.063
So if you look at that chart, that's
a simple waterfall chart, and I ask you,

6
00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:21.910
but anyway,
it can be more complex as well.

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.189
Now it's just so simple, and if I ask you,
where is the backend time there?

8
00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:30.170
How can you respond to that?

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.752
Where is the backend time?

10
00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:32.303
Yeah.

11
00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:37.680
&gt;&gt; Would it be that period of time from
when the HTML request started to, it ends?

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.640
&gt;&gt; So it's first,
you mentioned the HTML, so

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.700
the HTML in here is that one only, right?

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.720
So it started and end.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.990
So yeah, that's correct.

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.600
In fact, it's even less than that.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.720
And I will show you why.

18
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.710
So the backend time is just that 5%,
even less than that.

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.434
All the rest and
how the browser is loading resources,

20
00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:06.597
they may be also contacting the backend,
but it's not your Node.js,

21
00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:11.560
your Next.js code,
your PHP code, if you want.

22
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.256
That code is just that small portion,
okay?

23
00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:19.161
And our metrics, the metrics that matters,

24
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:25.336
such as first-contentful-paint,
typically they are around here.

25
00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:26.800
So, we have a problem.

26
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.410
The server is just that
part that you see there.

27
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.549
Not even the blue part,
because the blue part in this chart,

28
00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.580
I mean, I'm talking about the blue,
where is it, here.

29
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.640
That blue bar,
that's downloading the file.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.670
That will change based on the bandwidth.

31
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.740
The server responsibility, just that part.

32
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.150
All the rest has to do with how
we define things in our HTML.

33
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.770
So it's frontend responsibility.

34
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.840
Makes sense?

35
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.923
And from the top 100,000 sites, only,

36
00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:12.210
let's say 16% of the time is
because of the backend, okay?

37
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.430
Optimizing the backend has less impact and
it's not a simple or cheap task.

38
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.210
I mean,
you wanna optimize your server time.

39
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.520
You wanna cut 10% of the time.

40
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.460
Sometimes it's about buying some, or
putting some more infrastructure or

41
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.078
cloud infrastructure,
pay for some cash, or

42
00:02:34.078 --> 00:02:39.650
adding another layer of something,
right, it's expensive.

43
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.575
And think about that,
if you can cut 10% of the backend time,

44
00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:50.770
how much impact do you have
in first content load?

45
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.867
Then when we go back here,
how much impact you will have,

46
00:02:56.867 --> 00:03:00.564
if you just change this by 10%?

47
00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:02.720
It's not going to change a lot.

48
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.745
Yeah, everything will move a little
bit that way, but just a little.

49
00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.240
But optimizing the frontend
has high impact.

50
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.115
You make a change in the HTML and

51
00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:23.250
automatically you can see
higher impact on every metric.

52
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.650
And it's cheap,
it's just changing the HTML.

53
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.034
Not on everything that we will see,
but it's typically cheap.

54
00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:32.990
Do we have a question on the chat?

55
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.625
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just to comment that
there is no API calls here, but

56
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:43.558
sometimes when you are doing web apps and
you have to make a lot of API calls,

57
00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:46.820
and those API calls can be-
&gt;&gt; Those API calls, yeah.

58
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.140
&gt;&gt; Could be slow.

59
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.465
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, but, in fact,

60
00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:55.310
it will be the case in the project
that I have that we will test.

61
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.710
For now,
we are focusing on the first load.

62
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.159
If your first load, the first
page load needs content from APIs

63
00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.445
to render the initial page,
you might have a problem.

64
00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:10.519
But yeah, that's true.

65
00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.311
That's why I said it's not like
the backend is dead after the first

66
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.990
initial HTML.

67
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.025
But typically,
it's not the biggest problem.

68
00:04:21.025 --> 00:04:27.031
If you need to call APIs to
render your landing page,

69
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:30.586
you have a different problem.

70
00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:35.440
And again, I'm looking at you and
watching at you React developers, okay?

71
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.080
So that's a problem.

72
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.779
That's a problem for performance.

73
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.540
And maybe you say, and
there are always excuses.

74
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.700
No, because my team is blah, blah.

75
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.743
It's better to do this and this way.

76
00:04:47.743 --> 00:04:52.877
In my experience doing consulting for
big companies or large companies,

77
00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:57.014
the answer is actually,
you know what, the CEO realized,

78
00:04:57.014 --> 00:05:02.740
someone told the CEO that they're losing
money because of web performance.

79
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.990
So then the order goes back to the CTO, we
need to do web performance no matter what.

80
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.527
No, but infrastructure said that it's
better to do client side, [SOUND].

81
00:05:12.527 --> 00:05:13.749
No, it doesn't matter.

82
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.350
Because we are losing money.

83
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.170
It's about money, okay?

84
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.803
At one point, you need to go over this.
