WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.993
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Another problem,
and we are still talking about problems,

2
00:00:03.993 --> 00:00:09.379
not solutions, another problem is how we
typically underestimate the mobile space.

3
00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.149
And that's not new, we have been
underestimating the mobile space for

4
00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:19.716
a while, I know that because I've been
focusing on the mobile web since 2003,

5
00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:22.040
2004, so before the iPhone.

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.857
At first, I'm not sure if you remember
this, but at first, we were creating

7
00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:34.220
mobile sites like m.cnn.com, so
we were making a separate website.

8
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.370
Then at one point, the iPhone appeared and
we say, we don't need to do anything.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.755
So then we were just doing
desktop websites and then,

10
00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:45.143
we'll let the user zoom in and
out over the website and

11
00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:49.448
then we realize now that's not
good that's not a good experience.

12
00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:54.760
So then we move into responsive design,
but we didn't think about performance.

13
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.029
And I'm not sure if you know this,
but if you have three media queries,

14
00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:04.750
three different CSS files for, let's say,
simplifying, dekstop, tablets and phones.

15
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.640
You have three CSS files.

16
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.170
Every device will load the three CSS
files, even if the media query is false.

17
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.140
So every device by default
is loading all the files.

18
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.541
And we were thinking about that, so

19
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:23.663
then users on slow 3G networks at
the time, we're downloading CSS file for

20
00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:28.790
desktop and CSS file for
tablets that was completely useless.

21
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.312
So, and now we are underestimating
mobile in many different way.

22
00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:38.755
We can say today safely that
the mobile space is iOS and Android.

23
00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:43.643
We might have some small sparks of some
other things for some special markets,

24
00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:47.935
but most of the time, it's iOS and
Android, which is okay.

25
00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:50.415
But what about browsers?

26
00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:52.675
Are we talking about Safari and Chrome?

27
00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:56.880
Is that in house, so
if I try on my on my Mac on Safari and

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.720
Chrome on a small window
with an simulator.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.050
Is that good enough to say that it
works properly on mobile devices?

30
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.470
So, what are the browsers that
are actually having some market share?

31
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.592
So, let's go and
see some information really in action.

32
00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:20.130
So, there are a couple of websites
that you can use to get information

33
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.832
about the current scope of the browser
market share, but one is gs.statcounter.

34
00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.908
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's global
stats from a start counter, where actually

35
00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:37.435
you can see, this is the browser
market share worldwide on April 2023.

36
00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:44.765
63 is Chrome, then we have Safari, Edge,
Firefox, Samsung Internet browser.

37
00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.193
Have you ever tried your website on
a Samsung Internet browser just see how it

38
00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.672
looks like, how it works,
what's the performance?

39
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:55.391
And that's desktop plus mobile.

40
00:02:55.391 --> 00:03:00.920
But I can go and edit this chart and
select only mobile.

41
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.610
Even I can unclick tablets as well, so

42
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.190
focusing only on the problem
of mobile devices, okay?

43
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.926
I can also select by region, so you can
see how this is different on different

44
00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:16.263
regions of the world,
even countries, view chart.

45
00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:20.550
And now we will see that
we have users on Opera.

46
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.910
We have users on UC Browser.

47
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.363
Have you ever tried UC Browser?

48
00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:30.443
And by the way, UC Browser is
taking a lot of users worldwide

49
00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:34.922
because of some regions such as Asia,
here is 3%.

50
00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:36.349
Also in the U.S., so

51
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.775
UC Browser is a Chinese browser that
is also available in other countries.

52
00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:44.023
India, have you tried?

53
00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.427
Probably not.

54
00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:51.525
Yeah, of course that Chrome and
Safari are important,

55
00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:59.127
but you still have 4% of user 3, 2,
1 on other browsers, that we don't care.

56
00:03:59.127 --> 00:04:01.830
But you say, well, but that's like ie.

57
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.967
Well, if you're paying for
ads, you will have then 20%

58
00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:12.003
of those users accessing your
website on those browsers,

59
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.205
so it's not 002% of your users.

60
00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:20.969
Is it still 20%, 15% of your mobile users?

61
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.881
So, we should get the right information,

62
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.330
also there are other
sources of information.

63
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.700
Cloudflare has just released
also a Cloudflare Radar.

64
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.008
I don't remember the URL, but
we can Google that, Cloudflare Radar.

65
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:43.730
Radar.cloudflare.com, where you
can see current traffic trends.

66
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.168
You can search for,
I think that in adoption and usage,

67
00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:51.200
we have top browsers and user agents.

68
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.280
So yeah, you can see it's Chrome,
Safari, and Edge, but

69
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.362
you can filter these also by region.

70
00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:59.877
You can say, let's say, India.

71
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.475
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: You can
see that now it's 90% Chrome,

72
00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:10.011
3% Safari, 1% Firefox, and
you can change that, of course,

73
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:12.619
this is the traffic from Cloudflare.

74
00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:17.625
Every information here is like
a subset of the whole Internet,

75
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:20.370
but it will give us an idea, okay?

76
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.357
There is another thing that is
important that sometimes, these charts,

77
00:05:26.357 --> 00:05:29.170
these stats, are not actually showing us.

78
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.400
These little guys here,
Facebook, Instagram,

79
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.700
can also be TikTok, but
it depends on the OS.

80
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.406
What is the problem with Facebook or
Instagram?

81
00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:44.280
I'm not sure if you are users
of those meta apps.

82
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.990
What happens when you click
on a link on those apps?

83
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do they have
their own dedicated browser?

84
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.954
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah,
they have their own browser.

85
00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:56.864
And they don't appear on those
stats as a separate browser.

86
00:05:56.864 --> 00:06:00.966
In fact, meta has just created a name for
it, it's a Facebook mobile browser,

87
00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.019
even on Instagram.

88
00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:03.542
That's the name they have.

89
00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:10.100
They're not registered to
the OS as a browser actually.

90
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.170
But they have their own inner browser.

91
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.736
And when you are browsing a website,
or web app,

92
00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:21.186
on those social networks,
you are using a different engine that is

93
00:06:21.186 --> 00:06:24.540
not the same engine as
the browser on that device.

94
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.200
So have you ever tried your website there?

95
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.660
The performance, the abilities,
is everything working properly?

96
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.722
So, today, around 7% of global
smartphone traffic come

97
00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:42.990
from the Facebook or Instagram app.

98
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.191
This is coming from a mobile report,

99
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:48.820
there is an updated version
as well of that report.

100
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.800
They create a report every three months,
I think.

101
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.400
It's mobile report from ScientiaMobile.

102
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.110
So it's a lot, okay?

103
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.320
That 7% is coming from social networks.

104
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.590
And it's in the other
stats that we saw before.

105
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.458
They are actually under Safari or Chrome
because those systems they don't recognize

106
00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:13.410
or they don't separate the real
browser from inner browsers.

107
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.534
But the inner browser has
different capabilities.

108
00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:20.290
And they can be slower on the same device.

109
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.687
Also, when we are browsing
the web with mobile devices,

110
00:07:25.687 --> 00:07:28.060
we are using cellular networks.

111
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.672
And I know that some of you are thinking,
it depends on where you live,

112
00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:37.840
we have 5G now, so we don't need to
worry about performance anymore.

113
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.260
Well, let's see.

114
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.409
First, let's talk about real data,
about real users.

115
00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:49.888
Today, so here we have in black,
this is coming from the GSM Association.

116
00:07:49.888 --> 00:07:54.074
This is where all the carriers on
the world are actually grouped.

117
00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:59.606
We have in black, the actual
data from December last year and

118
00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:03.297
in red, the idea for the future, okay?

119
00:08:03.297 --> 00:08:07.325
But we're not there yet, so
we will focus on the black part.

120
00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:14.794
In terms of 4G,
60% of connections worldwide are 4G.

121
00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:19.178
Only 12% are currently 5G, okay?

122
00:08:19.178 --> 00:08:22.807
So we still have 30,

123
00:08:22.807 --> 00:08:27.971
around 30 on other networks.

124
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:31.647
And this refers per region, we are not
going to see all the regions here.

125
00:08:31.647 --> 00:08:36.394
I don't wanna bore you with this,
but let's focus here on 2022.

126
00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:43.723
You will see that, for example,
Asia Pacific, we still have 15% on 2G.

127
00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:47.948
I'm not sure if you have ever
browsed the web with 2G, have you?

128
00:08:47.948 --> 00:08:52.913
No, lucky you.

129
00:08:52.913 --> 00:08:55.376
But it's not just 2G, we have 3G,

130
00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:59.205
but this is real users today,
not 15 years ago, okay?

131
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.921
Today, that they might be customers
of your web app or website.

132
00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:04.958
I don't know,
it depends on what are you doing.

133
00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.803
But if it's a global app, a global
website, you might have customers there.

134
00:09:09.803 --> 00:09:15.674
So CIS, that is kind of the Soviet Union,
okay, in terms of the region.

135
00:09:15.674 --> 00:09:17.072
It doesn't matter, but
that's the region, okay?

136
00:09:17.072 --> 00:09:20.814
So it's a lot of ex-Soviet countries.

137
00:09:20.814 --> 00:09:25.692
So you also have a problem there, because
you can see that almost 5G doesn't exist.

138
00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:31.867
So we don't have 5G, it's 4G and
3G mainly and also 2G.

139
00:09:31.867 --> 00:09:33.293
Latin America, I'm from Argentina.

140
00:09:33.293 --> 00:09:39.147
So this is Latin America,
we have a lot of 4G, we don't have yet 5G.

141
00:09:39.147 --> 00:09:43.189
Yeah, we still have some users on 2G.

142
00:09:43.189 --> 00:09:46.358
Of course, that depends on the country.

143
00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:49.260
Yeah, North America without Mexico.

144
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.784
They didn't include Mexico here because,
yeah, it's Canada and US basically,

145
00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:55.346
almost you don't have 2G.

146
00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:58.497
In fact in some areas,
it's completely disabled at this point.

147
00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:02.491
And yeah, you have a lot of 5G, okay, 40%.

148
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:07.219
But it's just here,
it is not the rest of the world.

149
00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:11.727
But even with that in mind,
because maybe you're saying,

150
00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:15.964
well, you know what,
my solution is for US customers,

151
00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:20.306
so I'm focusing on that,
maybe that's a possibility.

152
00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:25.317
But when we are talking about 2G,
3G, 4G, 5G, within the generations

153
00:10:25.317 --> 00:10:29.640
of network connections,
most of the time we think of bandwidth.

154
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.275
Yeah, that the bandwidth is better,
but it's true.

155
00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:39.070
But when we are browsing the web,
is the bandwidth really important?

156
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:45.013
So forget about the mobile world,
think about your home connection.

157
00:10:45.013 --> 00:10:49.428
Let's say you have 200 megabits per
second, you have a connection, 200.

158
00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:55.294
And then you go to 400, you pay more to
your Verizon or wherever plan you have,

159
00:10:55.294 --> 00:10:59.806
you double the speed,
are you going to browse the web faster?

160
00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:04.427
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I don't think so.

161
00:11:04.427 --> 00:11:06.985
Maybe you will see Netflix better,

162
00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:11.844
you will have more connections of
Netflix in 4G, Netflix at home,

163
00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:16.379
but browsing the web is not going
to be really, really faster.

164
00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:22.196
Because the problem is not the bandwidth,
the problem is the latency.

165
00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:25.770
And that's the time delay between
when a data packet is sent and

166
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.745
when it's received,
expressed in milliseconds.

167
00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:33.031
In short words,
it's the time that it takes for

168
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:38.293
the data to get off your device and
get back to your device.

169
00:11:38.293 --> 00:11:43.629
So from, in this case your,
let's say your phone.to the web server and

170
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:46.352
back, that's the latency, okay?

171
00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:47.942
If you're working with gaming,

172
00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:51.704
you probably know that better because
latency on gaming is really important.

173
00:11:51.704 --> 00:11:56.196
But you will see on browsing
the web latency is also important,

174
00:11:56.196 --> 00:12:01.561
because latency is actually something
that will be there on every packet.

175
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:06.967
So every packet that you send, well, I'm
browsing the web, I'm not sending data.

176
00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:10.023
Well, actually,
when you're browsing the web,

177
00:12:10.023 --> 00:12:14.153
it's the browser making HTTP requests,
and that's sending data.

178
00:12:14.153 --> 00:12:19.537
So every HTTP request to get
the response will have a latency.

179
00:12:19.537 --> 00:12:25.776
And that's currently the latencies,
in average, on 2G to 5G.

180
00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:28.494
You have in there at the green area.

181
00:12:28.494 --> 00:12:30.689
It's a range, so min and max.

182
00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:33.013
On 2G, it's pretty bad.

183
00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:37.238
So that's why I said lucky you if you
didn't have experience browsing the web

184
00:12:37.238 --> 00:12:37.830
with 2G.

185
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:43.159
So in this case,
when you are connected in 2G,

186
00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:47.024
the latency can be between roughly

187
00:12:47.024 --> 00:12:51.969
a quarter of a second and
a second and a half.

188
00:12:51.969 --> 00:12:55.901
So that means you request, one image and

189
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:59.833
the first byte comes after one second for

190
00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:03.894
every HTTP request that you have, okay?

191
00:13:03.894 --> 00:13:06.238
3G is better, you can see it's better.

192
00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:11.103
And of course, 4G and 5G are increasing or
decreasing the latency,

193
00:13:11.103 --> 00:13:13.174
increasing the experience.

194
00:13:13.174 --> 00:13:16.410
So yeah, it's better to have 4G and 5G.

195
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.503
So you can see that, yeah, we saw that
there are still some users on 2G.

196
00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:27.558
But even if we forget about those, and
even if we are lucky enough to say,

197
00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:33.137
you know what, my users are not
even on 3G, for whatever reason.

198
00:13:33.137 --> 00:13:38.070
When we get deeper in just 4G and
5G that we know is

199
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.538
not all the users,
this is how it looks like.

200
00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:48.289
And the last one, it's a DSL home
connection that you might have.

201
00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:53.284
You can see that even 5G is
worse than a connection that

202
00:13:53.284 --> 00:13:56.334
has to do with the medium, okay?

203
00:13:56.334 --> 00:13:58.525
It's not the same to be wireless.

204
00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:03.107
Also on 5G, yesterday,
I've got some information from

205
00:14:03.107 --> 00:14:06.941
a friend that is working
at a Canadian company and

206
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:11.259
he's working on that part,
on connections, on 5G.

207
00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:16.492
So I asked him the real latency of 5G,
because when you search for

208
00:14:16.492 --> 00:14:21.839
the latency of 5G,
you typically get theoretical information.

209
00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:25.102
Yeah, it can be one second,
one millisecond, sorry, not second,

210
00:14:25.102 --> 00:14:26.014
one millisecond.

211
00:14:26.014 --> 00:14:30.518
Yeah, but
that's if the antenna is there, okay?

212
00:14:30.518 --> 00:14:31.618
It's not the real world.

213
00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:36.407
Well, in the real world,
he said that today in North America, so

214
00:14:36.407 --> 00:14:41.285
not in every country, in North America,
today is around 50, so

215
00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:43.918
the average is 50 milliseconds.

216
00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:50.979
So compared with DSL that you can get 10,
12, 15, it's still high.

217
00:14:50.979 --> 00:14:56.180
Yeah, much better than 3G,
I agree, but it's still a problem.

218
00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.702
And remember, this latency goes on every
request that your website is doing

219
00:15:01.702 --> 00:15:07.328
to the server because it's an upload,
okay, and then you get the response.

220
00:15:07.328 --> 00:15:12.535
So Verizon on their website,
they say the latency hardly impacts

221
00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:17.566
smartphone user experience in
advanced 5G and 4G networks.

222
00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:19.481
That's a statement from their website.

223
00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:23.280
The problem is that, first,
that's not completely true.

224
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.640
But anyway,
not every country has advanced 4G and 5G.

225
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.770
They might have 4G and
5G, but not advanced.

226
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:36.044
And we still have 30% of users on 3G or
worse.

227
00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:40.456
So it's not like we shouldn't care
about performance on mobile devices,

228
00:15:40.456 --> 00:15:42.216
it's still a problem today.

229
00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:45.617
So we still have a performance
issue with the mobile web.

230
00:15:45.617 --> 00:15:49.441
And that's why we care about this, okay?

231
00:15:49.441 --> 00:15:51.397
But networks is not the only thing.

232
00:15:51.397 --> 00:15:55.621
We also have CPU and GPU problems.

233
00:15:55.621 --> 00:16:00.153
I mean, not a problem, situations
that That happens in the real world.

234
00:16:00.153 --> 00:16:03.554
Maybe you're thinking but
my iPhone is actually pretty fast.

235
00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:08.278
So I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 that has
a very good GPU from Qualcomm, blah,

236
00:16:08.278 --> 00:16:11.345
blah, blah, blah,
it compares with my laptop.

237
00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:13.553
But that's not the real world.

238
00:16:13.553 --> 00:16:15.618
We are not the real world.

239
00:16:15.618 --> 00:16:20.393
That's again, that's from yesterday
as well, with real users,

240
00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:23.994
and it's the median on
JavaScript boot up time, so

241
00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:28.214
how much time it takes to
actually run JavaScript briefly.

242
00:16:28.214 --> 00:16:33.200
But the important part here is
the comparison between desktop and

243
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.474
mobile, okay?

244
00:16:34.474 --> 00:16:38.353
And you can see that mobile is much worse.

245
00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:43.761
Again, probably not for
the phone that you have in your pocket,

246
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:45.976
but that's not our user.

247
00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:48.289
We are not our users, okay?

248
00:16:48.289 --> 00:16:49.695
So on mobile we have,

249
00:16:49.695 --> 00:16:53.923
first that we are typically
underestimating how it looks like.

250
00:16:53.923 --> 00:16:57.228
We don't try and
test on every browser out there.

251
00:16:57.228 --> 00:16:59.776
Then we have a latency on cellular

252
00:16:59.776 --> 00:17:03.423
networks that sometimes
we forget about that.

253
00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:09.192
And then we just test our mobile website,
and even we test the performance

254
00:17:09.192 --> 00:17:14.417
of our mobile website in desktop
Chrome with just a narrow window.

255
00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:19.568
And yeah, that's not the case because
we are probably on Wi-Fi, but

256
00:17:19.568 --> 00:17:24.472
that has a DSL or another connection
that has a different latency.

257
00:17:24.472 --> 00:17:32.024
And then we have CPU and
GPU difference on real devices out there.

258
00:17:32.024 --> 00:17:39.991
So that's why we get into this
12.5 seconds that we've failed.

259
00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:44.377
It's painful, okay, and
we need to solve that.

260
00:17:44.377 --> 00:17:46.651
That's why we're still talking
about web performance.

261
00:17:46.651 --> 00:17:51.657
It's been a while since, I mean,
the community started talking

262
00:17:51.657 --> 00:17:56.400
about web performance, and
we still need to push it further.

263
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:03.733
Because when you compare that on desktop,
the same metric, you will see it's half.

264
00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:06.718
So on desktop, I mean,
the problem is still there.

265
00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:10.129
We will see if six seconds is okay or not.

266
00:18:10.129 --> 00:18:15.305
But on desktop, without changing
the websites, it's better, why?

267
00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:20.223
Because network is different, the latency
of the network is different, and

268
00:18:20.223 --> 00:18:22.953
also CPU and
GPU is different or is better.

269
00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:29.633
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So, other places
where you can see that difference.

270
00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:33.980
There is another metric that
we will cover in a minute.

271
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.020
It's called first contentful paint.

272
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.286
And you can see that the median is
different on desktop and mobile.

273
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:43.106
So mobile is slower by default, so

274
00:18:43.106 --> 00:18:47.694
all the metrics by default
are worse on mobile devices.

275
00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:52.359
And by the way,
mobile users are typically more than 50%

276
00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:55.260
of the use of browsing the web today.

277
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.575
It depends on the website,
but it's typically over 50%.

278
00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:05.316
So we should care more about that
because it's more than 50% and

279
00:19:05.316 --> 00:19:11.581
also are the ones that need more help
from us to make a better experience.

280
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:14.266
Speed index is also better on desktop, and

281
00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:18.751
probably you know what a speed index is,
so we will get into that later.

282
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:22.457
And we have a question.

283
00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:23.897
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Based on HTTP/2 and

284
00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:29.337
having the possibility to have multiple
requests without blocking each other,

285
00:19:29.337 --> 00:19:34.547
is it still important to think about
limiting these due to latency problems?

286
00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:36.997
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
the latency on HTTP/2 or 3, or

287
00:19:36.997 --> 00:19:40.441
even if there is a 4 tomorrow,
is it still there?

288
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:42.770
So the latency is not changing that.

289
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.577
We will see that with HTTP/2, and that
ability that maybe not everyone knows at

290
00:19:47.577 --> 00:19:52.382
this point what that means, will change
how we think about some tips and tricks,

291
00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:54.587
but it's not changing the latency.

292
00:19:54.587 --> 00:19:59.254
So over HTTP/2, even if we are sharing the
same TCP connection, every time we send

293
00:19:59.254 --> 00:20:03.615
a packet, a TCP packet, from the browser
to the server, we have the latency.

294
00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:09.798
So HTTP/2 is not improving or
changing the latency issue.

295
00:20:09.798 --> 00:20:10.934
The latency is still there.

296
00:20:10.934 --> 00:20:16.258
It's going to improve other
situations such as how many requests

297
00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:20.999
you can start at the same time and
releasing some client and

298
00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:27.031
server resources, but it's not
actually affecting the latency issue.
