WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.690
So welcome to Advanced Web Performance.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.290
We are going to cover a lot of stuff.

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.262
So I hope you're ready for,
hope that your brain is empty right now so

4
00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:15.730
you can get a lot of information
about how to make the web faster.

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.410
My name is Maximiliano.

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.470
I can go by Max.

7
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.050
I know it's a long name.

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.050
I'm Firt on social networks.

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.770
I'm a mobile web developer.

10
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.770
So I have been doing web development
since 95 and mobile apps as well.

11
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.869
And in terms of web
performance in particular,

12
00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.598
I've been working with web performance for
13 years.

13
00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.491
So I have started doing web performance,

14
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.454
specifically targeting mobile
devices back in 2009, 2010,

15
00:00:43.454 --> 00:00:48.100
and then focused on more general
web performance as well.

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.430
I have authored a couple of books.

17
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.840
Some of those books
are on web performance.

18
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.009
And also I have published many workshops
on different topics around mobile

19
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:04.040
development, app development, mobile
app development and web performance.

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.912
I'm from Argentina.

21
00:01:05.912 --> 00:01:11.273
I'm currently living in Buenos Aires,
okay, so that's far away for most of you.

22
00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:13.112
I don't know where you are, but

23
00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:16.820
typically Argentina is far
from all the other countries.

24
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.300
Anyway, I said firt.dev is my website,
@firt my Twitter account.

25
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.310
Regarding specifically talking about web
performance, these are the latest two

26
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.440
books that I authored on the topic,
High Performance Mobile Web and

27
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.080
Hacking Web Performance,
that by the way, a gift for you.

28
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.553
You will get a copy of the second one,
that's actually the last one,

29
00:01:39.553 --> 00:01:42.110
Hacking Web Performance later in PDF.

30
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.083
So we will go over also the stuff
that is actually on that book.

31
00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:53.754
So, prerequisites,
you can go and clone that repo,

32
00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:58.921
github.com/firtman, that's my last name,

33
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.700
/adv from advanced, -webperf.

34
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.520
There you will find just a simple
website that we will use later,

35
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.050
to actually see in action, part of the things
that we will cover about web performance.

36
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.630
You have a copy of the slides in
case you want to follow along.

37
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.361
And also you have a copy of that
book that I promised, okay, that for

38
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:21.480
future reference.

39
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.880
We are not going to go
over the book today.

40
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.010
So I have basically two goals today, okay?

41
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.197
The first one is to teach you
some new tricks that you didn't

42
00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:36.980
know about web performance,
that's my first goal.

43
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.218
And the second goal, and probably
the most important one, is I want to make

44
00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:47.600
you feel bad about what you are doing and
what you have been doing so far.

45
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.410
Okay, so remember that go.

46
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.040
So we are going to cover
a couple of things.

47
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.192
We're going to start with the problem,
so why web performance is important.

48
00:02:58.192 --> 00:03:02.710
Metrics, so how metrics work,
where are the metrics available today,

49
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.569
how to measure performance?

50
00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.610
The tools available, some of the tools,

51
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.721
there are many tools
that we will focus on.

52
00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:14.040
The tools that we have available in the
browser, open source tools, free tools.

53
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.070
There are also more tools
that are more commercial.

54
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.886
Charts and diagrams, then we will get into
understanding browsers because we will

55
00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:24.110
get advanced in this course.

56
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.575
That means that we need to understand
how browsers work to actually

57
00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:32.171
understand why I will go
into apply some techniques.

58
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.355
We are going to over,
even if this is an advanced training,

59
00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:42.314
we will go over the basic ideas anyway,
the basic optimizations and why, to start.

60
00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:46.477
And then we will push this further,
I'm talking about performance,

61
00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.110
we will push this further.

62
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.360
We'll, some kind of hacking tips.

63
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.290
We're going to see how to hack
performance with a lot of ideas.

64
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.017
And then at the end, we will cover
a couple of performance APIs,

65
00:03:58.017 --> 00:03:59.543
probably not all of them.

66
00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:01.708
But I will give you a quick overview, and

67
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:06.150
then you will have all the information
to get deeper on other APIs as well.

68
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.665
When we are talking about APIs,
I'm talking mostly about front-end APIs or

69
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:12.220
JavaScript APIs.

70
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.205
There are some exceptions there that
are also working with your back-end,

71
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.768
but most of the time
it's about the front-end.
