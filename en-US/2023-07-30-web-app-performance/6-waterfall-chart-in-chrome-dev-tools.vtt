WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.471
Now we've seen the metrics, so we know
the metrics that we need to improve, and

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.762
the balance sheets that we have, okay?

3
00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:11.123
Now let's talk a little bit
about tools and charts.

4
00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:14.582
Most of the time they're
going to work with, so

5
00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:19.259
our most important tool for
web performance will be that chart.

6
00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.979
That chart is a wonderful chart.

7
00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:27.976
That chart will show you,
In y-axis from top to down,

8
00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:33.224
resources in the order
that they were downloaded,

9
00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:40.319
and the x-axis time, from 0,
that's from the navigation start.

10
00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.348
So typically,

11
00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:46.743
page loads can also be over page loads in
case you have a client side application.

12
00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:49.518
So each row is a different resource.

13
00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:51.784
What's a resource, a file?

14
00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:57.317
An HTML file, a CSS file,
can also be a WebSocket request.

15
00:00:57.317 --> 00:01:00.064
It's a request, okay?

16
00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:03.692
We will use this chart a lot.

17
00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:10.404
These charts, typically they have on each
bar, you will see a bar different colors.

18
00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.119
Unfortunately, we don't have
any standard for colors.

19
00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.925
So each tool will give you
a different color for the same thing.

20
00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:21.546
Each bar so for
example here we see green then orange,

21
00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:26.476
then violet, then another light green,
and then blue,

22
00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:33.069
are showing me in the time, different
parts of the loading process, okay?

23
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.295
We'll get into the details on that.

24
00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.510
For example, I'm requesting a page.

25
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.545
The first step is the request, so
I'm waiting for the server to respond,

26
00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.078
then the server responds, and
then I'm downloading the file.

27
00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:45.768
Makes sense?

28
00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:50.262
I'm downloading the bytes over
the bandwidth, and when I have the file,

29
00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:51.796
I need to parse the file.

30
00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:58.348
Well, each step will be
a different color in the bar.

31
00:01:58.348 --> 00:02:02.876
So you can recognize what's going on,
and typically,

32
00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:06.260
waterfall charts, they look like this.

33
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.581
They are much more complex than
the simple one that you saw there.

34
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.801
Now, we have two per URL, one for

35
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:17.636
the first view, and
another one for repeat view.

36
00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:21.263
Because it's the first time
you're accessing that website,

37
00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:25.723
you have never seen that website before
on the browser, that's first view.

38
00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:28.353
You have a completely clear cache.

39
00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:34.261
Your computer doesn't know the IP address
of the server, then we have repeat view.

40
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:37.076
In that case, you're coming back.

41
00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:41.602
It can be one minute later,
a week later, and

42
00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:49.243
the repeat view might take advantage
of some things such as caching, okay?

43
00:02:49.243 --> 00:02:51.053
Makes sense?

44
00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:56.573
So, different tools, as I mentioned, will
give you the same information differently.

45
00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:01.829
And also you will find sometimes that
there are some vertical bars or lines.

46
00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.888
Can you see those here?

47
00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:05.171
Here?

48
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:08.586
Those are milestones over the timeline.

49
00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:13.994
Typically, the milestone from
the metrics that we saw,

50
00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:20.651
such as time to first byte,
first paint, largest contentful paint.

51
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:26.064
So you will see those vertical
bars happening there.

52
00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:29.048
So then you understand what's going on,
okay?

53
00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:32.812
It makes sense we will see this
in action now with our project.

54
00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:37.421
Anyway, another tool that it's actually

55
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:42.678
pretty cool to see is
called the filmstrip view.

56
00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:47.768
In this case,
the filmstrip view is, At least

57
00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:52.460
offer screenshots that
you can see in an array,

58
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.812
is an array of screenshots
taken over time.

59
00:03:56.812 --> 00:04:01.510
This is actually pretty good to actually
feel the pain of your websites and

60
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.074
actually how you can convince your
managers that your website is slow.

61
00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:10.433
Because I'm pretty sure that some of you
might go to your manager and say, hey,

62
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.750
our websites are slow.

63
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.954
It's taking 12 seconds to load.

64
00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:17.624
And for your manager, 12 seconds it's
actually pretty good, pretty fast.

65
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.357
12 seconds is nothing, okay?

66
00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:25.111
Well, the way to say that
once you prove that that's

67
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:29.016
a lot is to show the filmstrip view, okay?

68
00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:31.946
So I'm going to get out of here, and

69
00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:36.946
let's try to see the tools that
we have to see this in action.

70
00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:39.976
Well first, if I'm in Chrome,

71
00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:44.820
let me start closing some
tabs that I'm not using.

72
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.097
We can go to frontendmasters.com,
I can open dev tools,

73
00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:54.727
and now we can go to Lighthouse,
that's okay, but

74
00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:58.944
also there is a performance
tab there as well.

75
00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:04.297
In the performance tab,
you can start recording something.

76
00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:06.893
You can record the session.

77
00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:08.844
You can enable web vitals.

78
00:05:08.844 --> 00:05:13.187
So you can actually see those metrics,
the web vitals metrics,

79
00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:15.610
the most important metrics there.

80
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.303
You can throttle the CPU, what is that?

81
00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:25.286
It will try to throttle to slow down
your CPU to simulate a work device.

82
00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:28.529
I have an M1 Max here.

83
00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.931
Yeah, maybe that's not
the CPU that everyone has.

84
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:39.109
So you can try to slow it down, and
I can also throttle the network.

85
00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:44.684
I can simulate the Fast 3G, or
I can add here a custom profile.

86
00:05:44.684 --> 00:05:49.655
I can say could Fast 5g,
you said, download the upload and

87
00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:54.628
the latency, and he will simulate
that latency as well as it

88
00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:58.617
makes sense, so
you can throttle the network.

89
00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:02.678
This is not a real user metric,
but you can simulate one.

90
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.608
Okay, make sense?

91
00:06:05.608 --> 00:06:11.872
So, and then when you hit record,
and then you can refresh the page.

92
00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:16.427
It was pretty fast anyway.

93
00:06:16.427 --> 00:06:19.611
[LAUGH] So then when you say stop and

94
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:24.850
here you will see the timeline and
what was happening.

95
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.850
The performance tab that we
have here is not just for

96
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.766
network requests,
it will show you everything.

97
00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:37.072
It will show you also, for
example, rendering process.

98
00:06:37.072 --> 00:06:40.173
So what was going on in the CPU.

99
00:06:40.173 --> 00:06:43.132
So, you can go over here and

100
00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:48.803
see how can you see that thing,
that's a Leo shift.

101
00:06:48.803 --> 00:06:53.137
If it's bad or not,
it depends on the CLS body that you get,

102
00:06:53.137 --> 00:06:56.799
maybe it's not really bad and
it's pretty good.

103
00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:58.285
So this is one tool.

104
00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.637
There are many tools available, actually.

105
00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:06.403
Another tool that we have is another tab,
the network tab.

106
00:07:06.403 --> 00:07:11.092
This network tab is available
on Firefox and Safari as well.

107
00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:16.597
I'm using Chrome because it's the browser
with more tools for web performance.

108
00:07:16.597 --> 00:07:19.336
Compared with Safari and Firefox,

109
00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:24.368
it's far beyond the other browsers
in terms of tools available.

110
00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:29.360
So, If I refresh the page,
what you see here,

111
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.461
it's actually the waterfall chart.

112
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:39.344
You are seeing it differently, but
it's a waterfall chart anyway,

113
00:07:39.344 --> 00:07:42.393
and let me open this in a new window.

114
00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:46.690
Maybe I'm going to decrease the font size

115
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.245
a little bit to see the better,
where is it?

116
00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:53.630
Here.

117
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.300
Let me refresh.

118
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.347
There we are.

119
00:07:57.347 --> 00:08:01.891
Let me change a little bit.

120
00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:05.043
You can see you can reorder.

121
00:08:05.043 --> 00:08:10.897
The network tab, I need to make
the waterfall column larger.

122
00:08:10.897 --> 00:08:17.058
So what you see here, let me refresh
again, is a waterfall chart.

123
00:08:17.058 --> 00:08:23.362
By the way, if the website is still making
requests as it is, is changing on the fly.

124
00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:30.556
So maybe what you want is refresh,
and then pause here, the recording.

125
00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:32.756
So now it's not going to change.

126
00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:34.641
It's an a static analysis tool.

127
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.203
So this is a wonderful chart.

128
00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:42.879
You can see, Each request over time, okay?

129
00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.731
Over time with an each
bar has different colors.

130
00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:48.716
We have a green, we have a blue.

131
00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:53.369
Maybe you don't have that priority
column that I'm seeing here.

132
00:08:53.369 --> 00:08:57.007
So I'm going to disable that, and
we're going back into it later.

133
00:08:57.007 --> 00:09:02.281
By the way, you can see I can
right-click over the columns,

134
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.671
and add or remove columns.

135
00:09:04.671 --> 00:09:08.263
There are a lot of information
you can get from here.

136
00:09:08.263 --> 00:09:13.207
Remember, I'm in the Network
tab in Chrome DevTools, okay?

137
00:09:13.207 --> 00:09:15.409
So this is a waterfall chart and

138
00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:19.643
here you can see there is a blue
line here and a red line here,

139
00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:25.176
the vertical line that does express at
which moment something has happened.

140
00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:33.962
Also, something that you can do from
here is click Capture a screenshots.

141
00:09:33.962 --> 00:09:41.209
If you click Capture a screenshots,
and then reload, Now,

142
00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:48.892
we are going to see what happened on the
website at that particular moment in time.

143
00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:53.080
And by the way,
FrontendMasters is pretty fast.

144
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.008
So that's why we're not going to use it
as an example of something that we can

145
00:09:58.008 --> 00:09:58.709
improve.

146
00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:02.304
There's always room for
improvement on every website, but

147
00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:06.404
it's better to try to find one sample
that is not already optimized.

148
00:10:06.404 --> 00:10:12.256
But I'm just showing you how you can use
DevTools to see the waterfall chart that

149
00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:18.040
we will see during the rest of the day,
and how do you see themes review, okay?

150
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.065
So Chrome DevTools is the first
tool that we typically

151
00:10:23.065 --> 00:10:27.755
use as performance engineers
in the network tab,

152
00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:32.682
the performance tab, and
also the lighthouse tab.

153
00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:36.924
I'm not sure if you know this, but
you can track the tabs as well there.

154
00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:41.749
So you can put them all together
as a group of performance

155
00:10:41.749 --> 00:10:44.940
related tabs around Google Chrome.
