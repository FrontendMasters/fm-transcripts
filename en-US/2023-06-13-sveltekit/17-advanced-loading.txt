>> So whenever you're building an application, you're probably gonna be dealing with some environment variables, things like API keys and database credentials. And these can be added to a .env file when you're developing locally, so that you can know those secrets. In this exercise we want to allow the user to enter the website if they know the correct passphrase using an environment variable.

[00:00:25]
So right now, if they know the passphrase which is open sesame, nothing happens or at least nothing good happens because we haven't declared that environment variable in our button file. So we'll do that now, create the passphrase, open SESAME, And now inside our route page server js, we can import that environment variable from the env static private module, And this is where they're getting kicked out before cuz the data get passphrase does not equal the hard coded value or replace that hard coded value, we'll replace the hard coded value with the environment variable.

[00:01:14]
And now if you sign open sesame into the input, I'm in. Now, it's important that when you're dealing with environment variables, that you don't accidentally expose them to the user because then they could be stolen and that would not be good. And SvelteKit actively prevents you from accidentally revealing your secrets.

[00:01:36]
If you try and pull nvars into your page.svelte component, Sorry, I lost my scroll pace. If you try and import env/static/private into your Svelte component, then it's gonna break. All right, we see this error message from V that says cannot import env/static/private into client side code. Right, this is a server only module, and there's a few server only modules Svelte Kit.

[00:02:17]
Anytime you have a module that has the .server suffix, page.server.js, layout.server.js, +server.js, or any of your own modules that have a.server.js and suffix. And also any modules inside source/lib/server, these are considered server modules that cannot be imported into client side code under any circumstances, and so within those files it's quite safe to access environment variables into communicate directly with your database.

[00:02:46]
And in turn, those modules can only be imported by other server modules. You might be wondering why this module has such a funny name env/static/private. The static part indicates that these values are known at build time, and that means that they can be statically replaced. And this enables useful optimizations.

[00:03:07]
For example, if you have a feature flag that is statically analyzed at build time, then any code that is inside this block will just be removed altogether if the feature flag is not currently enabled. So where possible, we recommend using static environment variables but some cases, it might not be possible, you might need to refer to environment variables that are not known when your app is built but only known when your app is run.

[00:03:32]
And for these we use dynamic environment variables. So we have the same exercise as before, but this time we're gonna use dynamic environment variables instead of static ones. First, we're gonna change the module that we're importing from to dynamic, And we're gonna import env instead of passphrase because we don't know yet what properties that env object is going to have.

[00:04:04]
And then down here we're gonna replace passphrase with env.passphrase. And now as before when we type in the passphrase, we get into the website. So, so far we've been dealing with environment variables that are secret, and they can only be accessed by server modules but you might have some environment variables that are safe to reveal to the user.

[00:04:35]
And these are distinguished from private environment variables by having a PUBLIC_prefix which you can configure in your stock config. So in our .env file here, we're gonna set some public environment variables, but pick a color like steel blue for the background and bisque for the foreground. And then inside our component we can in fact import these and replace the hard coded variables that we currently have.

[00:05:03]
So just delete all of that And import PUBLIC_THEME_BACKGROUND and PUBLIC_THEME_FOREGROUND From env/static/public. And now when we reload this page, it's pulling those values directly from our env file, so we can change that And it will it will update the app. And again, because we're pulling from a static env file, those properties will be replaced in your code when the application is built.

[00:05:48]
Finally, of course, we can have dynamic public environment variables to same as before, we're just gonna change the input to env and grab that from the dynamic module instead. And then we'll prefix all of these with the env seen there, And now the application renders same as before.

[00:06:17]
Any questions about environment variables? All right, well I have some good news. We have finished the tutorial. Congratulations everyone, thank you for bearing with me, this has been a lot of content to get through. If you've made it the entire way through this tutorial, you can now consider yourself a Svelte and SvelteKit experts.

[00:06:38]
You can start building apps on your own machines by just typing npm create svelte on the command line, follow the prompts, that will set you up with a new application. But this is not the end, Svelte and SvelteKit will continue to evolve, we're always adding new features and as a consequence this documentation will also evolve.

[00:06:56]
So I do encourage you to check back periodically and see if there's new material. And if you wanna keep up with developments in the Svelte world, you can join our Discord server, it's a very friendly space at svelte.dev/chat. And you can follow Svelte society on Twitter, where you'll get a stream of updates on everything Svelte related.

[00:07:16]
We are very happy to welcome you all to the Svelte community. Thank you for doing the tutorial with us. And now we're gonna move on to the final part of this workshop, where we're gonna take everything that we've learned in the Svelte course and the SvelteKit course, and we're gonna build a full stack application.
