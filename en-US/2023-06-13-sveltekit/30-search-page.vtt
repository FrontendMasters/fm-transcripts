1
00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:02.948
All right, I'm gonna remove that logging,
we no longer need it.

2
00:00:02.948 --> 00:00:06.086
We've verified that we are,
in fact, getting cache hits.

3
00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:09.588
So, I'm just gonna delete that and
delete that.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.472
Okay, let's add a search
page that we can search for

5
00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:20.138
movies that we're interested in.

6
00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:28.606
The score by now we create a new
directory inside here, call it search.

7
00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:35.115
And inside the, we'll create a page.ts and

8
00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:40.389
a page.spelt, And

9
00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:44.063
we'll add a load function
in our page.ts file.

10
00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:53.191
And we're going to be using the URL object
because we're going to need to grab

11
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.294
the query parameter.

12
00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:16.613
And if the query parameter isn't
specified, then we'll just assume that

13
00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:20.212
someone has come direct to the search page
and they haven't yet performed a search.

14
00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:28.196
So, we're going to return
an empty array of movies.

15
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.196
I'm also going to pass
the empty string back to them.

16
00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:47.365
But if they have specified a query,
then we're going to make an API request.

17
00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:50.584
That's data equals await.

18
00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:53.822
And we need to import our API helper.

19
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:57.311
Import star as API from lib/API.

20
00:02:01.664 --> 00:02:03.701
We've got to pass in our fetch.

21
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:04.948
So, let's grab that.

22
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:14.744
And the endpoint this time
is search slash movie.

23
00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:18.830
And we're going to pass that
query direct to the API.

24
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.153
And this is going to give
us back another movie list.

25
00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:28.131
You can see that it's auto-imported
that from our type declarations.

26
00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:37.527
So, we'll return the query so that we
can render that in the search input.

27
00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:42.738
And the move is the results
array from the data object.

28
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:49.189
And then inside our search page.

29
00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:59.551
We're gonna add a div class = column.

30
00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:06.238
And at the very top, we'll just
have a big title that says, Search.

31
00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:09.580
So, let's go over to our
in progress search page.

32
00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:23.826
And also if there was a query that was
made, we need to create our script tag so

33
00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:27.646
that we can access the data
that was passed in.

34
00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:33.015
Remember Lang equals TS
export less data than

35
00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:38.960
what's going on with my
typing skills right now.

36
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.090
Data Query was provided.

37
00:03:45.743 --> 00:03:51.254
Then we're going to use that results page
component that we've been using so far.

38
00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:52.865
Pass it the movies.

39
00:03:57.054 --> 00:04:01.697
And we're going to give it a next
attribute of null for now.

40
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:10.332
And obviously, because we don't
have a query at this point,

41
00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:12.751
we don't have anything to render.

42
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:16.599
In theory,
if I add a query like Avatar now,

43
00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.288
it is in fact performing a search and
rendering that.

44
00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:25.004
But we want to have some user interface
that allows us to edit the query.

45
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:26.899
So, let's create a form element.

46
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.496
Unlike the other forms that we've been
using in this workshop, we're not using

47
00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:36.619
method equals post this time because this
is just going to reload the current page.

48
00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:38.740
It's not mutating any data or
anything like that.

49
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.347
It's just making a request to the API.

50
00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:46.082
So, we'll omit the method and
we'll omit the action,

51
00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:50.009
but we'll add an input,
give it a name query,

52
00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.279
because that's going to correspond
to the query parameter.

53
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:05.727
We'll initialize it with any query
that was previously added like this.

54
00:05:05.727 --> 00:05:10.986
I'm going to disable autocomplete and
I'm going to disable the spellcheck,

55
00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:15.301
otherwise it's going complain
about the spellings of movies.

56
00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:25.059
And hopefully,
if I now search for Star Wars.

57
00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:28.057
It's going to go away,
it's going to perform an API request, and

58
00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:31.117
it's going to update the page in
place without reloading the page.

59
00:05:31.117 --> 00:05:33.531
So, unlike a form method equals post,

60
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:38.369
form method equals get is going to
default to doing everything client-side.

61
00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:41.100
We're not going to reload the page
to get those new results.

62
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.933
Let's make this input
look a little bit nicer.

63
00:05:48.672 --> 00:05:51.899
First thing you want to do is inherit
the same font family that we're using

64
00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:52.482
elsewhere.

65
00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:57.876
We're going to make
the the input a little larger,

66
00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:05.292
say two M's, give it some padding and
make it filled with the screen.

67
00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:11.813
Going to give it a nice
translucent background.

68
00:06:11.813 --> 00:06:16.245
It's a very subtle, white color and
remove the border because

69
00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:20.688
the default browser styling for
these elements is ugly as sin.

70
00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:22.640
Too subtle border radius.

71
00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:32.033
And we're going to need to give it
a color as well, so make that white.

72
00:06:35.474 --> 00:06:38.491
I don't really like this
bright blue outline.

73
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:43.839
Let's use the nice accent color that
we're using for the elements in our nav.

74
00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:50.214
We can do that with
a focus visible selector.

75
00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:55.696
Outline 2px solid,
I'll use var accent like so.

76
00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:02.750
All right, and we can now search for
all of the John Wick movies or

77
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.863
whatever else we're interested in.
