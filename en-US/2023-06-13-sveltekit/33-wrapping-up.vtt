1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.931
And that's it.

2
00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:05.495
So there are some more pages to this app
that we have not built in this workshop.

3
00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:11.777
I encourage you to look on GitHub to
see how we've implemented the auth and

4
00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:18.583
the database calls, which on the already
deployed version allows us to log in.

5
00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:30.057
And see a personalized watchlist
of movies that we wanna watch.

6
00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:33.086
It uses Super Base under the hood, so

7
00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:39.146
you'll need to create an account with
them if you want to copy that code and

8
00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:44.228
apply it to your local version,
but other than that we now have

9
00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:48.968
a fairly nice and
usable full stack movies application.

10
00:00:48.968 --> 00:00:52.928
And that uses a whole bunch of features
that we learned about in SvelteKit.

11
00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:57.514
So I hope this has been useful, I hope
that demonstration gave you some insight

12
00:00:57.514 --> 00:01:01.210
into what kind of problems SvelteKit
is able to help you solve.

13
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.192
If you wanna carry on
learning about SvelteKit,

14
00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:06.238
then come to this whole discord.

15
00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.007
Come and talk to us on Twitter, and

16
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.317
we hope to see you at a future
Svelte community event.

17
00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:18.038
Thank you for watching
