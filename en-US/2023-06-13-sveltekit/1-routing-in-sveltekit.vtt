00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.071
Okay welcome to the final part
of the SvelteKit workshop.

2
00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:07.189
We're gonna take everything that we've
learned in the preceding sections and

3
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.344
we're gonna use it to build
a full stack application.

4
00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:14.257
Specifically we're gonna build
this application Svelteflix

5
00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:19.168
which is an app for finding the most
popular movies of the day and

6
00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:22.519
adding them to a personalized watchlist.

7
00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.153
So I'll give you a quick rundown of the
features that this app includes before we

8
00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:28.199
try and clone it.

9
00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.115
On the homepage we can see
the top trending movie,

10
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:35.907
which somehow is Shazam today, followed by
a list of all of the trending movies and

11
00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:38.768
the now playing movies and
the upcoming movies.

12
00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:42.978
And if we click into one of these,
we see a page for each of these.

13
00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:46.042
And if we log in to the app

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.718
Then we're gonna be able to
add movies to our watchlist.

15
00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:59.625
In my case Cocaine Bear is
already on my watchlist

16
00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.703
along with John Wick Avatar, and 65.

17
00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:12.596
We can search for movies And
we can look at these trending pages.

18
00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:17.400
And we've got a nice little infinite
scroll going on where it's gonna load

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.468
more data without paginating.

20
00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:25.722
We're gonna begin by creating a brand
new project using creates felt.

21
00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:30.773
So in here, I'm gonna type
npm create svelte@Latest and

22
00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:34.288
I'm gonna give it a name of svelteflix.

23
00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:37.066
That's gonna scaffold
a brand new project for us.

24
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:42.150
I'm gonna use a skeleton project,
so down arrows like that.

25
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.515
We're gonna use TypeScript in
this app I am gonna add Prettier.

26
00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:53.624
And we're probably not gonna get to
testing, but I will add Playwright anyway,

27
00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:58.377
just so that we can see where our tests
would go if we're going to add tests.

28
00:01:58.377 --> 00:02:02.601
Right, so it's created our app and
now we need to open it in our code editor.

29
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.656
I'm gonna be using VS code.

30
00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:11.419
And if you have the option to use
VS Code I recommend doing so.

31
00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.785
VS Code has a really good Svelte editor
extension which you can install from

32
00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:17.388
the extensions pane here.

33
00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:22.413
I already have it installed but if you
search for Svelte you can find Svelte for

34
00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:27.765
VS Code here, install that and that will
give you out of the box language support.

35
00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:31.658
All right, I'm gonna bring
open my in-editor terminal and

36
00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:33.651
install all my dependencies.

37
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:39.073
I'm gonna use pnpm, but you can obviously
use npm or Yarn if that's your thing.

38
00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:48.057
Then now that we've got our dependencies
we'll start the development

39
00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:50.413
server with pnpm dev or npm run dev.

40
00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:56.081
And then I'm gonna move this over to
the left hand side of the screen,

41
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:59.917
and open our development
server in the browser

42
00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:08.141
All right, so first thing we're gonna
do is just get rid of that placeholder

43
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:09.627
content which we don't want anymore.

44
00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:19.416
What we want to do before we do anything
else is scaffold out our layout.

45
00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:23.504
So we have a navigation bar up here and
then at the bottom of the page we have

46
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:27.873
a footer giving information about where
the data for this app is coming from.

47
00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:32.143
So let's build our layout, first of all,

48
00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:35.708
create a new file +layout.svelte

49
00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:44.733
And then inside that file we're
gonna first create a navbar.

50
00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.453
We'll add a link to the home page and

51
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:54.406
then inside we'll put
the Svelteflix logo in a moment but

52
00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:57.893
for now we'll just spell it out.

53
00:03:57.893 --> 00:04:02.825
And then further down we're
gonna have a set of links

54
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:07.544
that all belong together
div class="links".

55
00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.450
And we're gonna have a link for
our search page.

56
00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.283
We'll have one for the watchlist.

57
00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:34.354
And finally,
we'll have one for logging in.

58
00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:39.716
Eventually we'll want to only show this
if the user is not already logged in.

59
00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:44.192
But for now we're just going
to wrap it in like that.

60
00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:48.195
Obviously this doesn't look a whole
lot like what we have over here.

61
00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:54.859
So we're gonna add some CSS to this
page to make it look a little bit nicer.

62
00:04:54.859 --> 00:05:00.405
I'm gonna create a new file styles.css
inside my source directory.

63
00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:14.359
And in here I'm just going to add
some some universal CSS that I want

64
00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:16.576
to apply throughout the app.

65
00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:21.597
First, we're gonna apply
position: relative,

66
00:05:21.597 --> 00:05:26.392
and box-sizing: border-box to everything.

67
00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:31.063
This is the first thing that I add
to any css file because I never want

68
00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:34.663
elements to have default
values other than these.

69
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:45.424
And then, I'm gonna get rid of the default
margin on the body because we're not gonna

70
00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:45.970
need that.

71
00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:58.271
And I'm gonna make the body a flex
element with a flex direction of column.

72
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.449
Right, this app has a dark theme.

73
00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.556
It only has a dark theme, we don't have
a light and a dark theme in this app.

74
00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:15.187
So we're gonna add a background
to the HTML element.

75
00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:24.401
And it's gonna be a subtle
radial gradient that looks

76
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:28.796
almost like a silver screen when
a movie isn't playing on it.

77
00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:33.612
We'll add a radial gradient that begins at

78
00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:39.094
the middle of the screen
at the top of the screen so

79
00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:45.946
that's circle at 50% 0%,
50% across, 0% down.

80
00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:52.444
And the center of that
gradient is gonna be hsl 0,

81
00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:56.480
0, 8% which is a dark gray.

82
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.925
And it's gonna radiate out to hsl 0, 0,

83
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:09.020
2% at the end, which is a darker gray.

84
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.102
If I save that, nothing happens because
I haven't yet imported it into my app.

85
00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:18.458
So in the layout.svelte,
we're gonna add a script tag.

86
00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:23.144
And we're gonna import the styles.css
file that we just created.

87
00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:31.010
And that didn't work,
and I'm not sure why.

88
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.511
Let's take a look.

89
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:35.607
It might be because I got the syntax for
the radial gradient wrong.

90
00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:41.707
If we open Dev tools,
we can get a better look at that And

91
00:07:41.707 --> 00:07:46.238
we can see that indeed there is an alert
arrow next to that CSS declaration.

92
00:07:46.238 --> 00:07:50.847
So let's see if we can figure out what's
going wrong with our radial gradient.

93
00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:57.945
It might be because I didn't specify
a starting position for that value.

94
00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:02.742
Okay, we need to add the percent to
the saturation value of our hsl value.

95
00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:14.387
And we're gonna make
the background attachment fixed so

96
00:08:14.387 --> 00:08:18.439
that it doesn't scroll when
we scroll the page and

97
00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:21.542
we're gonna make it fill the screen.

98
00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:31.384
And then we're gonna need to add
a color that's slightly off white.

99
00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:34.437
Otherwise it's not gonna be visible
against a black background.

100
00:08:34.437 --> 00:08:35.940
So we'll add that too.

101
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.191
Okay, so we've got the basics
of our global CSS added.

102
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:42.788
Let's add some styles to
the navigation bar itself now.

103
00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:47.236
So in our layout.svelte component,
we're gonna add some navigation styles.

104
00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:51.922
We're gonna make this a flex

105
00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:56.614
element with display flex.

106
00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:06.921
I'm gonna give it a height of 3rems.

107
00:09:10.212 --> 00:09:12.400
And we're gonna align
everything in the center.

108
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.577
We want the links to be on
the right hand side and

109
00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:19.296
the homepage logo to be
on the left hand side.

110
00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:23.988
We can achieve that with
justify-content: space-between.

111
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.616
And we wanna set a color for
the links, and

112
00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:32.756
we wanna wanna set a maximum width
that's gonna be slightly constrained.

113
00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:35.581
Because otherwise when we
get to really big screens,

114
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:37.350
it'll start to look a bit silly.

115
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.870
So in this app,
it actually maxes out at 80rems.

116
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.058
And we're gonna be using these
values a bunch in the app.

117
00:09:45.058 --> 00:09:47.993
So I'm gonna add them in
the global style sheet so

118
00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:51.296
that they can be referenced
as CSS custom properties.

119
00:09:51.296 --> 00:09:55.907
So up here, I'm gonna add an accent color,

120
00:09:55.907 --> 00:10:00.019
which is gonna be the color of the logo,

121
00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:03.896
which I stole from the Netflix logo.

122
00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:09.461
And to be precise, that color is hsl 1,

123
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:15.369
59% saturation, 50% luminosity.

124
00:10:15.369 --> 00:10:20.246
And the column size is 80rems.

125
00:10:20.246 --> 00:10:27.758
And we're gonna add a custom property that
defines the padding on the page as well.

126
00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:31.579
We'll call that side and
it will default to one rem.

127
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:43.921
So we'll set a max width
here of var--column and

128
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:50.284
we'll set some padding
var of 0 on the top and

129
00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:54.487
that side value on the sides.

130
00:10:54.487 --> 00:11:01.268
And the color is gonna be the accent
color that we defined before.

131
00:11:01.268 --> 00:11:05.776
Okay, so it's starting to resemble the one
that we've published online already

132
00:11:05.776 --> 00:11:07.292
a little bit more closely.

133
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.505
But we wanna get that accent
color onto these anchor elements.

134
00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:15.665
So we'll do color: inherit there and
I'm just gonna disable the underline.

135
00:11:19.842 --> 00:11:20.930
Okay, great.

136
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:26.333
We need to get a better typeface though
because Times New Roman is a sin.

137
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:30.909
And we're gonna use the system UI font for

138
00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:35.878
the default font because
that way it will load

139
00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:40.847
without loading a web
font from somewhere and

140
00:11:40.847 --> 00:11:45.703
it'll look nice on everyone's platform.
