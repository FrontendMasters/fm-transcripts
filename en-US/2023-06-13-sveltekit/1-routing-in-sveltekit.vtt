00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.390
So SvelteKit uses a thing called
filesystem based routing.

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.925
What that means is that
the routes of your app,

3
00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:11.021
which is to say what the app should do
when the user visits a particular URL,

4
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:13.770
are defined by the directories
in your code base.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.730
Every +page.svelte file inside
source/routes, creates a page in your app.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.294
In this app we currently have one page,
which is source/routes/page.svelte,

7
00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:29.610
which you can see on the right here,
which maps to the root of the application.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.851
If we navigate to the about page,
you'll see that we see a 404 not found

9
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:38.360
error because we haven't
defined that route yet yet.

10
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.722
And we can fix that by
adding a second page.

11
00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:46.434
In the file tree over here,
just click the new file icon,

12
00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:50.009
and create about/page.svelte.

13
00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:56.656
And we can add some content to that page,
we'll copy over the homepage,

14
00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.737
put that in there.

15
00:00:57.737 --> 00:00:59.936
And then just change that select and

16
00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:05.000
Command D to select both instances of the
word home, and replace that with about.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.497
So you can now see that we can
navigate between home and about.

18
00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:15.901
And unlike a traditional multi-page app,
when we navigate between these two routes,

19
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.757
the content is being updated
within the current document.

20
00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:20.479
We're not reloading the document and

21
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.370
going all the way back to
the server to get the new content.

22
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.850
So this gives us the best of both worlds.

23
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.420
We get the fast server ended startup,
followed by instant navigation.

24
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.442
Although this behavior can be configured
if you do need something different.

25
00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.800
You'll notice, of course, that there was a
bit of duplication in that last exercise.

26
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.610
We had the nav bar repeated in both
the home page and the about page.

27
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.830
This is a very common thing when you're
building websites, you will have some part

28
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.606
of your user interface that should
be persistent throughout your app.

29
00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:52.967
And for
that we use something called layouts.

30
00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:56.679
Instead of repeating that content
in our page.svelte files,

31
00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.401
we're going to create
a layout.svelte which contains that.

32
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:04.757
So let's create our layout file, again,

33
00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:09.360
hit the new file icon and +layout.svelte.

34
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.680
And we're gonna move the navigation
content out of page and into layout.

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.342
You'll notice that it's not actually
showing any page content now, and

36
00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:23.700
that's because we need to tell
SvelteKit where that content should go.

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.497
So below here we're gonna
add a slot element.

38
00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.943
So far so good, although if we now go to
about we'll see that the navigation is

39
00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:38.097
doubled up, so
we need to fix that by getting rid of it.

40
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:45.957
So layout.svelte applies
to every child page.

41
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:50.900
That means sibling page.svelte files and
every page.svelte in child directories.

42
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.072
And you can have as many layout
files as you need that can be

43
00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.210
nested throughout your app.

44
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.769
So if you have some sections of your app
that should have a particular layout,

45
00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.584
you can add a layout.svelte that
applies just to those pages
