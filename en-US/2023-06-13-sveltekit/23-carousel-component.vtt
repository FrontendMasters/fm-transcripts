WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889
All right, so we've got all of this
trending movies data that we're not

2
00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.479
using at the moment, we're only displaying
one movie, and we'd like to show a whole

3
00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.469
bunch of trending movies beneath it
in that carousel that we saw earlier.

4
00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.688
So to do this, because we're going to be
repeating this a couple of times, we're

5
00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:20.863
going to add a carousel component that
we can reuse throughout our application.

6
00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:28.273
So let's go over to the lib folder or
create a new directory components.

7
00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:33.349
This is where we'll put components
that are gonna be repeated

8
00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:38.044
multiple times in the app and
create Carousel.svelte.

9
00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:41.410
Okay, so
we're gonna create a script element, and

10
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.714
we're gonna export a movies prop.

11
00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:48.256
First, we're gonna add
the lang=ts attribute as always.

12
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:58.258
And our movies prop is gonna be
an array of movie list result objects.

13
00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.655
If we look at that definition,

14
00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:04.904
you can see all of the things
that exist on that object.

15
00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:10.442
Including usefully for our purposes, the
poster path, which is that image there,

16
00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:15.048
and the ID which is gonna enable us
to link to an individual movie page.

17
00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:23.339
We'll begin by creating a div
with a class of carousel.

18
00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:29.985
And then inside there we're just going to
render a whole bunch of poster images.

19
00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.423
So for each of our movies in the array,

20
00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:38.806
each movies as movie,
we're gonna create a link element,

21
00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:46.924
That points to /movie/movie.id.

22
00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:54.476
And inside there we're gonna
render the movie's poster.

23
00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.070
Like with our hero component,
we're gonna use the media helper.

24
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.607
We're gonna pass in the movie.poster_path
that we saw with a width of 500.

25
00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.831
Let's see how that looks.

26
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:29.479
Okay, so we're gonna need to use
the carousel component in our page.

27
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.655
So let's open that component.

28
00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:34.976
Okay, so we've started building
our carousel component.

29
00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:38.470
Let's add it to our page.

30
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.736
Start typing carousel, auto-import that.

31
00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:46.255
And the movies that we're gonna pass

32
00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:50.779
are the data.trending_results.

33
00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:57.024
You can see that it's now
rendering that entire list.

34
00:02:57.024 --> 00:03:00.166
Obviously it's a little bit chunky,
this isn't quite what we want.

35
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:06.536
So let's go into carousel.spell and
add some CSS.

36
00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:21.359
First thing we're going to do as so

37
00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.149
often is we're going to turn this
into a display flex element.

38
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.847
I find that use display flex more than
pretty much any other display property

39
00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:29.497
these days.

40
00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:35.987
And we're gonna give this
a maximum height of for

41
00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:41.346
now let's just say 10 rams and you can
see that the footer is now appeared

42
00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:46.380
above the carousel because we need
to shrink the images down as well.

43
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.097
So we're gonna say that
the A elements inside there

44
00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:54.497
have a maximum height of 100% and

45
00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:59.340
the same for
the images inside the anchor elements.

46
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.326
It's starting to look a little
bit more like a carousel now.

47
00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:10.039
Let's add a gap,
Space them out a little bit.

48
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.619
And we wanna make the carousel scrollable
without making the entire page

49
00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.054
scroll along with it.

50
00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:22.148
And that's easy enough to do with
the overflow-x scroll CSS property.

51
00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:30.977
But you'll notice on the original,
when we scroll we ended

52
00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:35.737
up with the posters perfectly
lined up with the one below.

53
00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:40.080
And that's because we're using
something called scroll snapping.

54
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.418
Says add some scroll snaps the carousel

55
00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:49.157
property is called scroll_snap_type.

56
00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.757
And the value is mandatory.

57
00:04:53.757 --> 00:05:01.667
In other words, we always insist that
the image line up with the left hand edge.

58
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:07.085
But we need to add some padding before
this will behave the way we want.

59
00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:11.421
And we can, Use the,

60
00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:17.625
Side value that we declared
in our global CSS.

61
00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:24.956
But we need to add it both to the scroll
padding and the element padding.

62
00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:32.504
So scroll-padding-left is
gonna be var --padding.

63
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:38.370
And then the padding on the carousel
is gonna have that on both sides.

64
00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:43.369
All right,
you can see it's now slightly offset.

65
00:05:54.744 --> 00:05:59.863
One other thing that we'll need
to add to get rid of the ugly

66
00:05:59.863 --> 00:06:05.299
scroll bar on some platforms is
this pseudo selector carousel

67
00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:11.277
: : -webkit-scrollbar and
that's gonna get a display of none.

68
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.325
Now this is all starting to take shape,
but this big image is too big.

69
00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:34.521
We want it to be constrained to that
column width that we specified for

70
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:39.642
the navigation and for that header
element that we have on the page.

71
00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:44.546
Unfortunately, we can't just
use the column class on this

72
00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:49.941
carousel because then we wouldn't
be able to scroll the elements

73
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.859
to the left of that view that
would get cut off by the column.

74
00:06:54.859 --> 00:07:00.798
So instead, we're gonna need to use
a little bit of maths in our CSS.

75
00:07:00.798 --> 00:07:03.406
Bear with me for
a minute while we type this out.

76
00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:08.146
The padding on the side of the carousel
is gonna be the maximum of that

77
00:07:08.146 --> 00:07:09.820
side custom property.

78
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.571
And the calculated value of,

79
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:21.217
[ BLANK_AUDIO] The-- side property.

80
00:07:21.217 --> 00:07:26.256
Plus the full width of the page

81
00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:32.108
100 vw minus the column width.

82
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:39.898
I'm gonna group those values and
then divide the whole thing by two.

83
00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:44.359
And if we've set that up correctly,

84
00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:48.145
that will now max out when
we make the page bigger.

85
00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:52.246
So you can see now that it's getting
a little extra padding there on the side.

86
00:07:52.246 --> 00:07:55.662
So that we can see this on the screen
when it's zoomed in like this,

87
00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:57.985
I'm actually gonna go into my styles.css.

88
00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:02.192
And change that column width to say 60 and
now,

89
00:08:02.192 --> 00:08:08.150
when we drag this page out we'll
see that that happened much sooner.

90
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.939
We need to do the same thing for
the hero image now.

91
00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:16.467
So open the heroes.component and
we'll set a max width on that a element.

92
00:08:16.467 --> 00:08:20.564
In fact let's just add the column class.

93
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.680
And that is now similarly constrained
