1
00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:00.874
And that's it.

2
00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:06.177
So there are some more pages to this app
that we have not built in this workshop.

3
00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:12.271
I encourage you to look on GitHub to
see how we've implemented the auth and

4
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:19.261
the database calls, which, on the already
deployed version, allows us to log in,

5
00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:28.834
And see a personalized watch list
of movies that we wanna watch.

6
00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:34.617
It uses Supabase under the hood, so
you'll need to create an account

7
00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:40.715
with them if you want to copy that code
and apply it to your local version.

8
00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:44.364
But other than that,
we now have a fairly nice and

9
00:00:44.364 --> 00:00:47.658
usable full stack movies application, and

10
00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:52.837
that uses a whole bunch of features
that we learned about SvelteKit.

11
00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:57.226
So I hope this has been useful, I hope
that demonstration gave you some insight

12
00:00:57.226 --> 00:01:00.770
into what kind of problems SvelteKit
is able to help you solve.

13
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.650
If you wanna carry on
learning about SveltKit,

14
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.116
then come to the Svelt discord,
come and talk to us on Twitter,

15
00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:17.855
and we hope to see you at
a future Svelt community event.

16
00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.668
Thank you for watching.

17
00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:20.511
