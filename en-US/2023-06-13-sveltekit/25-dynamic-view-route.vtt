00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:05.124
So we're gonna create a new route inside
our src/routes directory which is gonna

2
00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:08.502
be called movies slash, and
then view as a dynamic parameter.

3
00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:20.096
And then inside that we can
create a page.svelte component.

4
00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:23.237
And we're gonna be loading some data,
so we'll add a page.ts as well.

5
00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:37.175
Now, we can actually do one better
than having a dynamic parameter here.

6
00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:42.265
Because we've defined which views
are valid, trending, now playing and

7
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:47.192
upcoming, we can use a route matcher so
that this view dynamic parameter

8
00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:51.663
is not matched for anything that
is not one of those three things.

9
00:00:51.663 --> 00:00:56.134
So the way that we do that is we
create a matcher inside src/params.

10
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.525
We'll create a new matcher,
call it list.ts.

11
00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.447
And you'll remember that we need
to export a match function,

12
00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:15.111
which is gonna return true if the
parameter matches and false if it doesn't.

13
00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:29.692
And if were return param,

14
00:01:33.953 --> 00:01:37.856
In views, which is just import like that.

15
00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:42.266
Then this is gonna return true
if the parameter is trending,

16
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:46.680
now playing or upcoming, but
false if it's anything else.

17
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.658
Now that we've got that,
we can add that to the parameter here.

18
00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:52.596
Just rename that directory view = list.

19
00:01:56.756 --> 00:02:02.314
And now if we go to /movies/trending,
the page exists.

20
00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:07.137
If we change that in any way, like
trendingx, then it's a 404,

21
00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:08.451
it no longer matches.

22
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:12.531
This gives us some confidence when we're
building our data loading logic that we

23
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.460
are in fact dealing with a valid view.

24
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.600
&gt;&gt; Sorry if I missed it but is there is
there any reason you would wanna do it

25
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.110
this way versus just making three
routes for trending, playing, etc.?

26
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.394
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the question was what
why are we creating a dynamic

27
00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:31.366
parameter instead of just
repeating the directory?

28
00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.985
And the answer is that these pages
are essentially the same they're using

29
00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:36.029
the same component,
they're using the same logic.

30
00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:40.850
And we could do it by just reusing
components in three separate files, but

31
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.501
then if we add a new view, like,
the most popular movies or

32
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:49.128
like the top rated movies,
then we've got to keep duplicating code.

33
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:53.451
And if we do it this way instead
then it allows us to express

34
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:55.350
those things just once.

35
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.652
It's also for the sake of the workshop,
it's a good opportunity to use

36
00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:03.824
more SvelteKit features and
that's the main reason if I'm honest.

37
00:03:06.047 --> 00:03:09.413
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Do you need to remove the three

38
00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:11.960
awaits in the promise?

39
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.968
&gt;&gt; Yes.

40
00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:17.260
All right, so,
thank you to whoever noticed that after

41
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.278
removing the waterfall in
our root load function,

42
00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:27.416
we actually did no such thing because
we're still awaiting the API calls here.

43
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.304
We need to get rid of each of these.

44
00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:36.305
Like that, although this is now erroring
because we're not returning a MovieList

45
00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:40.091
from the fetch call,
we're returning a promise of a MovieList.

46
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:47.507
So we need to get each of these and
just wrap that in a promise like that.

47
00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:51.665
And now because we're awaiting
all of these trending has

48
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.616
the correct type again of MovieList so.

49
00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:57.543
Thank you to whoever noticed that
in the chat, that's very helpful.
