00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.113
Okay, welcome to the final part
of the SvelteKit workshop.

2
00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:07.041
We're gonna take everything that we've
learned in the preceding sections and

3
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.149
we're going to use it to build
a full stack application.

4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:14.308
Specifically we're gonna build
this application SvelteFlix,

5
00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:19.274
which is an app for finding the most
popular movies of the day and

6
00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.661
adding them to a personalized watch list.

7
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:26.751
So I'll give you a quick rundown of the
features that this app includes before we

8
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:27.676
try and clone it.

9
00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:32.022
On the home page we can see the top
trending movie which somehow is Shazam

10
00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:35.717
today, followed by a list of
all of the trending movies, and

11
00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:38.849
the now playing movies,
and the upcoming movies.

12
00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:42.804
And if we click into one of these,
we see a page for

13
00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:46.002
each of these and if we log in to the app,

14
00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:55.449
Then we're gonna be able to
add movies to our watchlist.

15
00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.117
In my case Cocaine Bear is
already on my watchlist.

16
00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:03.738
Along with John Wick, Avatar and 65.

17
00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:05.826
We can search for movies.

18
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:15.551
And we can look at these trending pages
and we've got a nice little infinite

19
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:20.122
scroll going on where it's gonna
load more data without paginating.

20
00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:25.561
We're gonna begin by creating a brand
new project using create svelte.

21
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:30.587
So in here I'm gonna say npm
create svelte@latest and

22
00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:34.309
I'm gonna give it a name of svelteflix.

23
00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:37.191
That's gonna scaffold
a brand new project for us.

24
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:42.184
I'm gonna use a skeleton project,
so down arrows like that.

25
00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:44.587
We're gonna use TypeScript in this app.

26
00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:52.024
I'm gonna add prettier and we're
probably not gonna get to testing but

27
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:54.504
I will add Playwright anyway, just so

28
00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:58.918
that we can see where are tests
would go if we're gonna add tests.

29
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.588
Right, so it's created our app and

30
00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:06.757
now we need to open it in our code editor,
I'm gonna be using VS Code.

31
00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:11.711
And if you have the option to use
VS Code I recommend doing so.

32
00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:14.722
VS code has a really good
Svelte editor extension which

33
00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:17.348
you can install from
the extensions pane here.

34
00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:22.392
I already have it installed but if you
search for Svelte, you can find Svelte for

35
00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:27.603
VS Code here, install that and that will
give you out of the box language support.

36
00:02:27.603 --> 00:02:31.736
All right, I'm gonna bring
open my in-editor terminal and

37
00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:35.382
install all my dependencies
I'm gonna use pnpm, but

38
00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:39.204
you can obviously use npm or
Yarn if that's your thing.

39
00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:46.736
And now that we've got our dependencies,

40
00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:51.778
we'll start the development server
with pnpm dev or npm run dev.

41
00:02:51.778 --> 00:02:56.467
I'm gonna move this over to the left
hand side of the screen and

42
00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.907
open our development
server in the browser.

43
00:03:05.323 --> 00:03:08.049
All right, so first thing we're gonna
do is just get rid of that placeholder

44
00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.548
content, which we don't want anymore.

45
00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:19.687
All I want to do before we do anything
else is scaffold out our layout.

46
00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:23.700
So we have a navigation bar up here and
then at the bottom of the page, we have

47
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.869
a footer giving information about where
the data for this app is coming from.

48
00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:33.300
So let's build our layout first of all,

49
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.740
create a new file, +layout.svelte.

50
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.130
And then inside that file,
we're gonna first create a nav bar.

51
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.484
We'll add a link to the home page.

52
00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:55.310
And then inside, we'll put
the SvelteFlix logo in a moment, but

53
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.962
for now, we'll just spell it out.

54
00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:02.788
And then further down,
we're gonna have a set of

55
00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:07.861
links that all belong
together div class = links.

56
00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:14.402
And we're gonna have a link for
our search page.

57
00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:21.343
We'll have one for the watch list.

58
00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:34.405
And finally,
we'll have one for logging in.

59
00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:40.320
Eventually we'll want to only show this
if the user is not already logged in,

60
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.242
but for now we're just gonna
rough it in like that.

61
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:48.098
Obviously this doesn't look a whole
lot like what we have over here.

62
00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:54.630
So we're gonna add some CSS to this
page to make it look a little bit nicer.

63
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:03.214
I'm gonna create a new file styles.css
inside my source directory.

64
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.934
And then here I'm just going to
add some universal CSS that I

65
00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:16.572
want to apply throughout the app.

66
00:05:16.572 --> 00:05:23.044
First, we're gonna apply position:
relative, and box-sizing: border-box,

67
00:05:23.044 --> 00:05:28.682
to everything, this is the first thing
that I add to any CSS file because I

68
00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:33.689
never want elements that have
default values other than these.

69
00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:44.608
And then I'm gonna get rid of
the default margin on the body,

70
00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:46.232
cuz we're not gonna need that.

71
00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:53.995
And I'm gonna make the body flex element,

72
00:05:56.183 --> 00:06:00.070
With the flex direction of column.

73
00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:06.430
Right, this app has a dark theme,
it only has a dark theme,

74
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.511
you don't have a light and
a dark theme in this app.

75
00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:15.183
So we're gonna add a background
to the HTML element.

76
00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:25.650
And it's gonna be a subtle radial
gradient that looks almost like

77
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.459
a silver screen when a movie
isn't playing on it.

78
00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:35.223
We had a radial gradient that
begins at the middle of the screen,

79
00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:40.132
at the top of the screen,
so that's circle at 50%,

80
00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:43.359
0%, 50%, across 0% down.

81
00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:53.145
And the center of that
gradient is gonna be hsl 0,

82
00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:57.767
0, 8% which is a dark gray and

83
00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:03.416
it's gonna radiate out to hsl 0, 0,

84
00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:09.258
2% at the end, which is a darker grey.

85
00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:13.103
If I save that, nothing happens because
I haven't yet imported it into my app.

86
00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:17.238
So in the layout.svelte,
we're gonna add a script tag.

87
00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:22.917
And we're gonna import the styles.css
file that we just created.

88
00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:30.924
And that didn't work,
and I'm not sure why.

89
00:07:30.924 --> 00:07:32.071
Let's take a look,

90
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:35.858
it might be because I got the syntax for
the radial gradient wrong.

91
00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:38.591
If we open DevTools,
we can get a better look at that.

92
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:46.296
We can see that indeed there is an alert
arrow next to that CSS declaration.

93
00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:50.745
So let's see if we can figure out what's
going wrong with our radial gradient.

94
00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:58.031
It might be because I didn't specify
a starting position for that value.

95
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:05.956
Okay, we need to add the the percent to
the saturation value of our HSL value.

96
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.199
And we're gonna make
the the background attachment fixed.

97
00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:19.282
So that it doesn't scroll
when we scroll the page.

98
00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:21.192
And we're gonna make it fill the screen.

99
00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:30.205
And then we're gonna need to add
a color that's slightly off white,

100
00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:34.367
otherwise it's not gonna be visible
against the black background.

101
00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:36.141
So we'll add that too.

102
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.311
Okay, so we've got the basics
of our global CSS added,

103
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:42.355
let's add some styles to
the navigation bar itself.

104
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:47.224
Now, so in our layout .svelte component,
we're gonna add

105
00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:52.294
some navigation styles,
we're gonna make this a flex element

106
00:08:55.063 --> 00:08:59.744
With display flex

107
00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.704
I'm gonna give it a height of 3rems.

108
00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:13.604
I'm gonna align everything in the center.

109
00:09:13.604 --> 00:09:16.375
We want the links to be on
the right-hand side and

110
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.087
the homepage logo to be
on the left-hand side.

111
00:09:19.087 --> 00:09:23.685
We can achieve that with
justify-content space-between.

112
00:09:26.356 --> 00:09:31.146
And we wanna set a color for the links,
and we also wanna set a maximum width.

113
00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:33.875
It's gonna be slightly
constrained because otherwise,

114
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:37.060
when we get to really big screens,
it'll start to look a bit silly.

115
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.910
So in this app,
it actually maxes out at 80 rems and

116
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.859
we're gonna be using these
values a bunch in the app.

117
00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:47.879
So I'm gonna add them in
the global stylesheet so

118
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.276
that they can be referenced
as CSS custom properties.

119
00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:56.112
So up here, I'm gonna add an accent color.

120
00:09:56.112 --> 00:10:02.811
Which is gonna be the color of the logo,
which I stole from the Netflix logo.

121
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:08.523
And to be precise, that color is hsl 1,

122
00:10:08.523 --> 00:10:15.404
59% saturation, 50% luminosity.

123
00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:21.088
And the column size is 80 rems.

124
00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:27.947
And we're gonna add a custom property that
defines the padding on the page as well.

125
00:10:27.947 --> 00:10:31.477
We'll call that side and
it'll default to 1 rem.

126
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.608
So we'll set a max width here of var --

127
00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:48.498
column, and we'll set some padding,

128
00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:55.294
0 on the top and
that side value on the sides.

129
00:10:55.294 --> 00:11:01.175
And the color is gonna be the accent
color that we defined before.

130
00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:05.663
Okay, so it's starting to resemble the one
that we've published online already

131
00:11:05.663 --> 00:11:07.167
a little bit more closely.

132
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:11.316
But we wanna get the and that accent
color onto these anchor elements, so

133
00:11:11.316 --> 00:11:15.822
we'll do color: inherit there, and
I'm just gonna disable the underline.

134
00:11:19.844 --> 00:11:21.125
Okay, great,

135
00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:26.648
we need to get a better typeface
though cuz Times New Roman is a sin.

136
00:11:26.648 --> 00:11:33.249
And we're gonna use the system UI font for
the default font because that way,

137
00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:39.829
It will load without loading
a web font from somewhere.

138
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:43.048
And it'll look nice on
everyone's platform.
