>> And that's it. So there are some more pages to this app that we have not built in this workshop. I encourage you to look on GitHub to see how we've implemented the auth and the database calls, which, on the already deployed version, allows us to log in, And see a personalized watch list of movies that we wanna watch.

[00:00:28]
It uses Supabase under the hood, so you'll need to create an account with them if you want to copy that code and apply it to your local version. But other than that, we now have a fairly nice and usable full stack movies application, and that uses a whole bunch of features that we learned about SvelteKit.

[00:00:52]
So I hope this has been useful, I hope that demonstration gave you some insight into what kind of problems SvelteKit is able to help you solve. If you wanna carry on learning about SveltKit, then come to the Svelt discord, come and talk to us on Twitter, and we hope to see you at a future Svelt community event.

[00:01:17]
Thank you for watching.
