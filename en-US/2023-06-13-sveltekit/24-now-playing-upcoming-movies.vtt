1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.594
Okay, so our carousel is beginning to take
shape, but now we wanna add the other two.

2
00:00:03.594 --> 00:00:06.985
We wanna add one for now playing and
we wanna add one for upcoming.

3
00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:11.056
So back in our data loading function,

4
00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:16.536
our page.ts,
we're gonna duplicate this line,

5
00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:22.887
Then we're gonna add now_playing.

6
00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.957
And the endpoint for
this data is movie/now_playing.

7
00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:39.277
It's gonna give us the same
type of databack and movielist.

8
00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:47.284
And then we'll do an upcoming as well
using the movie/upcoming endpoint.

9
00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:52.396
And we can pass those into our

10
00:00:52.396 --> 00:00:57.304
component in the same way.

11
00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:02.616
So in our page.svelte component
we can duplicate these carousels.

12
00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:05.785
We can add one for now_playing.

13
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.584
And we can add one for upcoming.

14
00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:20.556
Some of the movies are duplicated between
these lists, that's totally fine.

15
00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:23.372
These are the three separate
views that we wanted to see.

16
00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:25.593
Now if you're paying
really close attention,

17
00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:29.271
you'll notice that there is actually
a problem in our data loading function.

18
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:32.744
And that is that all of
these calls are waterfall.

19
00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:36.319
And what I mean by that is we're going
away and we're getting the trending data

20
00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.231
and then we're getting the now plain data
and then we're getting the upcoming data.

21
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.743
And then finally, we're getting
the information about the featured Movie.

22
00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:48.556
And that's no good, we can make that much
more efficient by issuing these top three

23
00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:49.952
requests in parallel.

24
00:01:49.952 --> 00:01:52.572
So we're gonna rewrite
this code a little bit.

25
00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:56.665
We're gonna do const trending now_playing.

26
00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:02.126
And upcoming all together
equals await promise.all and

27
00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:07.017
then we're just gonna grab
all of these API codes,

28
00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:09.872
and put them inside that array

29
00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:19.088
Gonna get rid of the assignments and

30
00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:24.274
we'll turn the semicolons into commas.

31
00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:27.378
Now we're gonna issue those
API calls simultaneously,

32
00:02:27.378 --> 00:02:29.781
which is gonna result
in a faster page load.

33
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.381
This one is inevitably waterfall, because
we don't know which movie to get all of

34
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:37.327
the details for
until we know what's trending today

35
00:02:41.797 --> 00:02:46.393
Obviously, at the moment we

36
00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:50.797
just have a grid of images,

37
00:02:50.797 --> 00:02:57.314
here we don't know which list is which.

38
00:02:57.314 --> 00:03:02.289
So we're gonna define a new module that
describes the different views that we can

39
00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.910
use in this application.

40
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.922
And source /lib will add anew module,
views.ts.

41
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:19.471
And inside here I'm gonna declare a new
interface, view, we'll export that.

42
00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:27.110
Title is gonna be a string, and
the endpoint is also gonna be a string.

43
00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:32.361
And we'll use that endpoint later
on when we have dedicated pages for

44
00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:33.039
each of these views.

45
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.469
And we're gonna create
an object of views like this.

46
00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.063
We've got a trending view,
which has a title of Trending and

47
00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:57.572
an endpoint as we saw
is trending/movie/day.

48
00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:06.611
We'll create on our now_playing view,

49
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.542
the title of Now playing, and

50
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:15.741
an endpoint of movie/now_playing.

51
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:17.090
And finally, we've got our upcoming view.

52
00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:35.973
Now inside our page.svelte,
we can reference these views and

53
00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:39.247
pass the view information
into the carousel.

54
00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:44.945
And then we can render a header and
we can also use that information

55
00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:51.485
to create links to the trending and
now_playing an upcoming movie pages.

56
00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:56.672
So in our carousel component, we're
gonna export a new value which is view

57
00:05:00.231 --> 00:05:06.246
And is gonna import that from lib.views.

58
00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:10.342
And in the carousel,
we're now going to add a header,

59
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.570
Which is gonna have that column class so
that it's constrained to the width.

60
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.038
And the title of the h2, or the text
of the h2 is gonna be the View title.

61
00:05:32.047 --> 00:05:37.034
And we're also gonna invite
users of this component

62
00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:42.032
to pass in an href so
that you can see the entire list.

63
00:05:56.117 --> 00:05:59.927
And the reason that we're doing that,
if you look at the original, is so

64
00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:03.620
that when you have a trending carousel,
you can click to see all link.

65
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.033
And it will take you to a page
of all of the trending movies.

66
00:06:13.044 --> 00:06:16.659
Right, we've broken the page because
we're not passing in view and the href.

67
00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.090
So let's fix that in our page, see,

68
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.963
we're now getting a red squiggly
on these carousel components

69
00:06:25.963 --> 00:06:31.310
because we're not passing in
the props that it expects.

70
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.492
View=, and then we need to import

71
00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:39.113
the views data from the file
that we just created.

72
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.868
Do the same thing for
now_playing and upcoming.

73
00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:35.988
And we can now see those headers along
with those links on our home page.

74
00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:39.857
Because if we click those links,
nothing is gonna happen yet,

75
00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:42.418
because we haven't created that route.

76
00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:43.367
So let's do that now,
