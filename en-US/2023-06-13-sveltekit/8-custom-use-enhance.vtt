00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.770
So with use:enhance,

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.614
we can go further than just emulating
the browser's native behavior.

3
00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:08.339
We can provide a callback to the action,

4
00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.281
which adds things like pending states and
optimistic UI.

5
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:16.749
So to be able to see this we're gonna add
an artificial delay to our two actions.

6
00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.672
Open up your page.server.js file, and

7
00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:25.605
in the create action,
we'll do await new Promise,

8
00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.218
and we'll set timeout on
that fulfil callback.

9
00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:36.915
We'll give it a delay
of 1000 milliseconds.

10
00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:40.582
I'm gonna copy that and
add the same thing in the Delete action.

11
00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:49.853
All right, and so now if we,
Buy some milk, I don't know.

12
00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:53.401
We'll see that nothing happens for
a second, and

13
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.861
then the todo is added to the list.

14
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.541
Obviously not a very satisfying experience
if the user has to wait a whole

15
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.996
second before they see their
updates take effect, so

16
00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:07.931
let's add some local state so
we can add some optimistic UI.

17
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:12.222
Up in our script tag,
on the page.svelte file,

18
00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:18.620
we're gonna create a creating
variable that's initialized to false.

19
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.750
And we'll have an array of the todos
that are currently being deleted.

20
00:01:30.462 --> 00:01:35.146
We'll go to the first form where
we add a todo, and I'm just gonna

21
00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:40.097
restructure this a little bit so
that the code becomes easier to read.

22
00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:42.834
Put all of the attributes
on separate lines.

23
00:01:45.307 --> 00:01:47.785
We're gonna provide
a callback to use:enhance.

24
00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:57.924
First thing we're gonna do
is set creating to true, And

25
00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:05.450
then we're gonna return an asynchronous
function, That takes this update utility.

26
00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:10.243
We're gonna call that, and

27
00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:15.782
all that's gonna do is whatever would have
happened had we not provided a callback.

28
00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:19.972
Once the update is complete,
we'll set creating back to false.

29
00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:30.966
And then we're gonna disable the input
while the todo is being created.

30
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:35.662
Just add that disabled attribute
when creating is true.

31
00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:41.892
And we can now show a message
while we're saving data.

32
00:02:41.892 --> 00:02:46.660
Underneath the list of todos,
we're gonna add an if block.

33
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.992
If creating is true, Then

34
00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:56.042
we'll add a span there
with a class of saving.

35
00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:02.107
And we'll just say saving...,
close the span.

36
00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:08.516
And then now if you had another todo,

37
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:18.687
We get some user interface that tells
the user that their action has been

38
00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:23.551
acknowledged and that we're just
waiting for something to happen.

39
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.307
In the case of deletions, we don't
really need to wait for the server to

40
00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:31.197
validate anything, we can just update
the user interface immediately.

41
00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:38.359
So inside the each block, where we're
iterating over the list of todos,

42
00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.335
the first thing we're gonna
do is filter the list.

43
00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:45.356
Instead of just showing all of the todos,

44
00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:48.658
we're gonna show all of the todos
that are not marked for deletion.

45
00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:54.629
And we can do that by adding
this line inside the each block.

46
00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.063
Each data.todos.filter, And

47
00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:05.647
then the callback is gonna
be that the deleting

48
00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:11.668
array does not include
the ID of the current todo.

49
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.650
All right, right now that's having
no effect because none of our todos

50
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.575
are currently being deleted.

51
00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:24.954
But we can change that by again adding
a callback to the use:enhance section.

52
00:04:24.954 --> 00:04:28.550
Split the attributes onto multiple
lines to make it easier to read.

53
00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:38.857
And the first thing we'll do
is update the deleting array,

54
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:47.253
To include the todo that's been deleted.

55
00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.900
And then we'll return
the completion handler.

56
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.775
That again is gonna cause
the update function,

57
00:05:02.283 --> 00:05:06.428
That applies the changes that
were gonna happen anyway, and

58
00:05:06.428 --> 00:05:09.524
then removes that id
from the deleted array.

59
00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.105
Okay, that was a lot of code,
hopefully we typed it correctly.

60
00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.375
So now,
even though it's gonna take a second for

61
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:39.129
the action to actually take place, I can
delete these todos in quick succession.

62
00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.834
And I forgot to add the CSS on this
exercise so just pretend that you can see

63
00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:47.400
the trash can icon on
the right-hand side of the todo.

64
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.748
As we click these, the todos get deleted,

65
00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:56.427
even though we're waiting for
the server to actually apply the action.

66
00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.470
So use:enhance is very customizable.

67
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.453
You can cancel submissions,
you can handle redirects,

68
00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:04.386
you can control whether the form is reset,
all of that.

69
00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:08.312
You can see the reference documentation
for the details on how to do that.
