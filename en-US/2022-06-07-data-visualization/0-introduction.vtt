00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.625
I am so excited to be here physically
standing in front of you all [LAUGH] it's

2
00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.630
like a dream come true after
the last couple years.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.610
Hello, we are here to talk about
Data Visualization First Steps.

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.372
Hi, I'm Angana Vakil, I am a senior
developer advocate at Hisura and

5
00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:23.070
an Observable Ambassador and
former member of the Observable team.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.570
So today we're gonna be working
through some materials and

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.170
these slides also as observable notebooks,
so

8
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.060
you can find all of the course
materials on observablehq.com.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.209
If you go to the URL you see here
which I think just got pasted into

10
00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:42.872
the chat as well observablehq.com/@

11
00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:47.979
anjana/data-visualization-first-steps you
will find these slides.

12
00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:53.001
And if you click, you should see
at the top here a little of square

13
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:58.489
icon that says Data Visualization
First Steps, when you click that,

14
00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.523
you should see a sidebar open,
with all of the other materials.

15
00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:07.022
Including the overview which you
already saw, on frontend masters, and

16
00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:10.770
the different project worksheets
that we'll be working through.

17
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.210
So we're gonna be doing all of our work
in the browser today and Observable and

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.160
I'm gonna explain later how,
how that all works.

19
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.257
Observable is this in browser coding
environment that makes data visualization

20
00:01:22.257 --> 00:01:26.640
really quick and easy, so
that's why we are gonna be using it today.

21
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.966
And yeah, as we go,

22
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:32.022
I will explain everything you
need to know about Observable.

23
00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:36.392
You don't need an Observable account
to do the workshop today, but

24
00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:40.532
if you would like to sign up for
one so that you can save your work,

25
00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:44.150
come back to it later,
you are totally welcome to do so.

26
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.098
Okay, so first of all,
yes again, I am Anjana,

27
00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:55.330
I am visiting here in Minneapolis
from San Francisco where I'm based.

28
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.380
And my experience with data visualization,
really,

29
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.837
I guess started a couple of years ago
when I joined Observable and I learned

30
00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:10.660
a lot about how data visualization can
be really helpful for us as developers.

31
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.566
So that's kind of what
brings me to the field and

32
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.530
that's what I'm gonna be
sharing with you all.

33
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.979
So a couple of years ago was really pretty
brand new to the database space and

34
00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.610
was taking my first steps.

35
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.100
And so that is kind of the journey I would
like to take you along with me on today.

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.843
We're gonna be exploring some basic
fundamentals of databases which hopefully

37
00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:35.526
will stand us in really good shape to go
on and continue deepening our learning.

38
00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:38.468
With things like the really
awesome D3 courses,

39
00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:41.910
that folks like Charlie Wu have
put out on Frontend Masters
