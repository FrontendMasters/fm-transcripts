1
00:00:01.691 --> 00:00:08.015
A high level overview of why as developers
we might care about database and

2
00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:13.421
what the kind of basic steps are,
our first steps, as it were,

3
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.924
from zero to awesome this,
using Observable Plot.

4
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:22.903
And we have gotten to some hands-on
practice by working through those three

5
00:00:22.903 --> 00:00:27.881
projects that led us through the core
concepts of features in the dataset and

6
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:31.878
mapping those two encoding
channels in the visualization.

7
00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:37.811
So visual properties of the output
visualization using scale functions.

8
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.950
We've also talked about aggregating
data with group transforms and

9
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.034
splitting data up with faceting, so that
we can answer the questions we care about.

10
00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:50.244
Sometimes those are higher level and
needs smushing together,

11
00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:53.460
and sometimes those are lower level and
need separating apart.

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.204
And we took a look at adding some
interactivity to our charts to allow our

13
00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.803
users some flexibility with exactly
what data they're looking at.

14
00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:07.564
We also just saw some examples,
some patterns that we can use for

15
00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:12.334
taking our visualizations made
with Plot to the rest of the web.

16
00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:16.587
Whether that be through Observable
notebooks, which we can share, or publish,

17
00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:18.199
or embed in different places.

18
00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:23.059
Or using Plot as a standalone library,
either in Vanilla JS, or

19
00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:27.206
in React, or
other frameworks we can use it in as well.

20
00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:32.181
And now, just to pull things together and
wrap up, let's go through some of

21
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:37.102
the takeaways, hopefully,
that we are leaving today's workshop with.

22
00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:38.785
And some next steps,

23
00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:44.873
things that we can explore to continue
our journey into the world of data vis.

24
00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:49.600
So we saw that data visualization,
as evidenced by some of the sample

25
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.335
data that we looked at in our project,
can help us as web developers.

26
00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:59.909
To get a better understanding of and
improve not only our development workflows

27
00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.917
by looking at how much time we're
wasting waiting for CI tests to pass.

28
00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.512
Also our designs, our user interfaces,

29
00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:12.553
the focus that we're putting on the user
experience for, let's say, folks who

30
00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:17.765
are dialing in to our sites from different
devices, with different resolutions.

31
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:22.120
So by visualizing that data,
we can narrow in on,

32
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.751
[LAUGH] no resolution pun intended there,

33
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:29.484
we can narrow in on
exactly which devices or

34
00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:34.068
viewports are of particular
interest to our users.

35
00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:38.332
We also saw how it can help us get a sense
of sight performance by looking at, for

36
00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:39.700
example, our log data.

37
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.999
And by having those interactive interfaces
to our visualization, we can make

38
00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:50.070
it flexible so that we can really drill
down into the details we care about.

39
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.269
And of course,
there are tons of other applications.

40
00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.856
We heard about some ways that folks are
using data vis in the chat earlier, and

41
00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:58.570
in person.

42
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.840
And so again, if there
are applications that you have seen or

43
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.550
are now thinking of for your day to day as
a developer, please share them with us.

44
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.364
But there are so many different ways
that visualization can be handy.

45
00:03:13.364 --> 00:03:18.370
They go above and beyond just my boss
asked me to put this chart in a dashboard

46
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.468
[LAUGH], although that is also a totally
legit reason to care about data vis.

47
00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:28.428
We saw how to wrangle and visualize
our data with some built-in JavaScript

48
00:03:28.428 --> 00:03:34.424
functionality, like array filter and array
map, super handy for basic data wrangling.

49
00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:37.221
We saw lots of features
of Observable Plot.

50
00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:41.827
And again, you can check out
the documentation to dive into all of

51
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:45.617
the other features that we
didn't get time to cover.

52
00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:49.149
And to look up the API reference for
the different syntax and

53
00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:53.680
features that we saw today, because who
wants to keep all that in your head?

54
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.596
That's what documentation is for.

55
00:03:56.596 --> 00:04:00.719
We also saw how to use Observable
notebooks with their reactive runtime and

56
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.938
the built-in inputs that they offer for
interactivity.

57
00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:09.078
And really quickly at the end,
we saw a couple examples

58
00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:16.584
of how we can recreate that interactivity
in other environments such as React.

59
00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:18.454
And so as we walk away from this course,

60
00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:22.436
I hope we'll be thinking about kind of
the meta level of creating visualizations.

61
00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:24.935
And what we need to be asking ourselves or

62
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:29.057
what we need to be paying attention
to as we do visualization work.

63
00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:33.714
So we need to be, first of all, thinking
about what questions we wanna answer, and

64
00:04:33.714 --> 00:04:36.255
then thinking about how
to wrangle our data.

65
00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:38.933
So how to filter it down or reshape it,

66
00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:43.973
to put it in the most convenient
format for answering those questions.

67
00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:47.772
We need to think about how we are
visualizing that data in the sense of what

68
00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:49.405
types of plots we're making.

69
00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:54.202
Are we making an aggregated plot that
perform some grouping on our data?

70
00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:58.551
Are we looking at individual
data points on, let's say,

71
00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:01.585
a dot plot or
a cell plot as we saw before?

72
00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:05.707
And there are some other marks that
you can use if you dig into the plot

73
00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:09.124
documentation, things like line plots or
area plots.

74
00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:13.163
So you can read more about
those different types of marks,

75
00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:18.777
these different types of plots, and which
use cases they might be a good fit for.

76
00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:23.536
We also need to think about
how we're scaling from our

77
00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:28.400
data values to our display values,
so in other words,

78
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.511
from the input domain of our data space
to the output range of our display space.

79
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:39.851
And we need to, again, think about
whether or not it makes sense based on

80
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:44.620
the particular questions we're trying
to answer to aggregate data together or

81
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.060
facet and split it apart or not, right?

82
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.706
Sometimes just the default is actually
what we need to answer our questions.

83
00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:55.167
So these are some of the things
that we need to think about.

84
00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:59.229
And we also wanna think about in
cases where we are intending this

85
00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.723
visualization for third party users.

86
00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:06.647
What inputs or interactivity might
help them get faster answers to their

87
00:06:06.647 --> 00:06:11.502
questions if we don't know exactly
what those questions are gonna be?

88
00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:16.279
So how can I expose those controls
to my users so that they can get

89
00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.161
the most useful visualization for
their particular question?

90
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:25.684
So there are some further reading
links in the materials, which,

91
00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:29.574
again are all available in
these Observable notebooks.

92
00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:35.169
So there are some posts from the
Observable team as well as the Tableau and

93
00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.480
Netflix teams on kind of high
level data vis concepts and

94
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.611
why developers should care about them.

95
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:46.859
So take a look at some of those if
you're curious on digging more into

96
00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:48.587
the high level of data vis.

97
00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:53.627
And then in terms of the lower level
of how we're actually building these,

98
00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:55.871
lots of great resources for you.

99
00:06:55.871 --> 00:07:00.015
So the Observable team that's behind
pPot has made some great resources.

100
00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:04.809
There are cheatsheets available that you
can either use as observable notebooks,

101
00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:07.618
with interactive little planners,
as it were,

102
00:07:07.618 --> 00:07:11.814
so you can figure out the best plot
syntax that works for your situation.

103
00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:15.738
Or you can print them out as PDFs if
you're into having a physical cheatsheet

104
00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:18.266
next to you as you're
doing your database work.

105
00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:21.477
There are a lot of introductory notebooks,

106
00:07:21.477 --> 00:07:25.486
there are some video tutorials
that the team has done.

107
00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:27.643
So if you wanna get more in depth,
you can check those out.

108
00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:31.761
And, of course, there is the full
API documentation on GitHub.

109
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:35.791
There are some other Frontend Masters
courses that are great follow ups

110
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.420
to these first steps
that we've taken today.

111
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:44.219
So again, the D3 database courses
that Shirley Wu has put together

112
00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:49.524
are in the learning path,
Data Visualization with D3.js.

113
00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:55.115
So plot and D3 kind of complement each
other, where plot is really nice for

114
00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:59.911
that kind of high level quick
exploratory data visualization,

115
00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:03.399
D3 is a really great kind
of follow up to that.

116
00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:08.574
Let's say once you've got the basic idea
of what data you wanna concentrate on and

117
00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:13.224
what data you want to highlight, you
can do that in plot to figure out those

118
00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:15.863
basics, do that exploratory analysis.

119
00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:19.767
And then, let's say, transition to D3 for

120
00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:24.290
a more customized kind of
bespoke fancy animation,

121
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.350
lots of special interaction effects,
things like that.

122
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.927
Visualization that you can create after

123
00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:36.409
having explored what the answers
are to your questions through Plot.

124
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.863
So Plot and
D3 really go nicely hand in hand.

125
00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:43.320
Again, they're from the same creator,
they're intended for different use cases.

126
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.046
So after playing around the Plot for
a while,

127
00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:50.425
if you're curious about going down
to a lower level visualization API,

128
00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:54.980
check out D3.js, some great courses
on Frontend Masters there as well.

129
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.269
There are also some great data vis
courses available on Observable from

130
00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:01.209
the University of Washington.

131
00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:06.894
There's a great series from the Observable
team about time series data specifically.

132
00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:10.230
This is kind of a special case of
databases, where there are certain

133
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.514
considerations that you might not have if
you're dealing with non-time based data.

134
00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:17.547
So highly recommend
checking out that series.

135
00:09:17.547 --> 00:09:20.071
And there are a lot of other tutorials and
examples and

136
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.056
other resources available around
the Observable ecosystem.

137
00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:27.540
Whether you use Observable or not,
there's a lot of really great data

138
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.742
vis examples and
content that you can find there.

139
00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:35.636
And there's also a great conference
called Outlier that has some excellent

140
00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:40.696
past talk recordings that dig into all
kinds of different aspects of data vis.

141
00:09:40.696 --> 00:09:44.843
So take a look at those if you
enjoy the video learning format and

142
00:09:44.843 --> 00:09:49.772
you wanna watch some really great talks
about data vis from some of the folks

143
00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:53.473
who do it all day, every day,
and know the ins and outs.

144
00:09:53.473 --> 00:09:56.185
So that is it for our workshop today.

145
00:09:56.185 --> 00:10:00.028
Huge thank you to everybody for
attending and watching.

146
00:10:00.028 --> 00:10:05.627
And huge thanks to team Observable for
building all these great tools and

147
00:10:05.627 --> 00:10:09.868
for helping out with pulling
this workshop together.

148
00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:13.952
Huge thank you to Mark and
the whole Frontend Masters team for

149
00:10:13.952 --> 00:10:17.569
producing this great series and
these great videos.

150
00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:22.395
And if anybody wants to reach out, you can
find me on Twitter, you can find me on

151
00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:26.510
Observable, you can find me on Github,
around all of the places.

152
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.947
So yes, if you have a questions or

153
00:10:28.947 --> 00:10:34.255
you wanna show off on Twitter
the amazing visualizations you've made,

154
00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:39.840
please do, please tag, and I look
forward to seeing what everybody makes.

155
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.673
Thank you so much.

156
00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:41.559
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
