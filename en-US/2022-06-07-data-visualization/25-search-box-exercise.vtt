00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.471
All right, the next and
last thing that we're gonna do in

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.690
this interactivity project,
is to add a search box.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.282
To allow our users to search for
a particular endpoints path,

4
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:19.111
if they're interested not in a certain
status code, but they're interested

5
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:24.518
in all status codes of response from
requests to a particular endpoint.

6
00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:29.658
So what we're going to do is, use a
convenient little input called the search

7
00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:34.891
input, which analogous to inputs.checkbox
is going to be inputs.search.

8
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:40.164
Which is essentially going
to give us a way to filter

9
00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:48.026
down a data set based on whatever text
is put into that search box by the user.

10
00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:51.026
So the way that this works is,

11
00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:56.558
we're going to pass in some
data to this search input.

12
00:00:56.558 --> 00:01:00.863
Such that, when I type in something here,
for example,

13
00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:04.812
if I'm interested in that
file/search endpoint or

14
00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:08.778
one of the other endpoints
that I'm interested in.

15
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:14.313
I am going to get back a subset of
the data that corresponds to all

16
00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:19.432
rows in the data that matched
with a very kind of generous,

17
00:01:19.432 --> 00:01:23.819
let's say text search
across all the fields, but

18
00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.820
in this case the relevant one
is going to be the path field.

19
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.588
So this search input is gonna search
across all the fields of any data points

20
00:01:34.588 --> 00:01:36.870
that we pass in to this input array.

21
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.168
So what we're going to do is, using our
hands we're going to connect this search

22
00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:51.453
input called path search to the data
that we care about here, our log data.

23
00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:56.963
And then, we are going to again paste
our filtered plot from up here,

24
00:01:56.963 --> 00:02:00.203
and we can drag our check boxes down too.

25
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:05.352
So that both the check boxes and
the search box are connected to

26
00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:10.501
filters on our data set to make
sure that we are only displaying

27
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.767
data that matches all of the inputs
that the user has selected.

28
00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.604
So that is our next and final exercise and

29
00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:24.026
you can take a look at the hint to check
out how that search input works, you can

30
00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:29.714
also click through to the documentation
of the search input for more reference.

31
00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:33.720
And then think about, again,
how to combine filters for

32
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.143
both the search and the checkbox
input to make sure that the data

33
00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:42.920
that we're ultimately visualizing
matches both, so that is our.
