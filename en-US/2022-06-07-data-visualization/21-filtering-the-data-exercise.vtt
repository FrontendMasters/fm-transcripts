00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.375
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna create a checkbox input for

2
00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:09.120
the different status codes that we
find represented in our data set.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.108
And once we've done that,
we're going to hook it up to our plot,

4
00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:20.060
and only display data
from responses that came

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.540
back with those status codes,
if that makes sense.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.915
So first of all,
let's create a checkbox input.

7
00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:34.189
And in the cell below this next to do,
we have kinda the scaffolding for this.

8
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.474
We're gonna give it an array
of possible values, and

9
00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:41.270
then we're going to give it some options,
like for example,

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.361
if we wanna give it a label like
status code, something like that.

11
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.974
And to help you out,
what I've done here in this statusCodes

12
00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:54.948
array is pull out all of the different
statusCodes observed in our

13
00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:58.215
particular little chunk of the logs here.

14
00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:05.810
So you can use this statusCodes array
to help get this checkbox going.

15
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.520
So use the colors example
as a starting point and

16
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.272
see if you can get the checkboxes for
the different status codes working,

17
00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:20.768
so that you can capture those values
in this selectedCodes variable.
