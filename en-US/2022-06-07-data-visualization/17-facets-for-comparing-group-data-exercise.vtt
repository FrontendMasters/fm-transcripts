00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.163
Okay, one more thing to talk about here,
which is before we saw that it can be

2
00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:10.960
useful to smush groups together, aggregate
them using those group transforms.

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.070
Sometimes it can also be
useful to split groups apart.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.050
So in this case,

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.110
we have all of these different dots
kind of right on top of each other.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.041
So it kind of starts to get obscured,
like,

7
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.260
it looks like maybe we have some
other blue or red dots in there.

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.350
We have some kind of red and
blue dots mixed in together.

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.743
It becomes a little bit difficult to see
exactly which device categories are where

10
00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:39.120
because they're all kind of on top
of each other on this one plot.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.916
So as an additional exploration
of our data, what we can do is

12
00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:48.898
separate out those three device groups,
desktop, mobile and

13
00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:53.990
tablet to see if there are any
hidden details that we can reveal.

14
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.393
So what we're gonna do for splitting those
apart is using a concept called facets,

15
00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.860
which we spoke briefly about earlier.

16
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.283
So facets which are also called small
multiples in some cases, these are these

17
00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:15.490
smaller minicharts that essentially
visualize just a subset of the data.

18
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.056
And when we put many of those small
charts together, those small multiples,

19
00:01:20.056 --> 00:01:25.115
we can compare different subsets of
the data set that we're interested in.

20
00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:30.017
So in this case, our data set naturally
lends itself to these three kinds of nice

21
00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:34.792
little subsets, the desktop devices,
the mobile devices and the tablets.

22
00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:40.530
And so what we're going to do is use
plot to tell it with its notion of

23
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.832
faceting to split this dot plot up,
this type of plot that we have here.

24
00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:51.307
We're gonna tell plot to split it up
into three smaller plots, each one,

25
00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:54.278
corresponding to one of
the device categories.

26
00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:59.272
Okay, so the syntax for
specifying facets in plots

27
00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:04.276
is that when we make our
call to that .plot method.

28
00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:08.961
In addition to all of our settings for
the different scales and

29
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:13.570
the margins and other kinds of
layout properties like that.

30
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.379
We can specify a facet object,
facet property which then we

31
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.488
give as a value an object,
which has a couple of main features.

32
00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:29.668
So one is that we're gonna tell plot which
data we want it to be faceting based on.

33
00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:34.160
In this case, it's gonna be the same
data that we're using to draw our plot.

34
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.393
There might be cases where you want to
split up data in your plot based on some

35
00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:42.112
other corresponding data, but
in this case it's the same data.

36
00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:46.108
And then we want to tell
plot which property

37
00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:51.104
in the data we want to use as
the splitting property and

38
00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.779
which channel we want to split across.

39
00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:58.539
So for example if I want
to split across vertically,

40
00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:03.410
if I wanna make vertical facets here
that will be the wide channel and

41
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.611
then the name of whatever feature
I want to split based on.

42
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:12.611
So what we're gonna do in our
next exercise is trying to make

43
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.520
some faceted plots out of
the .plot that we just created.

44
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.170
So I'm just gonna copy this one into here.

45
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.357
So you all can copy.

46
00:03:22.357 --> 00:03:25.297
I'm copying my solution, but

47
00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:31.175
you can copy whatever your solution
was into this cell here and

48
00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:35.719
then modify it to add
facets using this syntax.

49
00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.550
So it's up to you which way
you wanna split things.

50
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.180
You can play around with it and
see what feels best.

51
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.070
But what we wanna do is use the device
type as the faceting feature.
