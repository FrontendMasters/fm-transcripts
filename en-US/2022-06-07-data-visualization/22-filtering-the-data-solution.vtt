00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.699
So again,

2
00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.680
this is just kind of a convention of
the way these observable inputs work.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.304
But if we are building our plot
visualizations, and observable,

4
00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:09.412
it's super handy.

5
00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:10.486
I hope you agree.

6
00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:12.350
So let's take a look here.

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.093
All right, so what we want the values of
the checkboxes to be, are essentially all

8
00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:21.974
of the possible status codes one might be
able to select from our data, which again,

9
00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:24.350
I had already parsed into an array here.

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.982
Just by going through the data and
pulling out all the status codes, so

11
00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:35.280
we can replace for the options array,
instead of nothing or an empty array.

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.970
We can just drop in that
status codes value.

13
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.330
So now we've got some check boxes.

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.290
Excellent.

15
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.402
But the other thing that would be cool,
well first of all,

16
00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.444
let's label this like we saw before.

17
00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:53.230
The status or status code or
whatever you want.

18
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.583
The other thing in the text here
that you might have noticed is,

19
00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:04.342
it would be useful if instead of
starting out with no data selected,

20
00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:08.197
we started out with all
of the data selected.

21
00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:13.250
And in the hints you may have
come across this so there is or

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.621
if you checked out the documentation
of the checkbox input,

23
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:25.170
there is another option I can add here
which is to put in the value of these.

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.307
Of the selected check boxes which
is essentially going to be an array

25
00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:33.273
of the values that we want,

26
00:01:33.273 --> 00:01:37.990
similar to how before we got an array
of the selected colours out.

27
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.262
So if I specify that in the options then
those will be essentially the default

28
00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:43.609
values for this input.

29
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.278
So here, if I want everything
to be checked by default,

30
00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:55.082
what I can do is just pass
in that same status codes

31
00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:59.760
array as the value for
this input by default.

32
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.280
And then we'll see once I reevaluate that,
all of the checkboxes, start out checked.

33
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.256
And as I unselect things,
we'll see them disappear from that

34
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:16.614
selected codes array,
which now gives me this reactive reference

35
00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:21.320
to whatever the user wants to
care about status code wise.

36
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.230
Cool.

37
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.600
Any questions, feel free to bring them up.

38
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.700
But I'm seeing nods.

39
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.480
I hopefully folks are following
along in the chat.

40
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.521
So let us now take these check boxes and

41
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:41.986
make them actually change
the visualization shall we.

42
00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:48.407
So first of all, another fun thing about
receivable mail books is, if you click and

43
00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:54.279
drag on it's three dots next to SL,
without little mickey mouse hand icon,

44
00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.430
you can drag SL wow to
a totally different work space.

45
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.390
Just kidding, you can maybe nope, drag
a cell down further in the notebook for

46
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.814
some reason this particular
setup does not want me to, but

47
00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:12.380
hopefully on your own okay, here we go.

48
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.332
So you can drag a cell and move it down
to, let's say above this next to do,

49
00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:22.666
so that we can have a little
bit closer relationship.

50
00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:27.218
Now in observable notebooks,
the order of cells does not matter at all.

51
00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:32.930
The reactive runtime just looks at which
cells depend on which other cells.

52
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.400
So that's all it cares about.

53
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.080
So you can put them in
whatever order you want.

54
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.654
So we are going to go ahead and

55
00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:46.778
put this check box right
above the cell for

56
00:03:46.778 --> 00:03:50.595
our code in the next exercise.

57
00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:54.987
Also, you may have also seen a filtered
cell there that is extraneous and

58
00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:57.516
we don't need to care about it right now.
