>> Our next to do is to only plot data that corresponds to the selected status codes. So this is going to show us the power of these inputs is that they allow the viewer to decide what data they care about. So, sometimes we make that decision for whoever's looking at the visualization.

[00:00:18]
Sometimes it's us, so we know what we care about. But other times, especially if we're building dashboards for other people to use, we don't know exactly what they're going to be drilling into and so giving folks the option can be really powerful technique. So what we are going to do is take our dot plat from before, scroll up or we can grab the solution from the solution button, we're just going to control C it or command C.

[00:00:47]
And come down and paste it in to this cell right here. And now what we're going to do, is we are going to connect this plot to the checkboxes that we just set up with this selected codes value, the array of checked values. We are going to filter the data coming into our plot to make sure that it only displays data that fits the selected status codes.

So that is your next mission should you choose to except it, should you not you can go get a coffee. No, just kidding. [LAUGH] We're all going to do it. And again, we can use our handy dandy good old friend dot filter to filter down the whole set of API log data to make sure that it only actually plots data that passes the check against these checkboxes, check puns.

[00:01:44]
So [LAUGH] Already, there are some hints but there are a few different ways that you can tackle this. So let's give it a shot and see what we got
