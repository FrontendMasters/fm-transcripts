1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.100
Are there any best practices for
building visualizations that use colors?

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.857
The very first graph you showed often
seem to be very friendly to people of

3
00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:08.850
color blindness.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.380
With all the greens and reds.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.210
&gt;&gt; That is a great point and
hence why I mentioned that.

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.546
So what we're gonna look at today,
and our first project actually,

7
00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:23.999
we're going to look at using
color to convey meaning.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.726
And when we're thinking
about accessibility,

9
00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:33.100
we definitely want to be using
colors that can be flexible to

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.480
folks with different visual
perception systems, right?

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.178
So what we're gonna explore in our
first hands on project that we're

12
00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:46.471
gonna tackle shortly,
is how to customize the color values for

13
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:51.250
a visualization, using the grammar
of graphics based visualization

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.987
library that we're gonna
dig into here today, plot.

15
00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:59.311
And through that we're gonna look at
a couple different examples of color

16
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:04.333
palettes, but in terms of making sure that
you choose colors that are appropriate for

17
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.253
your use case.

18
00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:09.575
And that might be for example,
considering accessibility for your users,

19
00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.690
it might be considering
things like brand colors.

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.331
If you're building something for
a particular company,

21
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:21.455
whatever the use case, you'll be able to
see how to put in a custom color palette,

22
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.370
to adapt the visualization to your needs.

23
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.390
Yeah.

24
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.480
&gt;&gt; Patrick in chat says,
I write data visualization for healthcare.

25
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.820
It's crazy how much of what you said
about performance aligns with the reasons

26
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.190
why we build visualizations regarding
people's vital health data.

27
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.605
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
Yeah, and I think the healthcare field and

28
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:45.377
understanding visualizations
in healthcare data,

29
00:01:45.377 --> 00:01:50.316
I think the last couple of years have
shown all of us all over the world,

30
00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:56.380
just how important and informative looking
at health data under a visual lens can be.

31
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.085
I mean, I don't know about you all but

32
00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.760
I've probably looked at more
charts in the last few years.

33
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.396
Not just because I was working in
database but because we were all tracking

34
00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:10.059
Coronavirus spikes and hospital
occupation stats and all of that stuff.

35
00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.990
So absolutely, really great use case,
great point and

36
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.184
we would love to hear more about
those examples in the chat.

37
00:02:18.184 --> 00:02:18.920
Yeah.

38
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.115
&gt;&gt; Front of masters we have
a metrics dashboard that

39
00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:30.586
of course shows usage and
revenue and all that kind of stuff.

40
00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:33.163
We have a bunch of
different visualizations,

41
00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:36.010
but example that I really
like is Apple Watch data.

42
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.753
How they're always continuously
like surfacing new charts and

43
00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:44.190
data, it's like I find
a new one all the time.

44
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.015
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:50.002
And being able to kind of just like
instantly understand how many steps

46
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:55.073
you've been getting in the, [LAUGH]
last week, or how different in this

47
00:02:55.073 --> 00:03:00.074
case courses on a platform or
perhaps it's different pages on a site.

48
00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:04.862
Looking at analytics around traffic and
revenue and things like that.

49
00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:10.392
This is why folks are often tasked
with building metrics dashboards for

50
00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.352
these bespoke customized use cases.

51
00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:17.803
Because having a single place where you
can go to kind of get the most updated

52
00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:20.850
insights and patterns, is super valuable.

53
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.730
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Then Michael in chat says,

54
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.280
my previous job was for
a central office of a retail company.

55
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.950
We did lots of visualizations for
product data.

56
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.140
How things were selling, how things
would mysteriously disappear, etc.

57
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.792
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure, exactly, yeah.

58
00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:40.214
I think any application such as retail
where there's a lot of complexity,

59
00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:43.441
there's a lot of different
things moving around, and

60
00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:48.002
trying to track all of that in just a kind
of a spreadsheet or a database table or

61
00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:52.670
something like that, it's gonna get
overwhelming really quickly, right?

62
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.672
So being able to pull it into
dashboards and see visually,

63
00:03:56.672 --> 00:04:01.817
instantly at a glance, what is happening,
how things are moving around or

64
00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:05.918
evaporating around I guess,
[LAUGH] can be super valuable.

65
00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:11.430
And again, why in a whole bunch of
different fields, the notion of having to

66
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.394
build a dashboard whatever the application
is, is kind of a very common use case.

67
00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:18.213
Yeah.

68
00:04:18.213 --> 00:04:22.856
&gt;&gt; And then Leo in chat says, I read
a book called Enlightenment Now which

69
00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:26.740
advocates a data driven
analysis of human progress.

70
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.562
The book shows and comments on
examples from this excellent website

71
00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:34.470
they link to is ourworldanddata.org.

72
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, our world in data.

73
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.039
I think I've come across that once or
twice before that's really cool.

74
00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.226
And definitely there are so
many really interesting sights and

75
00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:50.680
kind of aggregations of I would say sort
of envelope pushing data visualization.

76
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.054
Sometimes that's a matter of
getting your hands on data that is

77
00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:55.455
kind of unconventional or

78
00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:59.542
tells some interesting story that you
wouldn't usually get to hear about.

79
00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:05.557
So for example looking at data around
human progress that could be mind blowing,

80
00:05:05.557 --> 00:05:06.480
you know?

81
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.296
And I think that there are a lot of really
great resources on folks who are building.

82
00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:18.173
As we said before these kinds of cutting
edge visualizations that sometimes go even

83
00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:22.911
past the notion of analysis to things like
art or sort of displaying things in such

84
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:27.649
a visually compelling way that it really
grabs the viewers attention and can help

85
00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.547
call attention to important things like
for example climate change data, right?

86
00:05:32.547 --> 00:05:38.986
Being able to show folks, look at how
far off the scale this slide is going or

87
00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:44.406
what have you, can really help us
affect change in the world and

88
00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.614
get the progress that we want to see made,
made.

89
00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:49.320
Awesome.

90
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.745
Well, thank you so much.

91
00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:52.578
Those are awesome examples and

92
00:05:52.578 --> 00:05:55.971
sounds like we got some great
links going around in chat.

93
00:05:55.971 --> 00:06:00.390
And at the end of the day today I'll
also leave y'all with some other kind of

94
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.392
further reading links, that hopefully
will point you in some other

95
00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:09.025
interesting directions to find out more
about kind of the deep, deep, deep,

96
00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:14.585
wild, wide field of databases and all of
the amazing applications it has, yeah.

97
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:19.295
&gt;&gt; And last one in chat Sondra says, he's
a lawyer with a background in software

98
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:24.880
development and wants to implement data
visualization in their work as a lawyer.

99
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.867
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
Okay, yeah.

100
00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:29.850
So I'm sure there are tons of applications
in the legal field to look at.

101
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.334
I don't know how different
cases are processed,

102
00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:35.834
I do not know anything about the legal
field, [LAUGH] I'll have to say.

103
00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:39.579
But essentially what we're gonna cover
today are really just some very basic

104
00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:40.510
building blocks.

105
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.940
Again, this is first steps, right?

106
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.687
We're taking our first steps with
understanding some core notions of

107
00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:51.837
database, some of these core building
blocks of thinking about the way that

108
00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:56.919
we express features of data as features
of the visual pixels on our screen.

109
00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.228
And that is going to be something that
what we're gonna dig into today is how to

110
00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:05.941
essentially customize your visualization
so that you're not just using these kind

111
00:07:05.941 --> 00:07:08.421
of out of the box bar charts or
what have you.

112
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.855
But so that you can build
the visualization that you need to answer

113
00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:14.166
the questions that you're interested in,

114
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:18.164
because each of us is gonna be interested
in slightly different datasets and

115
00:07:18.164 --> 00:07:21.610
have slightly different
questions about those datasets.

116
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.190
So that is kind of our high level goal for
today,

117
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.292
is to set ourselves up with some key
concepts and a very flexible high

118
00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:36.022
level tool observable plot, which we're
gonna talk about most of the day,

119
00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:39.805
to set up some exploratory
data visualizations.

120
00:07:39.805 --> 00:07:43.653
And then that should stand us
in good shape to go on and

121
00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:47.599
dig even deeper with lower
level libraries like D3.
