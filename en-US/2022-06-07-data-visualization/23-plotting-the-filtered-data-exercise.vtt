00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.770
Our next to do is to only plot data that
corresponds to the selected status codes.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.862
So this is going to show us the power of
these inputs is that they allow the viewer

3
00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:13.940
to decide what data they care about.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.860
So, sometimes we make that decision for
whoever's looking at the visualization.

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.370
Sometimes it's us, so
we know what we care about.

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.732
But other times, especially if
we're building dashboards for

7
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:29.275
other people to use, we don't know exactly
what they're going to be drilling into and

8
00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:33.510
so giving folks the option can
be really powerful technique.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.984
So what we are going to do is
take our dot plat from before,

10
00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:42.926
scroll up or we can grab the solution
from the solution button,

11
00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:47.440
we're just going to control C it or
command C.

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.635
And come down and
paste it in to this cell right here.

13
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.152
And now what we're going to do,

14
00:00:54.152 --> 00:00:59.186
is we are going to connect this
plot to the checkboxes that we just

15
00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:04.609
set up with this selected codes value,
the array of checked values.

16
00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:09.521
We are going to filter the data
coming into our plot to make sure

17
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:15.100
that it only displays data that
fits the selected status codes.

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.224
So that is your next mission
should you choose to except it,

19
00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.550
should you not you can go get a coffee.

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.500
No, just kidding.

21
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.940
[LAUGH] We're all going to do it.

22
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.791
And again,
we can use our handy dandy good old friend

23
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:33.863
dot filter to filter down
the whole set of API log data to

24
00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:38.825
make sure that it only actually
plots data that passes

25
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:44.080
the check against these checkboxes,
check puns.

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.461
So [LAUGH] Already,
there are some hints but

27
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:49.830
there are a few different ways
that you can tackle this.

28
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.570
So let's give it a shot and
see what we got
