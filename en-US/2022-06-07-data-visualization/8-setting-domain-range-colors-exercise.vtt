00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.059
Okay, let's take a look here at how
we can configure the domain and

2
00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:09.988
range of a scale, in this case color
to customize the way our values

3
00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:14.850
are expressed through one
of our encoding channels.

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.209
So in this case, we have some default
colors being applied as the automatic

5
00:00:20.209 --> 00:00:25.482
mappings from the range of values that
we have in our conclusion field, in

6
00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:31.462
our data set, which if you scroll back up
to our little table at the beginning here.

7
00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:35.976
If you scroll through, you'll see that
we essentially have three different

8
00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:40.380
values that we find in the data set,
success, failure, and canceled.

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.699
So that is essentially our domain
of values in our data space.

10
00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.796
And all we need to do in terms of
overriding the domain here is to make

11
00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:57.529
sure that we know what order plot
is receiving those values and

12
00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:02.630
because they're not numerical
continuous values, they're not

13
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.820
kind of values that have any obvious
order so we just need to choose one.

14
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.676
So if we open the hint box we'll see
that the way we configure the domain and

15
00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:20.439
range is perhaps as one might gather
we specify the properties domain and

16
00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.570
range and
we give each one an array of values.

17
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.680
So in this case our domain, let's just put
them in an order that we can deal with.

18
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.194
So I'll have success,
be kind of the ideal state so

19
00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:36.874
that'll come first,
failure will come second, and

20
00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:41.650
then canceled will be the kind of
last one as hopefully an exception.

21
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.444
So, this is how I set up my domain and if
I evaluate here, Shift Enter, I'll notice

22
00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:51.554
that my colors stay the same but kind
of swap around, which already tells me

23
00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:57.350
that plot defaults, we're looking at these
values in a different order in the domain.

24
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.177
So now we know what order
plot is seeing them in, and

25
00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:04.027
now if I override the range property,

26
00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:09.090
I can put in three corresponding
colors to match my domain values.

27
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.230
Again, this is completely up to us.

28
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.582
So let's just use some kind of not
ideal not super accessible defaults and

29
00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:21.690
I would love to hear in the chat what
other palettes folks chose to use.

30
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.009
But let's say success maps to green,
failure maps to red, and

31
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.470
canceled we could use yellow, we could
use gray, why don't we just go ahead and

32
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.873
make it gray because canceled sort
of means it's not a salient so

33
00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:38.757
let's have it fade into the background.

34
00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:43.130
I always forget if it's E-Y or
A-Y let's find out, E-Y seems to work.

35
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.209
So, again if we wanted to change this
we can put whatever colors we want in

36
00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.181
there yellow for canceled for example or
I could change all of the these.

37
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.519
So this is completely up to us,
we've now seen for

38
00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.014
the color scale particularly but
this extends to all

39
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:05.872
of the other scales as well how to
override the default domain and range.

40
00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:10.531
So the default input values
the range of these, sorry,

41
00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:16.679
the domain of input values that the plot
is going to actually visualize and

42
00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:23.665
then the output range of values that
plot is going to map those inputs on to.

43
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:26.441
Questions, comments, concerns?

44
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.821
Okay, pressing on.

45
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:35.678
In our next exercise we're going
to add a new feature from our data

46
00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:37.730
set into our plot.

47
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.611
So so far we've got the status,
the kind of the conclusion status

48
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:47.600
visualized with color, but
we have more information in the data.

49
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.156
So if we scroll back up to our dataset,
we see we also have a minutes column here,

50
00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:55.284
which essentially tells us
how many minutes it took for

51
00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:57.800
this test to conclude or
to finish running.

52
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.735
And so we're gonna visualize that
now using a different channel

53
00:04:03.735 --> 00:04:08.261
because we've already got on
the Fill channel we've already got

54
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.240
our conclusion feature visualized.

55
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.867
So that means we're going to need to
pick a different channel to visualize

56
00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:16.640
a different property of the data.

57
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.438
In this case,

58
00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:22.620
we're gonna use the Fill opacity channel
to visualize that duration in minutes.

59
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.322
Right now our plot answers
the question did each test pass or

60
00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:32.780
what was the conclusion status for
each test?

61
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.491
Now we're gonna make it
answer both that question and

62
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.710
the question how long
did it take to conclude?

63
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.811
So that is our next exercise and

64
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:47.243
after we answer the question how
long did each test take in minutes,

65
00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:52.720
we're also going to notice that some
of the tests have a duration of zero.

66
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.073
So that means that if our opacity
channel is mapped to zero and

67
00:04:56.073 --> 00:04:59.930
we have an opacity of zero,
it means it doesn't show up at all.

68
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.597
We won't be able to see the status,
the conclusion failure,

69
00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:07.213
success, cancellation status.

70
00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:12.289
So, in order to get around that
problem as Part B of this exercise,

71
00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.099
we're going to also add a new channel

72
00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.560
to color the outline of each
cell based on the conclusion.

73
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.961
So, essentially we're gonna duplicate our
visualization using the Fill channel,

74
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:28.936
into the channel that corresponds
to the outline of each cell,

75
00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:34.140
which you can scroll up or check out
the hints to remember the name of.

76
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.080
So this is your task is to
add some more mappings here.
