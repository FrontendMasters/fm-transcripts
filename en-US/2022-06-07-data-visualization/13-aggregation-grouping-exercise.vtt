00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.765
So we've just walked through this code for
this very basic

2
00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:09.990
aggregation to make these vertical
bar charts based on the number

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.140
of observations in the data set for
each of these device categories.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.072
And we saw that we can do this
with the groupX transform function

5
00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:25.166
combined with the barY mark
to make vertical bars and

6
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:30.193
that we're putting the inputs to
this groupX transform as being

7
00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:35.218
the device category which we're
going to put along the x axis and

8
00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:40.056
then the output of that group
transform is going to be the count

9
00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:44.850
meaning the number of observation and
counted altogether.

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.217
And that's going to be output as
the height of each bar on the y axis,

11
00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:50.770
which is why we get bars
of different heights here.

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.316
However, this is not maybe the most useful
information, the count of observations

13
00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:02.190
in our data set is probably not what
we're ultimately super interested in.

14
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.247
What we're interested in is is probably
the number of users that are using each of

15
00:01:06.247 --> 00:01:07.670
those device categories.

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.325
So, let's try to adapt this chart to see
the breakdown by the total number of

17
00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.260
users rather than
the number of observations.

18
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.460
That's gonna be our first exercise here.

19
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.462
So in this empty cell right here,
we're going to

20
00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:28.550
start with this grouped
bar chart as an example.

21
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.422
So you could just copy that over and

22
00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:36.476
then we're going to tweak that
code to specify that the group

23
00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:41.750
transform should be calculating
the sum of the users' value.

24
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.130
And visualizing that on the y axis.

25
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.810
So that means that we're gonna need to
pass in as one of the inputs to that

26
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.220
group, transform.

27
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.000
We're gonna need to pass in the column
of data that we care about summing.

28
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.970
So in this case,
that's gonna be the user's column.

29
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.340
And then as a bonus extra credit exercise.

30
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.340
See if you can also figure out how to get
the color of each of the three bars to

31
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.021
be different to distinguish visually
that these are three different

32
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.450
categories of device.

33
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.136
So feel free to lean on those hints there
to get things rolling because this is

34
00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:25.845
a kind of a new skill that we're learning
here with these group transforms.

35
00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:30.345
And again we can use this previous
group to chart as a starting point, so

36
00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:35.300
you can copy that in and then make some
tweaks and feel free to lean on the hints.
