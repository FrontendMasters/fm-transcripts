1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.958
I'm gonna undo these cuz we don't need
to do that, this part is fantastic,

2
00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:05.005
this is kind of like where
the magic happens, okay?

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.939
Everyone ready for the magic to happen?

4
00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.721
All right, I've done a couple things,
first, I've created a private file.

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.324
You're not allowed to see what's
in that private's file, okay?

6
00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:16.350
It contains some information.

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.793
So I'm gonna just simply source
the private file, awesome.

8
00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:22.745
I now have some
environmental keys in here.

9
00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:27.674
I have a key to a provider that runs
on a test network, it's called Alchemy,

10
00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:29.842
if you've ever been to Alchemy.

11
00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:33.233
Alchemy effectively, let's say,
okay, might expose them.

12
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.860
I dox myself all the time, so
it effectively provides a way

13
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.533
into the network, and you need a way
to provide yourself into the network.

14
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.047
Now what you could do is you
could use a thing called Geth and

15
00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:49.067
actually create an Ethereum node
that connects to a real network on

16
00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.668
your machine and make requests yourself.

17
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.200
Well, I don't do that, instead,

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.074
most people just simply use
a provider that's already out there.

19
00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:58.923
There's one called Alchemy,
there's another one called Infura,

20
00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:00.703
you can find out a bunch
of different ones.

21
00:01:00.703 --> 00:01:03.663
Alchemy seems to be a pretty popular one,
so I just chose that.

22
00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:10.134
So I have an Alchemy key and then I also
have a Rinkeby private account or wallet.

23
00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:14.873
So if we look at right here, if I open up
my MetaMask, you'll notice that I have,

24
00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:19.150
let's switch over to Rinkeby, and
you'll notice that I have this one.

25
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.056
I have a decent amount of Rinkeby,
I actually had someone try to pay me for

26
00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.070
some of the Rinkeby when
it was really hard to get.

27
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.151
I almost made money off of fake money,
I mean, even faker money than fake money,

28
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:29.365
it was like super fake.

29
00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.727
And it was very fantastic,
I was very excited about it.

30
00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:36.774
But there we go, I have some fake
Ether on a network called Rinkeby.

31
00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:41.674
Which means now that I've sourced, I have
those private key informations inside

32
00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:46.512
of here, I'm gonna cat out one thing
from something behind me, what is it?

33
00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:50.117
Yeah, rinkeby.json,
I knew that, rinkeby.json.

34
00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:53.009
I'm gonna copy this little piece of code,
you guys don't need to do

35
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.970
this cuz obviously you haven't set
up all the accounts and all that.

36
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.369
I'm gonna copy this, I'm gonna go to our
hardhat config and under our networks,

37
00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.361
I'm gonna include this, rinkeby.

38
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:06.402
This is how you communicate with Rinkeby.

39
00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:10.055
Now notice we still have everything
else the same, I'm just saying, hey,

40
00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:14.240
here's the URL to the provider, here's the
list of accounts that you're gonna use.

41
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.363
So instead of having our 20 hydrated
accounts from the local network,

42
00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:22.701
I'm now providing the list of accounts for
it to use by using my private key.

43
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.930
And so there we go,
we have these two things right here.

44
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.144
I'm gonna do this now,

45
00:02:26.144 --> 00:02:29.259
this is where things are gonna
get a little bit interesting.

46
00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.017
Just so I don't screw myself like I did
last night, I'm also gonna go like this,

47
00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.910
console.log(counter.address).

48
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.951
I'm gonna print my address cuz if you
forget to print your address, well,

49
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.115
I can't contact it.

50
00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.203
So then you have to deploy it again.

51
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:47.005
So now that we've done that, I'm gonna go
npx hardhat, I'm gonna launch my counter

52
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.555
but this time, I'm gonna erase
localhost and put in rinkeby.

53
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.088
There we go.

54
00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:56.612
We are now putting it onto an actual
test net that will exist tomorrow,

55
00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:58.775
this contract will go on and live forever.

56
00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:03.246
Now it's gonna take a little bit longer
than our previous items because it's

57
00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:07.591
actually contacting something that's
not just simply on our localhost.

58
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:08.606
So it has to go through all this stuff.

59
00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:13.580
There we go, I got an address out,
pretty exciting, right?

60
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.886
At least I'm pretty excited.

61
00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:16.523
Also notice something kind of funny.

62
00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:21.927
Our counter is zero, last time we
did that, our counter was one, why?

63
00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:26.867
Cuz we were doing a node request to
a node that existed on our machine and

64
00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:32.762
we were able to catch state's transition
because it could happen in a single step.

65
00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:34.377
Now we're on a real network,

66
00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:38.071
state transitions don't happen
in a single step anymore, right?

67
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:39.713
So it takes longer, all right?

68
00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:41.376
So now we do that fun game again.

69
00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:44.691
I'm going to the environment,
erasing that, putting in our new one,

70
00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.913
go to webpack, kill that,
relaunch webpack.

71
00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:49.157
And as this thing launches,
it'll take a second.

72
00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:51.278
I go here, we are now at one.

73
00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:52.537
Also notice that it took a second.

74
00:03:52.537 --> 00:03:54.442
Do you see that kinda
how it took a moment?

75
00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.719
We're now out there contacting it.

76
00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.929
And how are we contacting Rinkeby?

77
00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:04.013
It's cuz I took MetaMask and I set it
to the Rinkeby network, that is it.

78
00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:07.290
So notice we didn't change
any of our frontend code.

79
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.445
I'm going to increment it,
it's now running on somewhere else.

80
00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.867
We have the wrong account hooked up to it,
so

81
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:17.326
this exciting part just got a little bit
less exciting, not so happy about that.

82
00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:20.079
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go here, I am gonna take this,

83
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.466
I'm gonna connect to my network.

84
00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:24.441
There we go, connected,
beautiful, awesome, do that.

85
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:26.193
I'm gonna refresh it just in case.

86
00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.625
Let's increment this thing,
and there we go, we have this.

87
00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:32.760
We're gonna confirm the transaction,
and now we're going to wait.

88
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.902
So this transaction is happening
on a real test network.

89
00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:37.200
We could go to Ether scan,

90
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.273
we could actually find this
information on Ether scan for it.

91
00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:44.015
So it has happened and
we just got the increment right there.

92
00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:46.041
So we actually, look at that,
look how sweet that is.

93
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.890
Okay, I think this is the coolest part.

94
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.774
I don't see very many smiles or
cheers or gasps, but this was awesome.

95
00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.615
We went from our machine
all the way out into the,

96
00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:56.773
I don't know where Rinkeby exists.

97
00:04:56.773 --> 00:04:58.966
It exists in a decentralized way, right?

98
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.888
On hundreds of machines out in the world.

99
00:05:00.888 --> 00:05:05.146
And we just put that state changing
transaction that will live effectively

100
00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:08.539
forever as long as Rinkeby does
that will be there forever.

101
00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.780
You in a year from now, if it's still up,
can take this contract address and

102
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.517
increment it for fun, right?

103
00:05:14.517 --> 00:05:17.634
If someone's at home doing it right now,
if they're fast enough to do it,

104
00:05:17.634 --> 00:05:21.108
they would probably increment it in front
of me and it would start going up, right?

105
00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.670
That's how awesome this is,
is that it actually worked.

106
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.906
We actually launched it somewhere else and
changed nothing about our frontend,

107
00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:33.843
because the provider is what abstracts
that communication to the network.

108
00:05:33.843 --> 00:05:36.980
Okay, well, I mean,
I thought that was awesome.

109
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.861
So I can paste in the contract address.

110
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:41.156
If anyone wants to increment it,
we'll come back and

111
00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:42.592
see how many increments we have.

112
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:46.361
It's on the Rinkeby network, so
you'll have to have a Rinkeby account.

113
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.546
You'll obviously,
have to be able to write that deploy code.

114
00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:54.154
Kind of good little exercise to not
deploy it, but to just simply talk to it,

115
00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:55.962
do all that kind of fun thing.

116
00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:59.974
There's a lot we just did here,
is there any specific questions?

117
00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:04.567
&gt;&gt; Can you in Ethereum contract,
it can really just have any

118
00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:09.544
arbitrary effect on anything,
then it doesn't necessarily

119
00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:14.726
have to do with monetary transactions or
moving Ethers around?

120
00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:16.220
&gt;&gt; That is exactly right.

121
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.116
That's why I'm so excited about this,
cuz right now it's hyper inefficient,

122
00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:22.489
it's not that great.

123
00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:25.035
Every technology that's
ever been introduced,

124
00:06:25.035 --> 00:06:26.981
its first version has always sucked.

125
00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:28.605
That's just the reality of the life,
right?

126
00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:32.351
I mean, think about cell phones, they
weren't that awesome, they got awesome,

127
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:33.699
they've been more awesome.

128
00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.326
First Internet, who had 14.4, right?

129
00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:37.915
Who had the dial-up sounds, right?

130
00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:41.990
That sucked, but
it was awesome at the exact same time.

131
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.619
And so the same thing with this,
is it's super expensive,

132
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.918
it's ridiculously expensive,
it's not worth it at all expensive.

133
00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:52.803
It needs to come down by
at least 1,000 fold for

134
00:06:52.803 --> 00:06:56.104
it to be even partially useful
in any sort of real context.

135
00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:58.574
But we're not doing
anything with JPEG art,

136
00:06:58.574 --> 00:07:01.570
we're not doing anything
with moving Ethers around.

137
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.219
We're just simply creating functionality
and using it like AWS Lambda.

138
00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.978
And that is what's really cool about this,
is that it's a decentralized

139
00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:15.834
censorship resistant network in which
you can put things up that execute.

140
00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:19.133
And to me, that's a pretty novel or
neat idea.

141
00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:20.907
Now, will it pan out in the future?

142
00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:24.498
Like I said, I have no strong stance
either way cuz I can't read into

143
00:07:24.498 --> 00:07:27.590
the future, but
I just think it's a very exciting thing.

144
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.247
And so, hopefully, you're feeling that
excitement kinda rise cuz that's how I

145
00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:33.420
felt at this point when
I launched onto Rinkeby,

146
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.225
cuz I originally wasn't gonna do that.

147
00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:38.584
But I thought, okay, I'm gonna give it
just a quick try, maybe it'll work out,

148
00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:39.521
this was two days ago.

149
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:42.084
And I just did it first try and
I was like, holy shit,

150
00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:45.072
that really worked way easier
than I thought it was going to.

151
00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:48.069
Cuz every time I've done Rinkeby
before that, it was always I had so

152
00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.183
much setup and all that.

153
00:07:49.183 --> 00:07:52.755
But now that I'm just slightly familiar
with it, just blazed right through and

154
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:55.007
it worked, and I was like,
wow, that was sweet.

155
00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.458
All right, Mark.

156
00:07:56.458 --> 00:08:02.327
&gt;&gt; So Alchemy provisions a node for you
to use, does that cost anything to use?

157
00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:03.809
&gt;&gt; There's the free to use plan,

158
00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:07.409
it has quite a few cycles on the free
to use plan, so I just use that, right?

159
00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:11.399
Eventually, yes, you will have to pay for
any provider as you become a larger and

160
00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.174
larger place.

161
00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:15.463
If you were to try to launch something
that does a lot of transactions,

162
00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:18.999
that does a lot of testing, you will
eventually have to pay for something.

163
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:22.108
But for now, easy to use,
free first using little bits.

164
00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:26.540
It's kind like the lowest plan on Heroku,
exact same thing.

165
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.619
&gt;&gt; So
nobody can stop us from counting now?

166
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:32.519
&gt;&gt; No one,
nobody can stop us from counting.

167
00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:36.819
[LAUGH] It'll be censorship forever.

168
00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:41.075
There we go, let me go over to this thing,
and I'll throw in that,

169
00:08:41.075 --> 00:08:42.761
there we go, fantastic.

170
00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:46.479
By the way, there's the Rinkeby address
to our contract, you can call account.

171
00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:50.590
If you want to do that just put it
in the chat, you can always do this.

172
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.153
There we go, that's the interface.

173
00:08:52.153 --> 00:08:55.618
If you just wanna use that,
you should be able to start up in Ethers.

174
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.994
Plug that little interface in there,
do that address, and

175
00:08:58.994 --> 00:09:01.098
just start calling it if you want to.

176
00:09:01.098 --> 00:09:05.325
&gt;&gt; Is there a linter or
anything like that for those interfaces?

177
00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:08.442
&gt;&gt; So those interfaces,
that's why I just use hardhat,

178
00:09:08.442 --> 00:09:10.758
they generate those interfaces for me.

179
00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:12.024
But on the other side,

180
00:09:12.024 --> 00:09:16.165
I don't know if there is something
that does it from the TypeScript side.

181
00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:18.151
I'm sure because, I mean,
let's just be real here.

182
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:21.250
If you look at the code,
let's see, what is it?

183
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.059
It's artifacts, this, there we go.

184
00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:26.699
Oop, not that one, art, I ignored
that artifacts thing, sorry, hold on.

185
00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:31.145
If we just look at this right here,
not that one, this one.

186
00:09:31.145 --> 00:09:34.691
This take me an hour to write
a generalized version to be able to

187
00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:38.991
generate out these interfaces such
that they'd be attached to objects and

188
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:40.440
returned back, right?

189
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.776
It's not very hard,
you have all the information.

190
00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:46.636
So it definitely can be done,
I'm sure it probably already is done,

191
00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:48.244
I just don't know about it.

192
00:09:48.244 --> 00:09:50.441
The reality is I write very little.

193
00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:52.686
When it comes to
the website side of things,

194
00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.854
I try to avoid as much as I can
with this stuff, but there we go.

195
00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:58.521
You should easily be able
to write this stuff out.

196
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:00.115
You already know it's a type event, so

197
00:10:00.115 --> 00:10:03.025
you need to mutate the filters object
with a little extra layer, boom.

198
00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:06.014
So if it doesn't already exist,
it'd be easy to exist,

199
00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:08.396
you'd get 100,000 stars on GitHub.

200
00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:12.156
And everyone knows that every star
you get increases your pay by 0.1%,

201
00:10:12.156 --> 00:10:14.970
so it's very important to have
a lot of stars on GitHub.
