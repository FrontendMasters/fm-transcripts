00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.554
I'm sure, you're also thinking this is
going too fast, too much coconut oil.

2
00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:07.670
Of course free range organic coconut oil
that is, but we're going deeper, okay?

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.457
So the thing what I need you to do now,

4
00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:12.417
is I need you to get the metamask
extension for your browser.

5
00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:17.877
So, metamask is a wallet extension
that is very, very common.

6
00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:21.043
I would call it the quote
unquote de facto standard.

7
00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:24.591
So just download it,
install it, create an account.

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.492
This will be a test account.

9
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.610
Make sure you put that in your head.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.530
This is a test account.

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.639
So make a silly password.

12
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.251
Get ready to delete this and
not use it for any sort of real items.

13
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:36.056
If you ever do a real contract later on,
create a fresh account,

14
00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:38.815
make sure you have all
the credentials saved.

15
00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:42.747
You don't wanna lose anything because last
thing you want is to create the greatest

16
00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:45.175
NFT in the world that you
cannot have any money for.

17
00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:50.271
Or the greatest contract in
the world that's not an NFT and

18
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.087
you can't do anything with it.

19
00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:57.554
Second, you need a positive attitude
don't forget that very important and

20
00:00:57.554 --> 00:01:02.106
also third consider watching my other
suite courses on front end, alright?

21
00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:06.566
So I'll give you guys a couple moments to
create an account it should take about

22
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.738
three minutes to create the account.

23
00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:10.758
&gt;&gt; Should I use my metamask account?

24
00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:15.783
&gt;&gt; You can use your metamask account,
if you already have one, go for

25
00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:20.567
it because we're going to be
primarily dealing in localhost.

26
00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:25.086
So you'll just be adding that it's just I
always I have a big warning because I have

27
00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:29.410
12 Bitcoin locked away currently I know
half million know nothing like a half

28
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.200
mil locked away forever.

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.802
But if you're not careful with
these pieces of software,

30
00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:37.310
you'll accidentally screw yourself.

31
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.011
So when you're doing something for test,
just remember, that mark it down and

32
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.610
if you ever use it again.

33
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.568
Create a new one, it's just how I live
my life, one mistake at a time that is.

34
00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:55.116
So hey by popular demand I have added
what I've been typing thus far.

35
00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:57.004
And I am pushing it up to a repo so

36
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:01.881
you can go to ThePrimeagen/jpgdegens which
will have each step along the way so

37
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:06.209
we've done our first commit which
is at the deploy script right here.

38
00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.310
So you can actually go to the scripts and
go and check out, say hello.

39
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.194
This is where we were at right here.

40
00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:15.898
And so as I do each step,
I'll also deploy it.

41
00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:18.962
And if there's any missing
code from within here,

42
00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:20.964
I'll try to add it as we go along.

43
00:02:20.964 --> 00:02:25.430
So hopefully everyone got
etamask ,got an account started.

44
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.360
Second, you got a positive attitude.

45
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.766
And third, you bookmarked
perhaps these other courses.

46
00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:34.623
All right, awesome .All right so
let's import the test account from our

47
00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:39.572
little Aetherium network that's
running on our computer into metamask.

48
00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:42.489
So I may actually accidentally
already have that done.

49
00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.663
I'm gonna type in my seat.

50
00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:48.013
Yeah, I forgot this is my,
I made this one on stream so

51
00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:51.412
it has a fairly inappropriate password.

52
00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:52.850
Because that's how you
do things around here.

53
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.387
And so this is my Rinkeby test network.

54
00:02:55.387 --> 00:03:00.040
And so if I go to my local host one here,
I'm gonna just remove this account,

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.954
so we can go through together.

56
00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:03.905
So we're gonna go to our node.

57
00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:08.017
We're gonna go up to say you can pick
any of these accounts you would like.

58
00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:09.714
I'm gonna pick the first account.

59
00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:12.824
I'm gonna copy out the private key.

60
00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:15.841
I'm going to go back to metamask.

61
00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:17.640
I'm gonna now go in here and

62
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.268
I'm gonna click this top little
circular icon and go import account.

63
00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:26.052
I'm gonna paste in the private key and
press Import.

64
00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:29.267
And so there we go we have
now imported in that one.

65
00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:33.359
Second, I'm gonna go to this little
network, you may be on the main net,

66
00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.607
you may be on some test net I'm
gonna go down to localhost.

67
00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:39.857
And when I do that,
you'll see right away, I am loaded.

68
00:03:39.857 --> 00:03:43.983
Lots of Aetherium going on, but
it's not quite 10,000, right?

69
00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:45.098
That's it.

70
00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:47.455
It always hurts when you
almost lose a comma.

71
00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:52.127
But what actually happened here is when
we deployed our Hello World contract,

72
00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:56.937
I had to spend some of my Etherium that
is why I'm not perfectly at 10,000,

73
00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.446
I'm at point 9999.

74
00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.367
There we go.

75
00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:04.510
So now we have one of our tech accounts
inside of our metamask plugin,

76
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.673
so fantastic.

77
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:11.001
So everyone hopefully gets caught up here,
make sure you're local host,

78
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.050
that's very important.

79
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.271
So if you don't see your money in there,
it's because you're probably not pointing

80
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:18.511
to the local host Environment for
Metamask.

81
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:22.364
&gt;&gt; We have to say you test network screw?

82
00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:25.950
&gt;&gt; Maybe if that's probably something
I forgot that at some point I've yeah,

83
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.255
there's a view testing network thing
step that I guess I've done it so

84
00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:31.344
many times I forgot that
was the first step.

85
00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:33.990
So if you got tripped up there,
my fault, I'm sorry
