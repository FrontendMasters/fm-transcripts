WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:04.181
We're gonna use our website and
we're now gonna display the counter on

2
00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.253
the website and we're going to
increment the counter on the website.

3
00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:11.561
So let's go back let's
open up our index.ts and

4
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:15.914
of course the first thing we need to
do is going to go up to this nice

5
00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:19.078
little address here and
we need to replace it.

6
00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:25.429
I'm fairly lazy, I don't want to have
to keep on putting in new addresses,

7
00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.498
so let's just do a simple process
.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS, right?

8
00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:36.559
So this is gonna grab our contract
address off of our environment variable.

9
00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.697
Now remember, if you were keen enough
to looking at that Webpack config file,

10
00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:48.658
I actually use .env to scrape off our
environment and to bring it into Node.

11
00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:54.798
And so what we'll do is we'll go here into
our base directory and create a .env file.

12
00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:59.917
We'll create a CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
we'll go to our network,

13
00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:05.049
grab our last counter address,
copy it, go back, paste it in.

14
00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.585
So now, when we start Webpack,
it's gonna take this .env file,

15
00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:13.883
grab out the contract address and
put it into our environment.

16
00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:17.396
And of course have some code inside
the Webpack config that will actually

17
00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:18.151
replace that.

18
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.309
I assume most people
already know about .env.

19
00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.120
Nothing here should be too shocking,
right?

20
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.345
Everyone's kind of used it.

21
00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:25.709
If you haven't used it, it's fantastic.

22
00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.141
They have it in multiple languages right?

23
00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:27.983
You have it in Go.

24
00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:29.667
I'm sure you have it
in other ones as well.

25
00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:34.302
It's just a beautiful thing.

26
00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:38.028
And so we won't be using too much of it,
but we will be using some of it.

27
00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:39.871
Was there a question right there?

28
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.769
Okay, so now we have that.

29
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.604
Second, we the do something with this,
right?

30
00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:51.601
Cuz before it was Hello but now we're
gonna be talking to our contract address.

31
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.097
So we do need something to change.

32
00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:56.694
So I think everybody here that's in the
audience you should be able to just type

33
00:01:56.694 --> 00:01:57.958
this up yourself, right?

34
00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:02.218
You should be able to replace function
hello with count which is gonna be

35
00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:04.280
a public function and that's it.

36
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.957
And then of course you're
gonna have a get counter which

37
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:13.743
is gonna be a public view returns utnt32,
there we go.

38
00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:16.081
So we kind of know what's
happening right here.

39
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:21.157
This is our interface of these two
functions that we want to call into.

40
00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:25.543
And then lastly we have our same
provider that we've been using thus far.

41
00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:29.592
So now it's time to do a little bit of
like we're gonna go right back into all

42
00:02:29.592 --> 00:02:30.504
that HTML link.

43
00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:35.296
So let's create a couple elements to
display that, I'm gonna create a div to

44
00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:38.774
display the number and
a button to allow you to click it.

45
00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:42.619
So I'm just gonna do a const el
= document.createElement for

46
00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:47.260
those that have only lived in the React
World this a little scary using the raw

47
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.888
documents stuff, but we're gonna do it.

48
00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:50.920
It's gonna be fun.

49
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.240
And then we're gonna go we'll create
a little nice a sync function called set

50
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.507
value or setCounter.

51
00:02:56.507 --> 00:02:59.316
I know you shouldn't ever create
functions inside functions cuz you keep

52
00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:00.494
producing functions, but for

53
00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:03.898
us we're just doing this isn't that we're
not creating enterprise code here, right?

54
00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:07.370
We're gonna go el.innerHTML.

55
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.702
Remember we like to live
dangerously around here and

56
00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:12.938
we're gonna await our counter contract
which we currently call hello.

57
00:03:12.938 --> 00:03:18.155
We should probably rename that and
call getCounter there we go and of course,

58
00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:23.227
I should probably just rename hello
to counter, beautiful, fantastic.

59
00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:24.912
We're gonna call setCounter.

60
00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:27.855
So that way we have a nice
set counter at the beginning.

61
00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.623
And then we need to create one
more element for the button.

62
00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:34.081
I don't think I'm doing anything that
people already don't know about.

63
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.579
So I'm just gonna kind
of speed through this.

64
00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.467
I assume I don't really need to
explain much of these things, right?

65
00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:44.296
This is just some JavaScript,
button.innerText = increment type.

66
00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:44.829
There we go.
So

67
00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.051
we know to increment and
of course button on click equals function.

68
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.876
We don't care what happens in here.

69
00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:55.591
Let's go a sync function
await counter.count.

70
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.232
Remember so this is where we're
gonna actually do the incrementing.

71
00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:04.088
So we're going to counter once and
then we're gonna set the counter,

72
00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:07.173
that sounds about right, right?.

73
00:04:07.173 --> 00:04:12.285
I'm gonna erase that last line because we
don't obviously want to have anything from

74
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:17.399
hello world on there and then we're gonna
have to go document.body.appendChild.

75
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.745
And let's append the el and
then of course let's append the button.

76
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:26.439
There we go.

77
00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.498
So now we have the elements
we have the button.

78
00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:30.367
We created them both here, right?

79
00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:34.171
We created everything, we get the value
out of our counter by calling

80
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:38.249
the function, we've called this
function by specifying it right here.

81
00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:39.996
Here's the interface to the function.

82
00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:41.683
We call it once to get the value.

83
00:04:41.683 --> 00:04:42.804
We create a button.

84
00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:44.300
We set the text to increment.

85
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.868
When it gets clicked, we call count.

86
00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:49.335
Then, boom, we set the counter.

87
00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:50.046
So there we go.

88
00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:52.928
That's pretty much identical
to our deploy script.

89
00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:55.903
With a little bit of UI
logic on top of it, right?

90
00:04:55.903 --> 00:04:58.458
Not a lot but it's fairly straightforward.

91
00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:02.978
So that means we are only have to do one
last thing, which is we have to go to our

92
00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:06.599
webpack we have to destroy it and
then we have to relaunch it.

93
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.483
Reason being of course, because we just
added a .nfile with our contract address.

94
00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:14.537
It doesn't currently have our environment.

95
00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:19.001
I don't know how to refresh webpacks
environment variables on the fly,

96
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.162
as you know my build system
wasn't that advanced.

97
00:05:22.162 --> 00:05:26.455
So therefore every time we change that
value, we have to make sure we destroy and

98
00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:27.556
relaunch webpack.

99
00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:30.040
I'm telling you this,
because I'm gonna forget.

100
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.796
And so when it breaks down, someone goes,
did you remember to do that?

101
00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:38.947
And then I'll remember to do that and
then we'll all first try together.

102
00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:39.822
Fantastic.

103
00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:43.426
So let's go back to our beautiful website
we've been making, which is right here,

104
00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.476
which currently says
hello front end masters.

105
00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:49.694
And I'm gonna open up the console just
in case we have anything go wrong.

106
00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:51.557
And I'm gonna refresh the site.

107
00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:54.858
Look at that, nothing went wrong
we have the one right here,

108
00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:58.681
we have the increment button cuz
remember we launched the contract and

109
00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:01.680
then incremented it once,
beautiful we've done it.
