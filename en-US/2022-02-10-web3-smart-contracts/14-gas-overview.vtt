1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.471
Yes, someone did incremented at
least four times while we were out.

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.772
So that's actually pretty fantastic.

3
00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.170
We saw we got some of that done.

4
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.753
All right, so this is probably one of
the more important little things you need

5
00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:13.080
to put in your brain.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.858
I'm just gonna go over some stuff,

7
00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:17.539
no need to program we're
just gonna see how it works.

8
00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.348
Effectively it's just talking about gas.

9
00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.100
Gas is really expensive.

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.968
You've probably heard this term if
you're familiar enough with ethereum,

11
00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:29.205
it's called gwei is the standard unit for
gas which is actually a non standard unit.

12
00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:33.944
The standard unit for ethereum is called
wei one we is the fundamental unit of

13
00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:39.770
ether effectively, it's like our pennies
every dollars 100 pennies effectively.

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.268
There's 10 to the nine wei and
a gwei, a gwei is not a giga chat.

15
00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:49.202
It is a giga wei it's a billion weis,
ethers just simply 10 to the 18 weis.

16
00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:51.931
So when you own an ether
you own 10 to 18 weis,

17
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:55.000
gas is measured in these
more fundamental units.

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.048
Gas tends to be measured in a giga wei,

19
00:00:57.048 --> 00:00:59.900
are we have just called
gwei from here on out.

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.540
So there's two things you need to
understand when it comes to gas prices.

21
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.680
First thing is virtual machines.

22
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.178
So I wanna just do a quick drawing on a
virtual machine just in case people don't

23
00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:08.822
understand.

24
00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:13.533
And effectively when you think about it
contracts are just simply a series of but,

25
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.386
I got to take a quick break here.

26
00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:16.736
Did you see how straight that line is?

27
00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:20.686
I mean, that was free hand drawn and
FDE material there.

28
00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:25.617
Contract is just simply a series of byte
codes that need to be executed one at

29
00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:26.179
a time.

30
00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.341
So you can imagine that if you were to
write a program that takes in text and

31
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.774
does what the text says,

32
00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:36.572
you would effectively have a do while loop
because that is the best loop of all time.

33
00:01:36.572 --> 00:01:40.801
You'd have a do while loop that inside
of it would have a switch statement that

34
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.640
would walk through your so called program.

35
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.809
If you ever did advent of code in 2019,

36
00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:49.499
they had an ENT machine in which you
would actually do effectively this.

37
00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.763
And it would hop around inside of
your program until it gets to an endy

38
00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:54.920
condition, and then it would leave.

39
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.200
And that's really all
a virtual machine is.

40
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.439
So when I write something
that looks like x + 3.

41
00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.593
What's actually happening is that there's
a something called an add being executed,

42
00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:06.850
a lot like assembly,
right, there's an add.

43
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.353
Maybe it has to load in the x for memory
and then it has to put in a constant and

44
00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:15.820
then it probably needs to go and
store this value in something else.

45
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.707
And so that's effectively
what a virtual machine is,

46
00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:22.770
is that it takes in something that's
not executable and executes it.

47
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.175
JavaScript was originally,
purely just an interpreted language, or

48
00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:28.880
it actually had a virtual
machine underneath it.

49
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.545
If you look at JavaScript core code
from 2012, you will literally see one

50
00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:38.095
gigantic switch statement, I used to
have to play around in it at Netflix.

51
00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:38.877
And that's all it was.

52
00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:41.360
It was just one gigantic statement.

53
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.120
And you just hopped around in there
while the JavaScript was executing, and

54
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.060
eventually it hit an exit condition.

55
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.494
And you'd be out of the gigantic
do while switch loop, right?

56
00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:52.883
They used go-tos actually,
so it's just switch and

57
00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:55.073
it used go-tos to hop
around inside the switch.

58
00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:57.731
A little bit dangerous to do go-tos but
it was a lot of fun.

59
00:02:57.731 --> 00:03:01.146
And so that's all a virtual machine is,
it interprets these things one at a time.

60
00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:04.902
Every single action in
a theorem comes with a cost.

61
00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:07.841
So we can actually open up this
little link that I put in there.

62
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:13.681
And you can see right away an add
operation requires three units of gas.

63
00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:15.394
And so that's, it's a hard number.

64
00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:18.869
So every single time you do an add,
you're paying three units of gas.

65
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.317
If you do, say a store,
it could cost a lot more,

66
00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:27.200
if you wanna store something onto
the network or onto your contract,

67
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.453
you can store a single word or 256 bits
for approximately 20,000 units of gas.

68
00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:38.330
Now that doesn't mean you're
paying just simply 20,000 gwei,

69
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.217
you're paying 20,000 units of gas and
so what is the other side?

70
00:03:43.217 --> 00:03:44.729
What is the cost of gas?

71
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.345
Well, I can just go in here and
go cost of open up.

72
00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:51.703
That's cost of storage cost of eth gas.

73
00:03:51.703 --> 00:03:56.171
Go here, it'll probably open up ETH
gas station, usually good way to go.

74
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.875
It should say somewhere around in here.

75
00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.211
All right, this one doesn't
give me just the gwei one.

76
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:03.183
There's one that just gives
you the gwei one, gosh.

77
00:04:03.183 --> 00:04:04.658
Ether scan, there we go.

78
00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:10.004
It's 205 gwei, meaning that if
we're to do this an add costs

79
00:04:10.004 --> 00:04:15.053
three gas units right now costs
205 gwei per gas unit, and

80
00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:21.608
the cost of one ether is $4,000 divide
that of course by 10 to the nine.

81
00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:26.485
And what do you get a single add
operation right now cost 0.02.

82
00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:31.018
So if you were to add 50 items right now,
it would cost $1.

83
00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:34.223
So, that's expensive, right?

84
00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.964
This is why a theory I'm
struggling in these areas.

85
00:04:37.964 --> 00:04:40.554
So I have the little thing
broken down right here.

86
00:04:40.554 --> 00:04:43.424
This is why I did tend to the nine,
not 10 to the 18.

87
00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:46.136
Because remember, it's in gwei,
it's not an ethers.

88
00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:50.985
So he times it by that to make it into
ethers multiplied by the cost of ethers

89
00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:55.740
divided by wei or you can just simply
reduce the formula to being this.

90
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.550
So, if you're not familiar
with maths there you go,

91
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.120
that's an easy way to do it and so
it's actually pretty expensive.
