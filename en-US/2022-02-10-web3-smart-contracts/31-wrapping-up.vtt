1
00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.100
Go for the build,

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.058
I think you guys have all the tools you
really need now to build something, right?

3
00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:09.142
You know what's going on,
if you screw up your own storage,

4
00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:12.481
I think you probably understand
why you screwed up your storage.

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.622
You can go out and
try to use the Ethereum IDE,

6
00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:20.105
I forget what it's called,
I don't know, it starts with an r.

7
00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:23.806
But nonetheless if you use that you'll
at least understand what's happening

8
00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:26.170
underneath the hood,
it won't be as confusing.

9
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.633
If something goes wrong you know why, but
I gave you hopefully all the pieces you

10
00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.506
will need to be successful
in building something.

11
00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.682
And I didn't wanna make it NFT specific,

12
00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.427
because smart contracts
are much bigger than NFTs.

13
00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:41.599
NFT is a single ERC, right?

14
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.875
721, there's also partially mutable or

15
00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:49.710
possibly non fungible tokens 11
something something for NFTs.

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.637
But again, that's just reading up,
learning what you need to do, but

17
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.412
now you know how to approach it.

18
00:00:55.412 --> 00:00:58.965
When you do an NFT, you know how to
do a special storage location so

19
00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:03.050
that you don't crush your own NFT data
that is brought in by openZeppelin.

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.334
You know about the diamond pattern,

21
00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.195
you'll be able to upgrade you'll be able
to replace, you'll be able to delete,

22
00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.114
you'll be able to make your
contract live a long time.

23
00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:13.478
And really just avoid a whole class of
headaches that you would normally have if

24
00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:16.430
you didn't take the time
to learn these things.

25
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.540
And honestly, when you build your first
NFT, it's likely gonna be pretty simple.

26
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.314
And you won't need a lot of these things,
and then you'll have a bug,

27
00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.650
you'll update it and
you'll hate your life.

28
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.020
Now, this won't happen,
hopefully everyone's happy about this.

29
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.088
So even if you have a single, very
simple contract, throw behind a diamond,

30
00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:33.730
you'll never be sad, right?

31
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.480
You'll always have a way to update it.

32
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.230
Be careful, external libraries that you
use, they could screw up your storage.

33
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.646
So, always make sure you just use
a special storage location for

34
00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.750
all of your stuff.

35
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.950
You'll just never have to worry about it,
right?

36
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.990
You'll never have to
undo the things you did.

37
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.580
And of course, if you wanna be as fast as
I am at making these things and just being

38
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.480
able to easily understand it, it's just
a time in the saddle problem, right?

39
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.830
I think everyone here can
easily do what I just did.

40
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.170
It's just you got to do it like
five times then it's simple.

41
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.740
It's just straightforward.

42
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.081
Thank you Frontend masters,
thank you, Mark, Aisha, Tanner, John,

43
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.920
appreciate that.

44
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.950
Awesome, you can see me on Twitch.

45
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.357
So did I pass the VIM speed test that I
set in the beginning and my fast at VIM?

46
00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:19.220
Did I move quickly enough, swift enough?

47
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.963
All right, I still have that Twitch.

48
00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:23.661
I still have a YouTube, that's about it.

49
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:28.596
And I hope you enjoyed this first
look into Web3 using Ethereum,

50
00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:32.361
I think it's pretty fun,
I had fun, that's it,

51
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:37.000
yes I gotta clap,
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
