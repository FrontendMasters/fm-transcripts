1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.541
I'm pretty excited to do this course,
you guys also get my Christmas mustache.

2
00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:07.516
So, I grow a mustache while
doing advent of code.

3
00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:10.465
And so
it's unusual that I have a mustache, but

4
00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:14.609
now you will get the full experience
of both crypto and a mustache.

5
00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.873
Which I believe makes me actually even
better at picking NFT's is when you grow

6
00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:19.529
mustache.

7
00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.954
So, I'm pretty excited about this.

8
00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.823
So, this is kind of the year of crypto.

9
00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.280
I think everyone can kind of agree
that this is the year of crypto.

10
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.793
See me personally,
I thought that was the year of crypto.

11
00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:28.774
I remember that year.

12
00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.293
That was fantastic.

13
00:00:30.293 --> 00:00:31.208
Everyone was buying it.

14
00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:34.971
January was hot and then everything
died off and no one cared about it for

15
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.366
many years and now it's gone crazy, right?

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.376
By the way,
I did buy here at this nice top part.

17
00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:44.884
I did sell nice and low, I just,
just classic buy high, sell low.

18
00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:46.232
I also had this really great joke.

19
00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:50.201
I was gonna make about this guy who became
a millionaire off of doge coin, and

20
00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.631
I was gonna call him slum,
doge millionaire.

21
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:55.785
And then I found out that he
made a Twitter account and

22
00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.370
it really ruined my joke.

23
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.070
And so I feel very upset about this.

24
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.875
So I think I'm gonna quit that means for
the rest of my life.

25
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.701
I was actually going to even make
another meme about quitting memes, but

26
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.526
then I realized that's kind of defeating
the purpose of quitting meme so

27
00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:10.549
I didn't do that.

28
00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.370
Anyway, so I'm going to be here
to talk to you about crypto, and

29
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.423
you will have to excuse the lambo
while I hit you with some knowledge.

30
00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:19.741
Which is the most important
part of understanding crypto.

31
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.664
But here's the real deal is that I am
not gonna try to sell you on anything,

32
00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:27.677
I don't think crypto's 100% the future and
100% not the future.

33
00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:31.240
I think it's actually just
a pretty interesting tech.

34
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.049
It has a lot that's gonna have to change,
right?

35
00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.189
Like no one thought in 1999 that
Everything with the web has already

36
00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.298
arrived, right?

37
00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:42.260
There was a lot of change between then and
even three years after that.

38
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.687
And so I do think that we're just
at this really unique spot with it,

39
00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:50.197
where we don't actually
know what's gonna happen?

40
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:51.649
We don't know what
the future is going to be.

41
00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.924
We don't know how much of it is going
to actually affect our daily lives.

42
00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:55.874
And so I think it's just really fun.

43
00:01:55.874 --> 00:01:59.339
I think every developer should at least
have some working knowledge of what

44
00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.944
it could be.

45
00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:02.128
And think of some fun ideas and
ultimately,

46
00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:05.559
you just might be able to make
something that's worth a lot of money.

47
00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.915
I know that there's these crypto punks
that are 64 by 64 pixelated arts and

48
00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:12.101
one of them sold for $100 million.

49
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:15.889
So, I don't know really what's going on,
but it's just a unique world right now.

50
00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:20.735
The goal of this course is not to teach
you how to build a Aethalium react app,

51
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:21.278
right?

52
00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:25.809
It's not going to be focusing on making
a website while lightly integrating with

53
00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.152
Aethalium or any of these technologies.

54
00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:32.746
Really what it's going to be is building
a really solid foundation such that

55
00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:35.926
you will be able to build
anything you want to build.

56
00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:40.614
And that's really my goal here,
is not just to just lightly do it,

57
00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:44.882
but to show you every part of it
that I can so that when you leave

58
00:02:44.882 --> 00:02:49.351
exactly how to assemble the pieces
that are important for you.

59
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:54.202
Know where the dangers lie and ultimately
be able to build something that's

60
00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:58.238
just more complex than a simple hey,
here's a crypto zombie.

61
00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:00.670
And so by the way,
crypto zombies is pretty good tutorial.

62
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.022
And so who am I?

63
00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:04.416
I am probably best known for using Vim.

64
00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:08.740
That's I know it's pretty cool skill
to be known for a lot of people.

65
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.449
They grow up hoping that they could
be known for such things, but

66
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.012
they don't get to be known for that.

67
00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:15.522
I have a Twitch, I have a YouTube and

68
00:03:15.522 --> 00:03:19.812
I work at a startup we ship DVDs
are around the United States.

69
00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:23.457
You may have heard of
us were called Netflix.

70
00:03:23.457 --> 00:03:24.643
We've been doing it for a while now.

71
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:26.106
I really think who knows?

72
00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.905
Maybe we'll ship DVDs to other places.

73
00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:32.548
We have lots of places to
expand very excited about it.

74
00:03:32.548 --> 00:03:37.087
And here is the course outline I'm kind
of moving fast because I don't want to do

75
00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:37.916
a long intro.

76
00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:40.616
I know a proper intro should
be 45 minutes long, but

77
00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:44.225
I want to make it shorter today because
there's just too much to cover.

78
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.651
So the first thing we're gonna do is
just do the Hello World Contract.

79
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:50.250
I want to make sure everybody has
the right tools in place that they have

80
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.780
seen kind of the basics of it.

81
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.769
So, we're gonna build
the Hello World Contract.

82
00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.615
We're gonna test it,
we're gonna deploy it.

83
00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:58.483
We're gonna talk to it from a webpage.

84
00:03:58.483 --> 00:04:03.094
So we're gonna kinda go to
the four spots you should

85
00:04:03.094 --> 00:04:06.855
know when developing Tech for Ethereum.

86
00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:08.979
And yes I am when I say
when we do web three and

87
00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.580
a tour I'm more specifically
looking at Ethereum.

88
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.622
There's a lot of directions we could go,
we could talk about layer two.

89
00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.343
We could talk about salona the oddest,

90
00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:20.789
chain ever created because it's programmed
in Rust, which means I could tell

91
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.676
you about rust the entire time
without actually doing anything.

92
00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:25.537
So, it does seem pretty tempting.

93
00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:27.727
But we're gonna start
with the simplest one,

94
00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:29.757
because it's just very easy to work with.

95
00:04:29.757 --> 00:04:32.905
Two we're gonna go a little
bit more complex contract.

96
00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.887
We're even gonna launch it on Rinkeby,
which is a live test net,

97
00:04:35.887 --> 00:04:38.610
that you can access pretty much
anywhere around the world.

98
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.423
Three we're gonna go to
a more complex contract.

99
00:04:41.423 --> 00:04:43.346
And unfortunately this one gets,

100
00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:47.931
this is where like the weeds of working
on the blockchain really start happening.

101
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:50.615
If you don't understand
these two statements,

102
00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:54.880
hopefully at the end of the course you
will understand these two statements.

103
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.629
Both of these should be very
obvious if you understand them.

104
00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.204
If they're not obvious, then don't worry
they will become obvious hopefully.

105
00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:05.887
And then we'll do more testing deploying.

106
00:05:05.887 --> 00:05:10.729
And then lastly we're going to
solve some of the bigger problems

107
00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.966
which is how do you update your contracts?

108
00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:17.778
How do you get something
large eyes of your contract?

109
00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:20.247
I even had the person that
created the EIP 2535.

110
00:05:20.247 --> 00:05:25.467
Try to make sure that I talk about this.

111
00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:26.630
I was like, don't worry,
we're talking about this.

112
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.510
I met with him and it was a lot of fun.

113
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.514
And so I hope you're ready.

114
00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:33.577
This is hopefully gonna be a little bit
different of a course because we're

115
00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:35.727
going to be primarily coding and
going pretty fast.

116
00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:39.699
So, I hope everyone's ready to keep up,
build a lot of things.

117
00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.234
And if you don't build a lot of things
you just wanna watch that's fine.

118
00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:47.497
But I am more of a person that
believes you learn by doing not

119
00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.116
by just simply watching somebody.

120
00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:53.227
And so that's I think the best
way to learn to do it because and

121
00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:56.765
another thing I will not be doing today
is I will not be going over how to

122
00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:59.896
declare a variable if statements for
loops, inheritance.

123
00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:02.551
I just assume everyone here
knows how to program, and

124
00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:06.600
if you see a sea based language, you
can kind of go okay, yeah, that's that.

125
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.736
Yeah, I get that.

126
00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:08.628
That's that Okay.

127
00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:11.066
Because we just want to go fast.

128
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:12.769
And I know I kind of alluded to this.

129
00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.031
But a theorem is a real it has
a really simple language with it.

130
00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:18.909
You'll see it, you'll just
immediately understand it, right?

131
00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.762
There's nothing super complex about it.

132
00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:25.348
Some of the concepts get harder and
some of the technicalities get harder, but

133
00:06:25.348 --> 00:06:27.308
the base part of it is super easy.

134
00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:28.960
It's also super popular.

135
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.911
Everybody knows what Aetherium is like
you even turn on the stock channel and

136
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:33.952
they'll have like a Bitcoin and
Aetherium ticker.

137
00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:35.337
So it's like it's popular enough.

138
00:06:35.337 --> 00:06:38.752
It's like the zeitgeist of
the smart contract world today.

139
00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:40.030
Will it be tomorrow?

140
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.717
I don't know.

141
00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.233
Netscape Navigator was really awesome and
so is AOL.

142
00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.914
I can't tell you what's going to happen.

143
00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:48.685
Is it the Netscape Navigator of today?

144
00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:49.411
It could be.

145
00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:54.057
But I also am going to assume that you
guys are familiar with TypeScript or

146
00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:58.857
have enough working knowledge that if
I said, Hey, go yarn install this,

147
00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:01.924
you're not going to be like,
what's an yarn?

148
00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:03.670
I don't understand what
you're trying to tell me.

149
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.672
So hopefully everyone's kind
of at that level because or

150
00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:09.993
else we'll spend too much time
just getting things set up and.

151
00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:11.807
I also not going to use the Ethereum IDE.

152
00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:16.109
There is an editor that's specifically
designed around a theorem

153
00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:18.655
that adds a bunch of convenience to it.

154
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:21.931
And one of the reasons why I don't want
to do that is just the same reason why I

155
00:07:21.931 --> 00:07:25.727
don't like people, especially when you're
new to something not using things like VS

156
00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:28.757
code or IntelliJ, but actually trying
to go down to just the basics.

157
00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:31.838
Cuz often when problems arise and
you've been using something that

158
00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:34.769
abstracts your environment,
you don't know why they happen.

159
00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:36.117
You're just like it's broken.

160
00:07:36.117 --> 00:07:36.985
I don't get it.

161
00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:37.978
Why is it broken here?

162
00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:39.527
Why can't I call this function?

163
00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:40.263
What's happening?

164
00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:43.850
You miss out on a lot of the core
concepts by abstracting yourself.

165
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.830
You guys can use VS code or
whatever you want to use.

166
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.290
But I'll be flying on vim, I mean remember
the whole being known for vim thing.

167
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.549
And lastly we'll be doing a lot of
debugging if a problem does arise.

168
00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:57.837
Now, some of them I have planned
some of them I don't have planned,

169
00:07:57.837 --> 00:07:59.003
they It just happened.

170
00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:02.871
And console log will be, of course,
our primary debugging tool,

171
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:05.991
the greatest of all debugging tools,
known demand.

172
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:10.476
But most importantly, this is the thing
that you really have to understand,

173
00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:13.375
everything we do today
we're doing it first try.

174
00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:16.866
So, I hope everybody's ready
to first try hang that up..

175
00:08:16.866 --> 00:08:20.650
That's one of the best parts of coding
live is it's always the first try.

176
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.397
And if you guys are interested I've
already I've taught a course here on front

177
00:08:24.397 --> 00:08:26.343
end masters about vim it was fantastic.

178
00:08:26.343 --> 00:08:30.616
Lots of separability from mark on this one
if this course is going to be great now

179
00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:32.969
he think I think he thinks it's great now.

180
00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:36.267
And then the second one which for
whatever reason the image didn't load.

181
00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:39.373
It loads and then doesn't load, which I
also did one on developer productivity.

182
00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:43.068
So, if you're wondering how I'm
like switching between folders or

183
00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:46.393
looking up stuff about say go Lang
i could just type in In this.

184
00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.356
How am I doing all those things?

185
00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:52.402
Have all those things done on another
course called developer productivity?

186
00:08:52.402 --> 00:08:55.407
Pretty fantastic pacing.

187
00:08:55.407 --> 00:09:00.136
I did want to say we're going to start off
slow, like I said, with the hello world,

188
00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:04.075
but each thing we do is going to
get significantly more complicated.
