00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.634
Let's go ahead and

2
00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:09.206
let's start to consume this.

3
00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:15.565
So, Accidentally closed this,

4
00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:24.045
let's open this back up and,
Let's go widgets.service.

5
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.635
And you'll notice here
that we're not doing much.

6
00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:37.909
For the sake of time,
I am going to copy some of this.

7
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.760
Now what I'm gonna do is,

8
00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:06.369
I'm gonna copy the guts, but
I'm gonna talk through some of this

9
00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.200
real quick because I think
it's important to see,

10
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.095
One of the const API.

11
00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:37.059
What I would actually
do at some point is I

12
00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:41.877
would replace this with a config file or

13
00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:45.385
a config value, all right?

14
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.451
I feel like I pasted this service
inside the service, All right.

15
00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.788
So what I wanna call out here
is we start to work with this,

16
00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:19.900
is that I have an API endpoint,

17
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.450
which is not going to change typically
from one environment to the other.

18
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.256
Then I have In this case,
the model, which is the widgets, and

19
00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:38.049
then based on what I'm trying to do,
I either need to do one of two things,

20
00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.131
either get the URL or
get the URL with the ID.

21
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:46.647
And so, I can create a method called for
instance, all.

22
00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:51.666
And back to this real quick,
I'm gonna copy this so

23
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:55.929
I don't have to stumble over it.

24
00:02:55.929 --> 00:03:01.436
And I'm gonna just kind
of burn through this,

25
00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:09.020
but I want us to see kind of
some of the consistency here.

26
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.890
I go return this.http, and we know
what the verb is gonna be, it's get.

27
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.328
And then what we can do is
we can type this, and so

28
00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:25.000
we're gonna get a widget, or
rather an array of widgets.

29
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.140
And then we're just gonna pass in geturl,

30
00:03:32.737 --> 00:03:35.710
Right here, but this is a method.

31
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.180
Now I can take this and,

32
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.319
I can, Go find,

33
00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.160
so I'll call this find,
and I'll pass in a string.

34
00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.720
So I wanna get a specific,
Particular widget based on the ID.

35
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.020
So I can do geturl with ID,
and I can pass it in.

36
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.282
Now notice, this is the same,

37
00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:15.380
almost the same exact
method as the one above it.

38
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.640
And then I can come here and
I can do create.

39
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.983
And what this would take is a widget,
we'll type it.

40
00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:30.810
And now from here, we're going to post.

41
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.225
And we'll untype this, and

42
00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:40.800
we're gonna update the call here.

43
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.259
And we're gonna pass in the widget,

44
00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:56.412
Which is still pretty close
if I go here to update.

45
00:04:57.866 --> 00:05:02.026
Very, very close, the difference,

46
00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:06.820
really post and put are almost identical.

47
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.768
I just like to use put when
I'm updating something,

48
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:14.260
cuz I think it's a little bit more,
I think descriptive of what you're doing.

49
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.660
And, Geturl with ID.

50
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.720
Still very, very, very, very close.

51
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.790
And then from here, let's do one more,
And it'll be delete.

52
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.870
And this will just take
in a widget as well,

53
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.850
the difference is we're gonna go delete.

54
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.980
And you're good to go.

55
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.885
This is a very, very consistent
shape that we're going to use a lot.
