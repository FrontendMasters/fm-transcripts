00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's generate some libs.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.133
So nx g lib, and we're gonna do core-data,

3
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:14.102
and I'm gonna do this first one by hand,

4
00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:19.383
and we're gonna set the parent-module.

5
00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:22.689
And so this is gonna be this big,

6
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.948
long dashboard/src/app, Module.ts.

7
00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.672
We really don't need routing,
but whatever.

8
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:42.920
All right, and so
we're gonna generate this first one.

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.699
But what we can do is when
you're generating it,

10
00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.105
you can use the -d for dry run.

11
00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:52.580
And this is super handy because now,
you can say, c,

12
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.461
like this worked, this did not work,
I didn't name this code right.

13
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:01.594
Or more importantly, this did not
go where I thought it was gonna go.

14
00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:05.850
So we'll take this off and
we will run this.

15
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.669
All right, now,
if we go back into our code,

16
00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:15.827
you'll notice now that in our libs,
I have a new core-data.

17
00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:23.550
So core-data, historically, this is what
I used to communicate with a server.

18
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.526
So this is why a lot of times,
we'll define certain data models and

19
00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:30.970
I use core-data for server communication.

20
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.013
Now, what I'll do here is
just to streamline this and

21
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:39.520
I recommend that everybody do this.

22
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.270
I would say, do this by hand one time and
realize how much you hate it.

23
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.140
And from there, you stop doing it by hand.

24
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.088
And so what I'll do is once I know,
like okay, I need to generate everything,

25
00:01:57.088 --> 00:02:02.610
is I'll just generate or
just create my entire command set at once.

26
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.079
And so what it will actually look like,
and I'll just show you the wizard behind

27
00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.960
the curtain,
is that it ends up looking like this.

28
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.850
And so I will actually stack all my
commands up right from the beginning and

29
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.390
generate everything all at once.

30
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.110
So I'm creating two more modules,
core-state, and material.

31
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.025
We'll let those run.

32
00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:33.683
There we go, and let's generate a service.

33
00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:41.252
And I feel like this is gonna
get kind of boring in a second.

34
00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:43.559
So now, I'm generating a widget service.

35
00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:48.599
And what I'm doing is I'm
putting this in core-data and

36
00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.640
all it's done is generated a service and
the spec for it.

37
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.926
Then what I'll do,
we're just gonna go through it and

38
00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:04.590
I will post all of this into
the repo as the notes, but

39
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.160
we're gonna generate
a routing module in our app.

40
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.887
And now, for the super, super fun part,

41
00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:18.790
I am going to generate my components.

42
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.685
And so we'll go widgets, And
we're gonna put this in our app module.ts,

43
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:30.523
we're gonna go style, and
I'm gonna generate a list in a detail.

44
00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:32.248
So I could just do this one by one, but

45
00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:35.250
I feel like everybody's
tracking what I'm doing.

46
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.760
I'm basically using the COI
to generate a lot of code.

47
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.320
There we go, all right.

48
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.572
So now, let me just do one more and
then we will

49
00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:57.770
see what wonders we have wrought
upon this earth, all right?

50
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.674
So if we go into our Visual Studio Code,

51
00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:08.858
now what you'll see is we have material,
core-state,

52
00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:13.612
core-data, and
we still have our API interfaces.

53
00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:20.170
And in our app,
we have our home component.

54
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.176
And we have not only
our widgets component,

55
00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:28.722
which is going to be
the container component, but

56
00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:33.826
it also has my list component and
my details component.

57
00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:37.037
Now, these don't do anything just yet.

58
00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:42.458
But in a matter of minutes,
even with me talking,

59
00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:50.214
I've managed to essentially generate
a line share of my application.
