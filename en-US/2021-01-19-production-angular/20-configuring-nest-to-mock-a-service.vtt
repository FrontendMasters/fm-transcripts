00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.475
And so now what I'll do is I'm
going to hop into my app module,

2
00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:11.876
and I'm going to import my widgets,

3
00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:19.485
Module, and let's see what

4
00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:24.201
happens when I run this.

5
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:29.541
So, npm run, you know what?

6
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:35.007
Let's just do serve all and
we'll catch up with this.

7
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:41.106
So I feel like it might break,
but we can kind of go from there.

8
00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:51.230
And this warning here, I'm not too sure
where that comes from, but whatever.

9
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.608
All right so if we go up, and
I wish I could make this a little smaller,

10
00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:58.110
I feel like I'm attempting fade here.

11
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.442
In the router score, when you see this,
it means that these are the routes

12
00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:08.594
that it's mapping through, so
it's outputting your routes.

13
00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:13.977
So I'm gonna come here and

14
00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:18.140
let's just check.

15
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.070
And so you can see here, it tried to
make the call and it doesn't exist.

16
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.370
So this is because I don't
have JSON server running.

17
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.872
So if I hop back in the code, let's see
if we can flip this really, really quick.

18
00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:37.598
So I'm gonna go to the widgets service,

19
00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:45.160
the one in the, Here.

20
00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:55.933
And I'm pulling this from environment,

21
00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.250
which I'll talk about that
possibly in a little bit.

22
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.471
Well, real quick.

23
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:11.420
What I've done is you have these
environment files that you can expose,

24
00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:16.880
Inside of your tsconfig.base.

25
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.834
Now there's some upsides and
some downsides to this.

26
00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:26.140
One, it's really easy to do because
then I can come back over here and

27
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.486
say I want to import environment
from env.environment.

28
00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:33.470
And then I can dynamically
set that at runtime.

29
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.899
But you do get circular dependencies, and

30
00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.220
if that's a problem,
then you may need to fix that.

31
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.990
But the other thing is that it
doesn't optimize for tree shaking.

32
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.054
But the other alternative to this
is quite a bit more work, and

33
00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:58.100
there's actually not a lot of consensus
on the best way to solve this.

34
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.802
So this works well enough and
it's totally fine.

35
00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:08.305
So all I've done here is,
let me just double check and

36
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:11.921
make sure that I'm doing this correctly.

37
00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:23.710
This actually returns all widgets.

38
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.830
So I'm just returning
that out as a string.

39
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.730
And so I think I got this.

40
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.050
Yep, all right.

41
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.510
So now, what it's trying to
do it's trying to grab that.

42
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.830
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna close that.

43
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.907
And now I need to make one change.

44
00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:54.058
And, We're gonna go to main.ts,

45
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:05.700
enableCors, save this.

46
00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:16.082
And I threw an error, but
I didn't get the cors issues.

47
00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:22.994
So now, let's go back into,
Our widget service.

48
00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:32.132
And let's treat this just a little bit so

49
00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:35.618
that we can make this work.

50
00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:42.797
So from here, I am going to,

51
00:04:47.222 --> 00:04:51.763
Jump into my code, And,

52
00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:08.231
Now, you see what's happening here?

53
00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:13.523
I was able to share my model definitions,

54
00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:19.410
one of the first things we
talked about is data modelling.

55
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.189
And so in a model repo,
you can actually share the interfaces

56
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:32.003
between your front end and your back end,
which is quite, quite nice.

57
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:35.989
And so from here, 1, and

58
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:41.977
title is going to be, Nest Widget FTW.

59
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.660
Description is going to be Pending.

60
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.527
And,

61
00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:03.035
Like so.

62
00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:04.776
And now,

63
00:06:07.757 --> 00:06:12.710
Return, Widgets.

64
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.460
So we'll save this.

65
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.204
Let's go back into our,

66
00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:28.340
We have liftoff.
