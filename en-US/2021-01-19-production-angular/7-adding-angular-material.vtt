00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.883
I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm just stop this for a moment and

2
00:00:04.883 --> 00:00:10.040
because I don't want to see
my compiler lock up again.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.039
And what we can do now is we
can start to add libs to or

4
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.390
functionality via libs
into our application.

5
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.356
And so, the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to add some

6
00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:33.600
additional packages or
libraries to help me do that.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.415
So, from the command line, let me just
make sure I'm in the right folder,

8
00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:38.030
very good.

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.300
I'm going to add in angular material,
and ngrx.

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.939
So we're gonna go nx add and
we're gonna go angular material.

11
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:58.405
Again, pinning the version for
anybody watching this in the future and

12
00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:04.750
then I'm going to go ahead and
fill these flags out.

13
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.002
So the reason or how I typically
do this is I'll run it once, and

14
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:14.460
I'll watch for the flash or I'll watch
where they'll asked me questions.

15
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.630
And then I'll go and try to figure out how
do like, I not have to put that in again.

16
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.469
And so for instance,

17
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.682
this is helpful that in the interwebs,

18
00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:39.554
And I just had to Google this and poke
around or rather I went to the project and

19
00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:43.338
I poked around,
is you can actually in the code for nx so

20
00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:46.190
this is the create--nx-workspace.

21
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.758
You can go through here and

22
00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:52.710
you can start to parse out the parameters
that are available to you.

23
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.230
And so this is not super elegant,
but I think not having to add in

24
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.280
a parameter every single time or
to go through that is really helpful.

25
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.247
So the big one I was looking for

26
00:02:04.247 --> 00:02:09.380
the other day was linter cuz I didn't
wanna have to choose between my linter.

27
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.844
So when you are building something out,
occasionally,

28
00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:19.424
you just have to actually go look in
the code or look at the documentation

29
00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:23.890
to figure out what the flags are so
you can streamline it.

30
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.075
And we'll do defaults true again and

31
00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:30.810
I'm just gonna jump the all the way to
the end here, and I'm going to hit Enter.

32
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.948
And so what this is gonna do
is it's now going to go and

33
00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.481
it's going to add angular material and

34
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:44.671
it is going to add in
ngrx into my application.

35
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.179
And so this is how we add essentially
third party libs into our nx workspace.

36
00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.874
And how this works under the hood just for

37
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:03.872
a little bit of trivial is
that there are essentially nx

38
00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:08.229
compatible schematics
that when you do nx add.

39
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.466
Or it's really angular compatible
schematics is that it goes and

40
00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:15.786
it grabs everything that you need and
installs it.

41
00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:17.728
And it basically spins it up but

42
00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:22.376
there are the kind of these blueprints
under the hood that do this for you.

43
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:31.988
All right, and so
now we have material nest available to us.

44
00:03:31.988 --> 00:03:38.053
And let's converge on a data model
cuz we're gonna go ahead and

45
00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:42.180
now we're gonna generate a bunch of code.

46
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.014
So, if we go into VS code,
and I'm gonna just

47
00:03:48.014 --> 00:03:52.795
bump this down just a bit,
kind of back to normal.

48
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.224
That what we can do is if
we go to api-interfaces,

49
00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:08.760
you'll see here in the libs,
here's this api-interfaces.

50
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.027
Now within this,

51
00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:16.120
what you can do is typically what I'll do
is I'll go export interface, BaseEntity.

52
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.499
And all I'll put here is id is string or
null and this is because

53
00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:31.170
pretty much everything that comes through,
you're going to have an id.

54
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.415
And then we're going to do Widget and

55
00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:43.669
we're going to extend BaseEntity.

56
00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:51.866
And we'll go title string description,

57
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:05.456
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Is extensive.

58
00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:07.323
&gt;&gt; Boom, thank you if I had a T shirt,

59
00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:10.490
I would throw it into the crowd
right into your hands.

60
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.041
This is typically what I'll do like
right from the beginning is what is

61
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.660
the interface.

62
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.720
And so if you're gonna do something like
items or whatever, and typically for

63
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.170
me if I'm just stubbing something out
title and description is my default.

64
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.349
And so the reason why I did that is
because I'm gonna generate code and

65
00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.120
we are going to essentially use Widgets
as is gonna play a central role in that.
