00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.780
When we ran the,
buddle analyzer, it was kinda.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.940
And we're analyzing that.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.050
We've got this also.

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.230
Now we've got this 50 or five megabyte
file, which is fine for local.

5
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.390
I would say kinda,
local production or, development.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.546
But it's not super great in terms

7
00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:31.887
of is this something that we really

8
00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:37.610
wanna build or put into production?

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.840
And so
i'm gonna run this build one more time.

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.493
So if you wanna build your app,
it's you can do NP build NPM, run,

11
00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:49.920
build nccih run dashboard hyphen build.

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.350
And what i wanna call out here is
that notice that this vendor map.

13
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.860
Is five and a half Meg's it's very large.

14
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.940
I would not recommend shipping this.

15
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.055
Let's do a neat trick here.

16
00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:09.613
History.

17
00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:17.382
Grab, build Copy this,

18
00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:23.270
we'll run this so we're gonna run
the build with the prod flag.

19
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.480
So NG run dashboard build production.

20
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.210
That's a mouthful.

21
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.060
And it's gonna now run a production build.

22
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.770
And so we're gonna let this run.

23
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.730
And then what i wanna do is i
wanna step into the actual file.

24
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.960
And we're gonna do a quick
analysis on the size.

25
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.210
And so remember we're five and
a half megabytes.

26
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.800
And now we're gonna
hopefully get even better.

27
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.521
So, you can already see that
these numbers look lower, but

28
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.580
let's hope into the code and
i wanna take a peek.

29
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.395
So we're gonna go into the disk and
apps and dashboard and

30
00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:15.725
i wanna reveal in finder and
i'm gonna go get info and

31
00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:21.580
you can see here it's one Meg for
the entire thing.

32
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.430
So simply by doing a production build,
we're able to reduce it significantly.

33
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.614
So that's surprisingly,
this may seem super obvious,

34
00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:38.230
but i have ran into situations
where it's our app is so huge and

35
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.390
you the first question is, well,
are you doing a production bill?

36
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.040
And they're what's a production bill?

37
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.190
And so,
we went from five minutes to one Meg.

38
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.770
So 80% improvement right off the top,
simply by adding in the proud flag.

39
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.310
Now, what i do wanna point out when you're
doing a production bill, so super easy.

40
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.079
That a lot of people are doing this but
i've seen individuals and

41
00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.505
teams that aren't they're not
doing a production build.

42
00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:18.741
Is that what you need to do when you're
doing a production build is that

43
00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:24.779
in your environments if you're using
environment variables, that in my case,

44
00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:31.510
i had an API endpoint that i'm pointing
to my local development environment.

45
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.477
And for the sake of this workshop, i'm
still pointing to that local development

46
00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:39.560
environment but this did not exist.

47
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.188
And so if i save this, and so
if you forget to set up your config for

48
00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:51.970
that environment and you run this,
is that it should throw an error.

49
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.965
And so what this allows you to
do is that it allows you to

50
00:03:56.965 --> 00:04:02.737
essentially segment your
environments specific examples or

51
00:04:02.737 --> 00:04:07.732
configuration details into
configuration files and

52
00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:11.810
then feed them in during the build.

53
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.733
And so, at a higher level,
what i've done is

54
00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:22.304
based on a configuration
file that existed outside

55
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:27.357
of that was even at a higher
abstraction is that

56
00:04:27.357 --> 00:04:32.780
i've used a make file,
which is super analog.

57
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.419
So, unfortunately with make is
it's been around forever it works.

58
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.160
It's not great to google, but i've had it
where it's, here's my configuration file

59
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.680
or here's my configuration end points,
different things.

60
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.306
And i've went through and
i've generated those configuration,

61
00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:51.870
those environment files on the fly.

62
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.833
And so if you are doing a production
build, or an environment build

63
00:04:56.833 --> 00:05:01.880
cuz another one that i use quite
often is what i would call UAT.

64
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.650
So user acceptance testing.

65
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.167
So typically i'll have a dev
environment where it's pretty volatile,

66
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:10.831
i'll have UAT, which is what i would say,

67
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:15.569
kinda l a beta release style environment
where you wanna put something in for

68
00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.970
your stakeholders and for users to go
through, test it, make sure that it works.

69
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.850
And then you have plans so
a lot of times i will have, essentially,

70
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.637
configuration for all three of those
environments and then when you're building

71
00:05:29.637 --> 00:05:34.240
it then you just target that particular
configuration and you make that work.
