WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.517
So now we're gonna, we're gonna
just live in the visa logo here and

2
00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:10.247
I am going to now take a common
component because there are times

3
00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:14.440
where you wanna do that,
I'm going to extract it out and

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.450
I'm going to share it across
multiple applications.

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.995
So what I'm gonna do here,
let's hop into our command line yet

6
00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:32.400
again, and Let me open yet

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.456
another tab and so
let's just think about this for a second,

8
00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:45.225
if I wanted to create something to
share across both applications,

9
00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:49.284
what do you think would be my first step?

10
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.300
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

11
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.020
Thank you Lillian.

12
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.960
So you would essentially
extracted to a lib.

13
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.078
So in this case, create a lib and
then extract it to that lib.

14
00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:10.268
So from here,
I am going to generate a lib so

15
00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:14.885
lib and we'll call this UI toolbar and

16
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:19.068
I'm gonna set the style to SPSS and

17
00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:24.130
I've just messed this up too many times.

18
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.770
I'm going to run with the dry run flag and
take that off.

19
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.270
All right.

20
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.580
And then from here, let's go ahead so
we've generated the lib.

21
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.870
Now let's generate the components
that exist within that.

22
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.200
So now we have the lib.

23
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.110
Now we need to put the two components.

24
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.776
So we're gonna do is we're gonna take the
toolbar across the top of this application

25
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.900
Here, because we could use this
across multiple applications,

26
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.710
especially if it's consistent with
your corporate brand styling.

27
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.730
So we'll take this and
we're going to extract it out.

28
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.970
So NGC will do toolbar.

29
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.960
And now we're gonna say put this
in your toolbar and give it a.

30
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.184
Again classic SAS.

31
00:02:23.182 --> 00:02:25.221
All right.

32
00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:33.467
Let's roll the dice And

33
00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:39.504
I believe we are good to go.

34
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.945
All right, so now we're going to
do is within our code, we need to.

35
00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:58.630
Move or just extract the so again,

36
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.610
I was talking about
refactoring through promotion.

37
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.950
Well, this is what this looks like.

38
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.764
Now the one thing that is
interesting about having

39
00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:19.965
multiple applications in
the same repos that occasionally,

40
00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:25.140
if you have your file names are the same.

41
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.780
You do have to pay attention
to the file path because you

42
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.708
saw that I opened up app component HTML,
but

43
00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:35.840
what I really wanted to do was
open up the one in the dashboard.

44
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.637
So we have client dashboard and so
you will occasionally stumble and

45
00:03:39.637 --> 00:03:41.910
you're reaching for one thing.

46
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.153
And you just end up in the wrong
app because your naming

47
00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:46.820
conventions are similar.

48
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.642
Alright, so what we're gonna do is
we're going to pick this up and

49
00:03:56.642 --> 00:04:03.486
we're going to move it into
the toolbar component.

50
00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:09.074
And then from here, we are going to change

51
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:14.380
this side now toggle to an output.

52
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.660
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go toggle side down admit and

53
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.960
this doesn't exist yet, but
I'm gonna save this and

54
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.736
let's go back into our component here.

55
00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:36.930
And we can just delete all this.

56
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.811
So we'll go output and

57
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.107
we're going to call this

58
00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:50.385
Toggle, side nav, and

59
00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:56.052
it's going to be a new event emitter

60
00:04:58.782 --> 00:05:02.247
All right, I'm going to clean up
my imports since I'm here, and

61
00:05:02.247 --> 00:05:05.950
output is a function,
I need to make sure I get that right.

62
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.400
And what I'll also do is I'm going to
create another output called log out.

63
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.561
Now there's certainly more things
that I could do with this,

64
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:20.840
but we are going to keep
this fairly simple for now.

65
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.895
And what I can also do
now is when we click this

66
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:34.154
button over here, we can log out.

67
00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:46.810
There we go now make
sure I got this right.

68
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.480
Log Out.

69
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.500
Yes, yes, yes.

70
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.888
You notice here that,
angular is complaining about the fact

71
00:05:56.888 --> 00:06:04.260
that now I'm using material components and
it does not know where to find them.

72
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.123
So this is when you segment
things into modules,

73
00:06:10.123 --> 00:06:14.985
aka the material module, then this is no

74
00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:20.288
problem at all, barely an inconvenience.

75
00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:26.320
Except when it doesn't pick up.

76
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.372
So I find typically when I create

77
00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:38.479
a new lib that I have to
do this at least once and

78
00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:45.260
an insult to injury There we go.

79
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.110
That was super weird.

80
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.210
Let's check back here.

81
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.950
And we're good.

82
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.204
All right.

83
00:06:51.204 --> 00:06:56.090
So now let's go into our dashboard.

84
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.360
And I forgot something.

85
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.860
Hopefully.

86
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.420
Everybody was like no, don't do it.

87
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.410
You're missing something and
I am truly missing something.

88
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:17.057
I just created a new lib and

89
00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:21.438
I need to import it.

90
00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:26.009
But that is also, there's one another
step I need to do that I forget,

91
00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.877
thank you for reminding me.

92
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:41.550
Is I need to make sure that I make
this available for consumption.

93
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.949
So within my module itself,
what I need to do is I need to,

94
00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:51.090
what did I have to do for material?

95
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.664
I had to export it.

96
00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:58.960
And so to a bart component, Very good.

97
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.202
And what I'm also going
to do is in the index,

98
00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:07.891
I'm going to little trick
typically I will just go

99
00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:11.590
type it in once, it'll add it up here.

100
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.420
I'll just change this to export and
I think we are good to go here.

101
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.508
And while I'm at it, I just prefer
unless I'm exporting a bunch of

102
00:08:24.508 --> 00:08:29.750
things to be very explicit about
what I'm actually exporting out.

103
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.796
Okay, so
I should be able to consume this now.

104
00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:32.727
I am.

105
00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:41.000
Hopeful all right,

106
00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:50.920
UI toolbar module, Scope here in.

107
00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:09.012
It's correct, I believe I did and

108
00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:12.104
so now if we go into

109
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.133
This is where I've just completely,

110
00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:54.460
forgot what is happening in
this top level component.

111
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.274
So I think actually nothing so

112
00:09:58.274 --> 00:10:04.073
we'll just go just create
an empty method and

113
00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:11.410
since we're here we'll just
do another one for logout.

114
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:20.866
All right, back to our template

115
00:10:30.873 --> 00:10:32.171
And last but not least,

116
00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:41.952
Log out.

117
00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.500
Save this.

118
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.000
I'm rolling the dice.

119
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.763
Let's see what happens.

120
00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:04.246
Module not found,
cannot resolve F-E-M-U-Y toolbar.

121
00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:10.330
Let's think about why
that may be happening.

122
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.054
Alright, so let's go back to

123
00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:24.470
And let's see if this will work.

124
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.063
This hasn't been the first time
in my life I've just had to

125
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:32.453
restart the server to
see if it would work.

126
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.939
What do you know?

127
00:11:40.939 --> 00:11:42.735
Mystery solved.

128
00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:44.740
All right.

129
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:51.330
So we have it working here and
so it's displaying.

130
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.680
Now let's go back into our code.

131
00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:02.480
And let's get this working
in our client application.

132
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.959
Module.

133
00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:10.197
There we go.

134
00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:15.036
And feel like a restart

135
00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:20.136
of TS servers in order.

136
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:33.690
It's like it knew what I wanted.

137
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.440
Alright, save this.

138
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:42.906
Let's organize our imports and

139
00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:47.606
now, let's go into

140
00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:51.762
the app.html and

141
00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.542
I think I could just put this in I don't
even know if I have to bind to the events.

142
00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:08.525
So, Wouldn't it be funny?

143
00:13:08.525 --> 00:13:13.970
Like 'haha' funny is

144
00:13:19.592 --> 00:13:21.730
What I had to do was just restart this.

145
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.112
I'm hoping I'm crossing my fingers because

146
00:13:27.112 --> 00:13:33.920
then I know we have to break up and
it's not me it's them.

147
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.470
Alright so this is working with

148
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.700
a little aspects, let me fix this.

149
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.222
So what happened is when we did NG add and
we added a material,

150
00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:57.330
it added it to all this wonderful
stuff into the dashboard.

151
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.240
What it did not do when I created the new
app, because I did not add material to it.

152
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.840
We do not get the same benefits.

153
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:14.724
So, we just go here paste this in,
and I believe I can just change this,

154
00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:21.310
and, What I will do as well, and
somebody might be sitting there like.

155
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.740
Shaking their finger at me but
typically I like to keep styles unless

156
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:33.890
there's a good reason not to, kind of
concentrate it to the application itself.

157
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.422
So, all I've done here, and
I may revisit this later but

158
00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:43.050
this is a workshop is I've just
moved the styles over, and

159
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.886
I could very well actually pull
this into a lib if I wanted to.

160
00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:54.006
And at first this was like the best

161
00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:58.820
day of my life right here.
