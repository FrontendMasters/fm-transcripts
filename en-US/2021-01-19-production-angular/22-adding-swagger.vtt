00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.727
I actually couldn't believe that I could
do this like this, but here we are.

2
00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:06.782
I think this is neat.

3
00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:09.891
We're gonna go yarn add,

4
00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:17.527
Nest swagger and swagger-ui-express.

5
00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:21.621
We're going to add this in.

6
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:26.582
And when this is done,
we're going to go make one

7
00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:30.462
small modification to our code base.

8
00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:35.980
And I am not going to
type this out by hand,

9
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.920
but it will be impressive.

10
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.520
None the less.

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.030
All right.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.884
So I think we're good here.

13
00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:43.523
Let me just double check.

14
00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:49.611
Get again, lock files, lovely.

15
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:52.170
I'm not gonna let that bother me.

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.218
Now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go

17
00:00:57.218 --> 00:01:03.292
into the main TS and
we're going to clean this up.

18
00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:06.784
And so I'm going to just
introduce a new method here.

19
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:12.043
I'm gonna paste it in and then we can
kind of talk about what it's doing.

20
00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:20.332
And we may need to wait for

21
00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:26.625
the application to stop compiling,
all right?

22
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:31.993
So we need to import Document, Builder and
the swagger module, all right?

23
00:01:31.993 --> 00:01:37.195
From here I've added
the Configure swagger Method.

24
00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:39.848
And I'm just creating
a New Document Builder,

25
00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:43.243
which we're gonna see what this
looks like in just a moment.

26
00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:48.983
But I'm setting the title description,
set version, build, whatever.

27
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.887
And then I am creating a document.

28
00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:54.428
And then I'm saying set this up.

29
00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:56.042
So this is just basic configuration.

30
00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:58.525
You can copy it off of the documentation.

31
00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:03.565
Or you can copy it from the repo but
I really didn't invent this other than I

32
00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:08.787
created kind of a extracted it out into
a standalone function for me to call.

33
00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:14.171
And then from here, we are going to call

34
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:20.706
configure swagger and
I believe I pass the app.

35
00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:21.320
Please double check.

36
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.199
Yep, could it be that easy?

37
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.223
True story.

38
00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:26.970
So just real quick.

39
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.384
I'm just configuring the Document Builder.

40
00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.661
And then I'm creating the document.

41
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:36.879
And then I'm setting it up.

42
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.415
So kinda three main steps in here.

43
00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:44.409
Let me just also double check I'll
show there's something really silly.

44
00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:57.292
All right, so, is happened here.

45
00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:08.563
This is where I'm going to
need mark to cue some epic

46
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:13.043
music in the background
in post production, so

47
00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:18.420
start thinking about maybe
Carmen Bruner or something.

48
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.436
What do we got here?

49
00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:24.131
Swagger in about a single method.

50
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:30.665
And so if I wanna get widgets,
try it out, boom.

51
00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:39.635
So it's kind of weird in a way,
I did wrestle with, do I talk about nest.

52
00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:44.008
When I talk about production Angular,
and the answer is,

53
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:49.543
I believe anything that helps you
build higher quality production apps,

54
00:03:49.543 --> 00:03:55.635
especially something so integrated and
so aligned with the angular ecosystem.

55
00:03:55.635 --> 00:04:00.359
Absolutely, I think in a way, I feel like
I would be morally remiss not to say like,

56
00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.328
hey, here's this awesome tool.

57
00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:05.357
And if you understand Angular,

58
00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:10.181
then you pretty much
understand how to build APIs,

59
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:14.671
which when you're
building production apps,

60
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:19.494
invariably, you are going
to need to consume an API

61
00:04:19.494 --> 00:04:24.789
typically faster than
the backend team can produce it.

62
00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.960
This is a great way to
supplement those efforts.

63
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.800
And I've had some situations or I've had
a lot of situations where you offer to

64
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.638
kind of stub that out and actually take
the pressure off the back end team and you

65
00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:43.429
get a high five is that you're actually
providing value to the back end team.

66
00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:46.037
By not Essentially turning up the heat for

67
00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:50.073
them to get something done when
they're probably overloaded.

68
00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:55.506
And so this is a way to really
take ownership of the entire stack

69
00:04:55.506 --> 00:05:02.507
as you start to build this out and remove
that dependency from the back end team,

70
00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:07.025
and as long as you have
consensus on the data model.

71
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:12.144
Then you can continue to
accelerate your development

72
00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:17.043
without creating unnecessary
risk down the road.

73
00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:18.737
So I'm gonna pause here.

74
00:05:18.737 --> 00:05:23.692
I'm gonna take one more loving

75
00:05:23.692 --> 00:05:29.218
look at this sweet, Swagger API,

76
00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:33.441
and, From here,

77
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:38.438
I'm going to pause and ask,
does anybody have any questions,

78
00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:43.435
comments about what they've just
seen in the context of a what I

79
00:05:43.435 --> 00:05:48.174
would consider a full-stack Angular app,
at this point?
