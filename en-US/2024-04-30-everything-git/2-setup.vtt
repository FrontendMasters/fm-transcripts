00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.103
By the way, I do want everybody
if you're following along.

2
00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:08.601
You really do want to make sure you have
the same experience I'm gonna have and

3
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.678
so I want you to try to make
a Git into its default setting.

4
00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.770
So if you've set an initial branch,
you may want to turn that off for

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.832
now you can tell by just
taking this command,

6
00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:20.669
copying and going to the command
line input and putting it in.

7
00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.213
I have one right there so
I'm gonna do the same thing and

8
00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:24.991
I'm just gonna go like this, unset.

9
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.657
And so now there's nothing there.

10
00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:30.286
And so I have the commands
right here on the screen.

11
00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:34.030
Please unset any initial default branch.

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.180
You don't have to, but
we're gonna be setting it along the way.

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.305
Also, if you have rerere enabled.

14
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:44.961
It'd be good if you don't have re
enabled for this because if you do,

15
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:49.075
you'll miss out on some of
the reasons why Git is fantastic.

16
00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:50.004
So Awesome.

17
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.525
Now that we have this,
we can keep on going.

18
00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:55.788
So everybody, hopefully you have all of
your default settings properly set up and

19
00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.775
now it's time to, well,
it's time to get good, okay?

20
00:00:58.775 --> 00:00:59.575
I'm ready to get good.

21
00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:00.762
Hopefully, you are.

22
00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.209
So how things will be structured.

23
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:06.115
Every section is gonna come with some
question-and-answer part where I'll say,

24
00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:09.305
hey, here's the thing, and
then you're gonna look at the thing and

25
00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:13.210
hopefully you'll internalize that then
I'll ask you a question like, all right,

26
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.379
let's stage the files.

27
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.899
And if I use these terms,
hopefully you remember what they all mean.

28
00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.869
And then you're gonna be
able to do it fantastically.

29
00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.150
You guys will all be awesome and

30
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.471
everyone will get a promotion
when they're done here.

31
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:25.481
All right, your first Git repo.

32
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:30.609
I'm sure this is not your first repos, but
let's just pretend it is and to make sure

33
00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.981
that nobody else, people that haven't ever
used Git, they can follow along as well.

34
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.431
So let's build our first repo.

35
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.573
We're not even going to draw Git.

36
00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:43.519
You guys already get it right now at
this point, we're just gonna move on.

37
00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.792
So configuring your Git
experience before we begin.

38
00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:48.071
You want to configure your Git experience.

39
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:51.081
This is that one thing you do when
you first set up your computer and

40
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:53.401
that you've completely
forgotten how it works.

41
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:56.261
You just know you did it at
some point in your lifetime.

42
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.771
And now we're gonna do it again.

43
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:03.629
How Git config Is it's a lot
like JavaScript's Object.assign.

44
00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.309
You have a global config and
you have a local config.

45
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.353
There's technically a third one and
a fourth one, but

46
00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:09.609
we're gonna ignore those ones.

47
00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.209
For now, there's just global and
local settings.

48
00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.539
Git config is a lot like
JavaScript's Object.assign.

49
00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.523
You have your global config,
which should be for every single project,

50
00:02:19.523 --> 00:02:22.546
and then you have your
specific project level config.

51
00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:25.216
So maybe in one project I
only wanna use rebase, and

52
00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:27.276
another project I don't wanna use it.

53
00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.191
Maybe in one project I wanna
have it under my personal name,

54
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.356
whereas I want all my projects
to be under, say, my work email.

55
00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:36.576
And so you can set them up individually so
you don't goof it up.

56
00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:38.066
It's very nice.

57
00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:45.449
So some key facts all Git keys
are in the shape of section.key.

58
00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.386
Is really important to remember because if
you don't remember that you'll get these

59
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:51.255
weird errors and they'll feel arcane.

60
00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:55.591
Remember section.key is
the key to any Git config.

61
00:02:55.591 --> 00:03:00.181
Global means it's for
all projects, user.name and

62
00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:05.186
user.email are the keys used
in helping create a commit.

63
00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:08.966
So when future you looks in the past and
tries to do a Git blame,

64
00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:11.236
who do they see other than yourself?

65
00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:15.686
Well, it's driven by these two things
right here, username and user email.

66
00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:19.709
So to add something to your config,
you do git config add,

67
00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.931
then you can do global and
the key end of value.

68
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.501
So just like you just think of
it like a hash map, all right?

69
00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:26.831
It's pretty straightforward.

70
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.951
You can view anything with get config-git
and then the key name, all right?

71
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:33.127
So pretty straightforward.

72
00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:38.116
So very first problem at make sure you
have your username and your user email,

73
00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.818
if you don't already have those values.

74
00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:42.487
It'll be very nice to do that.

75
00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.698
All right,
I just assume everybody already has this.

76
00:03:44.698 --> 00:03:48.817
Make sure you check to see that you have
your user email and your username set up.

77
00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:51.027
If you don't,
it's just annoying, honestly.

78
00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:52.706
All right, quick solution, there you go.

79
00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:55.356
Here's me adding my username and
my user email.

80
00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:56.966
So hopefully everybody else has that.

81
00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.213
Just to make sure I have that,
I'll just copy these right now,

82
00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:02.786
throw them in there bought a Bing,
bought a Boom,

83
00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:06.301
I got my git config username and
user email, primegin@aol.com.

84
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:08.496
Great email right there.
