00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.580
Now don't forget rebase
replays commits on history.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.541
So, looks like we already have this.

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:07.440
Yeah, ask README.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.420
We already went through all this,
sorry, hold on.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.857
All right, so
we're gonna do it again, except for

6
00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:14.533
this time instead of accepting ours,
which is theirs.

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.961
We're gonna accept theirs which is ours.

8
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:22.851
So, in hello git, let's do A + 5,

9
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:28.173
in remote git, let's do A + 6.

10
00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.954
So let's go to our upstream,

11
00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:36.047
hello git, and go and do A + 5.

12
00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.133
A + 5, perfect.

13
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:51.012
I'm gonna go to remote and
I'm gonna go in here and go A + 6.

14
00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:55.635
I just wanna make sure that I don't
have any other things to do here.

15
00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.064
Make sure I haven't goofed out anything.

16
00:00:58.064 --> 00:00:58.984
Okay, there we go.

17
00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:04.200
Git status, awesome,
git add this, git commit A + 6.

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.300
There we go.

19
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.830
Now we need to pull in our
origin trunk and rebase on it.

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370
So, git pull rebase.

21
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.360
Again, we have the simple conflict.

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.004
We just need to resolve it now and
then remember, we're gonna choose theirs,

23
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:22.978
which is ours.

24
00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:25.120
We don't wanna choose ours,
which is theirs.

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.121
So if you open up the README,
you'll see there's A + 6,

26
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.850
which is in the theirs category.

27
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.168
So erase that, save it.

28
00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:35.037
There we go.
We have now officially done that.

29
00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:37.246
We go to status, we add it.

30
00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:40.108
If you check on status, you can see
right here, all conflicts are fixed.

31
00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:40.735
Run this.

32
00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:42.262
It's waiting for
you to say that you're done.

33
00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:43.845
I'm gonna take this command.

34
00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:44.825
Rebase, continue.

35
00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.770
Awesome, now we have a chance to edit
our commit message if we want to.

36
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.255
I'm gonna keep it as A + 6.

37
00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:58.485
Awesome, so I can go get log one line and
you can see right here there's that.

38
00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:03.723
Here's our previous change and
now we have the A + 6 change, all right?.

39
00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:12.958
This is where it just
gets kind of annoying.

40
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.098
We're gonna do this a little bit.

41
00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:19.038
Let's just add a new line right
below A + 6 in hello git.

42
00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.248
Just one new line, okay?

43
00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:27.654
So let's go to hello git,
open up the README and go NewLine.

44
00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:33.772
Let's save it, git status,
git add, git commit, NewLine,

45
00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:39.064
go back to remote and I'm gonna get
pull this one in with a rebase.

46
00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:43.441
Now remember, rebase,
checks out the thing I'm going to,

47
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:45.314
replace the commands one at a time.

48
00:02:45.314 --> 00:02:46.836
And look at this, we got a conflict.

49
00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:49.098
Don't fix the conflict.

50
00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:49.708
Just check it out.

51
00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:52.994
Look at that.

52
00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:55.308
It's like we're all over again.

53
00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:58.490
We're doing the exact same thing again and
we've already fixed it, yet

54
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.058
here's the exact same conflict again.

55
00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:05.682
So it can be a little bit emotionally
painful if you have to fix

56
00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:09.783
the same conflict over and
over and over again.

57
00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:16.399
It's almost like I wish git,
you could reuse recorded resolutions.

58
00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.640
That would be really, really nice, right?

59
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.692
That's me saying to your face
the thing you're supposed to use and

60
00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:23.900
you don't realize that.

61
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.021
I'm saying it if you don't know about it,
yeah, it's like the joke,

62
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:30.759
you get it is like right there.

63
00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.266
It's pretty funny, all right anyway.

64
00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.509
So we see this, it's like,
man this stinks, right?

65
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.491
And so we could fix the conflict.

66
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:40.087
Don't actually commit it,

67
00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:44.996
let's fix the conflict to the point where
we have A + 6 plus the NewLine, right?

68
00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:48.036
So I'm gonna have to merge
those changes together, right?

69
00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:53.775
So I'm gonna have to go, delete that,
delete this, and then move that one down.

70
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.844
Kind of stinks, right?

71
00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:58.173
This is where things really get crappy
when you have conflicts like that because

72
00:03:58.173 --> 00:03:59.920
then they get really hard to understand.

73
00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.645
All right, so we're not gonna resolve yet.

74
00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:10.425
By the way, does this make sense
now with how rebase works?

75
00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:12.615
Do we all understand why this happened?

76
00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:18.065
The replaying of commits,
where we're gonna conflict add infinitum,

77
00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:22.588
cuz we're just replaying something that
has changed in the same place twice.

78
00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:24.323
Remember, it always replays one at a time.
