1
00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.344
All right, hello.

2
00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:02.392
Is everybody ready?

3
00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:03.628
No?
Yes?

4
00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:04.483
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I want more.

5
00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.522
Come on a little bit more.

6
00:00:06.522 --> 00:00:08.176
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; There we go, all right?

7
00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:11.341
We're excited.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

8
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.688
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Everyone,

9
00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:15.207
we're gonna do a Linus chat now.

10
00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:18.106
I actually heard a really
great quote before all this,

11
00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:19.808
which is Git was only invented so

12
00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:23.796
that the rest of us could be nearly as
smart as Linus because he is that good.

13
00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:26.499
He could hold all of Linux in
his head with revisions well,

14
00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.274
as the rest of us are just mere mortal.

15
00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:33.508
So, but for this grand course,
I did want to be a bit more professional.

16
00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:40.898
So we're gonna undone the black
hoodie [SOUND] and put on.

17
00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:41.658
Regular normal close.

18
00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:43.690
All right, so
I just think that's fantastic.

19
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.375
So all right, so who am I for
those that don't know?

20
00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.098
I'm Stream on Twitch.

21
00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:52.013
I make YouTube videos, I do handcrafted
artisanal memes every now and

22
00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:53.016
then on Twitter.

23
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:54.141
I don't have a link there.

24
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.501
I made this logo with ChatGPT,
it got so close.

25
00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.285
It's just so close yet
it's just so far away.

26
00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:03.950
Also those ones as well are from ChatGPT,
so pretty fantastic.

27
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.657
So the goal here is to teach you Git well.

28
00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:08.439
It's not gonna go over
every single command.

29
00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.042
I don't know if you've ever
played around with the man docs,

30
00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:16.010
but there's about 147 different
commands you can put into Git.

31
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.118
We'll go over 13 of them.

32
00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.466
We're gonna get pretty far into it,

33
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:24.119
but the last 1% of knowing
Git is extremely difficult.

34
00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.201
You don't ever have to know it.

35
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.399
I've literally not touched
most things in Git.

36
00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.598
There's just enough to make you good,
and that's what we want to be,

37
00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:36.387
is we want to be pretty dang good and
understand why they exist.

38
00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.983
All right, so before we git,
by the way, you should man.

39
00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:41.828
If you don't know what man is,
man is the manual pages for

40
00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:43.141
any kind of a Unix system.

41
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:46.242
So if you just jump in your terminal and
type man man,

42
00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:48.864
you will see a bunch of
manual pages appear.

43
00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:50.683
It's really important to be good at these.

44
00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:51.836
You don't even have to be great at them.

45
00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:53.686
Just good.

46
00:01:53.686 --> 00:01:56.917
Because everything you need to
know about Git is for free and

47
00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.477
on your system at all times.

48
00:01:58.477 --> 00:01:59.790
You don't You don't
even need the internet.

49
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.153
If you're on an airplane,
you can just man, get whatever command and

50
00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.924
you'll read the manual page for it.

51
00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:08.774
So it's always fantastic to have
the manual in the back pocket and

52
00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.174
just know how it works.

53
00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:13.841
So if everyone can open up the manual for
a quick second and check it out,

54
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:18.085
by the way, if you ever want to, you can
always do a man, get-, press some tabs.

55
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.757
And if you're.
If you're on zsh, you'll see that it has,

56
00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:23.431
like I said, literally 147 possibilities.

57
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:24.525
They're quite fantastic.

58
00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.934
So if you have man open,
you've never used man before.

59
00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:32.906
j goes down a line, k goes up a line,
d goes down a half page,

60
00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:38.993
u goes up half page, / or forward/
any word will search for something.

61
00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:41.702
n goes to the next search
term after you press Enter,

62
00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:45.102
capital N goes to the previous
search term after you press Enter.

63
00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:47.780
So now that you see this,
you probably think okay,

64
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.413
maybe vim shortcuts aren't
like all that crazy.

65
00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:52.313
Maybe this has some precedent.

66
00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:53.142
You're probably right.

67
00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:56.809
No one knows where f came from, but
the rest of it probably makes sense.

68
00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.648
All right, so quick exercise.

69
00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:05.337
In man pages, you see bold terms, I want
someone to find what is a bold term?

70
00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:07.488
What is its definition?

71
00:03:07.488 --> 00:03:12.768
Use the man pages, use man man to find
out why a man page has bold terms.

72
00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:16.083
So you can search, you can peruse.

73
00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:17.318
&gt;&gt; /bold.

74
00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:20.276
First result bold text,
type exactly as shown.

75
00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:21.368
&gt;&gt; Correct, all right, so

76
00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:25.017
there's a bunch of different ways you've
gotta read commands out of the man page.

77
00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:29.791
You'll see specified with italics,
with brackets,

78
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:33.535
with ..., ellipses, all that stuff.

79
00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:36.399
And so when you look at a man page,
everything has a meaning.

80
00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.025
And so this is just your intro.

81
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.717
If you If you forget how a man page works,
use man man.

82
00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:41.482
You can go over it.

83
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:42.591
You can look at it.

84
00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:43.627
It's always in your back pocket.

85
00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:44.916
Fantastic to have.

86
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:45.695
And so there you go.

87
00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:49.188
Bold text literally means to
type exactly as it's shown.

88
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:53.388
So if you look at the man page, you'll see
something like man-k and that shows up in

89
00:03:53.388 --> 00:03:56.940
all bold, and then you'll see the rest
of it telling you how to use it.

90
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.995
So that's how you use a man page.

91
00:03:57.995 --> 00:03:58.926
Fantastic.
