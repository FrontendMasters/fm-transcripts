1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.150
All right, so we have an act of conflict
right now, and we need to resolve it.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.239
So given what you know,
even though I've already foreshadowed and

3
00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:10.776
already told you, would you use rebase
if this was the experience of rebase?

4
00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:16.963
My guess is most people probably really
wouldn't wanna necessarily use rebase

5
00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:21.120
if it means you're gonna conflict for
any long-held branch over and over again.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.251
That'd be a pretty bad
experience just in general.

7
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:29.292
So hey, they'll probably help you not
have long running feature branches.

8
00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:32.303
So it's like a care through pain and
misery.

9
00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:36.757
So it's like it's a really nice way to
kinda fix that problem, but here we are.

10
00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:40.637
So anyways, I wouldn't personally wanna
use it just because it'll just be a pain.

11
00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:45.201
So instead, there's likely something you
don't know about, it's called rerere.

12
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.625
It's one of the strangest options at all
of git, it stands for reuse, recorded,

13
00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:50.472
resolutions.

14
00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:52.735
And even from the The Git Docs,
it says this,

15
00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.192
this functionality is
a bit of a hidden feature.

16
00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:59.269
It's like the best feature and
it's hidden, like why would you do this?

17
00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.566
Why would you name it this?

18
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.615
Why is it like this?

19
00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:05.982
It's just so painful that this,
why are you the way you are, right?

20
00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.505
That's the meme, right?

21
00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.472
It's happening right before our eyes.

22
00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:13.850
And so
all you have to do is enable rerere.

23
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.034
You can enable it in your config, which
means we can enable it locally, just for

24
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:21.586
this repo, or you can enable it
globally for all of your repos.

25
00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:25.286
So for the sake of you not having your
system altered in any sort of way,

26
00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.565
just enable it locally for just this repo.

27
00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:34.409
So I'm gonna go git config --add
rerere.enabled with the d, right?

28
00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.023
Yeah, with the d, to true.

29
00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:39.512
There we go, we just did it.

30
00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:41.936
We enabled it, it's fantastic, right?

31
00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:44.416
And right now, we're still conflicting,
remember that.

32
00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.980
We're still in the middle of this,
it's terrible.

33
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.358
Let's see where we're at, okay, good.

34
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.679
Everything we have the change in there.

35
00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.447
So I'll just add it.

36
00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:53.600
We'll do a git rebase --continue.

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.326
It will play it, oopsies,
I spelled, continue, wrong.

38
00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:00.092
We'll now edit our commit message.

39
00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:02.306
I'll keep the commit message the same,
cuz again, remember,

40
00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:04.285
rebase gives you the chance
to edit your commit message.

41
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:08.555
I don't want to edit it, awesome,
we resolve the conflict.

42
00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:12.449
Now, let's see something here.

43
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.896
Okay, fantastic, we did this.

44
00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:14.881
By the way, it's on a local list.

45
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:20.810
So if you do that, if you go git config,
I forgot to say this, --list --local only,

46
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.956
so these are only local options,
you'll see rerere is right here, right?

47
00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:29.142
You can cat out the git config,
you see right there.

48
00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:33.985
So okay, awesome, it's been enabled,
we're ready, fantastic.

49
00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:36.879
And we're gonna talk about what it is.

50
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.113
It's not all sunshine and
rainbows, by the way.

51
00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:42.270
Sometimes you could resolve something
thing in a way you don't like,

52
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.837
and you need to be able to go through,
and you can actually

53
00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:48.392
delete how you have recorded your
resolutions, so they don't replay again.

54
00:02:48.392 --> 00:02:51.378
So that can kinda be a pain when
you're like, that was a bad merge.

55
00:02:51.378 --> 00:02:54.259
And then you try to pull again and then it
just automagically does it for you, and

56
00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.547
you're like, dang it,
it just knew what I was doing, right?

57
00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:58.649
And you don't want that to happen,
but it did.

58
00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:59.866
So just remember that.

59
00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:03.675
All right, so let's resolve our conflicts
and accept our change with A + 6.

60
00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:04.307
We did all this, right?

61
00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:08.052
We got to do a little, what's it called?

62
00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:09.779
A git rebase --continue.

63
00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:10.990
I already did that, okay, awesome.

64
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.264
So let's go back to Hello Git.

65
00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:15.953
And let's make a simple
change to just upstream.md.

66
00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:19.340
Now, if we didn't have
recorded resolutions on,

67
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.034
we would actually conflict again here.

68
00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:28.216
But instead, if I go upstream, go right
here and go another change with a rerere,

69
00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:33.788
we'll go like that, we'll git add,
we'll git commit rerere, right?

70
00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:37.600
And I can get pull --rebase on remote, and

71
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.628
It's just gonna successfully rebase for
us.

72
00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:44.789
Everything's great,
we're not reconflicting,

73
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.737
it's just smooth sailing now.

74
00:03:46.737 --> 00:03:50.267
So very nice, very nice to have rerere on.

75
00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:54.827
I would highly recommend having it on,
just that only one thing you gotta

76
00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:58.285
be careful about is,
of course, the bad resolution.

77
00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:00.792
All right, rerere is free.

78
00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:03.148
You can just use it for free, nothing.
