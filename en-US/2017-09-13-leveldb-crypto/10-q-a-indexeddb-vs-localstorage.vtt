00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.990
Right, so Justin asks why local
storage exists, [LAUGH] I guess.

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.870
If there's IndexedDB and local storage,
why is there two of those?

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.360
Well, local storage pretty
sure came beforeIndexedDB.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.580
But unfortunately, local storage has
some fatal flaws, like it's synchronous.

5
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.440
And so doing heavy lifting,

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.350
doing data intensive things
is not gonna work very well.

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.190
It's gonna block the rendering
loop all kinds of problems.

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.210
So I would say don't even learn

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.230
about local storage cuz it's
just kind of a bad idea.

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.130
[LAUGH] You can use IndexedDB with these
nice wrappers and it's just as easy,

11
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.960
but it's a better foundation.

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.680
Okay, so the other question is,
what does the browser support look like?

13
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.930
So I don't recall exactly what the browser
support is like for the LevelDB browserify

14
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.310
stream, but I'd imagine that it's gonna
be really similar to IndexedDB itself.

15
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.204
So you can pretty safely use it on
mobile and you can pretty, IE11 has it.

16
00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:09.767
I think 10 might even have it.

17
00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:14.560
&gt;&gt; 10 has it, but-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it kind of works in IE10, right?

18
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.960
It works well enough in 11 or
Edge or whatever they call it now.

19
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.638
You always have to watch out for Safari,
which is the IE6 of our day, but

20
00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:30.420
it should work reasonably
well in most browsers.

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.983
How does the offline and
the online sync work?

22
00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:40.800
You use it offline and you wanna sync
it on the server site, database site.

23
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.010
&gt;&gt; Yes, so if you wanna implement
something like syncing,

24
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.430
there's more pieces that you're
gonna need to implement that well,

25
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.710
which I'll be covering after lunch.

26
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.800
But generally speaking,

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.850
you need something like an append
only log to do syncing well.

28
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.849
And we're gonna be doing some stuff
with crypto as well to do that

29
00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.153
securely using this idea called
Merkle degs, signed Merkel degs.

30
00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:10.970
Yes, syncing is a little bit more
involved, but we'll get to that.
