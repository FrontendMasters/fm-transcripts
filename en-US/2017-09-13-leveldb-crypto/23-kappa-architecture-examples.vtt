00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.950
For some other examples of cap
architectures and kind of like bigger,

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.130
more real world systems, I've got a few
one is called secure scuttlebutt.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.060
This is a peer-to-peer social database
that you can use for a social networking.

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.637
For gits implementation called git ssb,
which is like a peer-to-peer GitHub.

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.790
All of this stuff works offline,
like here I can running it.

6
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.286
So you can see it's
a social networking feed.

7
00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:32.330
It also is git implementation.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.890
So I think I'm running that as well.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.200
So if you wanna work offline.

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.750
If you want to send pull requests and
log issues and things, you can

11
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.997
use these tools which implement this
kind of peer-to-peer architecture.

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.260
There's also a lot of people who
use this network who are very

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.440
interesting folks to talk to who like
know all of this stuff pretty well.

14
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.310
There's also the project that I
was talking about a bit earlier.

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.158
This is one that I've
worked on called OSM p2p.

16
00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:06.130
It's a peer-to-peer Mac database, and
it's built on all of these tools that I've

17
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.110
showed you hyper log hyper kV
also like a spatial index for

18
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.800
doing queries on OSM like data structures.

19
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.440
I talked a little bit about this as well,
there's a debt hyperdrive or

20
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.190
in depth hyper core.

21
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.466
It's kind of a constellation of
different libraries that you can use for

22
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:33.176
peer-to-peer file sync, so it's more
suitable for having files that are,

23
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:38.281
might replace something like Dropbox,
but they're grant funded and

24
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:43.062
they're mostly building these tools for
scientific use cases.

25
00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:47.438
So but everything in here is
definitely worth checking out and

26
00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:51.394
these are all built in a very
modular fashion as well, so

27
00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:56.885
you can take out little pieces without
having to get the whole thing running.

28
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.405
Fantastic things to look at.
