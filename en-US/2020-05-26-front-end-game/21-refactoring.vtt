WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.570
And then we just really quickly
need to go into our constants.js,

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.313
we need to put one more function in
here which is export const.Get next.

3
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.519
Poop time equals clock.

4
00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.577
And then we're going to return
math.floor math.random times and

5
00:00:24.577 --> 00:00:30.160
what do I put here,
times three plus four plus clock.

6
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.710
Okay, so let's, poop time.

7
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.800
I did zero two seconds plus four seconds.

8
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.453
That's how long it takes before
feet after feeds before poops.

9
00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:49.846
Let me go back to gameState
just really quick and import,

10
00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:52.849
get next poop time, get next poop time.

11
00:00:56.588 --> 00:01:00.494
And let's go ahead and, see that happen.

12
00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.768
I'm gonna change the tick rate to
one second just to make the game go

13
00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:05.590
a little faster.

14
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.840
It means the animations will be kinda
cut off, but that should be fine.

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.594
We just wanna make sure
that everything works.

16
00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:19.500
Okay, so the fox should get hungry and
then you feed it.

17
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.330
And there you go.

18
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.900
Now it's fed.

19
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.770
And then we've kind of stalled out
there because we haven't implemented

20
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.110
time to start celebrating yet.

21
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.180
So yeah, last thing here,
let's go ahead and

22
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.280
implement really quick time to start and
end celebrating.

23
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.060
Change that back to 3000 to
slow down the game a bit.

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.748
And we are gonna put in
two more times here,

25
00:01:50.748 --> 00:01:56.945
timeToStartCelebrating negative one,
and timeToEndCelebrating.

26
00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:05.156
Okay, start celebrating And

27
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:09.258
do it here underneath maybe die,
startCelebrating.

28
00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:18.974
And this is gonna be
this.current = CELEBRATING,

29
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.478
modFox celebrate

30
00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:33.681
This.timeToStartCelebrating equals
negative one,

31
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:37.312
cuz it's already started celebrating.

32
00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:42.266
And it's gonna say
this.timeToEndCelebrating is going to be

33
00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:48.350
equal to this.clock and I again gave it
two but you can mess around with that.

34
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.302
Okay, and then endCelebrating.

35
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.907
It's gonna be another function.

36
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.406
And here we're gonna put
this.timeToEndCelebrating

37
00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:06.903
equals negative one.

38
00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:17.128
And we're gonna say this.current,
it's gonna go from celebrating to idling,

39
00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:24.315
Idling and
then we have to write a quick function

40
00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:29.250
really quick called determine Fox state.

41
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.330
So we're gonna say
this.determine fox state.

42
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.613
Now the reason why we're doing this,
if you're coming out of celebrating,

43
00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:40.508
if it's raining you have to go back
to looking away from the camera.

44
00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:46.030
If it's idling, and it's daytime then
it looks normally at the camera.

45
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.770
So that's what determined Fox
state is gonna do for us.

46
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.601
And we're gonna say,
if this.current triple equals idling,

47
00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:02.682
which it always should,
if we call this function.

48
00:04:02.682 --> 00:04:07.608
Then we're gonna check the scene and
sort of say if scenes

49
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.951
This start scene triple

50
00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:21.549
equals rain, then MOD fox

51
00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.158
rain else MOD fox idling.

52
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.100
Now, what's great about this is we
can actually go back to wake as well.

53
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.590
And we can remove
the modFox idling here and

54
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.680
underneath the modScene here,
we can just put it the last thing is even.

55
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.331
We can just put this.determine
fox state and we can reuse that

56
00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:58.260
same Bit of logic that we wrote.

57
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.700
So now when the day wakes up and
it's raining,

58
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.688
the fox will be appropriately
facing away or facing the camera.

59
00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:11.476
Okay, so now the fox should be able

60
00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:17.610
to be fed and it should celebrate.

61
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.810
So you can see now the fox is
appropriately facing away.

62
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.780
We'll wait just a bit of time and
then the fox will want to eat.

63
00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:35.630
Maybe, at some point, it might.

64
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.350
Then we can feed it.

65
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.726
So the fox is fed,
is sitting there fat and happy.

66
00:05:40.726 --> 00:05:43.256
You know the one part we didn't do?

67
00:05:43.256 --> 00:05:44.760
We didn't do the tick part.

68
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.930
So, good reminder to go
do that really quick.

69
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.981
So hop back into VS code really quick and
we need to do right here.

70
00:05:55.291 --> 00:06:01.322
So else if this.clock, triple equals

71
00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:06.806
this.time to start celebrating,

72
00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:11.204
this.start celebrating.

73
00:06:12.723 --> 00:06:17.116
Else if this.clock triple equals time

74
00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:21.509
this.start time to end celebrating,

75
00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:27.110
then you're gonna call
this.end celebrating.

76
00:06:30.453 --> 00:06:32.391
All right, one more time.

77
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:43.050
And actually we can well, we're in
a now So the fox should begin idling.

78
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.190
Notice the fox is appropriately
facing the camera because it's day.

79
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.613
It should begin getting hungry anytime.

80
00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:01.898
Okay, it's hungry, so we'll feed the fox.

81
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.834
And then it's celebrating,
very happy that you fed it.

82
00:07:11.257 --> 00:07:12.730
And then it's back to idling.

83
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.430
So that's kind of
completed that loop there.

84
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.980
And now the fox has a poop time, but
we haven't acted on that poop time yet.

85
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.240
Which is what the next section the act
of cleaning poop section will be about.
