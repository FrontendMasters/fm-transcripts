1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.195
So here we're gonna
take a bit of a detour.

2
00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:04.360
And we're gonna just focus on the HTML,
the CSS, and

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.450
get everything looking nice and available.

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.720
Again, I wrote a decent amount
of the CSS for you, and

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.950
then we're gonna write
some of it together.

6
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.134
I wrote all the animations because
I'm not a CSS animation person.

7
00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:16.543
It took me a while to write these and

8
00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:18.791
I'm probably not the best
person to teach them to you.

9
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.834
But there's great courses on
CSS on Frontend Masters, so

10
00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:23.520
definitely go check those out.

11
00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:29.568
Okay, so let's go back to our editor.

12
00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:34.658
And I'm just going to close this.

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.281
So the first thing is we're
gonna over to index.html, and

14
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:43.280
we're just gonna put
some more stuff in here.

15
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.484
So inside of the head,
we need to import our CSS.

16
00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:54.912
So the first thing we're gonna
put in is a link to a stylesheet.

17
00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:59.038
And the first one we'll
put in is ./sprites.css.

18
00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:05.425
Okay, and you can even look here in as
soon as I did that we got a nice little

19
00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:07.557
background cuz I set up that for you.

20
00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:16.037
And again, I'm assuming that you're
doing this with the sprites.css there,

21
00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:20.708
the background, and the pet, that
should all be in this source directory.

22
00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:22.850
If not,
you should go grab that now from the repo.

23
00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:33.964
Okay, we're also gonna put one in here,
href equals and

24
00:01:33.964 --> 00:01:39.196
we're gonna make one of our own, which
we haven't created yet called style.css.

25
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.812
Okay?

26
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:47.501
And then let's go down into the body.

27
00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:51.699
So and
it will put down there at the bottom.

28
00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:59.873
The first thing is we're gonna
have div class="container".

29
00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:03.450
Let's commute the container for
the entire course of the game.

30
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.629
So I'm gonna show you a little
hack that I do with VS code now.

31
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.989
You saw I can type out
div class="container" or

32
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.430
with VS code has a thing
called Emmet built into it.

33
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.990
It's what generated our HTML shell for us.

34
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.425
If I put .inner,
like the CSS selector for that.

35
00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:27.670
And I just hit tab,
it'll complete it out to full HTML,

36
00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.524
Which is pretty nice.

37
00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:35.575
Emmet is available for
other editors as well just search.

38
00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:38.938
I think it's emmet.io, E-M-M-E-T.io.

39
00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:42.752
Okay?

40
00:02:42.752 --> 00:02:47.772
And then we're just gonna put some more
divs in here that we can use to style.

41
00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:51.570
So we're gonna put .game .day cuz
we're gonna start a game in day.

42
00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:55.760
We're not gonna put anything in it.

43
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.307
We're gonna put .fox .hidden.

44
00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:01.112
Not put anything in that.

45
00:03:01.112 --> 00:03:05.874
We're gonna put the poop back,
that's very important poop-bag and

46
00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:08.706
that's gonna be hidden upfront as well.

47
00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:18.373
Then we're gonna put the foreground,
-rain.

48
00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:22.221
So when it rains there's like
the the rain that actually comes down.

49
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:23.140
That's what this is.

50
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.990
We're put the frame which
is gonna the game frame,

51
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.920
like the actual plastic part of the game,
right?

52
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.955
That's what the frame is.

53
00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.411
And then we're gonna put a modal,
M-O-D-A-L,

54
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:42.848
that's the name of the element
that like pops over with the text.

55
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.020
It's purple in the game.

56
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.170
And inside of modal,
we're gonna have .modal-inner.

57
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.696
And inside of that, we're gonna have
Press the middle button to start.

58
00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:02.620
Okay, we're getting close here.

59
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.461
So outside of modal, One thing I wanna
say is if you're trying to follow

60
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:16.606
along with My CSS and using spreads.css,
you do need to have the same structure and

61
00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:20.480
the same CSS classes as me or
My CSS is not gonna work for you.

62
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.640
So it's important that you
copy this kind of exactly.

63
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.597
And if something's not working,
just go copy and

64
00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:35.869
paste the index.html from any one
of the sections from the repo.

65
00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:39.850
Yeah, just grab it from
the next milestone.

66
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.440
That's probably what I will say.

67
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.427
So underneath the modal, we're gonna
make a div and call it buttons and

68
00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:47.898
inside of that, we're gonna put buttons.

69
00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:52.699
And then inside of the buttons,
we're gonna have three different buttons.

70
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.060
So we're gonna do .ptn, and
we're gonna make three of them with Emmet.

71
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.330
If I put the times 3 there, it'll actually
generate three exactly of what I put in.

72
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.618
So now I'm gonna have
three buttons in here.

73
00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:07.127
One of them's gonna be the left button.

74
00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:13.923
As you might have guessed,
this one is the middle button.

75
00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.857
And unsurprisingly, the right button.

76
00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:23.550
Underneath the buttons,
then we're gonna have icons.

77
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.269
So here we're gonna put in icons.

78
00:05:27.464 --> 00:05:35.816
And inside of that,
we're gonna have three icons, so .icon*3.

79
00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:38.210
And here we're gonna have highlighted for

80
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.278
the first one cuz it's gonna
be highlighted at first.

81
00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:48.665
The fish icon, the poop icon,
and the weather icon.

82
00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.987
And these are all the different
things that they can select, right?

83
00:05:56.333 --> 00:06:02.495
Okay, so you should be able to save that.

84
00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:07.454
And if we look at our terminal,
it's probably gonna be upset.

85
00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.902
I'm getting some crazy error.

86
00:06:12.902 --> 00:06:15.562
The problem that we have right now
is we don't have a style.css and

87
00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:16.854
we said that there's gonna be.

88
00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:21.809
And so Parcel's upset that we're trying
to reference a file that doesn't exist,

89
00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:22.314
right?

90
00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:25.881
So the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna go make that style.css so

91
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:28.248
that it stops yelling at
us that doesn't exist.

92
00:06:28.248 --> 00:06:31.129
So make a new file inside
of your source directory.

93
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.652
So fox-game, here inside of source,

94
00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:39.041
we're gonna make a new
file called Style.css.

95
00:06:41.732 --> 00:06:43.852
Okay, we're not gonna do
anything with it right now,

96
00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:45.338
it's totally fine that it's empty.

97
00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:49.901
An empty CSS file is still valid.

98
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:53.465
And I'm gonna just stop and
start my server again.

99
00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:56.870
And you can see it's happy now.

100
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.680
So if I refresh, we kinda see this,
it's just a bunch of stuff on a page.

101
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.090
But you can see here's all
the stuff I've kinda done for you.

102
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.540
Here's the icons, these all have
hover states and active states.

103
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.935
If I press the button, they go red.

104
00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:14.335
But nothing's happening.

105
00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.625
It's all style with no brains, right?

106
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:19.835
It has no JavaScript associated with it.

107
00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.665
So it's not gonna do anything.

108
00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:24.299
But you should be seeing
something akin to this.

109
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.563
If you don't, don't worry in just a second
there's gonna be another milestone which

110
00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:30.474
is css-completed.

111
00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:34.103
And you can just grab all that stuff and
if anything here fell behind.

112
00:07:36.437 --> 00:07:39.184
And the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna write a bit of CSS to make

113
00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:39.960
this all look nice.
