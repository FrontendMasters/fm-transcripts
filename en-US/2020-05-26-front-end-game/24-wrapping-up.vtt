1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.033
That's it.

2
00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:06.795
You, and
I pair coded on a fox game together.

3
00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:07.735
And it works.

4
00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:10.503
It's, let's say of mild amusement.

5
00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:15.028
I don't know if you're gonna be playing
this for hours and keeping it alive, but,

6
00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:16.916
more power to you if you choose to.

7
00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.424
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:20.450
And this is the last milestone,
by the way.

9
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.302
This is the code complete game.

10
00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:26.703
This is literally the same
code that I have running.

11
00:00:26.703 --> 00:00:32.503
You can actually see here,
code complete game.

12
00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:36.258
If you go to the GitHub actions,
you can actually see that I have,

13
00:00:36.258 --> 00:00:39.212
it automatically deploys
the code complete game.

14
00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:43.608
So it's actually literally the code

15
00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:48.582
that's running, yeah, for this game.

16
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:49.270
There you go.

17
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.811
Yeah, see, it's the same one.

18
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:53.922
Okay, so that's it.

19
00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:56.473
That is the the entire fox game.

20
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.523
We built it together.

21
00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.760
There's no more to it.

22
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.771
So I just want to wrap up with everything.

23
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.826
So I just wanted to give you some notes,
and things that I chose, and

24
00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:12.973
decisions that I made that you might
reconsider or rethink through.

25
00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:17.360
First one,
I alluded to this at the beginning, but

26
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.040
gamestate.js ended up being quite long.

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.590
Whereas all the other files
are not necessary as long.

28
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.551
This is 170 lines of code, and
there's a decent amount of

29
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:34.018
whitespace in there, so
I'm not heartbroken at how long this is.

30
00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:37.355
And like I said, when I tried to break it
into different pieces, I didn't like it.

31
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:39.200
I liked it better all together, so

32
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.756
I eventually refactored
it back into one file.

33
00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:45.837
But there's a lot of ways you could
have chosen to implement this.

34
00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:48.165
You could use more functional
style programming.

35
00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:51.207
You could have used more
object oriented programming.

36
00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:55.563
There's a lot of directions you could
have gone with this that I chose not to.

37
00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:58.250
I felt like this ended up
being pretty readable code.

38
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.648
You can tell me otherwise,

39
00:02:01.648 --> 00:02:06.903
I'm really interested to see how
people choose to re-implement this.

40
00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:09.742
But in general, I tried to have
problems before I solved them.

41
00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:13.550
If I had tried to break this
down into more files right now,

42
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.082
I feel like if I would have caused
more problems than I would have had.

43
00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:22.933
So that's kind of where
I ended up on that.

44
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:25.537
The CSS ended up going in two files and

45
00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:31.181
it definitely could have been broken
down into like a fox.css, a frame.css.

46
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:33.301
And I just didn't really
know where to go with that.

47
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:38.462
Again, I feel okay about where
we ended up, style.css ends

48
00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:44.700
up being 150 lines of CSS with
a lot of whitespace in there.

49
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.713
And sprites was a bit longer than that,
I think.

50
00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:51.663
So that's kind of an arbitrary philosophy.

51
00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:55.374
If this had been something like React, it
would have been more component oriented.

52
00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:58.452
But we didn't do a component
Oriented Architecture here.

53
00:02:58.452 --> 00:03:01.653
So that's where we ended up with that.

54
00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:05.925
Tests, this code ended up in very testable
ways like something like mod fox,

55
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:08.947
it'd be very easy to put like
a spy on query selector and

56
00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:12.052
make sure that it's called
with the right parameters.

57
00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:15.007
Same here with buttons.

58
00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:18.179
And then here with game state,
you could import game state and

59
00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.536
just make sure that it's
transitioning to the correct current.

60
00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:24.985
And that would be a pretty good
place to do some unit tests there.

61
00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:30.321
So that's more stretch goals for
you to go play with and try testing.

62
00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:33.522
This would not this project would
have benefited from TypeScript.

63
00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:35.782
And it would not be hard to
convert it to TypeScript.

64
00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:43.033
So again, something for you to look at.

65
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.450
I love GitHub actions.

66
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.672
They're like my new favorite toy.

67
00:03:46.672 --> 00:03:50.916
So you can see here again, both
the project files for the fox game and

68
00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:54.810
the other repo are using GitHub
actions pretty extensively.

69
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.164
And this is allows you to automatically
deploy your code to GitHub Pages.

70
00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:00.941
I would definitely invite
you to check that out.

71
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.898
They're not super hard to write.

72
00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:07.623
And yeah they allow you to automatically
deploy your code, automatically

73
00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:11.718
run prettier, automatically run ES lint
on everything that goes into your repo.

74
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:16.043
So that's another thing you
could definitely go look at.

75
00:04:16.043 --> 00:04:17.322
Make a framework version of this.

76
00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:21.150
I think that would be pretty cool if you
went back and did Svelte or Angular.

77
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.952
Something like that.

78
00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:25.504
Co-op parenting is what I call this,

79
00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:28.281
it'd be really cool to write like
a central server version of this.

80
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.523
It's hosted in node.js.

81
00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:31.937
And so that like me and

82
00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:36.033
Jumana could like play the same
game at the same time, right?

83
00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:39.098
And it would be keeping track of
all the state on the server and

84
00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:41.877
using WebSockets to real
time update all the clients.

85
00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:43.894
That would be a lot of fun.

86
00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:47.361
And you could definitely use
local storage here as well.

87
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:51.902
If I started the game and then close
my window and came back to it, it could

88
00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:56.384
reload the same state and you could
use local storage to do that as well.

89
00:04:56.384 --> 00:04:59.794
So, there's a bunch of ideas of
ways you could think about this,

90
00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:03.764
ways you could go change it, kind of
all the various different directions.

91
00:05:03.764 --> 00:05:06.441
You could go with this.

92
00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:08.161
And that's it.

93
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.740
I'm very grateful again
to Frontend Masters for

94
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.890
letting me come back and teach this again.

95
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.630
Please, again,
make versions of this hosted on GitHub.

96
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.292
Share them with me.

97
00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:24.085
I'm very interested in all
the various different cool things

98
00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:26.121
that you do with the game.

99
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:28.030
And yeah, I wanna see him.

100
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.333
And yeah, thanks.

101
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:33.833
