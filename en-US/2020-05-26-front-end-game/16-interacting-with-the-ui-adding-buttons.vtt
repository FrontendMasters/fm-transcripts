1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.126
So we're gonna add now some
interaction to our UIs.

2
00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:07.519
And the first thing we're to do is
the buttons, make the buttons work, so

3
00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.550
that when I click the button here,
let's just refresh the page.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.363
When I click the button here, it'll move
between the various different states from

5
00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:16.415
the fish, to the poop,
to the weather icon.

6
00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.793
So let's go ahead and do that.

7
00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:23.325
So head back over to VS Code,

8
00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:28.334
make a new file and call it buttons.js.

9
00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:37.224
Okay, we're gonna import something called
icons which we haven't created yet,

10
00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:41.923
but we're about to from another
file called ./constants.

11
00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:46.845
And then we're gonna do
a couple functions here.

12
00:00:46.845 --> 00:00:50.066
The first one that we're gonna
do is toggle highlighted.

13
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.410
So const toggleHighlighted.

14
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.070
And I made this an arrow function.

15
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.059
Let's go ahead and
do that cuz this is how I would write it.

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.719
So it's gonna take in an icon, and

17
00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.760
it's gonna take on whether I'm gonna
be showing or hiding that icon, right?

18
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940
This is gonna be an arrow function.

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.460
So again, this is a ligature.

20
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.830
So if I put equal and

21
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.310
angle bracket together, my font combines
them together and it looks like an arrow.

22
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.211
So, whenever you see that,
that's two characters together.

23
00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:32.462
And then I'm gonna do
document.querySelector.

24
00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:36.142
This is going to allow me to
select an item from the DOM,

25
00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:38.562
from the HTML part of this, right?

26
00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:44.845
And I'm going to be looking for, and
notice I'm using backticks here,

27
00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:50.522
which is the one that is the tilde
next to the one on your keyboard.

28
00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:56.046
And I'm going to be looking for
icons, icon.

29
00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:04.470
And then outside of that
I'm gonna put -icon.

30
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.858
Okay, so what this dollar sign curly brace
is saying like inside of here I have

31
00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:09.750
JavaScript.

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.651
So in this case, icon is gonna
be a number, this right here.

33
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.742
And this icons is going to be a list
of all the various different icons

34
00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:17.730
that are available.

35
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.740
So it'll be, in this case,
fish, poop, and weather, right?

36
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.810
So and then it'll toggle these particular
icons as highlighted or not highlighted.

37
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.666
So I'm gonna do .class list.toggle.

38
00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:43.510
And then I'm gonna be toggling
the CSS class highlighted.

39
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.172
And whether or not that's show.

40
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.031
So now anytime that I call,
it will look like this toggleHighlighted,

41
00:02:57.238 --> 00:02:59.522
Fish, true.

42
00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:02.961
This would make the fish icon
on the DOM highlighted, right?

43
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:07.970
Or if I did like poop, false,
this would unhighlight it, right?

44
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.413
So that's kinda what that function does.

45
00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:15.844
So again, this is an arrow function, and
I could have just as well done this.

46
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.731
So now it's actually a function body,
right?

47
00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:23.794
But because it's just a one liner,
I'm welcome to just,

48
00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:25.680
I can leave out those curly braces.

49
00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.450
So it's up to you what's more readable,
I like this but

50
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.436
it's up to you if you don't like that.

51
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.773
Notice when I save it, it reorganizes
itself, that's prettier in action there.

52
00:03:42.773 --> 00:03:46.772
Okay, I'm gonna do export default,

53
00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:51.514
Function init buttons.

54
00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:55.906
And then it's gonna take in
a function called handle user action.

55
00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:04.210
Okay, so this is a function that's gonna
handle all of our user interactions.

56
00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.186
So we're gonna use closures
again to keep track of this.

57
00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:13.322
So I'm gonna say let selectedI = 0.

58
00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:18.106
This is the currently selected
icon like the index of it.

59
00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:22.700
The first one that's gonna be
selected is going to be the 0th one,

60
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.597
which will be the fish one.

61
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.773
And then I'm gonna have a function
here called button click,

62
00:04:28.773 --> 00:04:32.560
function buttonClick and
it's gonna take in an event.

63
00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:45.291
And we're just gonna say

64
00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:50.709
if event.target.

65
00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:52.977
So in my notes I actually have
this written differently.

66
00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:57.040
So event is the name of the DOM event
that's gonna be coming in, right?

67
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.016
But I can actually select, If I do this
and I put curly braces inside of it,

68
00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:08.414
I'm gonna pull the target out of
the event, which is what I've done here.

69
00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:12.072
So instead of having event.target
I can just say target.

70
00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:15.469
And target is gonna be the actual DOM
node that I've clicked on, right.

71
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.682
So for example, if I come back over here,
if I click on this,

72
00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:22.211
it'll say this is the target,
the left button will be the target.

73
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:24.520
The middle button will be the target,
the right will be the target.

74
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.594
So this is the DOM node
that I've clicked on.

75
00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:39.384
So if I say target.classlist.contains,

76
00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:44.324
left-btn.

77
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:49.461
So if I have clicked on the left button,
is basically what this says.

78
00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:56.274
Then toggleHighlighted, SelectedIcon.

79
00:06:00.738 --> 00:06:02.031
And turn that off, false.

80
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:05.420
So the currently selected one,
turn off the highlighting.

81
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:11.368
And then you're gonna set a new
selected icon, so (selectedIcon

82
00:06:14.822 --> 00:06:20.661
= 2 + selectedIcon).

83
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.258
I'm gonna use what's called the modelo or
modulo or however you want to call it, but

84
00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:27.156
it's the percentage sign there.

85
00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:31.601
ICONS.length; So

86
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:35.231
let's talk about what this means.

87
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.152
Modulo is a really interesting operator.

88
00:06:37.152 --> 00:06:42.168
It's kind of like if you've ever done
long division before, and you ever had

89
00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:47.352
to do like the remainder, so like ten
divided by three was three remainder one.

90
00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:50.342
What modular returns here
is the remainder, right?

91
00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:53.158
So if I did 10%3,

92
00:06:53.158 --> 00:06:58.485
let's put this above here, 10%3.

93
00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:02.262
What's the remainder of 3 divided by 10 or
10 divided by 3?

94
00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:03.907
1, right, so this would equal to 1.

95
00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:05.477
So this is really useful for

96
00:07:05.477 --> 00:07:09.340
our lists because we're gonna
be looping around right.

97
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.720
So, if I come back to the game,
if I go to the right to,

98
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.430
or if I click the left button right now,
I expect weather to be highlighted.

99
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.015
So I want it to loop around.

100
00:07:20.015 --> 00:07:25.535
And that's what the modular is really
used for because if I say plus 2,

101
00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:31.515
in this particular case, if I did plus 2,
and let's say it was the last one,

102
00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:35.935
so I was like here,
it would loop back around to this one.

103
00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:37.254
Does it make sense kind of?

104
00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:41.051
It's a little mathy.

105
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:44.174
You could also do, I believe,
negative one here.

106
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.590
And I think that should work as well.

107
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.312
But the modulo math to me was
clearer in my brain if I did two.

108
00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:57.623
So that's why I ended up doing that way.

109
00:07:57.623 --> 00:08:00.488
When I'm doing modular in math,
I try to stay positive,

110
00:08:00.488 --> 00:08:02.706
just in general, stay positive with life.

111
00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:05.298
But beyond that, it's easier for
me to picture in my brains, so

112
00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:06.553
that's why I did the plus two.

113
00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:12.650
Okay, and then now that I've selected
the correct one, I'm gonna call

114
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.460
toggleHighlighted again because I've
changed the selectedIcon up here.

115
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.083
And I just call selectedIcon and true,

116
00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.552
cuz that will be then
highlighting the correct one.

117
00:08:23.552 --> 00:08:27.095
Then we're gonna do an else if,

118
00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:31.955
that's gonna be exactly the same for
but for

119
00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:38.272
the right
target.classlist.constainsright-btn.

120
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.189
And we're gonna do the exact same sort
of song and dance toggleHighlighted,

121
00:08:45.189 --> 00:08:48.729
selectedIcon, false, and
then we're gonna do our math.

122
00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:54.813
So we're gonna say selectedIcon = 1 +,

123
00:08:54.813 --> 00:09:00.897
cuz it's gonna go in the other direction,

124
00:09:00.897 --> 00:09:06.481
1 + selectedIcon % ICONS.length.

125
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:11.435
So anytime that you're thinking
about looping back around in

126
00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:16.402
programming and since,
the modulo is super useful for that.

127
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:20.967
All right.

128
00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:29.488
And then else,
We are going to do handleUserAction,

129
00:09:29.488 --> 00:09:34.496
and we're gonna pass back
the icon that was selected.

130
00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:41.460
So we're gonna take in here a function
from our gameState, and any time that

131
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.924
the user tries to do something, right,
they click on the feed button or

132
00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:48.650
they click on the poop button, we're
going to respond to that user action.

133
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.282
But we're gonna handle that inside of
gameState and not inside of the buttons.

134
00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:55.139
So we're kinda separating our concerns of
this is happening in the user interface,

135
00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:57.167
this is happening inside
of the game logic.

136
00:09:57.167 --> 00:09:59.022
Okay, so all of that looks good.

137
00:09:59.022 --> 00:10:04.774
Then we just need to do,
document.getElementBy,

138
00:10:04.774 --> 00:10:11.452
we're actually going to query selector,
query selector.

139
00:10:11.452 --> 00:10:14.016
And we're gonna look for
the .buttons, right?

140
00:10:14.016 --> 00:10:17.643
The HTML buttons container
that we created.

141
00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:21.230
And we're gonna add an event listener.

142
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:27.789
Anytime that it's clicked, we're going
to call buttons or buttonClick rather.

143
00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:34.503
So now all we have to do is initialize
this, we just call this function and

144
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:38.491
the buttons are gonna have this
event listener tied to them.
