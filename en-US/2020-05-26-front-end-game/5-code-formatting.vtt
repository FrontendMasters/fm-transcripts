00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.360
So I have my favorite project and
all JavaScript land is prettier.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.180
It's a tool that takes your code and
re-formats it into a consistent style.

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.330
If you're coming from other
languages like Galician or from Goa,

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.300
languages like that, they have formatting
tools kinda built into the language.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.685
That's my favorite part
about the GO community,

6
00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:25.050
is that they just have go format,
and everything just looks the same.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.020
And you never have to think about,
show you tab, show you spaces,

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.000
show you,
of all these different kind of things.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.220
It's like,
there's just one set of rules, and

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.330
it just always works and
everyone uses the same thing.

11
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.410
So I greatly admire that
about the GO community.

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.390
So JavaScript has a tool that's becoming
more and more standard called prettier.

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.535
Written by a guy that I really admire,
named James Long,

14
00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:52.162
and we're gonna use that now in our code.

15
00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:54.953
The great thing about prettier
is it just re-formats your code,

16
00:00:54.953 --> 00:00:58.010
it uses the same amount of spaces,
it uses the same rules for everyone.

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.580
So we can stop arguing,
do you want tabs, do you want spaces,

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.340
do you want semicolons, do you want a
space here, do you not want a space here?

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.480
All the stuff just goes out the window,
because the Prettier just does it for you,

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.914
and you can't argue with the tool,
because the tool wins, right?

21
00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:15.811
So let's go seeing how to make this work.

22
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.434
So we're here back in the command line,
instead of our project, and I'm gonna say

23
00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:27.783
npm install code I, that would work
as well, -D Prettier, like that.

24
00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:35.380
And you'll get a bunch of stuff.

25
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.070
You can ignore the errors and
stuff like that.

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.845
It's totally fine.

27
00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.290
Okay, so now,
I have prettier in my project.

28
00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:49.790
And we're gonna go into my project and
we're going to create a new file.

29
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.243
And we're gonna save it
at the root of the drive,

30
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:57.288
not inside a source inside of
the root of our project, and

31
00:01:57.288 --> 00:02:03.438
it's gonna be called .prettierrc, so that
it's very important that you call that,

32
00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:07.434
because that's what prettier
is gonna be looking for.

33
00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:11.710
So .prettierrc, and it's gonna say,

34
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.864
are you sure,
you're gonna say yes, and then,

35
00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:21.390
I want you to just put
opening curly brace,

36
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.697
closing curly brace, and just save it.

37
00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:27.370
Now, you might be wondering
why did we do that?

38
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.420
That seems kind of odd to do that.

39
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.640
Prettier does have some, like knobs that
you can turn is like I want four spaces or

40
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.280
two spaces.

41
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.850
I don't care.

42
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.830
I just want the tool to work.

43
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.670
So when you put the opening curly
brace here, you're informing prettier.

44
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.000
This is a prettier project.

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.800
So please format it.

46
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.240
And then,
I don't have any configurations, right.

47
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.196
So if I wanted to, I could say like,

48
00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:53.348
end of lines, I want LF,
or something like that.

49
00:02:53.348 --> 00:02:55.910
That's the Linux formatted end of lines.

50
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.684
I think you can put likes, oops.

51
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.130
Anyway, there's a bunch of configurations.

52
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.390
I don't really care,
just do whatever, okay?

53
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.170
So that's how we're gonna get
prettier to work with our project.

54
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.690
The next thing if you're using VS code,
I want you to come over here to

55
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.410
the extensions part,
which is this little tab right here.

56
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.730
And I want you to search in
the extensions marketplace for

57
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.360
prettier and there's a few of them.

58
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.070
The one that we want is one
written by Esben Peterson.

59
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.255
You can see it,
you can know it's the right one,

60
00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:33.530
cuz it has like almost over 6
million downloads, it's that one.

61
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.430
I want you to install that one.

62
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.230
If you're using sublime, if you're using
them, or Emacs, or something like that,

63
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.840
they all have their own plugins for it.

64
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.220
You'll have to figure that on your own.

65
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.100
But if using VS code,
this is really easy to do, and then.

66
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.720
The last thing I need you to do,

67
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.420
is that we're gonna just sit some
configurations inside of our VS code.

68
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.510
So if you're on Mac,
its command comma that I want you to hit.

69
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.350
If you're on PC, I believe it's
Ctrl comma, and at the worst,

70
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.300
you just come into, your looking for
preferences, settings.

71
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.500
That's what I want you to find.

72
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.120
So you should see something like this.

73
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.450
The first one I want you to search for

74
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.060
is format on save, this one here,
make sure that that's checked.

75
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.610
And then, I want you to look for
prettier, and there's one that's

76
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.780
called Type in prettier require config.

77
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.100
So it's this top one here.

78
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.680
I don't have it checked, so I want
you to check this one at the moment.

79
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.796
What's nice about this,
is it's telling the prettier extension,

80
00:04:42.796 --> 00:04:46.136
if you don't see prettierrc,
then don't use prettier on this project.

81
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.913
So then you can just leave this
installed all the time, and

82
00:04:51.913 --> 00:04:55.100
you never have to think about, do I need
to enable and disable this extension?

83
00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:02.285
Okay, so now, what's great about this is,

84
00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:08.221
is like I can come over to, well,
we don't have any JavaScript yet.

85
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:10.420
But this should work with the HTML, right?

86
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.230
Yeah.

87
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.510
So notice that, like I can take all
the formatting out of my HTML, and

88
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.820
then, whenever I hit Command S,
everything just readjust magically.

89
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.730
This is the prettier extension running
prettier on your code automatically.

90
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.210
That's what's great, is that I never
have to think about, do I have the right

91
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.489
indentation, and do I have the right
semi colons, do I have the right style?

92
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.260
Prettier just takes care of all that,
so you get to shut down that

93
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.300
thread in your brain that's thinking
about, okay, do I need to add space,

94
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.330
do I need to subtract, or something
like that, it just works out of the box.

95
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.930
So that is what prettier is.

96
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.230
Here are my notes, I talked about how
to configure it with the command line.

97
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.630
I'll just leave that to your exercise if
you wanna go into the notes and do that.

98
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.070
For now, this is just totally fine for
us to work this way.
