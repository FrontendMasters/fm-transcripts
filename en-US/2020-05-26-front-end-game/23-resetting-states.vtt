1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.110
So, we needed to do one
more thing in UI.js.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.277
We're gonna make another function here,
called writeModal.

3
00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:19.034
And, here in function writeModal,
it's gonna take in

4
00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:24.103
some sort of text, and
we're gonna default to blank text.

5
00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:27.690
That's what this text = blah,
this is a default.

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.287
So if I don't call with anything,
it's just gonna give me an empty string.

7
00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:35.504
And I wanna say, document.querySelector.

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.537
And, I'm going to ask for .modal.

9
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.199
And.

10
00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:56.932
We're gonna do a .innerHTML, cuz we
want this to be interpreted as HTML,

11
00:00:56.932 --> 00:01:00.698
because we wanna be able
to write HTML to it.

12
00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:02.641
=div

13
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:12.641
className="modal-Inner".

14
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:19.081
And actually, we probably could have just
left this, in fact, let's just do this.

15
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.966
So I'm gonna do modal-Inner.

16
00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:29.470
That's why we did that.

17
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.047
Okay, this makes sense to me now.

18
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.367
So we're gonna say, div className, or

19
00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:43.740
class="modal-Inner"&gt;&lt;/div.

20
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.540
And we're gonna put the text in there,
that we put in.

21
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.188
Now, why are we rewriting
the modal-Inner every single time?

22
00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:55.425
It's because we want to hide the modal
when there's no text in there.

23
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:59.056
And we did that with that CSS Selector.

24
00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.375
And so, that's why,

25
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:04.340
that's why we're rewriting
the modal-Inner every single time.

26
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.520
So now that we've rewritten that,
we can go back to gameState.js.

27
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.905
And we can import the top here, from UI.

28
00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:23.080
WriteModal.

29
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.870
And the first thing we're gonna do is,
whenever we start the game, we're just

30
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.890
gonna write modal with no text, and that
should drop our little button thing here.

31
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.070
So if I press this.

32
00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:39.671
That's still showing up,
which is curious, it shouldn't.

33
00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.225
And, here install that CSS.

34
00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:12.919
Cuz all these CSS classes should
have gone at modal-Inner probably

35
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:29.190
Yep, okay, cool, here we go.

36
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.700
So, this was a mistake on my part.

37
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.370
Go back to your style.CSS.

38
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.760
And I had here, on my line 86,
with the modal class, here.

39
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.600
This is actually supposed to
be the style for modal-Inner.

40
00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:52.812
And now if I refresh,
and I press the button,

41
00:03:52.812 --> 00:03:56.810
it'll actually remove that modal.

42
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.630
So again, style.CSS.

43
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.830
Down here at the bottom
was where I had modal.

44
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.349
Just make this the style class for
modal-Inner.

45
00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:12.708
And now when we start the game,
it'll remove that modal at the top.

46
00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:18.257
Okay?

47
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:28.250
So let's go ahead and
go back to gameState.js.

48
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.385
And we're gonna write a function really
quick that's called clearTimes, so.

49
00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:36.190
ClearTimes.

50
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.610
And this is something we can call when the
fox dies as well as when it goes to sleep,

51
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.020
it just clears out all
the existing timers.

52
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.220
So we're gonna say, this.wakeTime = -1.

53
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.046
This.sleepTime = -1.

54
00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:57.623
This.hungryTime = -1.

55
00:04:57.623 --> 00:05:02.064
This.dieTime = -1.

56
00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:10.886
This.poopTime = -1.

57
00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:16.388
And this.timeToEndCelebrating = -1.

58
00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:21.684
This.timeTo, we need begin here as well.

59
00:05:25.378 --> 00:05:32.093
I called start, this.startCelebrating.

60
00:05:32.093 --> 00:05:33.080
I can't remember what I called it.

61
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.761
TimeToStartCelebrating, that one, = -1.

62
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:43.464
Okay, so this is just gonna clear
all the different timers, so

63
00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:48.550
that when we call it we can be
guaranteed that nothing is happening.

64
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.675
So, let's go to sleep, first of all.

65
00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.963
So I'm gonna call, and make sure you
call it before you set wakeTime,

66
00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:59.750
because you don't wanna
clear out wakeTime.

67
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.294
So I'm gonna do it here,
above this.wakeTime,

68
00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:08.958
this.clearTimes, and
then it resets wakeTime.

69
00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:13.950
So this way we can guarantee that the fox
is not gonna get hungry in the night,

70
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.104
it's not gonna get, it's not gonna poop
in the night, all that kinda stuff.

71
00:06:19.104 --> 00:06:26.126
Okay, and then here,
we're gonna go down to, die.

72
00:06:31.294 --> 00:06:36.175
And here we're gonna say,
this.current = "DEAD".

73
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:45.377
ModScene('dead').

74
00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:49.666
ModFox('dead').

75
00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:52.600
This.sleepTime.

76
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.927
Well, actually, we can just say here,
we can just say, this.clearTime.

77
00:06:59.047 --> 00:07:00.599
And then we're gonna write to the modal.

78
00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:09.183
The fox died, frowny face.

79
00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:10.638
I'm gonna put a line break there.

80
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:14.856
So the &lt;br/&gt; Press

81
00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:20.484
the middle button to start.

82
00:07:20.484 --> 00:07:23.529
So that the user knows that they can
press the button to restart the game.

83
00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:30.460
So now let's start the game.

84
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.699
And if we just let it go
on washed after this,

85
00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.587
eventually it should hit that die code.

86
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:45.864
And we'll see a different scene,
we'll see the tombstone, and

87
00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:50.526
we'll see a modal at the top that says,
the fox has died, frowny face,

88
00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.812
press the middle button to start.

89
00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:54.808
So, fox is hungry.

90
00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:02.430
And eventually, there you go.

91
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.970
And then we hit the death scene.

92
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.580
And then you should be able to press
the middle button, again, cuz we kinda

93
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.780
coded this up at the beginning, we don't
have to do anything additional now.

94
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.270
It'll restart the game with a new fox.

95
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.370
Again, just leveraging all
the code that we wrote together.
