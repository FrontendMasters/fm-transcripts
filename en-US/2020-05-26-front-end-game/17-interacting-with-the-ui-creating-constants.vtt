1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.750
Let's go make their constants.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.980
So go and make constants.js
inside of your source directory,

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.310
and we're gonna put two things in here,
export, const TICK_RATE.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.906
So we're gonna move our TICK_RATE
into here, make that 3000.

5
00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:25.134
And export const ICONS fish,

6
00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:30.350
poop, and weather.

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.330
So why are we putting
this in a separate file?

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.910
One, it just makes it
easier to keep track of.

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.550
And let's say later that we add
a new feature that, I don't know,

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.800
you can give them a bath, or
something like that, right?

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.940
It would be really easy to come in here
and modify the entire game state, and

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.330
if I just put bath in here.

13
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.604
Now it would be expecting another thing,
right.

14
00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:55.350
It would be expecting
another button to be there.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.400
And that's all we would have to do,

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.170
we wouldn't have to change
it multiple places.

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.270
But for now,
we're just gonna have these three.

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.180
So go to init.js.

19
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:11.890
We're gonna delete the TICK_RATE here and
we're gonna import TICK_RATE.

20
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.227
So we're gonna import
TICK_RATE from ./constants.

21
00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:25.710
And then here in the first line of init,

22
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.171
I'm gonna say, InitButtons.

23
00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:34.160
And actually I need to
import that as well.

24
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.483
So yeah, up here at the top as well.

25
00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:42.152
Import InitButtons from ./buttons.

26
00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:50.001
Okay, and
then we're gonna call initButtons and

27
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:54.265
we're going to pass in
Game.handleUserAction.

28
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.740
The next thing that we're gonna do,
is we're gonna head over to game state.

29
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.407
And we're gonna create a function
called handleUserAction.

30
00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:12.060
And we're gonna say console.log icon, and

31
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.250
we'll also take an icon here.

32
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.305
So this is the actual function that's
gonna be called any time someone clicks on

33
00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:20.921
the button.

34
00:02:22.624 --> 00:02:25.657
But now, because it's inside of gameState,

35
00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:31.530
I know it's kinda gone through this kinda
circumlocutious way of making it there.

36
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.870
But now we have the ability to handle
these actions inside of our game state.

37
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.550
And we've kind of divorced
that from the interface.

38
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.720
So now we can handle the interface one
place that can be independently testable.

39
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.642
The interface concerns are all in buttons.

40
00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:50.980
And all the business logic action is
all happening inside of game state,

41
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500
which is where we want it to happen.

42
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:05.060
So I believe now if we go over to our
console, So looks like query selectors.

43
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.270
We have a problem here.

44
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.901
So let's go figure out
what's going on with that.

45
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.547
Document.queryselector is null.

46
00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:14.650
So where is that happening?

47
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.368
It's happening in buttons on line five,
you know what we didn't do maybe?

48
00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.134
So it's complaining that this is null,
right here.

49
00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:31.518
&gt;&gt; Someone in chat said,
I think Brian missed, toggled,

50
00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:36.560
highlighted selected icon true in the else
if section, if that's helpful at all.

51
00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:44.390
&gt;&gt; I did, that's also true, not the
current problem, but one of the problems.

52
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.720
So thank you to the person
who pointed it out in chat.

53
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.505
We actually do need a second toggle
highlighted here, inside of button click,

54
00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:54.000
which is actually gonna
look exactly like this one.

55
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.350
The problem right now is ICONS icon.

56
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.590
&gt;&gt; You're missing the dot
at the beginning of it.

57
00:04:09.108 --> 00:04:10.983
&gt;&gt; The dot at the beginning.

58
00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:12.832
&gt;&gt; Dot.

59
00:04:12.832 --> 00:04:15.250
&gt;&gt; You're right, thank you.

60
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.980
So Ken pointed out,
you need a period here, right,

61
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.050
because this is going to
be a class selector, right?

62
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.100
So this will end up being .fish icon.

63
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.202
That's what this part is
going to evaluate to.

64
00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:33.190
So now if we save that and
come back over here, now hopefully,

65
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.050
you can see here it's looping around,
okay.

66
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.010
We can go the other way, and yeah,
now we can select something on here.

67
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.390
So if we look at our console,
if I click here on the middle button,

68
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.710
it'll tell me I selected fish.

69
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.500
If I go over to the poop and
selected that, it'll give me poop.

70
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.420
And if I go over here,
it should select weather, which is great.

71
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.570
That's all happening inside of gameState.

72
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.090
So now inside of gameState, I can
handle all of this user interactivity.

73
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.586
We have reached the UI
interaction milestone.

74
00:05:05.586 --> 00:05:07.972
So if you've fallen behind or need help or

75
00:05:07.972 --> 00:05:12.110
just wanna see where I'm at, you can hop
over to the UI interaction milestone.

76
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.460
There's a link in the course notes
as well to that part of the repo.
