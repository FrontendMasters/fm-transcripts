WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:03.853
And we have reached
the Transitioning States Milestone.

2
00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:08.543
So if you are following along and you can
head to the Transitioning States Milestone

3
00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:11.156
the code should be in
that state at the moment.

4
00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:17.762
So we're gonna move on to my personal
favorite section which as I've

5
00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:21.680
been talking to in alluding
to it is the pooping section.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.974
So if you head back to Project Fox Game
here we are down here at Pooping, Okay?

7
00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:31.609
So after a fox eats it needs to poop.

8
00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.650
I think that's just laws of nature.

9
00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:42.430
So let's go ahead and make it so that our
fox, our Foxy friend can relieve himself.

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.979
So the next thing we wanna do is we wanna
track pooped time that's underneath

11
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.320
dieTime here, so ahead and
throw out a poopTime.

12
00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:51.923
Make that -1.

13
00:00:53.823 --> 00:00:57.755
Okay, we're gonna add a else if here,

14
00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:02.892
else if (this.clock === this.poopTime).

15
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.690
This.poop is what we're gonna do.

16
00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:18.700
Okay, and then somewhere in
here at a function called poop.

17
00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.980
And let's say this.current = "POOPING".

18
00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:40.889
This.poopTime, = -1 cuz after it poops
it doesn't need to poop anymore.

19
00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:45.101
This.dieTime cuz you can die of poop,

20
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:50.332
that's the thing I'm told,
= getNextDieTime

21
00:01:50.332 --> 00:01:56.893
(this.clock), And
you're gonna modFox to ("pooping").

22
00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:04.719
Okay.

23
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.313
So pretty straightforward,
I think that should be enough for

24
00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:13.480
us to go ahead and see our fox poop.

25
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.549
Just go ahead and
just close that up a little bit.

26
00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:32.339
And, Fox should go ahead and
eat pretty quickly.

27
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.557
And once it's hungry then
we'll go ahead and feed him.

28
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.239
Okay, feed the fox.

29
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.700
Then it should celebrate.

30
00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:01.750
Very happy that we fed it.

31
00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:09.610
And then we'll have to switch over
to the poop here in the middle.

32
00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:19.420
And after a certain amount of time it
should go ahead and begin to poop.

33
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.600
So there we go.

34
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.419
And now our Foxy friend has pooped.

35
00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:33.001
This is actually the real game, so

36
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:35.727
this is actually what I'm about to
program which is the cleaning up part.

37
00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:43.284
Let's go ahead and
clean that up and then here we go.

38
00:03:43.284 --> 00:03:47.507
Okay, [INAUDIBLE] that should
work as we expect it to.

39
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.177
So what we wanna do is
we're gonna go modify our

40
00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:58.335
cleanupPoop action here so
the user can clean up the poop.

41
00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:03.627
So we're gonna say if (this.current

42
00:04:03.627 --> 00:04:10.550
=== 'POOPING'), Then we're gonna say,

43
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.568
well, if it's not equal to 'POOPING'
then we're gonna say return

44
00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:22.113
otherwise we're gonna say this.dieTime,
= -1.

45
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:28.691
We're gonna togglePoopBag to (true)
cuz you want to turn it on, right, so

46
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:29.374
it shakes.

47
00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.683
And the fox just celebrates when
the poop is being cleaned up, so

48
00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:39.026
we can actually just directly
call startCelebrating.

49
00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:43.244
Which is great we don't have to like set a
time or anything like that, we don't have

50
00:04:43.244 --> 00:04:47.346
to program anything new we can just reuse
that same functionality which will also

51
00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:51.356
automatically set the end time, so
we don't have to worry about that either.

52
00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:57.739
Then we can say this.hungryTime,
which is the next part of the cycle here,

53
00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:03.545
= getNextHungryTime or
HungerTime rather with (this.clock),

54
00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:15.700
Okay, and the cool thing is, is that's
really about it for cleaning up the poop.

55
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.690
We're just kind of reusing a lot of
the functionality that we already had.

56
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.314
The last thing that we need to do is
we need to go to the end celebrate.

57
00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:30.958
Because when the fox is celebrating
from the poop cleanup there will be like

58
00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.024
the bag that shuts,
starts shaking is like okay,

59
00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:38.405
cool, we clean up the poop we need
to remove that upon EndCelebration.

60
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:43.373
So we can actually just say,
togglePoopBag(false).

61
00:05:43.373 --> 00:05:48.384
Now, when the fox eats it also celebrates,
and we don't need to hide the poop bag,

62
00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:52.393
but no matter what if we just say
always hide the poop bag it doesn't

63
00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:57.220
matter if it's eating or pooping because
the bag will just get hidden, right?

64
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.031
So we can just always say no matter what
if it's showing or not showing just make

65
00:06:01.031 --> 00:06:04.987
sure it's not showing which is what we're
doing there on line 90 right there.

66
00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:10.319
Okay, again now this should all work.

67
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.087
And that really should be it for pooping.

68
00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:23.111
The nice thing is we were able to largely
piggyback on other functionality that we

69
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:25.119
already had running which is great.

70
00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:29.505
So let's make sure that all that works,

71
00:06:31.148 --> 00:06:34.057
Before we move on to our
last section of coding.

72
00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.200
So feed the fox.

73
00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.161
It's very happy that we fed it.

74
00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.148
It's like it taunts me
with its swinging arms.

75
00:06:50.087 --> 00:06:56.725
So this.poop, = poopTime, returns -1.

76
00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:06.402
ModFox ("pooping") this.dieTime, okay.

77
00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:13.976
And getHungry we do that once we
feed it that's when we set up the,

78
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.190
getNextPoopTime(this.clock).

79
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.544
getNextPoopTime that's
coming from */constants'.

80
00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:30.915
So mysteriously it is not pooping.

81
00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:33.695
Probably should figure that out.

82
00:07:35.874 --> 00:07:41.650
So let's go ahead and do this let's change
the TICK_RATE to something real fast,

83
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.229
so half second ticks.

84
00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.550
And then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna log out every tick.

85
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.580
And we're gonna log out this.

86
00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:09.440
Looks like it worked just fine.

87
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.379
Okay, I don't know what's going on there.

88
00:08:13.782 --> 00:08:17.610
But you can see there all
this stuff is working now.

89
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.210
Must've just not refreshed the page.

90
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.834
Up, and then it got to sleep.

91
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.570
Okay, so that should all be working.

92
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.789
Let's change our tick time back to 3000
cuz that's really hard to keep track of.

93
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:43.829
All right, so, Let's go ahead and

94
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:48.140
go on to there's one thing that we haven't
actually implemented which the change

95
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.280
weather, so let's just go ahead and
do that really quick.

96
00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:58.722
So when you go to change the weather,
cuz that's this last button here,

97
00:08:58.722 --> 00:09:01.221
it should really just flip
between raining and not raining.

98
00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:03.706
It should be pretty quick and simple.

99
00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:10.743
So we're gonna go down to
our changeWeather, And

100
00:09:10.743 --> 00:09:14.739
we're gonna say if (this.,

101
00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:26.637
Let's see if (SCENES),
What's the best way to do this?

102
00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:27.859
Let's go ahead and do it this way.

103
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:36.623
This.scene = this.scene

104
00:09:36.623 --> 00:09:43.659
+ 1 modulo SCENES.length.

105
00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:53.178
And again, We could just do modulo
2 because that's how many scenes

106
00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:56.857
we have right now but if we add one later
we would want this to work like this.

107
00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:02.082
And then we're just gonna say modScene,

108
00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:10.536
With (SCENES (this.scene).

109
00:10:13.361 --> 00:10:18.147
So again, now that should work except
it has one particular problem that

110
00:10:18.147 --> 00:10:20.825
we will have to fix here in just a second.

111
00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:26.211
So notice that the fox is not in the right
state now when we change the weather.

112
00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:34.090
So we have to do this.determine, FoxState.

113
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.549
That'll help with that.

114
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.269
Okay, so now that's correct.

115
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:52.225
But now we have a different problem,
That if the fox

116
00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:56.598
is hungry that I don't think it'll work.

117
00:10:56.598 --> 00:11:03.108
Let me check cleanupState or
sorry, determinFoxState.

118
00:11:03.108 --> 00:11:05.485
Actually this will work just fine,

119
00:11:05.485 --> 00:11:08.504
so it'll only flip it if
the fox is in idling.

120
00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:12.398
So we are actually, we're already
really smart about doing that.

121
00:11:12.398 --> 00:11:15.027
So now we can still change this and
the fox is still hungry.

122
00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:19.562
Okay, so that was a changeWeather.

123
00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:22.906
Again, we were able to mostly leverage all
the things that we'd already written we

124
00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:25.789
just had to flip the weather and
everything just worked which is great.

125
00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:28.290
So now we're gonna move on to
the last section which is death.
