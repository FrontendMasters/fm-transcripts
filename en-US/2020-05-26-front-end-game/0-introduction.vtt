WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.190
So my name's Brian Holt,
I'm really excited to be here.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.587
I think this is my, I can't even count
right, 13th or 14th time recording for

3
00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:09.370
Frontend Masters.

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.006
And I'm just really excited
to be here again teaching.

5
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.380
This is my favorite thing to do, and I'm
really grateful to the Frontend Masters

6
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.740
team for allowing me to continue to
coming back and hanging out with you all.

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.756
So, a bit about myself.

8
00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:31.183
My name is Brian, you probably got
that from me saying it three times.

9
00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:32.562
I live in Seattle,

10
00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:38.440
you probably got that from saying that
I'm recording from my house in Seattle.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.342
I work at Microsoft,
I work on Visual Studio Code, and

12
00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:43.200
I work on NodeJS on Azure.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.430
So I'm the PM for
developer experience for NodeJS on Azure.

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.828
So, it's a cool mix of writing code and
working with the product teams as well

15
00:00:54.828 --> 00:01:00.322
as endless meetings and endless emails,
as I'm sure many of you understand.

16
00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.991
And yeah, today we're gonna be
doing the Project Fox Game.

17
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:09.065
So in the past,
I've taught you courses like containers,

18
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:12.320
I've taught you courses like React.

19
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.260
I've taught computer science, I've taught
to Intro to Web Dev, I did the boot camps.

20
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.518
But all those classes had,

21
00:01:18.518 --> 00:01:21.638
we're gonna teach you React,
we're gonna teach you containers,

22
00:01:21.638 --> 00:01:25.358
they had a core curriculum is something
that we're going to build together.

23
00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:28.130
This is gonna be something different and
it's a new experiment for me and

24
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.950
for Frontend Masters,

25
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.360
which there's no core here that I'm
actually trying to impart to you.

26
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.965
We're actually just gonna
build a game together.

27
00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:39.480
And it's gonna be like you and me are in
the room pair coding, designing things

28
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.900
together, having a conversation
about how we wanna build this game.

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.820
So what I want you to learn
during this is kind of how me,

30
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.210
I've been an engineer in the industry for
about a decade now, maybe a bit longer,

31
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.990
and I've been coding for
probably two decades.

32
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.792
So I'm not gonna say I'm the best coder,
but

33
00:01:56.792 --> 00:02:00.850
I am gonna say that I'm a effective
developer that ships code regularly.

34
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.843
So hopefully you can pick up some
of my tips, some of my tricks,

35
00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.899
some of the things that I've
learned over the years and

36
00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.105
maybe hopefully that's helpful too.

37
00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:14.493
And if you like it,
then we'll do more of these.

38
00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:19.986
So the first thing that I want
everyone to do right now is that I

39
00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:25.502
want you to go to this address
which is bit.ly/fox-game.

40
00:02:25.502 --> 00:02:30.395
And no capitals, it's very sensitive,
so it has to be lowercase fox.

41
00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:33.540
That's actually a minus character, right?

42
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.200
Game, right?

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.730
And that'll take you to this website.

44
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.021
It won't say bit.ly.fox-game because
I added that after the fact, but

45
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.005
it'll look something like this.

46
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:49.834
Okay, this is the course notes for
the course that I'm teaching.

47
00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:53.258
You can't see, it's little off frame,
but I have a little laptop right

48
00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:57.360
here that has this website up on it,
so this is literally my notes.

49
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.458
Now what's advantageous to
you is if you fall behind or

50
00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:00.675
you don't understand something I say and

51
00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:03.455
you want to refer to it later,
tou can always go to this website.

52
00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:06.085
It's always gonna be free,
it's always going to be open.

53
00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.945
And this is something
that you can share out,

54
00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:11.555
this is not a secret,
the source is open on GitHub, right?

55
00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:15.195
So that's something that's really awesome
that Frontend Masters allows me to do,

56
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.415
which is open source of all
of my course materials.

57
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.430
Okay, so hopefully you've arrived
here on this project website.

58
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.170
I just wanna give you a little
bit of how the page works.

59
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.800
So if I go to the section Welcome and
go to Introduction and click here,

60
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.020
you can see that actually ends up here
in the header, welcome-introduction.

61
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.330
I did that on purpose so that if you don't
know where we are, you can just look up in

62
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.490
that corner and you can see which section
and kind of chapter we're in at the time.

63
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.420
The other thing to know is that
I have some participants that

64
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.110
are online at the moment that are gonna
be asking me questions throughout, so

65
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.830
that's where these questions
are going to be coming from.

66
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.529
Okay, so here this just kind of
says some of the stuff that I've

67
00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.127
been going over already,
which is the course objective.

68
00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:09.870
This course is not
necessarily anything new,

69
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.539
it's meant to be a pairing coding
experience with you and me.

70
00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.480
Okay, who are you?

71
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.560
So the base level expectations of
this course is I expect you to be

72
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.340
a beginner in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

73
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.600
So I'm not here to teach you
necessarily those core things,

74
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.830
this should not be your first time
with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

75
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.250
I expect you to have at least some
intro to webdev or the boot camp.

76
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.410
So if you haven't done that,

77
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.540
this is a great time to pop
back into that, do those.

78
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.120
I left you some links here for
the boot camp and Intro Web Dev V2.

79
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.586
Nice thing is those two are actually
already free, you just have to sign up for

80
00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:51.460
a Frontend Masters account and
then you can watch those.

81
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.380
And this would be like a perfect
next class to take after that.

82
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.700
If you have just a base level
of familiarity with NodeJS,

83
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.260
that's going to be helpful as well.

84
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.620
But if this is your first time
with NodeJS, that's totally okay.

85
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.400
We won't be doing NodeJS, but
we'll be using NodeJS for

86
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.360
our tools later in the course.

87
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.490
Okay, setup instructions, I really
want you to just install two things.

88
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.620
One of them is NodeJS, you have to
install that one for this class to work.

89
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.300
I personally use NM,
you do not have to use NVM.

90
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.130
That just allows me to switch
versions really quickly.

91
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.570
You can just install it directly off
the website, and that should work for

92
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.216
Windows and that should work for
Mac and Linux just fine.

93
00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:42.900
I am a VM on the Visual Studio code team,
so I would implore you to install VS Code.

94
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.640
I will be using VS Code myself, and so you
will learn a bunch of tips and tricks for

95
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.300
someone that works on the team.

96
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
So obviously,
I think that's a benefit to you.

97
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.260
Even if it's necessarily your day to
day driver, if you prefer eMax or

98
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.080
something like that, that's fine.

99
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.660
And you don't have to, there's nothing
required on this course that you have to

100
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.740
do VS Code, but
it's a good time to try new things.

101
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.710
I get asked this every single
time what's your font,

102
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.210
what's your theme, what's your prompt?

103
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.170
For VS code, my font is Dank Mono.

104
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.630
That one is not free,
I think it's 50 British pounds.

105
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.400
If you don't wanna buy a font I've
actually found it worth it cuz I've used

106
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.590
it for years now.

107
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.090
50 pounds over like five years
of using it, probably worth it.

108
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.500
But there is one from Microsoft
called Cascadia code, and

109
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.230
that one is free and
it does have all the ligatures.

110
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.538
I gave you a couple links here to
figure out how to enable those.

111
00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:46.140
A ligature is if I have
like an equal signs and

112
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.160
a open bracket next to it,
it'll combine them into an arrow.

113
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.855
If you see like two things combining,
that's what a ligature is.

114
00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:54.480
You don't have to do it.

115
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.870
I just think it's cool, so I do it.

116
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.460
My theme is the default dark plus
theme for VS code, I just like it.

117
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.910
For my shell, I use ZSH and
I use the Spaceship ZSH prompt,

118
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.540
which is gonna show you what version of
Node I'm using and all that kinda stuff.

119
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.475
And yeah, and obviously VS Code.

120
00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:16.555
This isn't gonna be a perfect course,
right?

121
00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:20.005
I wrote it, so there's gonna be
grammatical and spelling mistakes and

122
00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:23.465
even occasions where there's just things
that are like wrong in the materials.

123
00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:27.935
So this is all on GitHub, you can file an
issue and then we keep track of that and

124
00:07:27.935 --> 00:07:29.365
we'll fix things.

125
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.225
And feel free to open a pull request
as well if you want to fix it

126
00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:33.575
yourself, that's great.

127
00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:37.715
I'll just say that I'm always
happy to chat on social media, but

128
00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:40.340
I get a lot of tech support requests and

129
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.790
I don't necessarily have time
to respond to all of those.

130
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.540
So if you do that,
the better place to put that is an issue,

131
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.860
cuz if it's an issue then we will
eventually get to that, for sure.

132
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.670
Okay, who am I?

133
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.370
This is me at Christmas
in 2018 in Paris drinking

134
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.072
a very fine Belgian beer that's the size
of my head, which I was very happy about.

135
00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:04.470
I told you I work at Microsoft,

136
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.700
I'm also on Frontend Happy Hour,
which is a pretty cool podcast.

137
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.950
And previous to Microsoft,
I worked at LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit and

138
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.680
in some other smaller
places in Salt Lake City.

139
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.710
I'm also on the board for Betsu Code,
which is an awesome nonprofit.

140
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.250
I live in Seattle.

141
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.000
I have a little dog named Luna,
who you may or

142
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.490
may not hear during the course of this
class cuz she likes to bark at everything.

143
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.530
And yeah, I left my links here for
social media.

144
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.910
So Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, feel free to
add me on all those, I always accept them.

145
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.490
Again, huge shout out to Frontend Masters
for letting me create this course,

146
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.000
for giving me incentive and time to do so.

147
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.580
I'm just infinitely grateful to them and
their team and to Mark and everyone.

148
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.090
So I definitely think
their product's worth it,

149
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.320
their workshops are really top-notch.

150
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.390
And last thing, I left a link down here
to the repo for this particular page.

151
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.920
In fact, if you open it here,

152
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.270
I would really appreciate a little star
up there, that's always helpful for me.

153
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.684
One, it feeds my ego to let
me feel good about myself.

154
00:09:13.684 --> 00:09:16.509
Just kidding, sort of.

155
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:20.105
And it also makes the repo a little
bit more discoverable to other people,

156
00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:21.270
which is always great.
