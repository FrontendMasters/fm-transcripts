1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.413
Okay, so
the next thing I want you to do is,

2
00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:04.906
I want you to go down to
the hello world here.

3
00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:10.831
And I have a repo here at
github.com/btholt/project-files-for-fox-g-

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.717
ame, and I want you to clone this repo.

5
00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:17.552
The reason being is, we would've
spent a lot of time doing CSS, and

6
00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:21.405
that's not what I wanted to focus on for
this particular workshop.

7
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:27.024
So I did some of the CSS heavy lifting for
you already.

8
00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:31.536
And so I gave you, and
then the other nice thing about this repo,

9
00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:36.397
which I'll click into here for
just a second, is I made milestones.

10
00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:39.960
So if you fall behind, you can just
jump to the next milestone, right?

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
So we're gonna start with
the aptly named start-here.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.120
But I think the next one is maybe
frontend-infra or build-process, right?

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.980
So we're gonna hit these milestones.

14
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.470
So if you fall behind,
you could just jump to the next milestone.

15
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.640
And then eventually,

16
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.610
we'll arrive at code-complete-game,
which is this one, right?

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.344
So it has all of the files here,
ready to go for the code-complete-game.

18
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:11.930
Cool, But yeah,
you'll start writing your code.

19
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.991
You can either copy the things out out
of start-here into a new directory,

20
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:18.515
or you can just work
directly in start-here.

21
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.389
I would probably say, if you wanna
like push this later to your GitHub,

22
00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:25.440
maybe copy it out and
then make a new git repo of that one.

23
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.304
That's probably how I would do it,
so I'll show you how to do that.

24
00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:35.130
Okay, so let's go ahead, and again,
I wrote this here for you, so

25
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.001
you can just copy this git clone, or
you can do it yourself, that's fine.

26
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.606
I'm gonna open my prompt here,
So let's do clear,

27
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:51.442
okay, so I'm gonna say git clone,
or I can just paste that here.

28
00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:56.027
And I'm gonna put this in fam-fox-game.

29
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.075
And actually,
what I should have done is, so

30
00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:11.942
what I told you is,
I'm gonna copy this into, copy -r,

31
00:02:11.942 --> 00:02:17.569
so recursive,
from fam-fox-game/start-here,

32
00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.630
and I'm gonna copy that to fox-game.

33
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.970
So now if I go into fox-game here, you
can see I have just the source directory.

34
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.767
If I look inside the source directory,

35
00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:35.765
then I have a background,
the pet, and sprites.css.

36
00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:46.370
So I will be minimally using the command
line for some of this class.

37
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.360
If you're not familiar with
the command line for Mac,

38
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.890
you just have to open your terminal,
which is what I'm using.

39
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.010
You can also use iTerm or
Hyper or something like that.

40
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.787
If you're on Windows, you can mostly
follow along with everything I'm doing if

41
00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:01.132
you open PowerShell.

42
00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:05.871
So if you open your windows and
you type PowerShell,

43
00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:09.864
you can use that as well,
or you can use cmd.

44
00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:13.319
I don't know cmd very well,
it's ironic, I work at Microsoft, and

45
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.942
I know this much of PowerShell.

46
00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:17.900
And most of the things I'm doing
will directly work in PowerShell.

47
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.828
But if you have any questions about that,
feel free to shoot me a message, or

48
00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:27.078
if you're following on live right now,
just ask in the chat.

49
00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:30.311
I guarantee you there are some Windows
experts in there that will be happy

50
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:30.900
to help you.

51
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.258
And lastly, if that just doesn't work for
you, you can just go ahead and

52
00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:37.727
say Clone or Download here from the repo,
and just click Download ZIP, and

53
00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.565
that'll download a ZIP file and
you can do it all from there.

54
00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:44.290
There's also the GitHub desktop client
which works super well as well.

55
00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:50.857
Okay, so hopefully you've
arrived at a point, and I'll,

56
00:03:50.857 --> 00:03:56.610
just to prove a point, open this in
the Finder, I have fox-game right here.

57
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.950
You can see I have a lot of copies of fox,
I've been working on this for

58
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.420
a while, that's why.

59
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.216
But I have fox-game here, it has
a source directory in it, it has bg for

60
00:04:04.216 --> 00:04:05.053
backgrounds.

61
00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:10.665
It has pet for all the various
different pets, and it has sprites.css,

62
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:15.182
which is the CSS part that I'm
not going to make you write.

63
00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:18.962
Okay, good, hopefully everyone's
kind of in the same state as me.

64
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.734
I can only assume that I'm nailing this,
and

65
00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:27.440
that everyone knows exactly what I'm
talking about, and I'm an awesome teacher.

66
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.380
So we're in the command line now.

67
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.930
You need to be in the directory
of your projects.

68
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.431
So you can see here,
I am in btholt/personal/fox-game,

69
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:39.500
right, and I have Node installed.

70
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.627
So hopefully you already
have Node installed.

71
00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:44.051
If not, just go to Nodejs.org,

72
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:48.910
you can download the binary install,
it doesn't take very long.

73
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.796
Okay, so if you type node -v,
you should see the version of Node,

74
00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.081
I'm actually gonna use 12.

75
00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.882
So now if I say node -v,
it says 12.16.0, right?

76
00:05:05.882 --> 00:05:10.627
As long as you're above 10, I don't
really care, so if you type node -v,

77
00:05:10.627 --> 00:05:12.609
it should be above 10, okay?

78
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:16.909
The next thing I want you to do,
again, inside of this directory is,

79
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.549
I want you to say npm init.

80
00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:21.676
Now if you can just init, and
it'll ask you a bunch of questions like,

81
00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:25.133
what's the name of this, what version
of this, what's your test command?

82
00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:29.444
I'm just gonna type init -y, and
it's just gonna give me the default,

83
00:05:29.444 --> 00:05:33.557
means yes, just say yes to all
the questions, I don't really care.

84
00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:39.804
So if I type that, you can see here,
it'll say, this is what I output for you.

85
00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:43.491
So this is going to start
a Node project for you.

86
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:48.060
It might give you this, I need to
update npm, that's fine, I don't care.

87
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.820
Okay, so now if I hit ls again,
I have a package.json.

88
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.088
And so if I look at that package.json,
it's exactly what it said up here.

89
00:05:59.088 --> 00:06:05.528
It's just a JSON file, which is
a JavaScript Object Notation file,

90
00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:12.761
of all the various information,
it's metadata about your project, okay?

91
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:18.257
So now if we npm install something,
it'll show up here,

92
00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:22.158
and so that later we can track it, okay?

93
00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:26.923
And so I have this code installed,
so I'm gonna say code ., and

94
00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:30.292
that's going to open
this folder in VS Code.

95
00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:33.579
If that doesn't work for you,
I'll show you how to initialize that.

96
00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:40.738
So now I've opened VS Code, and you can
see here, I have my source directory and

97
00:06:40.738 --> 00:06:41.804
package.json.

98
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:49.412
If you don't have that
special command working for

99
00:06:49.412 --> 00:06:56.022
code, I think you can type, so
in Windows, I think you hit F5?

100
00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:58.950
F1, not F5, F5 starts debug mode.

101
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.875
And in Mac, you wanna hit Cmd+Shift+P, and

102
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.570
that'll open what's called
the command palette here.

103
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.174
And if you type install, this top one
here, shell command install code in PATH.

104
00:07:13.174 --> 00:07:18.717
And that will allow you to the code .,
to open something in VS Code.

105
00:07:18.717 --> 00:07:20.970
That actually might not work in Windows.

106
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:28.062
Anyway, if you look for how to install
code from VS Code, it'll come up, okay?

107
00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:31.898
So now I have my package.json,
which I can see here.

108
00:07:31.898 --> 00:07:36.093
And I have my source file,
which has the sprites.css,

109
00:07:36.093 --> 00:07:39.495
it has all of my little
fox friends pictures.

110
00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:44.416
Okay, so that's kind of the state
that we wanna be in right now.

111
00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:48.315
The next thing that we're
gonna do just really quick is,

112
00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:53.043
I'm gonna create a new file here and
I'm gonna call it .gitignore.

113
00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:57.586
This is a file that tells git,
don't index these files.

114
00:07:57.586 --> 00:08:00.150
And so there's a couple things
that you just never wanna index.

115
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.795
The first one is a folder
called node_modules.

116
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.560
When I install stuff from Node,

117
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.370
I don't want git to ever track anything
inside of it, so that's what I do.

118
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.608
So you can put the / there to
let it know it's a directory,

119
00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:12.990
you can put Node modules like that.

120
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.113
That'll ignore anything that
has node_modules in its name.

121
00:08:16.113 --> 00:08:21.118
I always put the /, and
that's mostly just out of habit, okay?

122
00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:25.308
The next thing, particularly if you're
on a Mac, that I always put is,

123
00:08:25.308 --> 00:08:27.314
I just put .DS_Store like this.

124
00:08:27.314 --> 00:08:30.355
Mac has this file that,
when you drag things around,

125
00:08:30.355 --> 00:08:34.818
the way that it remembers where they
are in the folder is called DS_Store, and

126
00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:37.670
it just randomly generates it and
I hate it.

127
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.002
You can turn it off, but
I just haven't cuz I'm lazy.

128
00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:42.880
Anyway, just ignore it,
it's fine, everyone's okay.

129
00:08:44.845 --> 00:08:49.460
And that should be good for the gitignore.

130
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:55.746
Again, you can always add things to
gitignore later, and I frequently do.

131
00:08:55.746 --> 00:09:00.682
The next thing I want to do with you is,
this is not a git repo yet.

132
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:04.524
So I'm going to go back
to my command line, and

133
00:09:04.524 --> 00:09:07.586
I'm gonna say git init, like that.

134
00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:13.083
And it just says,
now this is a git repository.

135
00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:20.330
If you are doing it inside of
the cloned repo, it might not work.

136
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.160
Cuz then you would have a git
repo inside of a git repo.

137
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.100
That's why I told you to copy it out.

138
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.770
If it's not a git repo,
it's not the end of the world.

139
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.570
This is just so you can put it on
GitHub at the end of the course.

140
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.300
All right, so
that's the end of the hello world section.

141
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.320
We should have an empty git repository
with a couple of files in it.

142
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.616
You can even, if you wanted to,
you could say git add, and

143
00:09:40.616 --> 00:09:45.704
then you can see here that I have
a bunch of my source directory added,

144
00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:48.230
package.json, .gitignore.

145
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.700
You can also do it from here inside
of the pane inside of VS Code.

146
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.408
It's amazing, I'm just too used to
using the command line for git, so

147
00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:02.344
I'm real sorry about that,
I don't know what to tell you.

148
00:10:02.344 --> 00:10:03.625
So again, what I did is,

149
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:08.550
I said git add ., which is saying just add
everything in this directory that counts.

150
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.397
You can also do -A,
that's another good one.

151
00:10:12.397 --> 00:10:15.878
Now if I say git status, you can see,
these are all the files about to be

152
00:10:15.878 --> 00:10:18.607
committed, or staged for
commit is the term for that.

153
00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:22.497
And then I'm gonna say git commit,
with a -m for message saying,

154
00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.110
this is my initial commit.

155
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.526
And then I like putting
fun emojis on GitHub.

156
00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:36.870
So I always put :octocat, and that will
be transformed into an emoji on GitHub.

157
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.394
That's probably the most useful thing
that you'll learn today's course,

158
00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:42.573
is how to put emojis in your commits for
GitHub.

159
00:10:42.573 --> 00:10:45.351
So you're welcome,
you can just sign off now.

160
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.666
Okay, so
now we have our first commit here.

161
00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:57.020
If I put git log, you can see I have
my initial commit here from Brian Holt.

162
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.073
If this is your first time using git,
you might have to go, well,

163
00:11:01.073 --> 00:11:02.483
Apple ships with git.

164
00:11:02.483 --> 00:11:07.308
You'd have to go download git for Windows.

165
00:11:07.308 --> 00:11:10.816
But if this is your first time with git,
I'm not gonna teach you git.

166
00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:14.866
There is a great course on
Frontend Masters from Nina Zakharenko,

167
00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:18.645
my coworker at Microsoft,
that you should definitely take.

168
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:22.091
And it goes into really good depth
of what git is, how to use git, and

169
00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:25.920
it is worth your time, absolutely,
it'll pay dividends in your career.
