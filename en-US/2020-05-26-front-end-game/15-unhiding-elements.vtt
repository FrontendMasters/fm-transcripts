1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.300
We've reached the CSS completed milestone.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.510
So if you fell behind with the CSS or
HTML, feel free to move on and

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.380
grab that CSS completed milestone.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.340
So now if we look at our game,
we have no fox there because it's hidden.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.340
But let's go ahead and
remove the hidden for a second.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.763
And nothing's there because we
need to give it a modifier so

7
00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:26.261
if I say like fox-hungry.

8
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.151
You can see there it'll add
our fox friend to the page.

9
00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:39.800
All I'm doing is just changing you
have fox and fox dash something.

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.690
It's like I can put dead and
you can see it brings a tombstone up.

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.440
Or if I do fox-pooping,
I think is what I called it.

12
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.455
You can see that's what it
looks like when the fox poops.

13
00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:55.362
Right?

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.429
Or fox-sleep.

15
00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:07.215
So now that we have all this kinda stuff,
now all we have to do is change the class

16
00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:09.470
of that fox and
it can be in its various different states.

17
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.330
So all we're gonna do is tie
that to the state machine.

18
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.810
So whenever the fox is sleeping,
it's gonna have the fox sleep class and

19
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.090
everything is gonna work visually.

20
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.340
So we just have to control the JavaScript
and make that JavaScript just output

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.096
the class to the CSS, and
everything kinda takes care of itself.

22
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:29.630
I think the last thing I wanna do here,
before we move on,

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.210
is let's go ahead and fix this modal.

24
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.640
So I'm gonna actually move
this to the side to the right.

25
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.460
And let's just go ahead, I'll show
you how I kind of do this in general.

26
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.180
This is how I do my CSS is I just do it
in the browser first and then I copy and

27
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.790
paste that into the stylesheet.

28
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.530
So let's give it a padding, Of like 15 px.

29
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.460
Maybe like 25 px.

30
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.420
We'll give it a font size.

31
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.454
Bump it up to like 16 px, no.

32
00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:23.660
Not 25, 20, let's make a bold as well,
font weight, bold.

33
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.440
And let's round those corners because
everybody loves rounded corners.

34
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.730
So when you border radius, 5 px.

35
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.969
Let's have a little bit more round,
it's a more friendly game, 12 pixels.

36
00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:43.350
And that's it.

37
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.400
That's really what I would do.

38
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.010
So I just copy this.

39
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.520
This is on the inner, I believe.

40
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.670
Notes on the model itself.

41
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.100
So we'll just copy that.

42
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.943
And I'll move back over to my VS code and
I'll find that modal where I put

43
00:02:55.943 --> 00:03:01.673
the background, this one, and I'll just
paste that and save, and when I say that,

44
00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:05.971
prettier will automatically
readjust the formatting there.

45
00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:13.120
All right,
that was a whole lot of HTML and CSS.

46
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.040
Again, you can grab that as CSS completed.

47
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.940
Cool, does anyone have any
questions about any of that?

48
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how is the animation loop
occuring when there's no user interaction?

49
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.740
Is this JavaScript or something else?

50
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.160
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna give you
a very short version,

51
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.649
because again,
I'm not necessarily the expert on these.

52
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.460
There's a whole amazing course from
Sarah Drasner on SVG animations,

53
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.860
which is the advanced part of this.

54
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.300
And there's other great content on
Frontend masters about animations.

55
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.520
But let's take a look at
the remedial stuff that I did.

56
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.520
So, I'll inspect element
on our little foxy friend.

57
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.770
So fox sleep right there.

58
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.220
You can see I have this coming in.

59
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.470
It's coming from sprites.css right here.

60
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.450
And you can see I have a background, and

61
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.110
then I'm using animation here to
do some of the animation here.

62
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.180
So let's take a look at sleeping
dot whatever this is up here,

63
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.930
it has four frames of the fox and
it's just stepping between quarters,

64
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.720
right, so it's here, then it moves here,
then it moves here, right,

65
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.100
and that gives the impression of motion.

66
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.760
So if I look back, not that one, this one,

67
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.640
you can see each one of these frames,
it's kind of moving between them, right?

68
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.774
So something fun I could do,
if I can show you.

69
00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:51.227
I think if I got rid of the width and
height that would show you.

70
00:04:54.342 --> 00:04:55.560
Or with.

71
00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:07.390
That's really interesting.

72
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.200
So Background repeat.

73
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.470
So you can see all that
that's how it's doing right?

74
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.140
So it's actually moving like very jumpily,
right?

75
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.170
It's jumping between
the various different frames,

76
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.930
which is giving it
the impression of motion.

77
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.980
And that's what this step four say,
like it's this wide, it's this long.

78
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.010
And move it between these
various different frames every

79
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.510
second is how often it's jumping frames.

80
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.130
So if you search for
like CSS steps, animations,

81
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.500
you'll find a whole
bunch of stuff on that.

82
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.171
And it'll teach you a lot more
than what I'm doing here.

83
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:50.437
But that's kind of the gist
of what's happening here.
