00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.970
Here's the thing about
how I wrote this course.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.923
In general,
I'm kind of against monolithic CSS files.

3
00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:13.657
Because what always, always happens is,
you get a super long CSS file,

4
00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:18.660
and then you don't know what part's
important and what part's not.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.902
It's not deletable,

6
00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:23.506
if we go back to my previous section
that I was talking about that.

7
00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:26.361
And so
when I'm writing things like Angular,

8
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:31.202
when I'm writing things like React,
I try and match a component to a CSS file.

9
00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:35.401
That's in general kind of how
I like to think about things.

10
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.971
And I tried to do that initially
when I wrote this course, and

11
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.702
I found it looked really contrived and
gross.

12
00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:44.253
It just didn't make any sense, and
it made things more complicated.

13
00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:50.771
So I actually refactoried it
back into one style.css file.

14
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:52.955
And so again, that kinda goes to show,

15
00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:56.412
you need to evaluate everything
from the lens of pragmatism.

16
00:00:56.412 --> 00:00:59.100
Does this actually make sense to try and
break this down?

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.004
Or am I just doing it to be idealistic?

18
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.361
And then in that case, I was,
I was trying to be too idealistic.

19
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.927
And so I ended up refactoring
back to just one style.css file,

20
00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:10.429
cuz it ended up making everything simpler.

21
00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.060
So that's kinda my spiel on that.

22
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.853
So let's go ahead and
get started writing some of our CSS.

23
00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:23.730
The first thing is kind of two
things that I put in everything.

24
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.191
So I'm gonna put some comments up here.

25
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.441
You don't have to put the comments,
but I'm putting them in there so

26
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:31.582
hopefully it's a little bit easier for
you.

27
00:01:31.582 --> 00:01:39.363
So in general, the first thing I put
on every project I do CSS with is *,

28
00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:43.792
then I put in box-sizing border-box.

29
00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:47.139
This just makes everything
easier to measure in CSS.

30
00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.978
It's saying, hey, when I measure
something, always include the margin,

31
00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:55.401
the borders, and the padding,
and the interior, and

32
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.870
include all that in the measurements.

33
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.218
If you don't do that, the measurements
don't include the border, and

34
00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:04.723
I don't think they include the padding.

35
00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.860
Yeah, they don't include the padding.

36
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.290
It doesn't include the margin either way.

37
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.710
Anyways, this makes everything easier.

38
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.712
This is the only time I'll
use the wildcard selector.

39
00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.731
I literally never use it any other time.

40
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:23.252
And the star means apply to
every DOM element on the page.

41
00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:28.291
Okay, then for the body,
I want you to put in margin 0,

42
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.905
padding 0, and font-family,
and I used Arial,

43
00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:37.756
Helvetica, sans serif,
just that first one there.

44
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:45.592
So an antiquity of
browsers is that they just

45
00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:50.541
have a bunch of base level
CSS included with it.

46
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.863
And for whatever reason,
back in 93 or whatever it is,

47
00:02:54.863 --> 00:03:00.910
they included padding and margin on
the body, and we don't want that, right?

48
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.250
We want everything to push up against
the edges, so that's what that does.

49
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.920
And then font-family,
we're just gonna use Arial.

50
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.280
Every computer includes Arial,
it's a nice looking font.

51
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.970
They don't have to download any
web fonts or anything like that.

52
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.121
So that's what we're doing that for.

53
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:20.086
You could totally hop
on Google Web Fonts and

54
00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:22.060
grab a better font if
that suits you better.

55
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.599
The only text on here, anyway, is the
modal, so it doesn't matter a whole lot.

56
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.590
Okay, let's go do the frame and
background next,

57
00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:38.745
Frame and background.

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.261
Notice I'm doing /* for comments,
that's only valid in CSS.

59
00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:51.481
This doesn't work in CSS, works in SAS if
you're doing SAS, but we're not doing SAS.

60
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.864
Okay, so to get that working,
we'll do the container.

61
00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:02.197
And we're gonna use display
flex cuz I love flex and

62
00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:04.530
I use it literally all the time.

63
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.250
This is just a way of doing layout that's
a lot easier that you can kinda say,

64
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.416
this goes and
this takes up this much space.

65
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:14.383
And you can vertically center very easily.

66
00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:18.989
It's an absolute godsend compared
to doing floats like we used to.

67
00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.563
align-items, that's going to
put everything in the center.

68
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:28.002
And I think align-items is vertically,

69
00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:32.234
and justify-content I
believe is horizontally.

70
00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:34.500
So we're putting everything centered.

71
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.120
And we're gonna do a little hack that I
do all the time, so position absolute.

72
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.460
So you're saying, position this absolutely
within the container that it's in.

73
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.257
And then if you say left 0,
right 0, top 0,

74
00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:53.300
bottom 0,
it's a fun little hack that actually

75
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.850
allows you to take all of
the parent container space.

76
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.387
So if the parent container that it's
in is 100 pixels by 100 pixels,

77
00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:06.423
it'll take that 100 pixels by 100 pixels.

78
00:05:06.423 --> 00:05:10.230
There's other ways to do this, this is
just the way that I have always done it.

79
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.426
So you can see here,
now everything's starting to be centered,

80
00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:19.311
so that's good,
that's kinda what we wanted.

81
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:21.260
Okay, now we're gonna go do the frame.

82
00:05:25.218 --> 00:05:29.902
Underneath that, I'm just gonna
give it a height of 762 pixels.

83
00:05:29.902 --> 00:05:33.264
And that's just cuz I looked at
the image and that's how big it is.

84
00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:36.560
And width, it's a square,
so it's 762 pixels.

85
00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:42.076
I'm generally not so specific, but in
this case, we're not being responsive, so

86
00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:42.722
that's okay.

87
00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:44.566
And we'll do position relative.

88
00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:49.200
The reason why we're doing
position relative is,

89
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.069
we're gonna do some
positioning inside of it.

90
00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.522
And we want it to be relative to
the frame and not to the parent.

91
00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:56.636
So when you do position relative,
it's saying, all absolute and

92
00:05:56.636 --> 00:06:00.598
relative position is now relative to this
container, and not the one outside of it.

93
00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:05.670
Same thing here with inner.

94
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.523
We're gonna do inner position relative for
the same reason.

95
00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:20.099
Okay, then for the game,
Let's scroll up here a bit.

96
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.332
Width 628 pixels, again,
just something I measured.

97
00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:32.388
Height 577 pixels, position absolute,

98
00:06:32.388 --> 00:06:40.780
and we're gonna give it a position of
62 pixels and a left of 67 pixels.

99
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.066
So that's where the background has
to sit to make sure it looks like it

100
00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.492
belongs inside of the frame.

101
00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:51.964
Okay, and then the game.night,

102
00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:56.564
it just has to have its background
shifted around a little bit.

103
00:06:56.564 --> 00:07:04.460
So width is 716 pixels, Top is 62 pixels.

104
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.362
And this is just an artifact
of working with the designer.

105
00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:13.160
The designer gave me things that
were not the same proportions.

106
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.603
So I had to shift them around
a little bit to make them look nice.

107
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:20.009
And then the left is just saying,
move it to the right, no,

108
00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.746
it's actually moving
to the left 19 pixels.

109
00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:32.745
And then hidden, remember, we had the fox
that was hidden as well as the poop bag.

110
00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:36.985
This is just saying, anything that has
hidden on it, just put display none on it.

111
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:42.838
Okay, so we should save that, and

112
00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:47.544
I believe we should be
seeing something like this.

113
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:56.037
Right, something like that,
this is pushed offscreen.

114
00:07:56.037 --> 00:07:59.569
That's because these things
are not aligned yet, but

115
00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:04.403
you should be seeing the game with no
buttons on it or anything like that, or

116
00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:07.504
none of the icons, but
something akin to that.

117
00:08:07.504 --> 00:08:09.406
So let's go write the buttons next.

118
00:08:13.147 --> 00:08:21.805
Buttons, We're gonna do .buttons.

119
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.513
I'm gonna do position absolute, so

120
00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:30.151
that we can position them kinda
absolutely within the frame.

121
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:34.474
And we're gonna do top 674 pixels,

122
00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:39.190
left 266 pixels, height 71 pixels,

123
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.120
width, and if you're wondering,

124
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.574
how did I come up with all these numbers,

125
00:08:47.574 --> 00:08:52.430
it really was just guess and check, right?

126
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.192
I just opened the browser tools,
moved things around until everything

127
00:08:55.192 --> 00:08:57.599
looked right, copied the numbers,
and pasted them in here.

128
00:09:01.222 --> 00:09:03.660
Not any more complicated than that.

129
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:10.479
display flex, align-items center,
and justify-content center,

130
00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:15.602
just to horizontally and
vertically center things.

131
00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:26.267
And now you can see we have buttons
that are on the right places.

132
00:09:26.267 --> 00:09:30.579
Right, That's fun.

133
00:09:33.404 --> 00:09:35.592
Okay, let's do the icons next.

134
00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:42.365
Position absolute, top 572

135
00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:46.976
pixels, left 194 pixels.

136
00:09:49.695 --> 00:09:53.637
Height 67 pixels,

137
00:09:53.637 --> 00:09:59.557
width 374 pixels, 374.

138
00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:09.218
Display flex, align-items center,

139
00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:12.608
you can see that I use align-items and
justify-content frequently.

140
00:10:12.608 --> 00:10:16.213
And then justify-content,
we're gonna do space-between.

141
00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:24.272
So its what space-between is, it's
telling you to take the items that I have

142
00:10:24.272 --> 00:10:28.802
inside of this, in fact, let's just
save it and explain it to you this way.

143
00:10:28.802 --> 00:10:32.078
So if we inspect element here, for icons,

144
00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:37.364
you can see that's the size of
the container that we're looking at.

145
00:10:37.364 --> 00:10:39.696
space-between is saying, take the left or

146
00:10:39.696 --> 00:10:43.224
the first item, put it all the way
to the left, take the last item,

147
00:10:43.224 --> 00:10:47.110
put it all the way to the right,
and then space everything evenly.

148
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.960
So you can see that this space here and
this space here are totally even.

149
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.360
That's what space-between means.

150
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.100
Whereas you can do space-around,
you can do, there's another one,

151
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.576
space something, evenly,
yep, space-evenly.

152
00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:05.381
But space-between is saying,
stretch that out in that way.

153
00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:10.087
Okay, so now you should be seeing
the icons looking hopefully nice,

154
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:12.369
right, that's kinda the idea.

155
00:11:14.702 --> 00:11:19.451
And let's go ahead and do the next one.

156
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:26.583
So the next one is gonna be everyone's
favorite, We're gonna do the poop bag.

157
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.930
And .poop-bag, just gotta give it

158
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.593
a nice position, position absolute,

159
00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:43.551
top 300 pixels, left 160 pixels.

160
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:48.430
Okay, so it's hidden right now.

161
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.245
But if we go find the poop bag,
right there, and

162
00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:55.440
we turn off display none,
you can see there.

163
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.295
Whenever we clean up the poop,
that's where the poop bag's gonna go.

164
00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:02.510
It's already got nice CSS animations.

165
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.280
I mean, you can see here,
it's coming in from the sprites.css.

166
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.221
That's where it gets
this nice animation from.

167
00:12:13.338 --> 00:12:17.774
Okay, Let's go do the modal.

168
00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:26.532
And the modal, Is position absolute.

169
00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:33.560
And we're gonna do top 0, we want it
to show up at the top of the game.

170
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.932
And we want it to go all the way from left
to right, so we're gonna say left 0 and

171
00:12:37.932 --> 00:12:38.543
right 0.

172
00:12:38.543 --> 00:12:41.878
You also could probably
could've done width 100%,

173
00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:44.040
probably would've worked as well.

174
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.065
Same ways of doing different things,
other way around,

175
00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:49.089
different ways of doing same things.

176
00:12:52.074 --> 00:12:57.661
Okay, so you can see here, it's up there,
it's where we want it to be.

177
00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:02.443
And now we need to give it a color,
so right now,

178
00:13:02.443 --> 00:13:05.320
we don't actually need it.

179
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.641
But we'll put in modal:empty, so

180
00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:16.110
:empty gives it,
it's a CSS pseudo-selector.

181
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.120
So it's letting you know,

182
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.310
anytime that there's no content in it,
apply this CSS class.

183
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.012
So in this particular case,
we'll say display none.

184
00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:28.140
So if there's nothing in the modal,
it'll hide it, which is convenient, right?

185
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.808
So then we can just say, hey,
remove all the text, and

186
00:13:30.808 --> 00:13:32.783
it'll automatically hide it from you.

187
00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:36.690
So that's what the modal:empty does there.

188
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:46.562
And same thing with the modal-inner,
empty, display none.

189
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:59.066
Okay, and we wanna make this
look a bit nicer than it does.

190
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:03.107
So you can say, background-color, and

191
00:14:03.107 --> 00:14:07.617
we'll give it,
I think I gave it blueviolet.

192
00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:14.150
You can pick whatever your
favorite CSS color is.

193
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.866
I can also suggest peru, I don't know if
you knew if peru is a color, but it is,

194
00:14:18.866 --> 00:14:20.449
that is the color of peru.

195
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:25.396
We'll do blueviolet, and
then we'll give it a text color of white.

196
00:14:27.652 --> 00:14:31.190
And then now you can look at it,
and you can at least see it now.

197
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.763
I think later, we'll come back to this and
we'll give it some more styling.

198
00:14:34.763 --> 00:14:38.132
But that's what it'll more or
less end up looking like.

199
00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:45.746
Okay, And
then we gotta go do some stuff for

200
00:14:45.746 --> 00:14:48.657
our fox friend, and
then we will be done with CSS for now.

201
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.657
.fox, position absolute,

202
00:14:57.657 --> 00:15:02.922
top 336 pixels, left 285

203
00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:07.611
pixels, overflow hidden.

204
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:11.862
So we're positioning it absolutely
on the page somewhere, and

205
00:15:11.862 --> 00:15:15.494
then we're saying don't
overflow in any direction.

206
00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:18.562
So don't put scroll bars
if it has more content.

207
00:15:20.845 --> 00:15:27.782
Okay, then we'll do .fox-pooping,

208
00:15:27.782 --> 00:15:34.928
top 319 pixels, left 159 pixels.

209
00:15:34.928 --> 00:15:38.858
fox-celebrate, and

210
00:15:38.858 --> 00:15:46.723
we want that to be top 290 and left 290.

211
00:15:49.552 --> 00:15:58.181
.fox-rain, and
we want that to be top 362 pixels, 362.

212
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.994
And hungry, .fox-hungry,

213
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:10.734
top 362 pixels as well.

214
00:16:15.588 --> 00:16:23.843
And .fox-eating, top 362 pixels.

215
00:16:25.143 --> 00:16:31.509
And .fox-egg, top 289 pixels,

216
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:36.600
left 248 pixels, two more.

217
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:45.060
And again, this is just us taking
the fox and moving him around the page,

218
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.934
depending on where is
the appropriate place to do that.

219
00:16:49.934 --> 00:16:57.043
.fox-sleep, top 351 pixels,

220
00:16:57.043 --> 00:17:01.177
left 445 pixels.

221
00:17:01.177 --> 00:17:07.891
And last, .fox-dead, And

222
00:17:07.891 --> 00:17:14.841
top 380 pixels, and left 243 pixels.
