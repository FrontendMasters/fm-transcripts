00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.450
The next thing I want you to set up
is I want you to create a new file.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.990
Save this to the root of your project.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.696
This is another thing that I almost
immediately do whenever I start

4
00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:16.160
a new project, and
it's called .editorconfig, like that.

5
00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.112
Okay?
Yes, we want to use the dot.

6
00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.770
So you can see I got a like
a nice little mouse head.

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.831
That's called the, I have an extension for
that, I think it's called VS code, oops,

8
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:37.960
I'll show you, VS code icons right there.

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.796
That's where I get all these icons from,
so

10
00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.940
if you install that you'll
get all the cool icons.

11
00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:45.498
This one.

12
00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:46.430
Okay.

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.080
Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.450
So inside of editor config,
this is a cross editor tool

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.390
that's letting the editor know
here's my code formatting rules.

16
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.300
And this is nice because
if you have a bunch of

17
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.000
people in your team that are working and
they want to use Vim, and

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.560
they want to use all
the other editors out there,

19
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.180
this is a common format that they all
understand of how to set up the project.

20
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.290
So I'm just gonna show you how
to write a really quick one.

21
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.340
So I'm gonna say root equals true.

22
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.870
This is the one that lets them know like,
this is the root most editor format,

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.000
you can have nested ones.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.720
And then here I'm gonna put
inside of square brackets a star,

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.010
and this is going to be for
any file format.

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.950
Like if I wanted to do just Python files
that could do a header Py and this would

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.880
be just Python files or just JavaScript
files, but star's like for everything.

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.410
End of line, we want it to be lf.

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.950
That's Linux formatting.

30
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.270
I recommend that in general.

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.140
Insert File, new line.

32
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.860
We do Char set, you want utf-8.

33
00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:06.064
Indent and style, or we can do size too,
that's an excellent, indent_size,

34
00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:12.240
we want 2, cuz in general JavaScript
developers like 2, that's not always true.

35
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.132
But I find most open source
projects are 2 indent.

36
00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:19.520
And indent_style,
we want spaces, cuz again,

37
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.130
JavaScript, it's fine if you like tabs,
I don't actually care.

38
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.290
But in general JavaScript
has landed on two spaces.

39
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.850
I'm not gonna argue about it.

40
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.160
That's just what it is.

41
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.660
Okay.

42
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.610
So now, my project is set up to
use these formatting tools and

43
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.610
my VS code just knows how to use it if
you have the right extension installed.

44
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.309
So again, the extension that you
need is called editor config.

45
00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:53.230
And it's this one here I have it
installed EditorConfig for VS code,

46
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.695
2 million installs, go ahead and
install that one and

47
00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:58.290
then it will automatically
read these files.

48
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.340
Another cool thing is prettier knows
how to read an editor confirm.

49
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.310
So if I went in there and

50
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.910
change it to four spaces,
prettier would automatically pick that up.

51
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.889
So what's great is if I have like a joint
Python JavaScript file because Python

52
00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.507
generally uses four spaces for
indentation, you can set up Python have

53
00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:16.763
one set of rules, you can set up
JavaScript one set of rules, but

54
00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:19.625
this is a great project,
I definitely recommend that.

55
00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:24.940
Okay, any questions about editor config?.

56
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.800
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

57
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.300
I thought that you could turn on and off
settings like within the prettier config.

58
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.050
Why are you choosing to use
editor config for that purpose?

59
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's good question.

60
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.090
So, the reason why is
because not every editor

61
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.390
understands prettier configs
that's the first thing.

62
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.530
So like for example VS code out
of the box does not read your

63
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.410
prettier config to figure out what
kind of tabs and spaces you want.

64
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.029
So if I don't put in an editor config by
default VS code defaults to four spaces.

65
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.500
So that's what editor config is useful for

66
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.420
is it makes VS code understand
that I want two spaces.

67
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.370
Eventually prettier would fix all that but
it's just easier while you're writing.

68
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.340
And then the second part is, yeah,

69
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.500
most editors understand
editor config quite easily.

70
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.910
And so it's to help all of your projects
with all of your teammates across

71
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.140
various different languages.

72
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.954
It's not totally essential, but it's
something that I do for every project.
