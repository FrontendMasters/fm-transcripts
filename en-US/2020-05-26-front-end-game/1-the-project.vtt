1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.450
This is pretty exciting and fun.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.280
I'm excited to go over this with you.

3
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.260
Do you remember those really annoying

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.470
little digital pet key
chains during the 90s?

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.130
Like Tamagotchi or Digipet or
Giga Pet or all those things?

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.850
I do, I had them and my mom hated them.

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.970
Cuz I had two of them
going at the same time.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.980
And when I went to school,
she would have to take care of them.

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.522
So picture my poor mother having to take
care of both of mine and my sister's.

10
00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:31.530
And we would be furious if they
were not alive when we got home.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.680
My poor mother had to take
care of those damn pets.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.629
And like a saint,
I don't think she killed them very often.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.132
So we're going to recreate that magic.

14
00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:43.740
I'm gonna email this to my mom afterwards,
and

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.060
she's going to take care
of all of your pets.

16
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.808
No, I'm just kidding, sorry mom.

17
00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.250
Yeah, so we're gonna create like
a little digital pet together.

18
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.970
And what's really cool about this is
Frontend Masters commissioned an artist to

19
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.240
make professional art for this, so
it actually looks really, really good.

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.970
I left a link to Alice Brereton's site,
she's the artist for this.

21
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.880
She's an amazing artist, I've used
her several times for commissions, so

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.980
I definitely would, if you need art,
definitely talk to her.

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.230
So I have my version of the game up here.

24
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.160
So if you click this and open it, our
game is gonna look something like this.

25
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.450
Which looks really nice, right?

26
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.539
It's got buttons that work, just like you
know how the Tamagotchi had three buttons,

27
00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.508
and it was really annoying,
and the worst UX ever.

28
00:01:32.508 --> 00:01:34.452
Yeah, we're gonna recreate that,
it's gonna be fun.

29
00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:39.439
So let's go over the project requirements,
then I'll kinda show you the game and

30
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.030
how it works.

31
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.582
I would much rather you be learning and

32
00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:47.363
trying new things rather than
follow exactly these guidelines.

33
00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:49.580
That's more important,
this is more about exploration.

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.577
So if you wanna break the rules here,
no one's watching.

35
00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:56.626
I don't know, maybe I am.

36
00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:01.928
So I put a bunch of requirements here, and
I kinda of just tried to describe it and

37
00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:03.620
hopefully be as helpful as possible.

38
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.905
But again, if something here doesn't
jibe with what you wanna do,

39
00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:07.483
go do something else, that's totally fine.

40
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:12.285
So let's go over the requirements
to the game together.

41
00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:15.195
So the game starts in just
like a initialized state,

42
00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:16.605
which looks something like this, right?

43
00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.545
It's just ready to go, right?

44
00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:20.216
So I call this initialized.

45
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.810
At the bottom, the user can switch
between three icons using the left and

46
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.590
right buttons.

47
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.248
So you can see here,
I can go between all of these.

48
00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.806
And then it loops around, if I try and

49
00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:33.131
go to the right when I'm on
the rightmost one, right?

50
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:34.094
Same thing with left.

51
00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:42.660
Okay, when the user starts,
the fox will hatch.

52
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.621
So it's gonna be a little fox,
which is super cute.

53
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.190
Once the fox has hatched,
then it's gonna be just idling.

54
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.123
So it's just gonna be standing there
waiting for something to happen.

55
00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:56.930
The user can switch the weather at
any time using the weather icon.

56
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.735
Just so you know,
this is the weather icon right there.

57
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.000
And it'll go between day and rain.

58
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.985
After some time,
the fox will become hungry.

59
00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:11.148
Then this should be some sort of variable,
right?

60
00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:15.678
It should be between,
I'm gonna say 15 seconds and 18 seconds.

61
00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:18.450
Right, so
there's a little bit of variability,

62
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.100
there's some excitement
to our digital pet game.

63
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.050
It'll become hungry, and
the fox can only be fed when it's hungry.

64
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.820
That makes sense.

65
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.557
After some interval of being fed,
the fox will poop.

66
00:03:31.557 --> 00:03:35.067
So after the fox poops, then you
will be able to clean up the poop.

67
00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:36.685
You can't clean up poop
before there is poop.

68
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:41.423
There's no [LAUGH] predestination of poop,
I don't know.

69
00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:42.348
When a user cleans up poop,

70
00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:44.740
it should add another interval until
the fox is hungry again, right?

71
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.045
So that's kinda the loop here,
get hungry, then it gets fed,

72
00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:52.792
then it poops, and
then you clean up the poop, right?

73
00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:55.290
That's kinda the loop here.

74
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.851
The fox can't be hungry and poop at
the same time, I think that makes sense.

75
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.930
You get hungry,
then you clean it up, then it poops.

76
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.472
If the fox isn't fed or the poop
isn't cleaned up in some interval,

77
00:04:06.472 --> 00:04:08.953
then the fox will die, unfortunately.

78
00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:13.046
And then it'll go to the game over screen.

79
00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:16.191
And then after some interval of day/rain,
right,

80
00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:20.720
which we're kinda considering those
the same thing, it'll go to night.

81
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.010
And once it goes to night,
then everything resets.

82
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.490
The hungry timer will reset,
the poop timer will reset.

83
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.582
I think you can just assume
that if the fox is hungry,

84
00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:30.710
it'll get a nice kind of snack on its own.

85
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.434
And once the fox is asleep, you can't do
anything until it hits daytime again.

86
00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:40.375
Okay, once the fox dies,
it'll go to the death scene.

87
00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.366
The fox becomes a tombstone and
the game is over.

88
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:47.634
You can press the middle button and
it'll restart

89
00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:52.990
the game back into that
hatching kind of thing.

90
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.410
And then you can see up here at the top,
there's a modal, oops.

91
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.801
This sometimes happen, I think if
the browser cache just gets stale.

92
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.954
So if you just refresh the page,
the background shows up again.

93
00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:07.565
Okay, so you can see here there's
a modal that tells the user,

94
00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:09.509
you've gotta press
the middle button to start.

95
00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.213
So as soon as I press this,
the game will start.

96
00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:19.164
And the fox should not be able to die,
get hungry, poop, be fed, or have the poop

97
00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:24.070
cleaned up, or fall asleep when it is
being fed, sleeping, hatching, or dead.

98
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.250
Right, so if the fox is being fed, right,
it can't die during that period of time.

99
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.650
And the last thing here,
in general, I am a big advocate for

100
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.210
responsive design, so that this should
work on a phone, that kind of thing.

101
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.730
In this particular case, I'm going to let
you just make everything a fixed width.

102
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.760
And that's just kind of
the way it has to be,

103
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.550
cuz this is a pretty
complicated CSS thing.

104
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.777
So you can see here if I make my browser,

105
00:05:57.755 --> 00:06:02.150
Browser window smaller here, you can see
it's not really responding too much.

106
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.210
So that's fine, it's okay to make
this just work at fixed width for

107
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.940
this one time.

108
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.360
All right, so let's just take a look at
the game, the one that I implemented.

109
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.180
And that you and
I are gonna implement together.

110
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.409
Again, this doesn't necessarily have to
be the same way that you implement it.

111
00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.050
But this is just kind of how it worked for
me.

112
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.696
So if I press the middle button,
the fox will appear here, and

113
00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:25.110
it will begin to hatch.

114
00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:30.730
Okay, and you so
you can see the fox here has hatched.

115
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.218
And now we're just kinda waiting for
something to happen,

116
00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:35.930
cuz that's what Tamagotchis do.

117
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.389
So wait a second, hopefully
the fox at some point gets hungry.

118
00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.621
It's not a very hungry fox, I guess.

119
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.100
[LAUGH] There you go,
you can see the fox is now hungry.

120
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.230
It should be pretty obvious what
the fox wants right now, so

121
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.550
I press the fish button.

122
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.300
And the fox will quickly nom on some fish.

123
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.443
And then he's gonna get
real happy about it, so

124
00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:57.222
he'll celebrate that he ate the food.

125
00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.626
And he'll go back to being idling again.

126
00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:07.541
And you can also change
the weather here to the rain.

127
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:11.637
So this is the same as idling,
it's just now it's in a rainy mode.

128
00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:15.834
And then you can see here
now the fox is pooping.

129
00:07:18.984 --> 00:07:20.760
And so here we can clean up the poop.

130
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.680
Again, the fox is very happy that you've
cleaned up its poop, and so it celebrates.

131
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.017
You can see that there was a little
poop bag over there as well.

132
00:07:36.007 --> 00:07:40.640
And at some point, for
the way the I implemented it,

133
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.444
it takes about three minutes to hit night.

134
00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:46.358
And this night we're not gonna feed it,
and

135
00:07:46.358 --> 00:07:49.999
we're gonna just unfortunately let the fox
die so you can see what that looks like.

136
00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:52.680
So this is what the dead scene looks like.

137
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.339
You can see up here it says,
the fox has died,

138
00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:55.830
press the middle button to start again.

139
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.400
And so it'll just stay like this
until I hit the button again.

140
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.633
And then it'll go back into
the beginning of the game.

141
00:08:07.134 --> 00:08:09.400
And again,
this is all available online already.

142
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.770
So you can see it here.

143
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.650
All the code that I have implemented
is up available online, and

144
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.510
I'll show you that here in just a second.

145
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.900
So technical requirements, there are none.

146
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.870
You and I are gonna do this in just
plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

147
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.320
So I'm not gonna use the framework.

148
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.490
I'm actually not even gonna
use any third-party libraries.

149
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.390
That's just the way that I'm
choosing to do it this time.

150
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.217
But if you want to use React, if you
wanna use something else, you're free to.

151
00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:39.426
I would suggest maybe while following
along this course, just follow along with

152
00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:41.984
me and we'll build it together and
HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

153
00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:44.740
But my challenge at the end of
this course is for you to go and

154
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.390
rebuild this game in the technology
stack that you choose.

155
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.037
And I'll have some suggestions
around different things you can try.

156
00:08:51.037 --> 00:08:55.438
But you could do it with React, Angular,
Vue, Svelte, or something like that.

157
00:08:55.438 --> 00:08:58.279
Or even do a server-side version with
Node, which would be really cool as well.

158
00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:04.030
So yeah, this is a simple project
with simple requirements.

159
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.952
If this was done in a vacuum,

160
00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:10.847
there's a high chance that I would do
this just with plain JavaScript and HTML.

161
00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:14.033
Because you can imagine
I'm a React developer,

162
00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:16.740
I choose React most of the time.

163
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.610
But in this particular case,

164
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.680
React is really heavy for
just a couple view layer things.

165
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.470
So this project is well suited for just
being done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

166
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.258
And then the last thing here,
it's a useful exercise for

167
00:09:30.258 --> 00:09:33.070
you to be kind of pulled
away from your tools.

168
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.320
And try things in a different way and

169
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.630
think about things different ways so that
you don't become an Angular developer.

170
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.028
You should be a front end developer
that happens to do Angular right now.

171
00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:48.310
Because in five, ten years, we probably
won't be writing Angular anymore.

172
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.800
I think that's a pretty
safe prediction to make.

173
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.310
But, I guarantee you, we will absolutely
be writing JavaScript in ten years.

174
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.283
So it's good for you to kind of have
those muscles stretched and ready to go.

175
00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:02.527
So beyond that,

176
00:10:02.527 --> 00:10:06.970
you're free to make all the technical
personal choices that you want.

177
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.000
Please, please after you're done and
re-implement this with different

178
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.220
frameworks and tools, please tweet them at
me, and I will definitely retweet them.

179
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.980
I'm really excited to see
the creativity of the community and

180
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.350
all the cool stuff that you do.

181
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.930
So yeah, I would love to see
this in every framework.

182
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.361
Okay, does anyone have any questions?

183
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:28.332
Yes.

184
00:10:28.332 --> 00:10:32.080
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if when you
created the requirements for the app,

185
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.983
if you created the requirements first or
if you built the app first?

186
00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:36.952
&gt;&gt; I did the latter, right?

187
00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:39.400
I wrote the game first and then I
invented the requirements to fit them.

188
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.242
Yeah, that was just way
easier to do it that way.

189
00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.815
[LAUGH] That's a good question though.
