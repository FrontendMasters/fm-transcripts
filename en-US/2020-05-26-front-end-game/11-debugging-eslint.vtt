00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.710
All right, any questions so
far about what we've done so far?

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think that Krista and
I are getting the underlines

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.400
in the warning for example,
under console log.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.200
&gt;&gt; So the first thing you wanna triple
check is make sure that you have

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.550
the ES Lint extension installed, this one.

6
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.680
And then you probably
need to restart VS Code.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.488
So you just command q or alt f4.

8
00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.652
And then just reopen it,
it should probably reopen to the same one.

9
00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:40.800
And then hopefully you should
see those underlines happening.

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.730
Did that help?

11
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.470
It did not?

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.942
&gt;&gt; Already restarted it too, [LAUGH] yeah.

13
00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:49.595
&gt;&gt; Let's see.

14
00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:58.025
I just make sure that ES Lint enabled
is happening in your settings,

15
00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.820
which is command comma, control, comma.

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.370
Make sure that you have
a .eslintrc.json and

17
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.170
it's in the root directory
of your project.

18
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.790
That'd be another thing.

19
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.614
Make sure that this is all well formatted.

20
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:19.350
&gt;&gt; Yes,
that was not enabled in the settings, so.

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

22
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.530
That's cool.

23
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.210
That one definitely should be.

24
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.241
So if you search for any ESLint enable,
hopefully that will help.

25
00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:42.756
I think something else you can do if you
look in the command palette is yeah,

26
00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:48.580
so if you again,
shift command p control, shift p or f1.

27
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.370
All those work will open
the command palette.

28
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.040
If you look at the ESLint, if you type
Yes, lint, it'll show you all the things.

29
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.470
You can do enable ESlint as well and
that should work.

30
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.675
All right,
this actually probably will help for

31
00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:04.390
people that are still having problems.

32
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.040
If you do show output channel, this will
show you all the output from ESLint and

33
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.540
it'll probably tell you
why it's not running.

34
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.338
So, Lynnae asked a good question about

35
00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:20.325
what happens if the underlining
is not happening in the code?

36
00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.245
It's hard for me to say without
actually taking a look at it, but

37
00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:25.485
I'm gonna show you some
steps to figuring that out.

38
00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:31.515
First thing, make sure that
the ESLint extension is installed.

39
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.100
You should see that and
it should say uninstalled, right?

40
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.230
To let you know that it is installed.

41
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.290
That's the first thing.

42
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.530
The next thing you wanna do
is looking into preference.

43
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.600
So command comma, or
you can look at code preferences settings.

44
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.740
And you can see here in ESLint,

45
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.300
there's one here that makes sure
that says EsLint is enabled.

46
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.455
And then the last thing
that might be happening,

47
00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:02.211
which I think is what was happening
to Lynnae, is in your eslintrc.json.

48
00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:06.954
If this is mouth formatted in someway
that the ESLint cannot understand it,

49
00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.898
it's not gonna work, right?

50
00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:14.493
So in Lynnae particular case,
she had a space here.

51
00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:17.489
And so now if I had the space here,
it won't work and

52
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.600
it's not gonna really tell me why.

53
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.040
If I go back and look over here,
it's still remembering it, but

54
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.780
if I was gonna reopen this,
it wouldn't work.

55
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.510
So the way that VS Code will help you
with that, is you can see here in View,

56
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.080
you can look at Output.

57
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.050
Okay, so I'm gonna click at Output.

58
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.670
And then there's a drop down here
with a bunch of stuff I can look at.

59
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.100
Click on the ESLint and

60
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.170
it'll give you all the errors that
are coming out of ESLint, right?

61
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.810
So you can see here it says failed
to load plugin import, right?

62
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.490
And actually,
I think it'll say somewhere up here.

63
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.312
Well, yeah, that's what the problem is.

64
00:03:55.312 --> 00:04:01.930
So if I go back here and save,
Then it'll start working again, right?

65
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.230
So, those are some steps you can figure
out to why things aren't working, and

66
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.510
that's in general, the taken to
debug why extensions don't work.

67
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.130
There's one here for Prettier for example,

68
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.260
we can see everything that
Prettier is happening over here.

69
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.000
So, lots of good stuff going on.
