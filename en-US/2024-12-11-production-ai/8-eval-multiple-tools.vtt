00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.691
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's make one more.

2
00:00:01.691 --> 00:00:04.994
This one's gonna be called all tools, and

3
00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:09.488
it's gonna be when we give
the agent all the tools at once,

4
00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:14.500
cuz right now, we've only been
giving it one tool to pick.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.540
What if we gave it all
the tools to pick and

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.068
then check to see if it
still picks the right tool.

7
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:23.307
Given that it can pick many tools, I wanna
determine if it can pick the right tool,

8
00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:26.343
if given more than one option
to pick a tool, right?

9
00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:28.043
Which is more real world.

10
00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:30.512
So let's do that.

11
00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:35.123
And I think this is mostly
all the same code as well.

12
00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:37.109
Let me just double check.

13
00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.194
I'm trying to be better at being
consistent with the notes that I have here

14
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:42.767
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, yeah,

15
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:46.734
it's mostly all the same code, so
I'm just gonna copy what we already have.

16
00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:51.518
I'll just take the dad joke one,

17
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:56.449
go to allTools, paste that in, like that.

18
00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.446
I need to import the rest of these,
tool definitions.

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:05.910
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So I got that.

20
00:01:09.654 --> 00:01:11.896
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The next thing I need
to do, I think I have a helper in here.

21
00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:15.076
No, it's the same thing.

22
00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:20.042
So really all I gotta do here is now
I just need to pass in all the tools

23
00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.125
to the array.

24
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:22.728
Don't worry about this movie search one.

25
00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:24.217
We haven't made that yet.

26
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:29.708
And then I need to make some inputs for
that same score, though.

27
00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:35.158
So let's do that, I'm gonna

28
00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:41.703
say allTools is all three of those.

29
00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:44.611
To my array down here,
I'm just gonna pass in allTools like that.

30
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.593
Change the experiment from
whatever you had it to.

31
00:01:49.593 --> 00:01:54.302
I'm calling mine allTools, and
then from here it's just like, okay,

32
00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:56.581
let's come up with some inputs.

33
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.801
I expect when I say, tell me a funny
dad joke that you'll call the dad one.

34
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:02.775
Great, what else?

35
00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:10.395
I expect that when the user says,
take a photo of mars,

36
00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:16.202
that it will generate image definition.

37
00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:23.651
And I expect if what is
the most apvoted post on reddit

38
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:29.928
to call the reddit ToolDefinition
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

39
00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:31.257
however many more you wanna do.

40
00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:34.571
Again, ignore the movie one.

41
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.151
We didn't do that one yet,
I forgot to take that out.

42
00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:41.417
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, let's run all Tools.

43
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.786
And let's see if this thing is smart or
not.

44
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:53.699
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Oof,
looks like two out of three passed.

45
00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:54.529
One of them failed.

46
00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.045
Let's go see,
which one do you think failed?

47
00:02:58.045 --> 00:02:58.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Generate image.

48
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.064
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Generate image,
that's what I think too.

49
00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:01.709
I'm gonna run it again.

50
00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.743
Sometimes I like to run them many,
many, many times and

51
00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:08.499
you get the average of all those runs but
this was pretty consistent.

52
00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:14.854
Look at that, it's always failing on
the same one so what I can go do.

53
00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:16.736
So I'm gonna go look at the results,

54
00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:20.339
I'm gonna go all the way down here to
see where it fell that's a one on.

55
00:03:21.507 --> 00:03:22.302
Which one is this?

56
00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:27.247
Reddit, this is a zero on generate_image.

57
00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:28.964
Yeah, it failed on generate_image.

58
00:03:28.964 --> 00:03:32.749
Even though we said, hey,

59
00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:39.178
take a photo means call this,
it's failing.

60
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:41.626
So then we would wanna go back and
then we would wanna go address this.

61
00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:45.342
So maybe this one wasn't good enough, so

62
00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:50.024
I'm gonna say,
I'm gonna change the whole thing.

63
00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:55.960
I'm gonna say, use this tool

64
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.422
with a prompt to generate or

65
00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:07.461
take a photo of anything.

66
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:12.442
Smaller prompt, but kind of tricks the AI
to thinking that it's doing something,

67
00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:14.021
it's not, right?

68
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.982
I could even change the name to be like,
generate image or photo or

69
00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:19.361
something like that.

70
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:24.289
And I might help it, but let's start
with that and see what happens.

71
00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.951
Or actually I'm tripping I need to put
this down here I'm putting in the wrong

72
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:30.541
spot that's why hold on.

73
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.836
Let's put that here and

74
00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:39.346
then here it's just like

75
00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:44.928
the prompt to use to generate,

76
00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:49.447
an image or take a photo.

77
00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:56.937
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, let's try that.

78
00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:05.600
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Boom there we go,
self-healing it's good.

79
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.044
I run it again just to
be just to be sure there

80
00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:12.118
we go looks like that was really good.

81
00:05:12.118 --> 00:05:17.311
So let's go check out our dashboard
look at our visualization.

82
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:21.373
Look at that, that's a pay raise you
show that to your boss like look.

83
00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:26.633
We went from here two months ago,
and now we're here.

84
00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:31.445
That's a pay raise,
you could have statistical evidence

85
00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:35.284
of why you deserve more
money with this chart.

86
00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:37.654
So there you go.

87
00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:42.559
&gt;&gt; Jamie: Can you talk about more like
real world scenarios that you get

88
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:43.527
into with.

89
00:05:43.527 --> 00:05:44.690
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, let's do it.

90
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.476
Let's dive into something
beyond just what we're doing.

91
00:05:49.476 --> 00:05:51.116
And we're only going to talk about it,

92
00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.461
we're not going to implement
any of this stuff, okay?

93
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:56.200
So let's do that.

94
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.046
We're gonna go to this repo that
I'm using called AutoEval, so

95
00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.952
that's what we're actually importing.

96
00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:04.719
And here AutoEvals,

97
00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:10.791
let me go to the root of this thing.

98
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.870
Here's a lot of the metrics and
scores that it has.

99
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.284
So I talked about LLM as a judge.

100
00:06:18.284 --> 00:06:20.720
Here are a lot of them,
I can talk about some of them.

101
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.116
So the battle one is essentially like
getting the result of one thing from your

102
00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:31.610
system versus the result from an internal
one and seeing which one's better.

103
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.310
And then if yours is better,
then you get a higher score.

104
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.330
Closed QA is basically testing whether or
not the LLM,

105
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.172
whatever model you're using,
can answer the question.

106
00:06:44.423 --> 00:06:47.394
Based off of the data that it's already
trained on without having to use

107
00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:48.097
external data.

108
00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:52.289
Without you basically would test whether
or not the LM already knows the answer to

109
00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.493
something without you having to give it
more context with rag or a system prompt.

110
00:06:56.493 --> 00:06:57.717
It should just know it.

111
00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:01.561
Like if I go as GPT 3.5,
something about the Olympics in 1990,

112
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:04.494
I would expect it to know that
without me having to tell

113
00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:07.384
it because it should have
been trained on that data.

114
00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:08.432
That's a close QA.

115
00:07:08.432 --> 00:07:13.450
So it's checking whether or not this
LLM knows the information without you

116
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.118
having to tell it, which is useful because
then now you know what you should tell it.

117
00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:21.170
Humor, I have no idea what that is, but

118
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.045
I'm guessing it detects if
this thing is funny or not.

119
00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:26.091
[LAUGH] If people want to do that.

120
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:30.131
Factuality, it's exactly what it sounds is

121
00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:34.915
the it's checking to see
if the response is factual,

122
00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:38.758
if it's real, based off of some context.

123
00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:43.030
Moderation, exactly what it sounds like,
some of these other things,

124
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:48.002
I don't know, SQL I guess it detects if
this is legit SQL, if it's executable SQL,

125
00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:49.002
not broken SQL.

126
00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:52.567
Kind of scary, then you have the rag ones.

127
00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:55.466
This is where it just like, you know what?

128
00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:56.830
This is where it gets really,

129
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.567
I gotta go to another website
to show you this one actually.

130
00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:01.597
So remember something called ragas.

131
00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:06.899
Ragas is a Python
framework that is literally

132
00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:14.704
its only purpose is to help you
eval your rag based systems.

133
00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:15.699
I was going to do that.

134
00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.037
I was going to implement some
of this today, and I got,

135
00:08:19.037 --> 00:08:22.900
I don't know, I got three hours into and
I realized I was just.

136
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.147
Scratching the surface,
and it wasn't worth it.

137
00:08:24.147 --> 00:08:25.353
It was going to be the whole it was going

138
00:08:25.353 --> 00:08:26.873
to be the whole course
just talking about this.

139
00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:30.093
So I didn't do it, but
it's worth talking about it.

140
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:30.826
Braggers is really cool.

141
00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:37.063
So if you, if you go into their metrics,
how do I go into their metrics?

142
00:08:37.063 --> 00:08:38.238
Here we go their website.

143
00:08:38.238 --> 00:08:39.340
None of those things
are clickable by the way.

144
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.819
They look like they are, but they're not.

145
00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:43.412
[LAUGH] So if we go into their metrics.

146
00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:46.799
Where are they?

147
00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:49.863
There we go, available metrics.

148
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.343
There we go.

149
00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:52.459
I really like the way they break it down.

150
00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:56.326
So they have some good ones on here.

151
00:08:56.326 --> 00:08:58.530
Context precision, and
this as you can see,

152
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.483
this is what I'm talking about is starting
to get deep you see this math already.

153
00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:05.236
Context precision is actually really good.

154
00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:08.493
This one, basically,
I'll show you the code.

155
00:09:08.493 --> 00:09:13.934
This one basically takes a user input,
what your LLM would respond with,

156
00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:18.236
and then what your vector
database would have retrieved,

157
00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:23.546
and it will tell you how precise
your retrieval mechanism is.

158
00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:28.425
Dd your retrieval mechanism find
the appropriate pieces of data

159
00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:33.406
to answer this question,
given the response that your LLM gave?

160
00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:39.186
And they actually break it
down on a mathematical way to

161
00:09:39.186 --> 00:09:41.476
tell you how they do that.

162
00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:45.310
So, I If this looks scary to you,
it's because it is.

163
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.146
But AutoEvals has this in TypeScript.

164
00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:50.556
So we could use it right now.

165
00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.270
You have it, it's in your repo.

166
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.406
But I decided not to use it
because it can get pretty hairy.

167
00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:01.276
Here's an example of how
to do it with a reference.

168
00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:04.850
So a reference is like you already
ran the retrieval ahead of time and

169
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.446
you already know what the reference is, so
you don't need to run the retrieval again.

170
00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:11.376
So you could just put it in here.

171
00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:13.712
So this is like, I'm just testing
the retrieval part directly.

172
00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:15.676
I already ran them ahead of time.

173
00:10:15.676 --> 00:10:17.213
I don't need to run it again.

174
00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:23.232
So here's one and these two use
an LLM to determine that precision.

175
00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:27.957
There's an LLM inside of this
to tell you what's happening and

176
00:10:27.957 --> 00:10:29.839
I can show you that code.

177
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.706
And then it can also do it without an LLM,
where it just like compares these two.

178
00:10:33.706 --> 00:10:36.669
So there is a lot going on here.

179
00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:41.802
There's like noise sensitivity
context entities recall,

180
00:10:41.802 --> 00:10:46.722
faithfulness like there's
a lot of stuff going on here.

181
00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:50.950
And again, there's probably a handful of
people in the world who are just up to

182
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.572
date on all this stuff.

183
00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:55.215
And if it's not the creators of this, it's
probably people who contribute to this.

184
00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:58.891
So this is not something you need to
be up to date with and understand, but

185
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.988
you need to know that there
are systems like this that exist.

186
00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:05.019
And you can pull from and
learn when you need to learn.

187
00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:07.294
But I promise you, every day that I
wake up, there's a new white paper.

188
00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:13.161
I'm like, a better eval metric, a new
standard on how to eval things, right?

189
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:16.922
For instance, if you're making a coding
agent something that can be a copilot,

190
00:11:16.922 --> 00:11:18.815
you're gonna use SWE-bench, right?

191
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:24.329
Like SWE-bench is something
that you would run your coding

192
00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:29.411
agent through to detect how
good it is at writing code.

193
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.930
And this is the standard for
coding agents.

194
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.180
And there's tons of these standards.

195
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.233
There's tons of these metrics and

196
00:11:35.233 --> 00:11:39.280
scores that you use depending
on what you're trying to test.

197
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.720
This is why I said this is
someone's full time job.

198
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.070
This is why this is
a team of people's job.

199
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.536
It's just to do this all day, which is
also why I said, if you're looking for

200
00:11:47.536 --> 00:11:51.658
a skill to learn and like be valuable,
it is this skill, in my opinion,

201
00:11:51.658 --> 00:11:53.418
this is extremely valuable.
