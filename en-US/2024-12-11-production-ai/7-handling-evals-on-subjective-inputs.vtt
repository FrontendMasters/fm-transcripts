1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.329
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
let's make the other evals so

2
00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:06.570
we can see some more experiments going.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.580
So, I'm going to make a new experiment
here in my experiments folder.

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.460
Let's make one for the dad jokes.

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.228
So I'll say,
dadjoke.Eval.ts just like that.

6
00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:31.115
And because it's pretty much
gonna be the same thing,

7
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:36.030
I'm just gonna copy what we had
here in the Reddit, the whole file,

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.807
just gonna paste it into the dad joke.

9
00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:44.297
And I'm just gonna swap out the Reddit
tool call definition to the dadJokeTool

10
00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:48.968
call definition, and
then switch up the inputs, obviously.

11
00:00:48.968 --> 00:00:53.118
So instead of Reddit,
this will be dadJoke.

12
00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:56.952
Instead of this,
this would be dadJokeToolDefinition.

13
00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:05.363
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm gonna change
my experiment name to dadJoke.

14
00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.821
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then I'm going to
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Change

15
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:23.538
my input here to be,
tell me a funny dad joke,

16
00:01:23.538 --> 00:01:28.061
and I'll get rid of this other one.

17
00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:36.112
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So I hope my system
will call the dad joke tool if someone

18
00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.694
says tell me a funny dad joke.

19
00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:43.957
If not then it's pretty bad in fact we
should go sabotage our tool to make

20
00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:48.885
it not respond to dad jokes just so
you can see how we can improve it.

21
00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:52.355
So let's try that after we run it so
you'll see so

22
00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:57.349
you can see the process on how to We
talk about evals, but then, like,

23
00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.412
what do you do when the evals aren't good?

24
00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.792
So we'll talk about, like,
how to improve that.

25
00:02:04.432 --> 00:02:06.762
But for now, let's run it.

26
00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:13.465
So the way you run it, again,
if you're on Windows, you do MPX,

27
00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:18.283
TSX, evals, experiments,
the name of that file you.

28
00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:25.662
So in this case, dadJoke, make sure you
have your importdotemv/config at the top.

29
00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:27.508
If you're not on Windows,
you don't have to do any of that.

30
00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:30.928
You can just run NPM runEval dadJoke.

31
00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:34.771
I'm gonna do it the Windows way
because it also works on Mac, so

32
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:36.664
that way everybody can see it.

33
00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:37.862
So I'm gonna run dadJoke.

34
00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:42.566
And of course, I got 100% because
I literally said in the input,

35
00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:44.279
tell me a funny dad joke.

36
00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.858
There's no way you can mess it up,
given the instructions that we have.

37
00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:49.835
So, gotta do that.

38
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.828
Let's go look at our dashboard to see
how we can view those experiments.

39
00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:54.911
I'll just refresh this right quick.

40
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:57.958
There should be another dad
joke in the drop-down here.

41
00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.456
And you can see the only one that
I ran had 100% so there it is.

42
00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:11.519
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Now,
let's sabotage our dad joke right now.

43
00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.615
It has some pretty good instructions
on the prompts, I think, it says,

44
00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:16.497
get a dad joke.

45
00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:18.572
So it knows to get a dad joke.

46
00:03:18.572 --> 00:03:24.455
But what if I wrote a really
bad description here,

47
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:29.216
like, use this tool to get the weather,

48
00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:32.871
literally a bad description.

49
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:35.786
But my eval still expects an input from,

50
00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:38.802
tell me a funny dad
joke to call that tool.

51
00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:44.761
Do you anticipate the LLM to call this
tool when the LLM thinks that it should

52
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:49.975
call this tool to get the weather
when the user asks for a dad joke?

53
00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:52.915
Probably not.

54
00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:57.403
So I would expect when I run this

55
00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:02.854
that's it's gonna be like.

56
00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:04.872
Actually, it still did it.

57
00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:09.084
[LAUGH] I don't know
why it still did that.

58
00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:10.774
Maybe it's the name.

59
00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:11.862
Let's try to sabotage it here.

60
00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:16.907
Let's call it weather tool.

61
00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:17.908
Something like that.

62
00:04:17.908 --> 00:04:18.688
Let's see what happens.

63
00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:21.502
I did not expect that.

64
00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:29.075
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, yeah, I guess the
name does have a lot of influence on that.

65
00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:34.042
And I think that's because
I'm using 4.o mini.

66
00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:37.339
The 4.o mini is really good.

67
00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.074
I think if you did that on 3.5,
it would not get it.

68
00:04:40.074 --> 00:04:45.019
So let's say you had a poorly named tool,
a poor description,

69
00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:48.395
but yet you expected to do something else.

70
00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:50.502
So this eval would tell you that.

71
00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:54.993
This eval would be like,
wow, it didn't get it.

72
00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:56.839
So what do I need to improve here?

73
00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:01.068
Well, if we're detecting whether or
not the AI is picking the right tool, and

74
00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:04.847
the only way to influence whether or
not the AI can pick the right tool is

75
00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:09.265
the name of the tool that you give it, the
description of the tool that you give it,

76
00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:13.483
and then some other instructions in
the system prompt, well, guess what?

77
00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:17.079
Those are the only things you can
play around with to improve this, so

78
00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.737
once you see that score, then you
then come in and like, okay, well,

79
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.793
I'm gonna call this dad_joke.

80
00:05:22.793 --> 00:05:28.650
Let's not call it weather, and then I'm
gonna say returns, a random dad joke.

81
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.348
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I would
make my improvement.

82
00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:38.203
If you want historical
references of your improvements,

83
00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:42.164
you technically could just make another
experiment in here and call it dad joke,

84
00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:44.567
V1 or V2, and
make a whole nother experiment.

85
00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:47.468
So you can see all the improvements
you had over time.

86
00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:52.992
But because the other thing you could do
is in our eval tool, I'm not doing it,

87
00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:57.279
but this thing can also log
the metadata associated with it.

88
00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.126
So, what was the system prompt?

89
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.613
What was the tool call definition?

90
00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:02.116
So we can log it at that time.

91
00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:05.778
So you can go see over time what the tool
call definition and name was, and

92
00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:09.682
the system prop name was at the time
when you ran that experiment, cuz you're

93
00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:13.623
gonna be changing those things over time
so you can see what not to do, right?

94
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:17.932
And then you can actually take all of
those and write me the most optimized one.

95
00:06:17.932 --> 00:06:21.596
Here are all the results of my
evals with the system prompts and

96
00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:25.203
the tool call names and
definitions and the scores they got.

97
00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:29.396
Write me the most optimized one that
would give me the highest score, and

98
00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:33.246
then it would write you the right name and
the right description and

99
00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:36.457
the right system prompt
to maximize that score.

100
00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:39.627
So this is why it's very important
to log this stuff and keep it.

101
00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:42.837
So, yeah, you would make that improvement.

102
00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:44.627
I'm gonna make that improvement.

103
00:06:44.627 --> 00:06:48.408
I'm gonna run this again
on the same experiment, and

104
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.518
of course I expect it to go up.

105
00:06:50.518 --> 00:06:57.256
So that is the process of running your
evals, figuring out where in your chain,

106
00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:02.298
where in your LLM,
has the influence to make a difference.

107
00:07:02.298 --> 00:07:07.182
Make that change, run your eval again,
see what happens, right?

108
00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:09.480
And then also adding more data.

109
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.355
So now, if we go back to here,
we go back to dadJoke, yeah,

110
00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:18.331
there was 100, 100, then it went to 0,
then it went back to 100.

111
00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:21.918
I think this will only show
the last 10 sets, the last 10 runs.

112
00:07:21.918 --> 00:07:24.699
It won't do more than, I don't think.

113
00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.760
Let's do one for generate image.

114
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.367
So I'm gonna say,

115
00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:37.006
generateImage.eval.ts.

116
00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:42.172
It's very similar, so
I'm just gonna copy it,

117
00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:45.202
bring it in here, paste it.

118
00:07:45.202 --> 00:07:51.174
Import from generateImage,
select the dadToolDefinition,

119
00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:56.139
and change that to
generateImageToolDefinition.

120
00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:59.787
I'm gonna get a new experiment name.

121
00:07:59.787 --> 00:08:05.031
Gonna call this generate
image call whatever you want.

122
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.489
Cursor is already telling
me that inputs jacked.

123
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:10.610
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
take that suggestion, and

124
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.221
I'm gonna say,
generate an image of a sunset.

125
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:16.697
So I expect when a user says,
generate image of a sunset, for

126
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:19.572
this to actually call
the Generate tool message.

127
00:08:19.572 --> 00:08:21.368
Now we're not actually
running the functions.

128
00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:26.248
We're just seeing if the AI is
telling us to run the function, right?

129
00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:28.468
So let's try that one.

130
00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:30.297
So now I'm gonna go here.

131
00:08:30.297 --> 00:08:36.920
I'm gonna say, generate image eval.

132
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.650
And of course I get 100 because
I explicitly asked to do that.

133
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.864
So, you might get a user saying,
let's say you have some analytics and

134
00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:48.580
you anonymized it.

135
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.040
So you can kinda see what people are
saying, but you don't know who they are.

136
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.530
And then you saw that someone said,

137
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.744
take a photo of the sunset.

138
00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:07.225
Would you expect that
to generate an image?

139
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:09.463
I don't know, it depends on
what you want out of your app.

140
00:09:09.463 --> 00:09:14.224
If you want your app to be clever enough
to know that taking your photo also

141
00:09:14.224 --> 00:09:18.828
means generating an image,
i you didn't think of that ahead of time,

142
00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:23.300
you would have had waited to a user
to have said something like that.

143
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.153
It would have had to fail,
you would have had to collect it, and

144
00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:30.008
then you would have had to address it,
right?

145
00:09:30.008 --> 00:09:33.926
I actually don't know what that's
gonna do, so I don't know.

146
00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:35.818
If it fails, we'll address it.

147
00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:39.074
If it doesn't fail,
let's see what happens.

148
00:09:39.074 --> 00:09:39.904
It did fail.

149
00:09:39.904 --> 00:09:43.336
So it doesn't think taking a photo
is rendering an image, but

150
00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:45.054
I want my LLM to be that clever.

151
00:09:45.054 --> 00:09:45.960
So what do I do?

152
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.920
How do I address this?

153
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.302
How do I improve this?

154
00:09:48.302 --> 00:09:55.081
Because for some, my LLM, my agent is like
the number one users are photographers.

155
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.010
So, they always say, take a photo.

156
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.347
So, that's why that's happening.

157
00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.597
So those are my number one users.

158
00:09:59.597 --> 00:10:03.667
So, I need to, like, instead of telling
them, like, hey, stop saying take a photo,

159
00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.607
I need to make my LLM
address take a photo.

160
00:10:05.607 --> 00:10:10.137
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How do you handle it
when eval-ing things that aren't just

161
00:10:10.137 --> 00:10:12.681
a bully and call this tool or not?

162
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:16.021
It could be,
is this structured output valid?

163
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:17.583
These kinds of things.

164
00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.210
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll get
into that right after this.

165
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.467
There's so much of that.

166
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:26.131
You'll see why I had to do
this first before I show you

167
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:30.908
that cuz it's just a can of worms,
it's just crazy.

168
00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:32.478
But we had to do this part first.

169
00:10:32.478 --> 00:10:35.331
So, yeah, I have an LLM that
is on a photography app and

170
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:38.432
most of our users are photographers,
and they love to say,

171
00:10:38.432 --> 00:10:41.482
take a photo when they actually
mean generate something.

172
00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:43.939
So instead of telling them to say,
stop saying that,

173
00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:46.189
I should just tell my LLM to handle that,
right?

174
00:10:46.189 --> 00:10:47.719
So how do I do that?

175
00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:51.525
Well, it failed so I'm gonna go here.

176
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:53.188
I can put something in this description.

177
00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:58.971
Hey, taking a photo is the same

178
00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:04.763
thing as generating an image.

179
00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:07.279
Maybe I'll start with that if I could
spell photo right, there we go.

180
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.453
I'll start with that.

181
00:11:08.453 --> 00:11:10.891
I'll start with that description.

182
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:12.508
I'll add that, and
let's see if that's good.

183
00:11:12.508 --> 00:11:13.866
So I'm gonna rerun this.

184
00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:17.602
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And it did.

185
00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:18.237
It improved it.

186
00:11:18.237 --> 00:11:22.395
So now, I feel pretty confident
that if some user came in and said,

187
00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:26.281
take a photo, that it will call
the generate image function.

188
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:27.961
And this is the process.

189
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:31.651
You do this over and
over and over and over.

190
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:33.755
And this is why it never stops.

191
00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:37.785
Do this forever until eternity,
because people will just find new ways,

192
00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:39.681
especially if you're a chat app.

193
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:42.080
If you're a chat app, every day is just,

194
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.551
you just go see what weird stuff people
are saying, and you try to address it.

195
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.501
That's it [LAUGH].

196
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:52.181
It's really hard, but
also kinda hilarious and fun.

197
00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:56.801
Somebody tried to jailbreak our AI
the other day, and I was like looking

198
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:02.050
at the stuff that they were trying to say,
and it was so hilarious.

199
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.240
It's so funny, yes.

200
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.003
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So if you look at
the dashboard for your image.

201
00:12:07.003 --> 00:12:08.613
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.
Let's look at the dashboard.

202
00:12:08.613 --> 00:12:14.524
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So I noticed that
it this only went down to 50% and

203
00:12:14.524 --> 00:12:19.748
then back up,
as opposed to when you look like

204
00:12:19.748 --> 00:12:24.568
dadJoke it was a very binary zero and one.

205
00:12:24.568 --> 00:12:25.542
What's-

206
00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:26.122
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What's
the difference there?

207
00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:26.798
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

208
00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:30.903
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So I'm pretty sure it's
because I had different amounts of inputs,

209
00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:31.410
right?

210
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.238
So I think on the dad
joke only at one input.

211
00:12:35.238 --> 00:12:38.409
So it was always 100% right or
always zero.

212
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.152
But I think on generate image,
I had two inputs.

213
00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:42.652
So it could be 50% and

214
00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:45.803
it could not be 50% so
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Remember the average of

215
00:12:45.803 --> 00:12:46.629
the results.

216
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:47.777
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Establish the results,
yeah.

217
00:12:47.777 --> 00:12:49.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And so
it's actually running two-

218
00:12:49.948 --> 00:12:50.939
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,

219
00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:54.907
it's running two prompts.

220
00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Against-

221
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.722
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yep, and it gets

222
00:12:56.722 --> 00:12:57.805
the average of both of those.

223
00:12:57.805 --> 00:12:58.624
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Gotcha.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exactly.

224
00:12:58.624 --> 00:13:02.320
Yeah, hope you guys see the power
of just having evals in general,

225
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.710
because if you didn't.

226
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.689
So not only do you need the eval,
you need to log what users are saying,

227
00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:11.736
and you need to save that somewhere so
you can do this part, otherwise,

228
00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:14.869
there's literally no way
you'll ever improve your.

229
00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:16.979
Of your system is like,
how would you have known that?

230
00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:18.149
This is what people were saying.

231
00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:19.823
It's so random.

232
00:13:19.823 --> 00:13:24.287
So, you have to be able to do that, but
once you do it's like, okay, the first

233
00:13:24.287 --> 00:13:28.903
level improvement is prompt engineering,
and that's what we've been doing.

234
00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:30.519
But there's many levels of improvement.

235
00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:32.424
Prompt engineering is just
the first thing you do.
