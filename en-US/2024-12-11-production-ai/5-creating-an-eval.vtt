1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.030
Let's make our reddit eval.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.062
So essentially all the hard work is done
because I already made this run eval

3
00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:07.703
function.

4
00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:11.401
We just have to call it with some data and
our task.

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.019
So let's do that.

6
00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.019
So I'm gonna go to our code
I'm gonna go into evals here.

7
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.159
And where did I put this?

8
00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.260
This is, it's on the root, okay.

9
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.300
Stop going there, thank you.

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.330
So here I'm gonna say reddit and typically
I like to do a dot eval extension.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.153
And yet you actually will have to do that.

12
00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:38.742
If you want the script that I built to
run it for you, you have to do dot eval.

13
00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:41.429
So if you don't do that,
you cell phone get ran.

14
00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:48.278
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And really, all we wanna
do here again is just call this run eval

15
00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:53.536
with our experiment, name our task,
our data, and our scores.

16
00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:54.255
So let's do that.

17
00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:55.722
So I'm gonna say,

18
00:00:55.722 --> 00:01:01.246
runEval that's gonna import that
I'm gonna give an experiment name.

19
00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:03.096
I typically just give it
the same name as the file.

20
00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.026
You can call it whatever you want.

21
00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.106
It's gonna take an object here.

22
00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.486
The first thing is gonna be the task.

23
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:15.886
The task is an async function that always
takes in the input as its argument.

24
00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.936
So that's really all you need,
it's an input.

25
00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:20.957
So what am I gonna do with this?

26
00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:25.405
I'm gonna call our,
I have an LLM a runLLM function here.

27
00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:26.604
It does exactly what it sounds like.

28
00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:28.480
It runs an LLM given an input.

29
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.920
So that thing takes in a messages like
this so you can pass in some new messages.

30
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.440
We just wanna make a new message
here that is role of user,

31
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.270
and the content is gonna
be whatever the input is.

32
00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:54.682
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So run this LLM with
this new message, essentially.

33
00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:04.224
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The other thing is we need
to pass the actual tool definition to

34
00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:04.945
this LLM.

35
00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:09.208
So how could it call, if we're testing
whether or not it were able, it was able

36
00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:13.165
to call the reddit tool, we have to
tell the LLM that it has a reddit tool.

37
00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.006
So we want to be able to do that.

38
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.540
So the way we can do that is we can
pass in a tools array here like this.

39
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.627
And it's always gonna be an array.

40
00:02:21.627 --> 00:02:26.357
And I already have
the reddit tool definition.

41
00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:29.156
You can import that from
source tools reddit,

42
00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:33.027
so I'm gonna pass that in
here to the tools array.

43
00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.107
So we have our task.

44
00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:38.921
The next thing is, we need our data,
so I'm just gonna put one in here.

45
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:43.226
So remember, the data is an object
with the input and then the expected.

46
00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:45.392
So I'm gonna make it an object here.

47
00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:47.084
I'm gonna say the input.

48
00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:51.100
I'm gonna write a user input that I think
should trigger the reddit tool to be

49
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.617
called.

50
00:02:51.617 --> 00:03:00.154
So I'm gonna say,
find me something interesting on reddit.

51
00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:01.807
I mean, I'm literally mentioning
the name reddit here.

52
00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.728
So I would hope that it would
go look at reddit, right?

53
00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:06.298
So that's the input.

54
00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.278
What do I expect to get back?

55
00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:15.648
Okay, so the way the expect,
the way the expectation works,

56
00:03:15.648 --> 00:03:21.933
the value of your expected has to match
the shape of whatever this returns.

57
00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:29.970
So runLLM, if we go look at it,
it returns a message.

58
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.234
So it returns an object.

59
00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:35.633
So our expected value should also return
an object, because we need it to match

60
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:39.649
whatever the task returns,
cuz that's what it's checking against.

61
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.274
If they aren't the same format,
it can't check against them, right?

62
00:03:42.274 --> 00:03:45.651
So whatever your tax returns, whatever
the shape of that, if it's a string,

63
00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:48.021
then you're expected as a string.

64
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.101
If it's an object,
then you're expected as an object.

65
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:52.031
In our case, it's a message.

66
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:57.381
So which is an object with a roll
tool calls content whatever whatever.

67
00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:59.441
So we need to make sure
that we do that as well.

68
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:02.088
So the expected.

69
00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:07.169
In this case, I expect to give
back a message of role assistant

70
00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.418
that has a tool call array and
a function whose name is reddit.

71
00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.917
I expect to see that because I asked for
reddit here, so

72
00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:18.590
I expect the AI to call
a tool with reddit.

73
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.631
So I have a helper function here
called create tool call message,

74
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:23.028
that'll just do that for us.

75
00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:26.779
So I'm gonna use that, actually,
I'll, I'll just write it out.

76
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:33.731
So create tool call message,
and what does it do?

77
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:40.068
Yeah, it just takes in the tool name, so,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Which is a string,

78
00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:44.836
and it's just gonna return that shape
of the object that I talked about.

79
00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:48.733
So role assistant, tool calls,
type function, function, name,

80
00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:49.883
tool name, right?

81
00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:52.748
So nothing crazy, so let's do that.

82
00:04:52.748 --> 00:04:59.848
It's gonna turn the message,
role assistant, there we go.

83
00:04:59.848 --> 00:05:05.137
Tool calls, there's an array of objects.

84
00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:09.766
Inside of this object,
there is a function that has

85
00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:14.407
a name that is whatever
the tool name you passed in.

86
00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:20.717
And I think there, yeah, I need type
function, there we go, type function.

87
00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:29.285
So now we have that function.

88
00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:34.512
Now, when I go down to expected,
I can just say, yeah,

89
00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:40.433
create a tool call message with
the reddit definition.name.

90
00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:42.781
So that's our one input.

91
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:46.291
For every one data object you have
in here, this will be called one,

92
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.284
one time, right?

93
00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:50.043
So if I have 30 in here,
this will be called 30 times.

94
00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:51.696
I'll have 30 runs for this one experiment.

95
00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:55.613
And the score is the average of
amongst all those runs, right?

96
00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:57.353
So we're just gonna put one,
we're not going to get crazy.

97
00:05:58.563 --> 00:06:00.699
But as you can imagine,
if these were real user ones,

98
00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.846
you're gonna find out real quick how good
your system is or how good it isn't.

99
00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:05.616
And then you'll be able to find those.

100
00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:09.926
You can take it to the next level like,
okay, all the ones that got a zero.

101
00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:14.676
Find me the common words across all those
user inputs so I can get a word cloud.

102
00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:18.349
And then now, I know what words I need to
add to my prompts and my instructions so

103
00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.086
it can catch them next time, right?

104
00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:25.240
You just got to get really creative
with it, it's like some detective stuff.

105
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.776
Okay, so now that we have our data,

106
00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:35.483
the next thing we want
to do is our scores.

107
00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:39.726
So we can go down here, and
we can say scorers, and

108
00:06:39.726 --> 00:06:46.210
we're going to import our tool called
match score here, so let's do that.

109
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.640
Import tool called match scores.

110
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.700
Bring that down here.

111
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.916
Wait, why is this thing freaking out?

112
00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:55.244
I forgot a comma, there we go.

113
00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:01.717
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So now you should
have a file that looks like this.

114
00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:06.500
RunEval reddit,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Task

115
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.395
is this input, we have this user here.

116
00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:15.204
What the input is the content we're
gonna check to make sure that the AI

117
00:07:15.204 --> 00:07:17.414
has access to this reddit tool.

118
00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:20.652
The data we want to test is find me
something interesting on reddit.

119
00:07:20.652 --> 00:07:23.567
We expect it to return a message that
has a ToolCall to the same name, and

120
00:07:23.567 --> 00:07:25.973
we're gonna check it
against a ToolCall score.

121
00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:29.838
So now let's run this, and
hopefully this doesn't burn.

122
00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:36.913
[LAUGH] So to run this, you can do npm
run eval, and then the name of that file.

123
00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:41.804
So in this case, the name of my file
is reddit, should be able to run ads.

124
00:07:41.804 --> 00:07:44.108
And what did it say?

125
00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:50.818
Did I misspell my file, maybe reddit?

126
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.998
You know what, you have to put it in
an experiments folder, that's why.

127
00:07:57.328 --> 00:07:58.448
Sorry about that.

128
00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:02.000
Make sure you put these experiments in an
experiments folder, then it'll catch it.

129
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.320
I forgot I did that.

130
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.949
Okay, so
now that it's in the experiments folder,

131
00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:11.024
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I believe it'll work now.

132
00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:14.068
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, and there it is.

133
00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:19.590
So our previous score was 1, our current
score is 1, the difference is 0.

134
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.212
It's saying that because I
already have some scores in here.

135
00:08:22.212 --> 00:08:24.484
So what you can do is if you
go to the root of your repo,

136
00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:25.992
there's a results.json there.

137
00:08:27.822 --> 00:08:28.875
I have tons of stuff in here.

138
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:35.015
I'm just gonna clear this out,

139
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.794
okay, hold on.

140
00:08:37.794 --> 00:08:40.379
I'm gonna clear this out, and

141
00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:45.861
I'm just gonna put an empty
experiments array in here like this.

142
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.312
So that way, mine is clear.

143
00:08:47.312 --> 00:08:48.607
That way, there's no comparison,

144
00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:51.002
it should always just be this first
one should just be the first one.

145
00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:55.525
Yours will look different than
mine cuz you didn't have any, so

146
00:08:55.525 --> 00:08:57.464
I'm gonna run that again.

147
00:08:57.464 --> 00:09:01.937
And yours probably looks something like
this, where it said, experiment reddit,

148
00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:05.598
previous score is 0, current score is 1,
the difference is +1.

149
00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:07.331
Yours might look something like this.
