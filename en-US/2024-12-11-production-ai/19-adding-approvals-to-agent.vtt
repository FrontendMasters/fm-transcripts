1
00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:02.822
We got to go tell our agent,
about approvals now.

2
00:00:02.822 --> 00:00:06.234
So we're gonna create a function
called handleImageApprovalFlow,

3
00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:09.004
and this is pretty much gonna
do all this stuff for us, and

4
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.915
then we just need to check for
that before we start our loop.

5
00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:13.440
So I'll walk you through it, as we do it.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.851
So, let's go to our agent,
make a new function up here,

7
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:23.333
it says handleApprovalFlow.

8
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.458
Or what did I call it?

9
00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.712
It would be very specific what I had.

10
00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:29.044
Handle image approval flow.

11
00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:29.748
Let's do that.

12
00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:36.425
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we're gonna do that.

13
00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:41.378
And this function really just needs,

14
00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:45.091
all the messages so far, and

15
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:50.676
the new user message, that's really it.

16
00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.576
We need all the messages,
and you'll see why.

17
00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:56.852
So, history is AI message,

18
00:00:56.852 --> 00:01:00.783
user message is a string.

19
00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:07.544
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
we're gonna walk through this.

20
00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:13.219
So, the first thing is, we need to get the
last message, which is the latest message.

21
00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.761
The last message in the database
is the newest message.

22
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:18.820
It's the last message that
the conversation left off on.

23
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.795
This is how we can tell,
if you're an approval state or not.

24
00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:24.587
So all I have to do is look
at this last message, and

25
00:01:24.587 --> 00:01:26.328
we can see if it was a tool call.

26
00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:31.122
So if I say, cool,
grab this last message from the history,

27
00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.381
which here's a neat trick.

28
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:37.149
I think you can just do,
at negative one now, right?

29
00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.412
I think that's the same thing,
so much better.

30
00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:44.983
So you could say,
that'll give the last thing in the array.

31
00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:50.325
We check to see, hey,
does that message have a tool calls array?

32
00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:55.318
And if so,
grab the only tool that's in there.

33
00:01:55.318 --> 00:01:59.711
And then, we check to see,
if this is not a tool call, or

34
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:05.431
if there is a tool call but its name
is not the name of generating an image.

35
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.599
We don't need an approval.

36
00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.264
We can just stop right now, right?

37
00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:09.293
We don't need to do anything.

38
00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:11.904
So, let's do that.

39
00:02:11.904 --> 00:02:16.122
If this is not a tool call or,
tool call dot,

40
00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:19.772
what that's tool call dot function,

41
00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:24.906
that's right, function dot name,
does not equal,

42
00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:30.410
you've got to import the image
generation name in here.

43
00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.217
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Tools, there we go.

44
00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:41.196
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Generate
image tool definitions.

45
00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:45.538
So if it doesn't equal generate
image to definition dot name, then,

46
00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:47.241
we can just stop right now.

47
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.510
We don't need an approval.

48
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.607
Everything's good.

49
00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:52.160
It's either they're
calling another function,

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.254
or it's just not even a function call,
just a regular thing.

51
00:02:55.254 --> 00:03:01.297
But if it is, a tool call,
that's image generation.

52
00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:04.578
Let's make a loader.

53
00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:07.802
So we'll make a loader.

54
00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:11.621
We will then now process the user
message to see if they approved it or

55
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.631
disapproved it.

56
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:18.320
So we'll say,
approved is await runApprovalCheck.

57
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.372
And it just takes in the user message,
like that.

58
00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:23.187
So this would be a Boolean true or false.

59
00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:30.843
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then from there,
we can say, cool, if you did approve it,

60
00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:34.106
let's go ahead and just call our
run tool function right here.

61
00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:36.464
We can actually just
call the generate image,

62
00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:40.755
we know that's the one you wanna call, but
let's just call the run tool function for

63
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:42.765
now, assuming that we might add more.

64
00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:45.451
Types of actions that need approval here.

65
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:50.382
If you didn't, we'll save a new message,
a new tool message, cuz we have to respond

66
00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:54.904
back with a tool message of saying,
user did not approve that image generation

67
00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:58.487
at this time, or whatever you
wanna tell the AI so it can stop.

68
00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.471
But in this case, it'll just keep going.

69
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:02.795
So, let's do that.

70
00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:08.279
If approved,
let's update our loader to be,

71
00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.657
cool, I'm doing that now.

72
00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:14.698
And then, we just wanna run the tool
with the tool call and the user message.

73
00:04:14.698 --> 00:04:20.909
So I'll say const to response, on time,

74
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:27.120
equals await run tool with the tool call,

75
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.919
and the user message like that.

76
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.892
So we get back our tool response,
whatever that is.

77
00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:40.597
And then the last thing we want to do is,
update our loader to let them know

78
00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:44.239
that we're done and
then we have to save this response.

79
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.002
So I'm gonna say, do that.

80
00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:53.392
And then I'm gonna say,
wait, save tool response,

81
00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:58.220
tool response takes in the tool call ID,

82
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.914
which should just be, tool called ID.

83
00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:05.945
And then it takes in the response that
you got back from running the tool,

84
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.943
running the tool itself
with the run tool call.

85
00:05:07.943 --> 00:05:10.605
So, this will be tool response.

86
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.064
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then, else,
if you didn't do this, then,

87
00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:22.779
we also, yeah,
we still wanna save a tool response.

88
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:29.932
But the answer to this is,
user did not approve it.

89
00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:31.338
You can put whatever
message you want here.

90
00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:32.647
This doesn't matter.

91
00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:33.757
It's not gonna call the function.

92
00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:34.836
This is what calls the function.

93
00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.719
So, regardless, the function isn't called.

94
00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.850
This is just trying to help the AI out.

95
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.724
It's probably gonna be confused.

96
00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:44.046
Like, wait, why didn't you do the tool?

97
00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.074
That's not what I expect you to do.

98
00:05:45.074 --> 00:05:48.323
So you kinda wanna tell it, yeah, man,
the user didn't approve this one, sorry.

99
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.375
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so we got that.

100
00:05:56.375 --> 00:06:01.175
Now, we just need to stop the loader and

101
00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:04.381
then, return true here.

102
00:06:07.247 --> 00:06:11.288
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Loader dot stop,
and then return true.

103
00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:16.283
If we got this far, that means,

104
00:06:16.283 --> 00:06:23.510
there was something that
need to be approved.

105
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.665
If we return false, that means,
nothing needed to be approved.

106
00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:30.623
And we need to know that
because depending on whether or

107
00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:34.887
not, something needs to be approved or
not, we need to add this user message.

108
00:06:34.887 --> 00:06:39.261
Because if there was an approval,
we already added this message,

109
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:43.569
because that message would have
been a response to the tool call.

110
00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.455
If If there was not an approval,
then, we need to proceed as usual and

111
00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:48.733
add the message here.

112
00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:51.307
So, that's why we have to return true or
false.

113
00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:54.308
And now we actually have to get
the history at the top, whereas before,

114
00:06:54.308 --> 00:06:55.970
we're only getting the history here.

115
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.530
We have to get the history here now,

116
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.719
because the approval tool
needs all the history.

117
00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.978
So, let's do that.

118
00:07:01.978 --> 00:07:06.857
We'll go down here, we'll say,

119
00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:12.242
history equals how you get messages,

120
00:07:12.242 --> 00:07:17.289
and then we say, is approval equals

121
00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:22.335
await, what I call this, handle,

122
00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:26.219
image, approval, flow.

123
00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:30.880
That wants all of the history,

124
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.293
and the user message.

125
00:07:34.293 --> 00:07:38.145
And then I can say, okay, well, if there
was never an approval in the first place.

126
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:42.620
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Not if it was approved or
not, but

127
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.728
if it was even an approval request,
a pending approval.

128
00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:49.371
Then I can say, we need to add this
message because otherwise this message

129
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:50.742
won't get added, right?

130
00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:54.939
Like if we go up here,
it returns false right here.

131
00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:58.862
So, I never added the user message,
to the database.

132
00:07:58.862 --> 00:08:03.232
So it'll get here, It'll get the messages,
it'll put them in here.

133
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.654
And the last message it'll see,
would be the message that it said,

134
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.045
and not what the user said.

135
00:08:08.045 --> 00:08:10.224
So we have to add this back,
just like we had it before, but

136
00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:11.563
only if there wasn't an approval.

137
00:08:11.563 --> 00:08:18.601
If there was an approval, approved or
not, we can't make a user message, right?

138
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:20.896
This makes a role user message,

139
00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:24.644
because here we are in
an appending approval state.

140
00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:28.380
The message has to be a tool message.

141
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.091
You have to respond back with a tool.

142
00:08:30.091 --> 00:08:33.273
So this is where it's, kinda confusing.

143
00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:35.892
&gt;&gt; Student: In your check,
you're checking if it's the wrong tool.

144
00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:40.230
I mean, would there be a case
here where it would be still in

145
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.313
an inconsistent state cuz you
had a tool call just one?

146
00:08:44.313 --> 00:08:45.463
It wasn't the image one?

147
00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:46.485
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Well,
I'm checking right here.

148
00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.371
&gt;&gt; Student: It's gone.

149
00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:52.343
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so,
we only proceed if it's not a tool call,

150
00:08:52.343 --> 00:08:54.496
or if the tool call is.

151
00:08:54.496 --> 00:09:00.190
We only proceed if it is a tool call and
the tool call's name is generated.

152
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.525
&gt;&gt; Student: You're saying if it's.

153
00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:03.758
Well.

154
00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:07.584
Mean, but if it's not that tool,
then it's kinda immaterial.

155
00:09:07.584 --> 00:09:12.184
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, yeah, if it's
not that tool, it'll return, and then,

156
00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.247
it'll call this, and then.

157
00:09:14.247 --> 00:09:17.992
&gt;&gt; Student: And it'll still be
cuz if it is some other tool,

158
00:09:17.992 --> 00:09:21.466
you'd need to have that tool's response.

159
00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:25.111
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I should just say,
we would never be in a state,

160
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:28.211
where the last message in the database,

161
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:33.613
is a tool call if that tool didn't
need an approval in the first place.

162
00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:36.280
Unless your system broke for
some reason and

163
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.098
the last message it left
off on was a tool call.

164
00:09:39.098 --> 00:09:42.942
At that point, you would probably
wanna implement a self-healing thing,

165
00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:46.844
that checks, the last message in the
database to make sure it's not ending on

166
00:09:46.844 --> 00:09:49.386
something that's broken like that and
instead.

167
00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:52.066
&gt;&gt; Student: This should be this
one doesn't need an approval.

168
00:09:52.066 --> 00:09:53.043
Just go ahead and run it.

169
00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:53.544
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exactly.

170
00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:54.266
&gt;&gt; Student: The response.

171
00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:55.984
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
how the hell they being up in the state.

172
00:09:55.984 --> 00:09:57.184
I don't know, just run it.

173
00:09:57.184 --> 00:09:59.020
Yeah, Yeah.

174
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.900
Cool, so, the other thing we
need to do is stop the loop,

175
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.321
when we see, we're in an approval state.

176
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:11.927
So all we have to do is go
ahead into the tool call thing.

177
00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:13.757
We can be, hey, are you generating image?

178
00:10:13.757 --> 00:10:15.918
Cool, stop right now.

179
00:10:15.918 --> 00:10:17.395
Don't continue and return.

180
00:10:17.395 --> 00:10:21.901
That way it doesn't continue in the last
message that we see is the tool call, so

181
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:25.870
when we come back our handle approval,
we'll see that it tool call and

182
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.898
it'll kick off.

183
00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:31.175
So, let's do that so in here we'll say,

184
00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:36.429
if tool call.or I'm sorry,
no, that's right,

185
00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:40.096
tool call dot function, dot name,

186
00:10:40.096 --> 00:10:45.863
triple equals generate tool definition,
dot, name.

187
00:10:45.863 --> 00:10:50.779
Then, let's do our loader, update loader,
stop and then get messages.

188
00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:55.293
So we'll just do that, update our loader,
like, Need user approval.

189
00:10:55.293 --> 00:10:59.151
Stop the loader, so stop spinning,
and then return which exits out this

190
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:02.767
whole process, the while loop
everything with just the messages.

191
00:11:02.767 --> 00:11:04.272
So we completely stop.

192
00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:07.157
Otherwise it's a regular tool, keep going.

193
00:11:07.157 --> 00:11:10.510
All right, let's give it a try and
see what we broke.

194
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.228
So, I'm going to go to my terminal.

195
00:11:14.228 --> 00:11:21.621
I'm gonna say npm starts, and I'm gonna
say it generates an image of a turtle.

196
00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:28.303
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's thinking,
and it's, cool, yes,

197
00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:30.546
I need to call the generate image.

198
00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:33.941
But do you approve greeting or
generating an image?

199
00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:35.551
So, we didn't add this part.

200
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:38.064
So we're wondering where
the hell did this came from?

201
00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:40.280
Already did that here in this UI file.

202
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.166
So, it checks to see if there's
a tool call with this name, it'll,

203
00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:45.578
it'll put that for you.

204
00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:47.762
So you didn't have to do that,
that's free.

205
00:11:47.762 --> 00:11:52.685
So now you can respond back with,
something ambiguous.

206
00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:56.002
I actually ran something in here and
it killed the terminal, and I was,

207
00:11:56.002 --> 00:11:59.111
I think I put yes with exclamation part,
and, nothing happened.

208
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:03.025
So, I don't know, why that happens,
but I'm not gonna do that, or

209
00:12:03.025 --> 00:12:04.792
something kindaa in between.

210
00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.735
I wanna see if it figures it out.

211
00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:10.069
Sure, [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know.

212
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:11.171
Let's see.

213
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:14.771
&gt;&gt; Student: With the question mark,
it's gonna be, meh.

214
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:15.845
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It was, no.

215
00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:18.909
I said that's not it, that was not enough.

216
00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:23.968
I think it's because if you really
think about what I told it.

217
00:12:23.968 --> 00:12:25.018
Where did I put this.

218
00:12:27.802 --> 00:12:32.562
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
it's in the LLM file, it's this one.

219
00:12:32.562 --> 00:12:35.462
I was, if you are not sure
that it is not approved.

220
00:12:35.462 --> 00:12:40.055
&gt;&gt; Student: What if you would have said,
sure would not a question mark?

221
00:12:40.055 --> 00:12:41.969
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, let's try it again.

222
00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.568
Actually, let's check this out.

223
00:12:44.568 --> 00:12:47.135
Let's try that image.

224
00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:49.452
Let's try that turtle again.

225
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:50.306
It should know that.

226
00:12:54.763 --> 00:13:02.692
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Nice, and then I can say,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Sure, nice, I did it.

227
00:13:02.692 --> 00:13:06.705
So, yeah, that question mark was
the difference of it being like mmm.

228
00:13:06.705 --> 00:13:09.271
You didn't seem too sure,
it's always my head a gun to your head.

229
00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:11.751
So, I'm not gonna do that one, and

230
00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:15.822
now it's gonna generate us a turtle image,
Blink twice.

231
00:13:15.822 --> 00:13:20.322
Yeah, blink twice if you are sure,
[LAUGH] if you need help,

232
00:13:20.322 --> 00:13:23.217
I have a 911 tool, okay come here.

233
00:13:23.217 --> 00:13:24.709
Let me click on this.

234
00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:28.268
Come here, thank you.

235
00:13:28.268 --> 00:13:29.801
Look, it's a turtle.

236
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:30.554
&gt;&gt; Student: So pretty.

237
00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:31.523
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Nice, nice.

238
00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:33.705
So, cool.
