1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.794
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So follow along as we
implement the memory management that

2
00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:06.240
we're gonna do.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.574
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So our strategy is window
sizing, limited to window sizing and

4
00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.038
doing a very naive summarization.

5
00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:16.090
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
then you can improve that if you want.

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.290
I'll give you some tips.

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.042
So the first thing is we
need to go to our LLM.

8
00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.763
And we need to get this summary.

9
00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:25.903
Well, actually,
we have to make that function first.

10
00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:27.148
So let's start here in the memory.

11
00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:33.687
In the memory file, we're gonna make
a function that gets the summary.

12
00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:37.709
And then we're gonna do this code
right here that basically gets

13
00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:39.280
the last five messages.

14
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.426
Just tap it off F5,
you can do whatever number you want,

15
00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:44.520
that's the window that I'm picking
is just the last five messages.

16
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.146
And then it tries not to leave off
on a tool response cuz that would

17
00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:51.690
put the database,
it would put the LM in a broken state.

18
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.803
So like, can't leave off on that message,
get one more after that,

19
00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:56.323
just to make sure it's not broken.

20
00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:00.668
And then the other thing is creating
a summary every 10 messages,

21
00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:02.277
I'll create a summary.

22
00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:05.067
These are just random
numbers that I picked.

23
00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:06.097
You can pick whatever numbers you want.

24
00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:08.425
So let's do that.

25
00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:10.713
Let's head over to our memory,
and the first thing is,

26
00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:12.037
I'm gonna update these types.

27
00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:13.485
So now there's a summary here.

28
00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:19.941
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's go to view string,
and then in our default data,

29
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:24.510
I just want the summary to be
an empty string, so we got that.

30
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.740
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: For the add messages.

31
00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:37.107
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All we wanna do is check to
see if the messages length is greater or

32
00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:41.687
equal to 10, and
then we want to get the oldest messages.

33
00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:46.830
So the last, the oldest five messages and
run this summarize messages

34
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.119
function that we're gonna create and
then just update the summary to be that.

35
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.553
So let's do that.

36
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.379
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And we'll make that
function and come back to it, so

37
00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.491
it's not there right now,
but we'll make it.

38
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:10.655
So db.data.messages.length greater than or
equal to 10.

39
00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:14.776
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Then we wanna
grab the oldest messages.

40
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:22.499
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Equals
db.data.messages.slice,

41
00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:28.411
what did I put here, 05 map,
okay so, or yeah, 05 and

42
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:33.482
I need to map over these
to remove the metadata from

43
00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:39.425
them because I don't want the IDs and
created at in there.

44
00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:44.709
Actually, maybe you do, maybe you do,
cuz put them in the summary.

45
00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.956
No, but we'll leave it.

46
00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:49.100
Need an eval for that.

47
00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:56.115
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And now we'll come back and
add the summary, but for

48
00:02:56.115 --> 00:03:02.826
now, we'll just say const summary
equals an empty string, okay?

49
00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:08.311
And then we will say,
db.data.summary equals the summary.

50
00:03:08.311 --> 00:03:11.093
That way we can write it and when we make
the function, we'll come back and do this.

51
00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:18.920
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, and
now to get the messages.

52
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:21.681
Pretty simple.

53
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.251
We get the last five.

54
00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:27.701
We do this logic right here and
then we return the last five.

55
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:33.631
So let's say,
get rid of this return right here.

56
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:34.341
This instead.

57
00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:35.827
This is gonna be our messages.

58
00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:50.076
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Our last five
are gonna be messages.,

59
00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:55.049
what did I do, /-5.

60
00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.389
So we got that.

61
00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.787
And then the logic to do this, basically
what we're doing is we're like, okay,

62
00:04:00.787 --> 00:04:04.126
it's the first thing in this
array which is the oldest thing.

63
00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:07.640
Is its role tool?

64
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.451
If that's the case, what's gonna
happen is if we pass that into the AI,

65
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.166
it's gonna be like,

66
00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:20.760
you cannot have a tool response
without a tool call with the same ID.

67
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.610
So we don't want that.

68
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.031
It's gonna error.

69
00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:27.827
So we then say, okay, we'll go get the one
before that, which would be the tool call,

70
00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:29.359
and then this should work.

71
00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:31.561
That's essentially what this is doing.

72
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:33.241
So I'm just gonna paste that in.

73
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:36.451
And let me update my
code to say last five.

74
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.364
And I guess I should
spell messages correctly.

75
00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:47.697
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So, pretty simple, and then
we just put them back in the same order.

76
00:04:47.697 --> 00:04:52.197
The way it works is, the latest message
in a chat is always the one at the end.

77
00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:53.927
The oldest message is always
the one at the beginning.

78
00:04:55.027 --> 00:05:00.031
I guess I don't have to do this, I guess
I could just do that [LAUGH] I think that

79
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:04.899
works the same, I don't know what that
was, I think it just looked cool.

80
00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.538
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You need to return at
the end for if it's not the 6th.

81
00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:16.724
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
I need to return the last 5.

82
00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:29.686
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, and then we need to
make a function that says get summary.

83
00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:34.647
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Get summary.

84
00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:35.207
It's gonna be.

85
00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:41.779
Const db equals, how do we get the db?

86
00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.198
Await get db.

87
00:05:49.277 --> 00:05:52.545
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then we're just
gonna return db.data.summary.

88
00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:05.573
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Pretty simple.

89
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.673
So now, if we go back to the LLM,
we need to do two things.

90
00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:11.968
Need to get the summary,
put it in here, and

91
00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:15.103
then we need to create
our summarized messages.

92
00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:18.769
So let's just start with our
summarized messages, and

93
00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:22.281
then we can bring that back into here and
keep moving.

94
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.883
So let's go to LLM.

95
00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.941
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Make a new function at
the bottom called summarize messages.

96
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:42.327
And this thing just is gonna
take in a list of messages.

97
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:44.829
That's it.
And then it's gonna have a system

98
00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:48.827
prompt and that's about it with
those messages and that's it.

99
00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:55.736
So let's say messages, AI message is that.

100
00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:00.717
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Response is await.

101
00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:10.264
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Run LLM.

102
00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:18.293
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Gonna pass in those
messages, gonna pass in a system prompt.

103
00:07:18.293 --> 00:07:22.383
And we're gonna say,

104
00:07:22.383 --> 00:07:27.334
you're Job is to summarize

105
00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:32.500
the given messages to be used

106
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.754
in another LLM's system prompt.

107
00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:48.660
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Summarize it, play by play.

108
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.720
So it's like, AI said this,
user said this.

109
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.200
AI said this, user said this.

110
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.570
Otherwise, it'll spit out a paragraph,
which might also work.

111
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.970
You got to play around with it.

112
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.629
You have to eval this.

113
00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:05.874
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got our messages.

114
00:08:05.874 --> 00:08:08.194
I'm a crank up the temperature
a little bit on this,

115
00:08:08.194 --> 00:08:09.795
a little bit of randomness I think.

116
00:08:11.045 --> 00:08:12.605
Why not?
Don't do that.

117
00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:16.977
Definitely don't do that.

118
00:08:16.977 --> 00:08:19.975
These numbers, although are just decimals.

119
00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:21.529
They're very strong.

120
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:24.359
I would never go over 0.4.

121
00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:29.041
I guess if I were to make something so
wrong,

122
00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:33.863
if you do this,
you won't get back English.

123
00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:36.807
You'll get back a character
you've never seen.

124
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.886
I didn't even know there
was a rendering for that.

125
00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:40.957
Yeah, don't do that.

126
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.309
Okay, I think that's it.

127
00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:47.661
So then we just return the content.

128
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.939
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Just in case,
fall back here.

129
00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:55.267
So we got that.

130
00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:58.979
And then while we're in here, we might as
well go ahead and pull in the git summary.

131
00:08:58.979 --> 00:08:59.779
So I'll do that.

132
00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:04.109
I'll say summary equals await,

133
00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:07.516
get summary from memory.

134
00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:16.316
Then what I can do is I can just add
that to, I'm in the wrong function.

135
00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:17.530
I'll that here.

136
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.285
I want to do that up here and to run LLM.

137
00:09:21.285 --> 00:09:27.335
So up here I want to say,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Get summary.

138
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:35.795
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And the system prompts
is gonna be this, plus the summary.

139
00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:39.130
So I'll do this.

140
00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:47.777
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I can say,
conversation so far.

141
00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:52.603
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Like that.

142
00:09:54.483 --> 00:09:59.234
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And the last thing
we need to do is go back to memory,

143
00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:03.101
go to where we're adding the messages and

144
00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:08.628
summary right here should be await,
summarize messages,

145
00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:13.738
and it's gonna take in
the oldest messages like that.

146
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:14.703
Let's see what it does.

147
00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:18.140
What's my database looking like?

148
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.888
We're looking good.

149
00:10:18.888 --> 00:10:20.444
We're looking good, okay.

150
00:10:20.444 --> 00:10:21.472
Let's see if we broke something.

151
00:10:23.774 --> 00:10:27.471
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, I don't know.

152
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:28.604
You tell me.

153
00:10:37.194 --> 00:10:38.069
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Do it.

154
00:10:42.882 --> 00:10:44.140
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Here's a joke for you.

155
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.862
What do you call a beehive
without the bees at e-hive?

156
00:10:47.862 --> 00:10:51.820
My goodness, that was so cringe [LAUGH].

157
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.558
Humor can be quite subjective if you like.

158
00:10:57.558 --> 00:10:59.400
I can share a different type of joke.

159
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:05.591
Yeah, let's see.

160
00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:06.713
Do it.

161
00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.238
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's see if this one says.

162
00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:13.348
Here's another joke for you.

163
00:11:13.348 --> 00:11:15.958
Why was the big cat
disqualified from the race?

164
00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.096
Because it was a cheetah.

165
00:11:17.096 --> 00:11:21.131
[LAUGH] I hope that one brings a smile.

166
00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:21.746
What a jerk.

167
00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:23.561
This thing's is getting too good.

168
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:33.793
Make me some art for that joke.

169
00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.490
Yes, I do.

170
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.227
I wonder if I put a check here,
check this out.

171
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.515
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] Putting
a check emoji wasn't approval.

172
00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:55.425
That's actually pretty cool.

173
00:11:56.505 --> 00:11:58.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It's not ambiguous.

174
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:04.705
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
let's see what art it made.

175
00:12:07.281 --> 00:12:09.211
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Come on.

176
00:12:09.211 --> 00:12:09.981
There we go.

177
00:12:09.981 --> 00:12:11.561
Come on, come here.

178
00:12:13.053 --> 00:12:14.889
My goodness, why does it take so long?

179
00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:21.735
[LAUGH] Why is he so sad?

180
00:12:21.735 --> 00:12:26.812
&gt;&gt; Audience: [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: He's a cheetah.

181
00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:27.550
My goodness.

182
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.050
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH].

183
00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.193
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is hilarious.

184
00:12:31.193 --> 00:12:35.915
What is this animal?

185
00:12:35.915 --> 00:12:38.009
[LAUGH] What is going on?

186
00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:39.601
This is hilarious.
