1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.968
We now have approvals, we talked
about evals, we talked about rag,

2
00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:08.324
these are all things that I think you need
in a production ready system that move

3
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:09.720
beyond just prototype.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.553
In fact, if all you ever did was evals and
nothing else,

5
00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.070
you would be doing better than 99%
of the stuff that's out there.

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.696
In my opinion, I cannot tell you how
many products are in production,

7
00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:22.904
paid products that when you use them,
they do not work [LAUGH].

8
00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:28.063
And these are paid products,
because that's just the state of things,

9
00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:31.863
everything worked well on my machine
until I pushed it up to AWS, and

10
00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:33.974
now it doesn't work well.

11
00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:38.669
That's just how it is, so just knowing how
to eval, you're already ahead of the game,

12
00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:40.710
in my opinion, I learned evals late.

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.380
Okay, let's talk about memory management,
so we have a problem with our messages.

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.930
They're going to become too big and we
won't be able to talk to our chat anymore.

15
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.510
Let's see if I can simulate that,
I was gonna write a script to do it, but

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.328
then I just fell off [LAUGH] so we'll just
copy and paste until that happens, so

17
00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:05.790
what do I mean by that?

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.649
Let me find a repeatable section here

19
00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.830
that I can copy and paste over and over.

20
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.486
I'll make one, so

21
00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:23.964
let's say I do something like npm start

22
00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:29.934
*hello*
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,

23
00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:35.435
that's a good repeatable section,
so then now I can go down here,

24
00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:39.381
and I can say,
I'll copy this part right here.

25
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:41.652
Actually, let me put a comma here so

26
00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:46.287
that way it'll do that too,
I'll copy this and then I'll just do this.

27
00:01:48.423 --> 00:01:49.636
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I almost had a bunch,

28
00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:53.547
this thing takes way more tokens than
I thought it was gonna take, but

29
00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:58.413
eventually you will run out of memory, and
it will be like, sorry, can't help you.

30
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:03.360
Those are too many tokens, so
what do you do at that point?

31
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.708
Well, you could just reset the chat,

32
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:15.441
you could just do this,
you could just go up here,

33
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:20.610
I mean, I'll just do this, hold up.

34
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.175
You just reset the chat like this and
that will for sure work, right?

35
00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:26.236
Well, what do you lose when you do that?

36
00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:28.908
&gt;&gt; Student: Everything.

37
00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:31.189
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You lose everything,
you lose your entire conversation,

38
00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.558
imagine using iMessage or Slack and

39
00:02:32.558 --> 00:02:35.720
before you can send the next message you
got to delete all your previous messages.

40
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.993
That will suck, that's like before they
had cloud storage with your photos you

41
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.107
want to take this photo on your camera?

42
00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:45.831
[LAUGH] But upload these photos first and
pay us five bucks,

43
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.955
so that would be terrible,
we don't want that.

44
00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:54.140
The other alternative is, what people
do is, chat apps like ChatGPT or

45
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.296
Cloud will just encourage you
to start a new chat window,

46
00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.816
which is essentially starting over,
but in a new chat window.

47
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:04.477
Cloud is famous for it, they'll even warn
you when you're getting close to like,

48
00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:07.686
hey, you're getting close,
you might want to make a new chat, right?

49
00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:12.188
So that's the thing, you don't want to do
that, so, you want to implement different

50
00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:14.976
strategies, so
that's what we're gonna do today.

51
00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:20.132
The first strategy is called window
slicing, this is super basic, and

52
00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:21.935
we'll do some version of that today.

53
00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.553
It's essentially just don't
return all the messages,

54
00:03:24.553 --> 00:03:26.367
just return a subset of the messages.

55
00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:30.540
It can be by like a number of messages,
it can be by number of tokens,

56
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.167
however you want to do it.

57
00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:36.133
You just create a window of messages,
most likely the most recent ones up until

58
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:41.037
a certain point, whether it's a certain
token count or a certain message count.

59
00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:44.679
That's all you show, so
your AI has really good,

60
00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.776
short to medium term memory,
but not long term memory.

61
00:03:48.776 --> 00:03:52.432
Basically, it don't know what the hell
you said you know, 30,000 tokens ago, or

62
00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.790
something like that, or
whatever your token limit was.

63
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.835
So that's one way,
summarization based management,

64
00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:05.709
which is what we're also gonna do is,
you do maintain a window of

65
00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.130
recent messages, so in this case,
very similar to this,

66
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.399
you only show the last X amount of tokens,
last X amount of messages.

67
00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:17.810
And then periodically,

68
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.804
you summarize the older messages
that you would have evicted.

69
00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:27.006
So in this case, if we're only
gonna show the last 200 messages,

70
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:31.864
we want to summarize the ones
we would have got rid of, right?

71
00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:36.185
Once you summarize that, you put that
summary into the system prompt of like,

72
00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:39.404
hey, here's the conversation so
far that has happened.

73
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:45.006
And then the AI understands that summary
plus the new messages that you sent,

74
00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:47.947
so we'll be doing something like that.

75
00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:51.181
You also have like
hierarchical summarization, so

76
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:52.697
this is like getting really into it.

77
00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:54.497
Like when you summarize it,

78
00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:59.627
you're like here's the immediate
thing that we just talked about.

79
00:04:59.627 --> 00:05:03.008
Here's something that we talked about
recently, and here's this like forever.

80
00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:05.838
You just need to know this about this,
this person or this conversation.

81
00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:12.068
This is like a fact about them, it's their
shoe size, it's like their favorite color.

82
00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:16.524
Whatever it is, you just need to
know this, this is like a fact,

83
00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:21.993
you could do topic based segmentation,
so, group them by different topics.

84
00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:24.254
Here's different topics that mean you and

85
00:05:24.254 --> 00:05:27.582
this person have had a conversation
about group those things,

86
00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:32.003
and then you have advanced techniques, so
whether or not something is important.

87
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:33.770
So not only you're summarizing it,

88
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.076
you're trying to figure out if this
information is even important,

89
00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:41.013
because maybe most of the stuff that they
said is just stuff that doesn't matter.

90
00:05:41.013 --> 00:05:43.407
So really only to keep
the stuff that's important, so

91
00:05:43.407 --> 00:05:45.540
you give those things
scores of importance, and

92
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.699
you only retain the things that have like
high scores, or maybe they last longer.

93
00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.930
So when you start evicting things or
getting rid of stuff out of your summaries

94
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.339
and your messages, you only get
rid of things with low scores.

95
00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:02.046
So that could be pretty cool,
compressed contact storage.

96
00:06:03.961 --> 00:06:06.882
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
don't do this [LAUGH] why put this here?

97
00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:12.147
This one is a little more advanced,
so it's basically just

98
00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:17.099
like taking entities and
random important keywords and

99
00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.604
things that stand out, and
only keeping those things.

100
00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:24.994
It's not really that relevant,
I don't think it really helps that much.

101
00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:31.692
You can do dynamic window sizing, like
a hash table where you change the window

102
00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:37.024
size depending on some behavior,
some threshold, or something like that.

103
00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:41.578
The last thing that I didn't put here is
you would actually just use rack for this,

104
00:06:41.578 --> 00:06:44.033
we put those movies in
the vector database.

105
00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:47.783
You could just put those messages
in a vector database too,

106
00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:51.223
give it a tool to say, query chat history.

107
00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:55.400
And then if someone asked the agent
something about something they said weeks

108
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.253
ago, they could go query that
vector database and be like, yeah,

109
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:03.583
I found our conversation that we had
a week ago about this, here you go, right?

110
00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:08.032
You can find that, so you can do that as
well, and as you can see, a combination of

111
00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:13.227
all these things, plus things I didn't
even mention because I'm not aware of.

112
00:07:13.227 --> 00:07:20.427
There's really no good answer for this,
what I do in production is three things.

113
00:07:20.427 --> 00:07:25.072
I limit you with a window,
I record facts about you so

114
00:07:25.072 --> 00:07:30.033
if you have a fact that you
mentioned like I prefer this or

115
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.747
I like this or this is something about me.

116
00:07:33.747 --> 00:07:37.099
I have a tool that understands
that you're giving it a fact, and

117
00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:41.462
it saves that fact in the database, and
then I also summarize the conversation so.

118
00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:45.136
Summarizing the conversation,
putting that in there, putting the facts

119
00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:49.746
in the system prompt and then only showing
you a window typically is good enough.

120
00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:52.535
Now, what the AI sees and what the user
sees are two different things,

121
00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.704
the user can scroll up indefinitely and
see every message from the dawn of time,

122
00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:57.429
but the AI is only going
to see this window.
