1
00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:03.381
We need to set up an account here
on Upstash for our vector database.

2
00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:06.951
It's free, does not require a credit card,
you just set it up.

3
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:09.413
So I'm gonna walk you
through how to do that.

4
00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:12.352
I have all the notes in here, but
I'm just gonna do it on my screen, so

5
00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:13.537
you can just follow along.

6
00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:18.346
Basically, what you wanna do is
you wanna go to upstash.com.

7
00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:21.482
Upstash is great in my opinion.

8
00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:25.328
I will talk about this product, cuz I
think it's great, I use it for everything.

9
00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:28.511
It's a great product,
[LAUGH] I recommend checking it out.

10
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:30.391
But we're gonna use it for
vector databases.

11
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:34.703
So once you make an account, log in.

12
00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:39.847
Does not require credit cards,
it's a simple GitHub or Google login.

13
00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:42.036
Can't remember if they have you make
a team or something like that, but

14
00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:42.882
whatever they have you do.

15
00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:44.735
I think they give you a personal one.

16
00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:47.737
Regardless, when you get to this screen,
click on Vector.

17
00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:52.984
Once you click on vector,
you can click Create Index.

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.666
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Inside of Create Index, you
can just give it whatever name you want.

19
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.203
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Whatever.

20
00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:06.950
Pick whatever region is closest to you,
doesn't matter.

21
00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.899
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: For the embedding model,
this is important.

22
00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:12.884
Do not put Custom.

23
00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:17.631
If you put Custom,
you will not be able to follow along.

24
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:24.514
Custom means, hey, so
Upstash Vector does the embedding for us.

25
00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:29.142
We just sit at our text, it will convert
it to a vector and put it in a database,

26
00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:30.579
if we pick one of these.

27
00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.728
If we pick Custom, it's assuming we're
gonna convert it on our side and

28
00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:36.371
just give them the vectors.

29
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.682
We're not doing that today.

30
00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:42.074
We can, OpenAI actually does have
a really good embedding model, so

31
00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:44.434
we could just do it, but we're not.

32
00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:47.793
It's so much easier just to send
Upstash text than it is vectors.

33
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.075
So we're just gonna pick the big one here,
the mixedbread.

34
00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:54.583
This one has a dimension of 1,024,
it's pretty big.

35
00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:58.084
I think OpenAI's big one is 1,536,
so even bigger.

36
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:07.257
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So that means one embedding
is gonna be 1224 numbers or vectors.

37
00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:08.268
That's one embedding.

38
00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:11.978
Every time you make one embedding,
there's 1024 decimals in there.

39
00:02:11.978 --> 00:02:14.828
That's just one embedding.

40
00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:19.799
And you might have one movie,
maybe not in our example, but

41
00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.387
if you did multiple,
each chunk is 1024 numbers.

42
00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:27.912
So if you have hundreds and thousands
of chunks, multiply that by 1024,

43
00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:29.660
that's that's how much is in there.

44
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.574
So it can get pretty deep.

45
00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:33.410
Metric, we'll just pick COSINE.

46
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.047
These are the different searching
algorithms that I was telling you about.

47
00:02:39.047 --> 00:02:43.725
How do they determine the distance
between two vectors, or many vectors,

48
00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:45.515
to see how similar they are?

49
00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:47.673
They have COSINE,
EUCLIDEAN, and DOT_PRODUCT.

50
00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:49.037
We're just gonna pick COSINE.

51
00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:51.396
I don't know the difference between
the three, I'm gonna be honest.

52
00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:52.623
If you know, let me know.

53
00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:54.499
I always just go with COSINE.

54
00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.787
And then you can click Next, and then
you can just click Free, free forever,

55
00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:00.789
you get 10,000 updates,
10,000 queries a day for free.

56
00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:04.390
That's more than enough for
what we need to do today.

57
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.481
And then you can click Create.

58
00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.674
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Aand you can make as many
of these as you want, as far as I know.

59
00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:15.991
Once you have that you
wanna click on env and

60
00:03:15.991 --> 00:03:21.535
click this copy button right here,
which will copy these two env vars.

61
00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.710
Put them in your .env file.

62
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.920
Put these two env vars in your .env file,
and you are set up.

63
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.476
That's it.

64
00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.980
All the NPM modules are already installed,

65
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.557
you just need to add
these to your .env file.

66
00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:44.022
Cool, and just to show you the example
of what RAG looks like, let me see here.

67
00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:46.232
I already have an index.

68
00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:50.115
I'm gonna go back to my other index
that I have with my movies in it, here.

69
00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:51.868
I have 1000 movies in here.

70
00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:54.876
I'm gonna click on Data Browser.

71
00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:56.445
And just to show you how
the vector database works, right?

72
00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:00.786
So let me say, movies about space,

73
00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:04.991
and, yeah, movies about space.

74
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:07.792
Let's just query that,
let's see what happens.

75
00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:11.327
Cool, the first thing that it
came back with a score of 0.85,

76
00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:15.505
which is really high, I would say
anything over 7 something is pretty high,

77
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:19.128
is gravity, which makes sense,
cuz that's a movie about space.

78
00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:22.233
So it found it, and then Interstellar,
and then WALL-E, and

79
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.936
then Independence Day, and
then Jupiter Ascending.

80
00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:27.957
So it can get pretty good, right?

81
00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:30.636
And so it's taking this,
it's turning it to a vector, and

82
00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.165
this is the other pieces of
vector that it's creating.

83
00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:36.465
You can see the vector
representation of that right here.

84
00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:40.322
I'm gonna copy this just so
you can see what this looks like.

85
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:40.920
Let's go down here.

86
00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:48.688
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's just one of those.

87
00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:54.766
So that's the array of 1000 numbers
that I was talking about, right?

88
00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:58.861
So that's where the math is coming from.

89
00:04:58.861 --> 00:04:59.508
So it's pretty good.

90
00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.370
So this is like a little playground.

91
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.271
They actually have a RAG Chat where
you can go here, add your OpenAI key.

92
00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.209
And it's a chat app where you
can chat with your data, right?

93
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:09.536
So it's pretty cool.

94
00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:12.015
But I don't feel like adding my API key,
so I'm not doing that.
