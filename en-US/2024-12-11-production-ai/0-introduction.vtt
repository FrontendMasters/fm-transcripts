00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
welcome everybody to agents in production.

2
00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.950
I am your instructor,
Scott moss, and in this course,

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.881
we're gonna be teaching you how
to take a prototype agent that

4
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.920
you built with an LLM all
the way to production.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.001
So very excited about this course.

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:20.276
This is what's been on top of mind for
myself for the last year plus,

7
00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:25.152
every morning I wake up, I've learned
some new way of incorporating an LLM in

8
00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:27.415
production, and it blows my mind.

9
00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:29.717
So I'm gonna be sharing some of
those things with you today.

10
00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.449
First, let's just kinda hop into
what you're gonna need, and

11
00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.435
then I'll talk about
some of the other stuff.

12
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:39.512
So obviously you're gonna need get
Node js latest version, 20 works.

13
00:00:39.512 --> 00:00:42.990
That's why I tested on,
I'm not sure if anything 18 might work.

14
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.073
I haven't tested it, but
20 for sure definitely works.

15
00:00:45.073 --> 00:00:46.545
You can use bond if you want.

16
00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.186
That also works great.

17
00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:53.531
You're gonna need to open AI account and
note that GPUs aren't free.

18
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:57.522
So you're gonna have to add a credit card
to that account and you're gonna have to

19
00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:01.395
add five bucks as a minimum to use the
account, although you probably won't be

20
00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:05.650
going through those, yeah, you probably
won't be going through those $5 today.

21
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.503
It depends on how many times you run these
commands, you should probably be fine.

22
00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.575
But, yeah, that should be more
than enough for this course.

23
00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:16.669
And then there's gonna be another account
that we're gonna set up together.

24
00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:18.631
It's from a product called upstash.

25
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:20.134
You do not need a credit card for that.

26
00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:23.186
But I'll walk through setting that up,
and we'll talk about it later.

27
00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.517
So if you're taking this course and
you're like, what's an agent,

28
00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:27.706
never used LLMs before?

29
00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:29.675
Kind of heard about them, no worries.

30
00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:34.064
I have another course for you, and that's
gonna be building agents from scratch.

31
00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:35.434
So you can check out that course.

32
00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:38.060
And in fact, this course builds
on top of that curriculum.

33
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.430
So if you just took that course,
you're in great hands.

34
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.591
If you haven't learned anything about
agents, please take that course first,

35
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:45.762
you're gonna learn so much.

36
00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.692
And again,
the materials is building off on that.

37
00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:49.684
So check out that course.

38
00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:50.965
First thing is the repo.

39
00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.447
You can go here and
check out the repo on my GitHub.

40
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.225
Should say agents in production.

41
00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:00.831
The notes are in the read me and
all the others materials that you need so

42
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:04.194
you could check that out, and
then prerequisites as far as like,

43
00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:08.047
what you need to know, again, agents,
if you wanna know more about that,

44
00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:10.158
take the other course I just mentioned.

45
00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:12.031
Obviously you need to know JavaScript.

46
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.098
So, if you don't know JavaScript, this
might be a little hard, but you definitely

47
00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:19.477
don't have to be like an expert at
JavaScript to take advantage of this

48
00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:23.753
course when not doing anything, this isn't
like going into detail about JavaScript.

49
00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:26.071
So if you just have used JavaScript or
any language,

50
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.134
any high level language similar to that,
you'll probably be fine.

51
00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:30.787
Although I will be using TypeScript.

52
00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:32.628
So if you've never used TypeScript,
no worries.

53
00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:33.570
Types are optional.

54
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.671
You don't have to do any of that stuff
just as long as you know JavaScript.

55
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:39.289
APIs, if you know how to consume APIs and

56
00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.144
use APIs are pretty much
gonna be good here.

57
00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.949
We're not gonna be building APIs, so
no worries if you haven't built any.

58
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:45.706
That's totally fine.

59
00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:47.488
It's mostly just consuming.

60
00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:48.803
And then again, LLMs.

61
00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:51.770
So hopefully you have some basic
understanding of how to use LLMs.

62
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.803
Having built an agent or something
similar with an LLM will be helpful.

63
00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:59.583
If you have no idea what an agent is or
an LLM is, please, again,

64
00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:04.135
check out the course building agents
from scratch that I taught here as well.

65
00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:05.914
But other than that, you should be good.

66
00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:10.385
As far as the format, like always,
I'll introduce some concepts, or

67
00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:14.035
mini concepts, and
a lecture format, all the notes, and

68
00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.887
all the details will be
here in that section.

69
00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:20.684
I'll kinda just give you my TLDR of it
because I don't like reading bullet

70
00:03:20.684 --> 00:03:23.454
points, I kind of like to
tell you how I feel about it.

71
00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:27.916
And then from there, you guys can follow
along as I implement the things that I

72
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:31.430
just taught you into the application
that we're building.

73
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.334
And then as far as like,
how you might follow along,

74
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.043
you can literally follow
along as I'm doing it.

75
00:03:37.043 --> 00:03:40.241
You can copy and paste the code
that's gonna be here in the notes.

76
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.359
So every step that we do,
the code is gonna be in here.

77
00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.580
And then the last thing is,
once I'm done doing the live coding,

78
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.329
I'll commit that to push up to a branch
where you can just check out if you just

79
00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.640
wanna get caught up on
exactly what I just did.

80
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.191
So three ways to follow along.

81
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:57.152
You can kinda pick your own speed there.

82
00:03:57.152 --> 00:03:58.362
So what are we gonna be building?

83
00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.456
I'm gonna go to my terminal.

84
00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:04.405
So again,
it's heavily based on the other course,

85
00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:09.251
but it's an agent that has access
to Reddit, random dad jokes,

86
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.755
and what else was, yeah,
to be able to generate images.

87
00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:19.260
So those three combinations, you can
imagine the results were kinda kooky.

88
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.494
So we're building off on that agent,
adding some more functionality,

89
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:25.100
but more importantly,
getting it ready for production.

90
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.365
So here's the final product of that.

91
00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:31.118
So I'm just gonnago into some of
the things that we're gonna be covering in

92
00:04:31.118 --> 00:04:31.842
this course.

93
00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:35.147
If you wanna know more about like how
that agent works and how it was built,

94
00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:36.547
it's in the previous course.

95
00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.509
So one of the things that we're gonna
be doing is something called evals.

96
00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.595
So an eval, we'll dive into it,
but essentially I'm able to,

97
00:04:45.595 --> 00:04:50.344
let me see, run,
I could do something like this.

98
00:04:50.344 --> 00:04:54.084
And what this is gonna do is, basically,
you could think of as like a test.

99
00:04:54.084 --> 00:04:59.026
It's gonna test whether or not the LLM
was supposed to do it was supposed to do.

100
00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:03.462
Do so without diving too much into it,
because we're gonna do it,

101
00:05:03.462 --> 00:05:08.455
this eval just checks to make sure that
the agent picked the right tool given

102
00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:10.133
a certain user message.

103
00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:13.580
So in this example I'm saying,
tell me something cool from Reddit.

104
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.004
So I'm writing it in eval to check
to see if the agent decided to

105
00:05:18.004 --> 00:05:21.165
pick the reddit tool
versus any other tool.

106
00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:23.144
So I wanna be able to check that.

107
00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:24.355
So we're gonna be doing evals.

108
00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:26.582
We're gonna be writing evals for
all different types of stuff.

109
00:05:26.582 --> 00:05:28.419
This is literally
someone's job to do this.

110
00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.980
So we'll be doing that.

111
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.480
At the same time,
you'll be able to view those evals.

112
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.936
I built a whole react app where you
can view those evals on a graph and

113
00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.666
you can see kinda how they differ,
stuff like that.

114
00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:40.886
So we'll be taking a look at that.

115
00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:42.596
I'll show you that when we get to evals,.

116
00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:43.980
So, that's one thing.

117
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.618
The other thing that we're gonna be adding
is rag, so retrieval augmented generation.

118
00:05:48.618 --> 00:05:53.700
We'll talk more about that, but
basically we're gonna teach our AI, we're

119
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.936
gonna give it access to index of data that
it has not been trained on previously and

120
00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:03.492
then we're gonna teach it how to
query that data to answer questions.

121
00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:08.290
So we're gonna be indexing this
agent on a movie data set from IMDB,

122
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.599
so we can ask it questions about
movies and things like that.

123
00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:20.622
So if I say,
find me a scary movie about ghosts.

124
00:06:20.622 --> 00:06:26.059
If this doesn't break, it will think,
it will do a movie search,

125
00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:30.135
and then it will try to
synthesize all that data and

126
00:06:30.135 --> 00:06:33.553
give me a list of movies, I'm guessing.

127
00:06:33.553 --> 00:06:34.127
There we go.

128
00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:36.101
So you can see it spit
out a list of movies.

129
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:38.033
So we'll be building that as well.

130
00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:40.254
That's something that we'll be doing.

131
00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:42.787
And then one of the other things
that we'll be doing that I can show,

132
00:06:42.787 --> 00:06:44.519
because a lot of the other
stuff we're doing,

133
00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:47.675
like you can't actually see because it's
like framework stuff in the background,

134
00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.184
is we're gonna be implementing
something called human in a loop.

135
00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:55.697
So human in a loop is, when I say that
in AI, that means so many things.

136
00:06:55.697 --> 00:06:59.464
But in this example,
it means like an approval.

137
00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:04.575
So before the AI can do some action,
it must seek my approval first,

138
00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:09.522
and I have to say yes, or
some form of yes, before it can proceed.

139
00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:10.528
So we wanna implement that.

140
00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:15.216
So usually you do that on like some
type of destructive, mutative operation.

141
00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:17.335
In our example,
our AI can generate images.

142
00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:19.277
So before I have it generate images,

143
00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:22.422
I am laughing because I'm
thinking about the last course.

144
00:07:22.422 --> 00:07:25.131
I wanna get an approval first.

145
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:29.033
So I'll ask the agent,

146
00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:35.288
generates me an image of a fluffy cat.

147
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:39.489
So I can say that and then it will think.

148
00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:43.911
And be like, wait before I do this,
I need your approval, yes or no.

149
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.680
So I can respond back, yes or no.

150
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.025
So I'll say yes in this example.

151
00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:54.028
And then, cool, it'll go generate
an image of a fluffy cat.

152
00:07:54.028 --> 00:08:00.160
And then hopefully, this is a fluffy
cat [LAUGH] DALLE 3 is wild.

153
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.289
It's unhinged.

154
00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:06.562
But, if you get a good prompt,
it's actually really good.

155
00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:09.817
So, let's see what image
this thing generates here.

156
00:08:09.817 --> 00:08:10.669
There we go.

157
00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:14.829
It says, there we go, okay, fluffy cat.

158
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:15.593
It's pretty good.

159
00:08:15.593 --> 00:08:22.568
So, if we run that back and I say,
generate me an image of a fluffy dog,

160
00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:29.457
but because I'm a cat person,
I'm gonna say, no, don't do that.

161
00:08:29.457 --> 00:08:30.742
I only want cats.

162
00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:33.214
And then it should not do that.

163
00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:35.223
It'll process my approval.

164
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:38.960
And then it should say, yeah,
sorry, couldn't do that.

165
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.248
Let me know if you wanna
do it again next time.

166
00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:45.338
So we're gonna build a flow like that,
which I think is incredibly powerful.

167
00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:48.755
If your agents, I don't know, trading
money out of someone's bank account,

168
00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:51.820
you probably wanna get their approval
first, or something like that.

169
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.681
So we'll be doing things like that.
