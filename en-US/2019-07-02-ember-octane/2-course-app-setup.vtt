00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; Mike: Let's open up our editors,
download the workshop project and

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.880
get started.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.920
So you'll need to make sure that
you run npm install -g ember-cli.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.760
If you know you already have ember-cli
installed, any version will do.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.695
Then clone the workshop project,
go into that folder,

6
00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:24.030
install the dependencies and
then run Ember serve.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.200
I recommend you use Visual Studio code for
this workshop.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.750
And that'll just help you see all
the nice developer experience

9
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.480
that you'll see me go through.

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.780
When you open the folder, make sure you
click the Open Workspace button and

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.380
you may see a dialog saying Mike has

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.760
recommended you install some extensions,
so make sure you click Install All.

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.410
Now that we've cloned the project and
installed its dependencies,

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.570
all we need to do is run Ember serve and

15
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.440
Ember CLI is building our source code into
something that can run in the browser.

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.630
In addition you can see
JSON server is running so

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.430
that's our little development back end.

18
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.760
You may notice in the root of your
project you have a db.json file,

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.330
that's effectively our database,
it's just a JSON file.

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.710
So as we work with this API you'll
be able to see things change there.

21
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.500
We're not dealing with data yet but

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.480
I'm just trying to give you a high-level
roadmap of how this project works.

23
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.770
One of the things that
we see in our console is

24
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.460
we're serving on local host 40 200 and
I've got that URL open on the right.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.319
And make sure my path is correct.

26
00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:43.980
&gt;&gt; Mike: There we go, so we see,
congratulations, you made it.

27
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.570
So this is Ember telling us that we
have successfully started the app up.

28
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.900
Now, we should look at
where this is coming from.

29
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.854
And you're gonna wanna go to

30
00:01:57.854 --> 00:02:03.467
app/templates/application.hps.

31
00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:07.511
That this is the top level
Handlebars template and

32
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:11.370
Handlebars is the markup
language that we use.

33
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.960
It's sort of a superset of HTML.

34
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.210
But this file that we're looking at now,
application HPS, that is responsible for

35
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.670
what you're seeing on
the screen to the right.

36
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.530
So we can see that if we were
to delete some comments, and

37
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.520
this thing welcome page, and save,
everything on the right disappears.

38
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.960
And if we were to add something new,
&gt;&gt; Mike: It would appear on the right.

39
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.890
So this provides us a really nice quick
iteration cycle where we can make some

40
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.150
changes, save, and then see on the right
side everything is keeping up to date.

41
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.170
So let's do something with this.

42
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.190
In the root of your project, you will
find a folder called starter files.

43
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.230
And in there, there's a starter.html.

44
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.770
And this here, this is the raw HTML.

45
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.130
Maybe your designer gave you this as
sorta a breakdown of the way the site

46
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.600
is supposed to look for this project,
but this is gonna be our starting point.

47
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.940
Start with some raw HTML and CSS, and
we're gonna evolve the app from there.

48
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.730
So I'm gonna copy this to my
clipboard from starter.html.

49
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.340
Go back to application HBS which
is in the templates folder.

50
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.480
App slash templates application HBS.

51
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.390
And I'm just gonna paste this and
hit Save.

52
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.439
Now on the right we see some stuff but
it doesn't quite look like Slack yet.

53
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.070
The reason is we're missing our CSS.

54
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.020
So we can go back to the starter
files folder and grab our CSS.

55
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.680
We are going to be using Tailwind
which is a CSS framework.

56
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.920
It is what allows us to express our styles
mostly in terms of classes in our html.

57
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.100
Sorta composed together via classes
instead of us writing a lot of CSS.

58
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.860
You won't need to worry about this for
the workshop.

59
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.330
I just want you to know
what you're looking at.

60
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.300
But hopefully, it means that this
part of an app is out of mind.

61
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.270
So we're gonna take starter,
CSS's content, and

62
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.720
we're gonna go to app &gt; styles &gt; app.css,
and paste it in there, and hit Save.

63
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.871
And on the right, we should see something
that looks like Slack, there it is.

64
00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.163
&gt;&gt; Mike: So congratulations,

65
00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:44.691
we have something that looks like what
our finished product will resemble.

66
00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:47.391
I'm gonna make a commit and
then we will continue on.
