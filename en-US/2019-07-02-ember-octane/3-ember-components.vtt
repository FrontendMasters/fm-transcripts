00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.790
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The next thing we're
gonna do is go to application HPS.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.330
And start slicing this
HTML up into components.

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.080
We want this to be a little
bit more manageable and

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.490
a little bit more semantic in that we
want to look at application HPS and

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.630
see higher level things, then label and
input and button and so on.

6
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.940
We don't want 211 lines of HTML and I'll
point out, this isn't quite diff soup.

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.470
This isn't like, this is pretty semantic,

8
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.680
actually had an accessibility expert
review this to make sure that this is

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.840
the kind of thing we should be writing for
an app like this.

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.220
So I've left us some comments
to give us clues around

11
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.890
what would be a good thing to
break out into a component.

12
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.952
So let's start at the top and
kind of work our way down.

13
00:00:56.064 --> 00:01:01.732
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And I'm gonna get rid of
this for now, because we don't need it,

14
00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:05.457
unfortunately, that killed our server.

15
00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:07.060
Just switch it.

16
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.970
So at the top,
we've got something called team selector.

17
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.900
And this is the entire nav up at the top.

18
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.260
This will become the team
selector component.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.104
So what I want us to do is to go into app,
templates,

20
00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:25.052
create a new folder called components and

21
00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:31.618
then create a file within that
folder called team-selector.hps.

22
00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:39.221
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What we're gonna
do is go back to application HPS,

23
00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:44.208
grab this nav here remember,
I've collapsed this thing and

24
00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:50.840
we're gonna cut it and move it over and
paste, and I'm gonna save both files.

25
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.240
And we see that sidebar that used to
be there on the left side of our app,

26
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.780
that has now disappeared.

27
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.690
The HTML is no longer there.

28
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.988
What we can kind of bring it back
by referring to this component.

29
00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:05.502
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We have TeamSelector, and

30
00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:10.753
if you have the VS code extensions
installed that come with this workspace,

31
00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:14.050
you'll see that autocomplete
that I just saw.

32
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.180
And now we have it back.

33
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.930
So this is one of the things
that Ember Octane gives us,

34
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.680
templates that are expressed
in terms of outer HTML.

35
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.920
The older Ember components didn't quite
behave this way, they needed sort of

36
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.970
a wrapping element, and we would have
had to jump through a few more hoops.

37
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.610
But now, we can just move things into
HPS files to break all of this up.

38
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.300
So let's do this with a team sidebar.

39
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.030
We're gonna grab that HTML, save.

40
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.920
The sidebar with the list of
channels has disappeared.

41
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.061
And in our app templates
components folder,

42
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:54.067
we're gonna create team-sidebar.hps,

43
00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:59.484
paste, and
then go back to application.hps.

44
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.908
And replace it with this new
component that we've just built.

45
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.598
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Teamsidebar and
the channel should come back.

46
00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:16.788
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm gonna do
the same thing with the header,

47
00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:20.240
grab the HTML, save the file.

48
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.340
The header has disappeared.

49
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.450
Right, that was this top bit
over here with this general,

50
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.786
the title and description of the channel.

51
00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:33.375
So we're gonna grab that and
we're gonna call this file channel header.

52
00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:38.900
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Replace

53
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.640
it with it's component [SOUND] and
it comes back.

54
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.950
Messages are a little bit different now.

55
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.570
So we've got two unique
messages in our sample HTML.

56
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.250
We're gonna have to pick one and
kinda throw the other away.

57
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.620
Once we start evolving
this a little bit more,

58
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.080
we'll get many different chat
messages popping up again.

59
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.979
But for now,
I'm just gonna pick the first one.

60
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.145
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And I'm gonna create
a component called message.hps.

61
00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:22.586
This is proof that there are no
restrictions on reasonable names for

62
00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:24.240
components.

63
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.801
We don't need a dash in a components name,
for example.

64
00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:33.577
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Message [SOUND].

65
00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:36.320
And finally,
our last component is the footer.

66
00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:44.792
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Channel-footer.hps, paste.

67
00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:49.826
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And [SOUND] there we go and

68
00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:56.124
this is the footer down here.

69
00:04:56.124 --> 00:04:59.520
It's the little area where we
type into new chat message.

70
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.020
Congratulations, we have
just componetized our HTML.

71
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.070
And you can see that, just refinements,
add a couple of messages.

72
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.120
But you can see that this
is much more semantic HTML.

73
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.210
We can look at this and see,
there's a selector to pick a theme.

74
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.740
There's a side bar,
there are three messages and

75
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.740
there's a channel header and the footer.

76
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.990
This was not evident from looking
at the raw HTML that we were given.

77
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.240
Maybe if you add, like lots of comments,

78
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.625
lots of metadata there,
you know developers.

79
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:32.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH].
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Leaving you hints

80
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.050
about what was going on.

81
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.220
Yes, you could have seen that.

82
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.630
But in this case,
just from the markup itself,

83
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.890
everything looks looks pretty reasonable.

84
00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:48.570
I'm gonna make another commit, and
we have just completed step two.

85
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What does HPS mean?

86
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.990
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The question
is what does HPS mean?

87
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.280
And that indicates that
these are handlebars files.

88
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.530
This is the template
language that amber uses.

89
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.300
So this kind of looks like
regular HTML for now.

90
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.790
But we'll start to introduce things
that are obviously not treated as HTML.

91
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:18.040
And that's where we see that handlebars
is a superset of a text file, right?

92
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.820
In this case, a Superset Of HTML.
