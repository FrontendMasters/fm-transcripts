00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.845
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So for now this seems like
it should do, so I'm gonna to save that,

2
00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:06.340
and I'm gonna click this sign-in button.

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.308
Let me go to my console here,
click, all right,

4
00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:16.735
I'm in my debugger, so
there's my DOM event.

5
00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:21.522
And if I look at the target,
it is a form element, so looking good so

6
00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.952
far, so
I could console.log something here.

7
00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:33.100
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's actually do something
with this, let's say I want the target.

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.687
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
because I use JSDoc comments,

9
00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:44.733
you can see that VS code knows
that this is an HTMLFormElement.

10
00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:52.857
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So that's the form element,
and I want to querySelector to get

11
00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:57.473
the select, so that should be
the currently selected user.

12
00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:06.727
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
we'll try to console.log that out, and

13
00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:09.220
let's get rid of the debugger for now.

14
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.090
Console, clear it, Sample McData, sign in,

15
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.480
all right, let me change the setting here.

16
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.927
I want to preserve the log, reload,

17
00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:29.820
clear it out, Sample McData, sign in.

18
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.520
Okay, so here's what's happening,
UserId is 2, so my console log succeeds.

19
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.232
Then I see this thing I'm used to
seeing when my Ember app boots up.

20
00:01:41.232 --> 00:01:43.106
Anyone have an idea what's going on here?

21
00:01:46.704 --> 00:01:50.536
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Can somebody tell me
the default behavior when I submit a form?

22
00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:52.078
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bubbled.

23
00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.945
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Postback?

24
00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:55.048
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry, what?

25
00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The postback?

26
00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:59.839
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I mean,
it makes a get request.

27
00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:00.971
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Refresh the page?

28
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:04.955
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah,
it results in the page reloading, in fact,

29
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:07.001
I see Navigated to login?

30
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.639
So it's similar to clicking on an a tag,

31
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.790
a vanilla HTML link,
it's causing a page load.

32
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.430
That's the default behavior of a form
submit event, we need to prevent this.

33
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.913
And the way to do this, this is just
the way the DOM API works, preventDefault.

34
00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:32.847
We're saying, look,
we're handing this submit event,

35
00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:36.206
don't handle this the way vanilla
HTML submit events are handled.

36
00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:40.316
So if we reload this,
clear the console, sign in,

37
00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:44.616
change the user, sign in,
change it back, sign in,

38
00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:49.036
we can see that we're getting
stuff logged out, yes?

39
00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:56.431
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So native DOM events versus
the action helper fire at different times?

40
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:00.052
Action helper fires after all the native
DOM, like onClick-type stuff, Next up,

41
00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:00.975
where does this sit?

42
00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:05.162
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep, this is
equivalent to addEventListener, and

43
00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:08.120
there are some subtle differences.

44
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.080
I don't wanna get too deep
into the weeds there,

45
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.330
because it's DOM API errata,
but it is equivalent.

46
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.090
The mechanism by which it
operates is addEventListener,

47
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.930
it's different than onClick equals action,
which you're used to in classic Ember.

48
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.275
You will not see the action helper or
modifier used

49
00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:35.357
anywhere in this app,
we're just using the on modifier.

50
00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:40.445
This is the path forward that
will give us some benefits,

51
00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:45.544
particularly around things
like rehydration, right?

52
00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:52.832
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There are benefits, I'm not
ready to get into it yet, I will look for

53
00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.775
an opportunity later on, yes?

54
00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:58.423
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Say, Mike, do you think it
could be a problem if you have to remember

55
00:03:58.423 --> 00:04:02.334
to put that preventDefault in every
form-related component you make?

56
00:04:02.334 --> 00:04:04.553
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You'd be putting that at the

57
00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:09.705
top level in some kind of initializer or
something to say, at the body tag, just,

58
00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:15.325
by default, don't refresh the page when a
form's submitted, or is that bad practice?

59
00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:19.390
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It is possible to do that,
I would say that it is a bad practice.

60
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.880
Anytime you do something like that that
has massive ramifications throughout your

61
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.581
app, you're setting yourself up for
potential unexpected behavior later on.

62
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:35.435
There are community
libraries that will give

63
00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:40.542
you helpers that you can
use in this space here,

64
00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:45.649
which would let you kind
of call this function,

65
00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:51.537
call onLoginFormSubmit,
but also preventDefault.

66
00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:54.005
So you'd kind of wrap that functions, so

67
00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:58.886
you'd see right in your template that in
this specific case, this is prevented.

68
00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:03.798
I will give you that it might make sense,
I can't really come up with

69
00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:08.980
a case where preventing default
would be a bad thing for a form tag.

70
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.870
But in other places,

71
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.470
it might totally be a bad thing,
maybe file uploads or something.

72
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.920
There's certain times when maybe you do
need to do a true multipart form submit.

73
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.790
But I definitely err on the side of

74
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.250
doing these modifications
at specific call sites.

75
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.340
I want as little global
customization as possible cuz

76
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.020
then whoever contributes to your app,

77
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.820
they have to familiarized themselves with
all of the little tweaks and adjustments.

78
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.980
You sort of altered your world
from what people expect it to be.
