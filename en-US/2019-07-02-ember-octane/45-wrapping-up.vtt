&gt;&gt; Mike North: I hope
this was a fun workshop.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.490
I had a lot of fun, and
I am impressed that

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.240
we were able to build up this nice Slack
app, starting from pure HTML and CSS,

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.990
all the way up to making API calls,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
and managing state, and
component architecture strategies.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.960
Writing all of our tests along the way,
I think that

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.720
this is an indication of being able
to do things faster and easier and

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.005
smarter with Amber apps 10 than has
ever been possible with Amber apps.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:39.379
