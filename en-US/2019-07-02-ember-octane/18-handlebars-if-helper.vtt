00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We last ended up creating a
piece of derived state called isDisabled.

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.980
And when no user is selected,
isDisabled is true.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.030
So we're gonna do a couple
things with that.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.760
First of all, I don't think I should be
showing logging in as userId, nothing.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.330
I don't think this message should appear
at all if the form's currently disabled.

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.030
This text should only pop
up if you've picked a user.

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.210
So we're going to use the handlebars
if helper and here is the syntax.

8
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.610
So you'll notice that we have a hashtag to
open the if, and a slash to close the if.

9
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.820
And this is the typical
syntax you'll see for

10
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.050
any kind of helper that where you're
passing it a chunk of template.

11
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.960
And in this case, it's that bit there.

12
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.650
So now if we save this,
let's see if is disabled.

13
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.110
Sorry, if it's enabled,
so I could do this.

14
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.010
I had my condition reversed.

15
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.500
So let's select a user, great,
great, and back to nothing selected.

16
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.795
Looks good to me,
here’s another thing we can do.

17
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:29.240
We can go to this input and
I’m just going to create a new line here.

18
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.524
I’m going to disable the button so

19
00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:35.949
it’s not clickable in the event
that the form isDisabled is true.

20
00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:45.916
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what we should see
is this is not a clickable button if we

21
00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:46.760
inspect it.

22
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.244
There's our disabled attribute there.

23
00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.386
And if we pick a user,

24
00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:56.840
you should see on the button that little
disabled text should flash and disappear.

25
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.800
There it is, no more, and
this is now a clickable button.

26
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.690
Great, and we should show some
visual indication of this, right?

27
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.720
Grey button kind of means disabled.

28
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.230
So I'm gonna conditionally
apply some CSS here.

29
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.660
I'm gonna delete this bg grey, or
cut it rather, so that I can use it later.

30
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.754
And I'll say,
this is another use of the if helper.

31
00:02:22.754 --> 00:02:26.160
But it's sort of the inline form
where we don't have an open or close.

32
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.648
If this is disabled, apply that class,

33
00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:41.190
otherwise apply bg-teal-dark.

34
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.640
Think of this like a ternary operator,
right, like a question mark,

35
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.770
colon, we've all used this before.

36
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.790
So now let's see how this looks.

37
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.110
Pick a user,
that looks like an enabled button.

38
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.240
That looks disabled, there we go.

39
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.757
So we've created a little piece of derived
state, and we have a tracked property so

40
00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:01.961
that everything updates accordingly.

41
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.460
And we have a more interesting form here.
