00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.040
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're gonna use Ember CLI
in order to create some new routes.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.060
And I'm gonna try to automate
this as much as possible.

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.490
We're trying to lean on Embers
opinions and conventions.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.984
So that we can,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Do as little work

5
00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:18.540
as we have to.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.095
So the first thing I wanna
run is ember g route,

7
00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:29.080
and I'm gonna open up router.js, just so
we can see what's already in there.

8
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.740
Teams, so I want teams/LinkedIn.

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.940
That's how I want my URL to look like.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.200
And internally when I'm creating link two,
or I'm calling transition two.

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.540
I want the name of that
route to be teams.team.

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.320
I could also do teams.show.

13
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.580
That something that indicates
this is a single team,

14
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.970
that's what this page is all about.

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.161
So ember g route teams/ team,

16
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.707
something like that, and

17
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:09.864
we can pass an argument called path and

18
00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:15.200
this is gonna be the path within teams.

19
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.287
So I'm just going to say :teamId and
I'm going to put a colon before it.

20
00:01:20.287 --> 00:01:24.610
The colon indicates that this is
what we call a dynamic segment.

21
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.370
It's a part of the URL that it's
gonna have like an ID in it or

22
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.880
something right from our diagram earlier.

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.690
This would be like the LinkedIn or

24
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.460
the Microsoft that string, which we
will need to use to make an API call.

25
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.970
So we're gonna get the route module,
we'll get the unit tests for the route.

26
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.620
And we can see that this nesting has
already been applied automatically.

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.350
This route has been
installed in the router.

28
00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.890
We can go one level deeper, and
we can say I want teams/team/channel.

29
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.250
Right one more level of
nesting because remember,

30
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.190
it's almost like has many relationships.

31
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.190
If you've ever work with
a database before and

32
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.770
an object oriented database design

33
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.890
that has many relationships those also
kind of go down these nesting levels.

34
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.890
Our application has many teams,
a team has many channels, right?

35
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.860
Each of those also happens to have
turned into a layer of nesting.

36
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.820
Often ends up that way.

37
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.913
So we're gonna say channel ID.

38
00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:49.086
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Great and
it's kinda oddly formatted.

39
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:57.869
Let me unroll it a little,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just so

40
00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.138
we can talk about it
a little more effectively.

41
00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:06.220
All right, so,
teams is gonna be like this.

42
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.480
Teams, and then anything after that.

43
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.164
And this is gonna be, go down here,

44
00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:21.950
teams/(linkedin), and anything after that.

45
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.730
Sorry, that would be this one.

46
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.320
And then this would be
something like that.

47
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.410
So that is how the URL
nesting is applied here.

48
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.620
These are all in the context of
their parent and grandparent, etc.

49
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.700
But these are kind of URL's
that we are going to see.

50
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.090
So let's start, because we have the HBS
files for each of these routes let's start

51
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.790
to break up our team's HBS which has
a whole chat UI in it, currently.

52
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.100
So I'm gonna leave the team
selector in there, right?

53
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.900
Regardless of which team you're on

54
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.020
the selector to pick your team that should
remain there and switching between teams.

55
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.740
That's not gonna take down that sidebar.

56
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.380
So it's totally appropriate the team
selector should be in this.

57
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.380
Will make sure to put our outlet
here because that's where all

58
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.380
the rest of this content is gonna come
through by way of the child templates and

59
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.050
grab everything else and we're done.

60
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.270
So let's go to team hbs.

61
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.150
So here we're gonna wanna

62
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.320
leave just the team sidebar.

63
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.410
If you change channels,
which is what this team sidebars all about

64
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.350
it's the channel list and
then the logout button.

65
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.910
As you change channels we don't need to
tear that thing down and rerender it.

66
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.200
It's not getting swapped out for anything.

67
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.280
It's the other content.

68
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.860
It's the content to the right of
the sidebar, right, this outlet.

69
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.520
That's what's getting swapped out as we
go from channel to channel to channel.

70
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.940
So this is the appropriate template for
team.hbs.

71
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.080
And then finally,
channel hbs this is the lowest level and

72
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.090
we just have the rest here.

73
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.570
So, let's see what this looks
like as we play with it.

74
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.230
Teams, okay.

75
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.810
So we've landed on teams and
we can see that the sidebar is rendered,

76
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.380
we don't have any errors in our console,
right?

77
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.710
Everything looks okay.

78
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.770
But obviously the other
content is gone away.

79
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.430
So this is not really a valid URL for
this app anymore, right?

80
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.636
We need a team ID.

81
00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:50.790
If you wanna show a chat UI,
we need to know which team and

82
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.170
which channel and there's really
nothing interesting to render

83
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.530
in the case that we're missing that data.

84
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.710
We'll deal with this in a moment.

85
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.970
But let's manually try to
figure out this for now.

86
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.880
So I wanna go teams/li and
now we've got LinkedIn.

87
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.640
So now, our team.hbs is being rendered.

88
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.360
Okay, still we're missing that channel.

89
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.940
And so we can't render
anything on the right, right?

90
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.619
This is also not a valid URL.

91
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:25.441
&gt;&gt; Mike North: But
if we put general here, now we're back.

92
00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:27.690
Now this is the chat UI
that we've been working on.
