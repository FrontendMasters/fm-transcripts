00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.720
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
far we have been using hard-coded data,

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.808
most of that data currently lives in
the HTML that we started with, right?

3
00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:13.260
That's where all the teams and
the channels, and things are coming from.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.470
So in the next two steps, we're going
to make our way to using real data.

5
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.550
And the first step we're gonna take is
to have data live where it should live.

6
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.037
And that means putting some temporary
stuff in our routing layer.

7
00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:36.625
So that our top level templates get data
from the things that are supposed to load

8
00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.580
data, the routes.

9
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.362
And we can kind of set
everything up downstream so

10
00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.694
it works with our hard-coded data there.

11
00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:49.638
The step we're gonna take after that is
to use fetch to actually grab data using

12
00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:50.370
networking.

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.500
So, let's get started.

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.580
First, I want us to think
about how our app should be

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.969
organised in terms of the routes.

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.254
And I have a little animation
here that'll help us.

17
00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:14.720
So application.hbs is shown
on the screen no matter what.

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.380
No matter which URL we use, the stuff
in application.hbs is always there.

19
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.229
And so you can think of that as any
URL that begins with slash, right?

20
00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:30.746
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
that's a URL indicator up there.

21
00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:37.445
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This outlet thing
that we've seen in a couple places,

22
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:43.000
that's where any child routes
template might be rendered.

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.220
So in this case we have two,

24
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.636
and they both are sort of swapped out,
only one is visible at a time.

25
00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:52.220
We've got login.hbs, and

26
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.350
then if we click a link to say sign in,
we end up going to teams.hbs.

27
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.196
Now this concept of outlets keeps
working as we go deeper and deeper.

28
00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:07.815
So if we wanted to include,
we want to say that, look,

29
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:12.462
if you're in the chat UI,
this team selector's always visible, but

30
00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:17.630
when you pick a team, we might have
some specific content for that team.

31
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.541
For example, a sidebar.

32
00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:26.800
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So this is where we can
see the nesting happening here, right?

33
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.760
Teams has an outlet.

34
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.210
And then anything that's
changing within a team, right,

35
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.930
that should be in the team.hbs.

36
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.820
So you can imagine if we switch
from LinkedIn to Microsoft

37
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.465
all of this inner blue area,
that would be torn down and

38
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:46.520
you'd see a new sidebar pop up
with Microsoft channels, right?

39
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.946
Similarly, when we go
from channel to channel,

40
00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:53.384
we have some channel specific content,
right?

41
00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:56.031
And that is gonna be a channel.hbs and

42
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.597
that's what our URL would
look like at the bottom.

43
00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:03.467
And here you can imagine when
we click on one channel or

44
00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:08.541
another channel the yellow area is
gonna be torn down and then it'll be

45
00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:13.570
replaced with the new channels header and
chat messages and footer.

46
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.296
So in terms of thinking about how
we want things structured there

47
00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.989
are a couple aspects
you've got to consider.

48
00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.700
One is what do you want
your URLs to look like.

49
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.340
Another is which pieces
of content are changed

50
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.420
by various dynamic parts of the URL,
like teams/linkedin, right?

51
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.730
LinkedIn would be replaced by Microsoft,
right?

52
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.540
So that's the part of the URL that's sort
of a value that we're gonna extract and

53
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.870
we're gonna use to find the right content.

54
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.940
And this gives us a pretty clear direction
as to how we should set our routing

55
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.770
structure up, right?

56
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.140
If we change a channel, the yellow
area is torn down and re-rendered.

57
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.070
If we go from one team or
another, even the sidebar,

58
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.690
right, all that blue area's torn down and
re-rendered.

59
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.500
And if we go from the chat UI,
and we hit Logout and

60
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.360
go all the way back to the login page,
the entire red area is torn down and

61
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.990
it's replaced with this green login.hbs.

62
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.670
So this is a good guide,
in the specific case of our app,

63
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.930
how URLs and nested routes and
their templates are all connected.

64
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.290
It's about what your URLs look like,
which content depending on URL changes is

65
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.581
torn down and replaced with something
new and they're sort of interrelated.

66
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:42.562
And then there's a third aspect but
you have total control over it so

67
00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:43.984
it's not really a constraint.

68
00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:49.042
And that's how you want your files
organized, I would say, treat that as

69
00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:54.836
something that falls out as a consequence
of decisions you make to get things right,

70
00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:59.830
with respect to the nesting of templates,
and the shape your URLs take.

71
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.450
Everybody cool?

72
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.950
This takes a little while to become
intuitive, which is why this animation

73
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.140
paints a very, very clear picture for
how things should look.

74
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.620
So teams.hbs has the team selector,
team.hbs has the sidebar for a team.

75
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.330
And then a channel has all of
the chat messages in there.

76
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.263
I'm showing you this because we're
about to break our app up into more

77
00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.706
templates and to apply some nested
routing so that we get this.

78
00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:39.001
And we can start driving data from
the routing layer into the route's

79
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.160
respective top level templates.
