00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.815
&gt;&gt; Student: Do you wanna mention the pause
test helper instead of just debugger?

2
00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:09.100
Because oftentimes do you wanna interact
with the page at a state in your test?

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.230
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think it's included,
right?

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.280
Let's see.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.130
I believe it is.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.630
Let me see.

7
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.810
&gt;&gt; Student: Often-
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Why don't you tell me what

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.975
you'd like me to do?

9
00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; Student: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It's pause test, right?

10
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.440
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah, and then instead
of debugger, put a wait pause test.

11
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.280
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting.

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.000
&gt;&gt; Student: And then, and above two.

13
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.040
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Above?

14
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.362
&gt;&gt; Student: Where the other debugger is,
just take it out.

15
00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:33.849
&gt;&gt; Mike North: [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Student: And then,

16
00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:35.489
you can show the difference.

17
00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.120
Does something very similar as you know.

18
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.750
And in the console,
you'll see a little message.

19
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.206
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So yeah,
this is a relatively new thing.

20
00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:49.240
So what pause test does,
it's kind of like a debugger.

21
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.429
You can still inspect the page
with debugger, right?

22
00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.679
We were able to pluck out DOM elements.

23
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.990
But I couldn't have gone in here and
started to type stuff.

24
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.730
So this is the live app.

25
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.470
I'm able to sort of poke at it and
do whatever I need to do.

26
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.080
And to resume,
instead of hitting play in my debugger,

27
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.350
we're not really paused here,
you just run resume test.

28
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.530
And that should go to the next screen.

29
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.290
And then we resume test again.

30
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.740
So two different ways, but yeah,
thank you for pointing that out.

31
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.210
This is another valuable thing that
sort of, it'll level up from debugger.

32
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.560
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Student2: One more slight

33
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.930
addition to that is that you
don't have to import it.

34
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.769
You can just use this stop pauseTest.

35
00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.263
Because oftentimes, you don't actually
wanna use that long term use of it, so

36
00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:35.170
you can just drop into the debugger here.

37
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.200
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes,
good point there, right?

38
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.520
You don't wanna leave this
import hanging around.

39
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.243
&gt;&gt; Student: And
if you click development mode,

40
00:01:41.243 --> 00:01:43.144
I think it fixes all the weird zooming.

41
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.219
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think, when I get rid
of all my test runner UI, I would.

42
00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.380
I don't get to see my test passing or
failing.

43
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.247
To me, that's kind of a valuable thing.

44
00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:56.059
Especially when I'm writing the test.

45
00:01:56.059 --> 00:02:02.670
I want to know is it green or not.

46
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.093
But absolutely, if we were to run through
this, and leave pause test in place,

47
00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:07.320
now it's sort of two units UI's
completely hidden from you.

48
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.450
And you'll just sort of see things
like flashing on the screen as

49
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.330
the tests are run on a full size app.

50
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.054
Which, when used in
combination with pause test,

51
00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:22.489
this would be great for
maybe debugging something.

52
00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.925
But for writing it from scratch,
I kinda want to know about the status.

53
00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:27.589
It's a top level thing.

54
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:28.709
Great additions,

55
00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.430
please don't hesitate to chime in
with more if you have other insights.

56
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.200
&gt;&gt; Student3: Can you still inspect state
when using pause test similar to debugger?

57
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.445
Or it's on pause, so
you don't have the frozen state for-

58
00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:42.377
&gt;&gt; Mike North: When you talk about state,

59
00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:46.913
you mean you want to be able to see
what's in all of the closures at

60
00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.140
a particular stack frame.

61
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.490
You cannot because this
is an ember construct.

62
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.090
And just think of it
like you're waiting for

63
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.880
a promise that doesn't resolve
until you call resume test.

64
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.530
That's it.

65
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.330
So the benefit is you can
interact with your app.

66
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.390
The cost is you can't
really see a stack frame.

67
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.755
So if you were, for example, counting
invocations of something, make sure this

68
00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:17.552
action is fired once or twice, and
you're gonna assert on that later,

69
00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:19.979
debugger might be the right tool for
the job.

70
00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.050
Because you care about
this closure right here.

71
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.614
But we don't any variables
in this closure right now.

72
00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:33.180
So I wouldn't put a lot
of value on pausing.

73
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.490
Sorry, I wouldn't put a lot of
value in using debugger here.

74
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.790
Pause test is probably the right tool for
the job.

75
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.897
But if you wanted to pause
within application code, right,

76
00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:48.705
like in an action handler of some sort or
something else,

77
00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:53.629
there, I would not use pause test,
I would use debugger.

78
00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.145
Because you could tempt out a race
condition that's gonna radically alter

79
00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:00.090
the way your code is gonna work.
