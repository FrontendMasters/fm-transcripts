00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
&gt;&gt; Mike: The next thing we're gonna do is
apply a component architecture practice

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.740
called container and
presentation components.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.630
This is a very,

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.550
very popular technique to use across
all front end development these days.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.960
I believe it was sort of born
out of the React community.

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.810
In principle,
here's how you wanna think about this.

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.860
You make it so
your components are either smart and

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.980
stateful, or they have an interesting
template of some sort.

9
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.870
And you try to make components
that are either one or the other.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.937
And you try not to make something
that can tick both of those boxes.

11
00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:48.406
This means that you can test
the presentation of things, right?

12
00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:51.307
These are, for example,
our template-only components.

13
00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:54.860
We give them args, they render some HTML.

14
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.129
They are stateless.

15
00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:59.440
&gt;&gt; Mike: So those are easy to test.

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.320
You just pass them args,
see what they render.

17
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.370
Pass them args, see what they render.

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.850
A container component would be
something that has actions.

19
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.420
Something that has state, right?

20
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.931
And that is gonna be easy to test
because you can give it a for

21
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:19.094
testing use only presentation.

22
00:01:19.094 --> 00:01:23.394
They might be much easier to
make assertions against than

23
00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:26.450
the full-blown component in the wild.

24
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.450
So you can think of it as like,
you can have a big JS module, but

25
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.700
your template should be
very simple in that case.

26
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.725
Or you can have a complicated template,
but

27
00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:42.880
your JS module should be absent or
extremely simple.

28
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.650
I would say it's fair game
to have a JS module for

29
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.480
the purpose of bringing in a service,
something like that.

30
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.855
But you shouldn't be doing stateful stuff.

31
00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:56.810
You shouldn't be seeing this dot
whatever in that components template.

32
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.290
Presentation components are just
about turning data into HTML.
