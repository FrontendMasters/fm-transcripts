00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You used to need computed,

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.730
but because the user ID is tracked,
you don't need computed here.

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.140
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So if you've used Ember
before, a lot of the stuff around computed

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.880
properties and stating your dependencies
and all that, completely gone away.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.400
All you need to know, all you need to
think about is tracked has to be added

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.060
to anything that is rendered state or
observed state,

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.770
which includes, if you are using computed
properties this would also include that.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.295
But if it's used in a template, or a
computed property or an observer, the last

9
00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:37.837
two of which are sort of things I'm not
talking about today, you must track it.

10
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.340
If you're gonna change it and it's used
in those contexts, you must track it.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you have a object passed
in that has tracked properties on it,

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.490
does that state of being
tracked propagate?

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.330
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Good question.

14
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.750
So first I want to point out that
anything passed into your component

15
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.610
is already tracked.

16
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.640
So the object itself that you pass in,

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.900
let's say it's an object that has
properties first name and last name.

18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.640
The object itself is tracked like
all args passed into a component.

19
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.728
And yes, the inner properties
would be tracked as well.

20
00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:18.636
So when a property is
tracked the decorator would

21
00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:23.423
set that object up and
no matter how it’s used or

22
00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:27.852
where, it’s the object that is enabled for

23
00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:33.259
tracking with respect to
that particular property.

24
00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.330
So nothing about how it’s used or
where it’s used would affect that.

25
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.350
Any other questions?

26
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.250
&gt;&gt; Jacob: Yeah, Mike which version
of Ember can you start using

27
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.770
track properties in?

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.330
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thank you.

29
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.850
So, Jacob, the first release that
you can use Ember native classes in,

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.671
which is sort of part of this situation,
we're looking at with

31
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:59.670
polyfil that you can add,
I think we go back to Ember 3.4.

32
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.820
Tracked properties are gonna be enabled in

33
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.370
the first stable release of Ember Octane
so today we are using a canary build but

34
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.780
for watchers of this video in the future
It's my best guess at this point.

35
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.610
Man I'm setting myself up to be right or
wrong by putting a number out on

36
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.430
video 3.13, something like that.

37
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.723
So for now you have to use this canary
version because this Octane is in

38
00:02:31.723 --> 00:02:37.214
a preview state where we're gathering
feedback and enabling things.

39
00:02:37.214 --> 00:02:41.554
And teaching people how to use it and
then once it hits the stable release,

40
00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:46.104
this is one of the things that will be
first available without a feature flag or

41
00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:47.650
something at that point.

42
00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:52.710
And I should point out, the reason I've
mentioned native classes came earlier.

43
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.443
It's kinda hard to get value out
of using native classes without

44
00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.381
using tracked an action.

45
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:04.461
You can install Ember decorators,
which is a community library but

46
00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:10.432
it's maintained by the same people same
person has his name's Chris Garrett,

47
00:03:10.432 --> 00:03:15.810
who has been driving a lot of this
work in the framework itself.

48
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.640
And so that is another way to use
decorators and native classes with Ember.

49
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.080
But I would not describe
that as Ember Octane.

50
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.580
Tracked is very much
a part of Ember Octane.

51
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.730
But you can kind of get to
a pretty close middle ground state

52
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.340
with this library called Ember decorators
so that is where I would look for that.
