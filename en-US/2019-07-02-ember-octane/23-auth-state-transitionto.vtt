1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.313
&gt;&gt; Mike North: One thing I wanna point
out, and we should look at this,

2
00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:05.299
to see if we've done this right.

3
00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.237
You have two options here for
sending the user on their way to a new

4
00:00:10.237 --> 00:00:14.000
destination, transition to and
replace with.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.781
And there's a difference between the two,
but before I do that,

6
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:20.481
has anyone ever found
themselves in a web app?

7
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.420
Where you hit the back button and
it has trapped you in that experience.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.024
You hit the back button and it sends
you forward, you hit the back button,

9
00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:27.822
it sends you forward.

10
00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:33.086
So that has to do with some misuse
of the history stack, where there's

11
00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:38.811
a URL in your history, and all that URL
does is forward you to a new location.

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.377
So you go back and it forwards you,
and you go back and it forwards you.

13
00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:47.142
I think it's quite possible we've done
that, we've made that mistake here.

14
00:00:47.142 --> 00:00:55.091
Let's, sorry, teams, let's make sure
that's the case, so I can go back here,

15
00:00:55.091 --> 00:01:00.351
that's fine, let's log in
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I

16
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:05.201
should be able to hit back and
I should end up in the tests,

17
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:10.974
let me make this a lot more clear,
I wanna start out outside the app.

18
00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:18.660
Sorry Google, and now I'm gonna
enter the app and land on Teams.

19
00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.240
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I wanna make
sure I'm doing this right,

20
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.247
it takes a little bit of thinking here,
so I wanna be unauthenticated first.

21
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.016
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Cuz I wanna
simulate the case where, okay, so

22
00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.992
we're unauthenticated.

23
00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:39.421
I'm gonna attempt to visit Teams, and

24
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.184
it's gonna forward me to the login page,
everyone follow?

25
00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:47.535
What I wanna make sure of, is that
when I arrive at the login page and

26
00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:50.040
I hit back, I wanna be back at Google.

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.293
I don't wanna be trapped in that login
page, I wanna be able to leave the app,

28
00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:56.070
we don't wanna trap our users.

29
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.682
So, let's try it, Teams, so

30
00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:03.916
it's really quickly done that redirect and
the back button.

31
00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:09.066
Okay, good, this works properly,
if it didn't,

32
00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:13.757
if it hadn't,
we would wanna do replace with.

33
00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:18.521
And the difference is, transition
to at the new item in your history,

34
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:23.450
replace with replaces the most recent
item in your history with whatever

35
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.256
you're sending them to.

36
00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:30.118
So especially if you had like a multi step
forwarding process or something like that.

37
00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:34.421
You would wanna make sure that
you don't like, completely fill

38
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:39.211
the user's back button with all of
those meaningless history states.

39
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:42.251
You want it to be meaningful milestones,
and

40
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:47.451
a good rule of thumb here is if you're
building a server-rendered app like,

41
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.936
with PHP or regular HTML,
how would you like your history to look?

42
00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.314
Use that as your guide post, right?

43
00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:59.050
And the only advice I can give you,
because this is nuanced,

44
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.890
actually test the stuff out.

45
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.893
There's no rule of thumb I know of where
it's always best to use transition to in

46
00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:05.747
one situation.

47
00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:08.645
Always best replaced with another,

48
00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:12.667
test it out and
think about what your users expect.

49
00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:17.992
So we'll leave this as transition
to because it seems to work,

50
00:03:17.992 --> 00:03:20.511
and let's deal with log out.

51
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:22.741
So we'll go back to our app.

52
00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:29.400
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Log in, and
I wanna wire up this Logout button,

53
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.202
so first let's add this
method in our service.

54
00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:42.341
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Apps/services/off, and

55
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:48.772
we're going to create
a function called log out,

56
00:03:48.772 --> 00:03:53.824
and this is going to end local storage,

57
00:03:53.824 --> 00:03:57.665
clear, clear, looks like.

58
00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:03.246
Clear is clear, everything, let's do
remove item, I don't wanna overdo here.

59
00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:08.793
So we're gonna remove that
item from local storage and

60
00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:12.296
send the user to the login screen.

61
00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:18.112
Does that look reasonable to everyone,
that log out probably means this?

62
00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:19.848
We can also make this an action.

63
00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:26.804
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And for those of you
who have been using Ember for a while,

64
00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:31.448
you maybe thinking,
you don't usually put actions on services.

65
00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:36.500
Services in old ember do not support
actions, but because now action

66
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.829
comes in the form of a decorator,
we don't care who owns this function.

67
00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:45.079
It could be on a vanilla JavaScript class,

68
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:49.786
that has nothing to do with ember,
a class with no base class.

69
00:04:49.786 --> 00:04:53.576
You can put an action there,
you can put a property there.

70
00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:59.792
So you can mix and match your vanilla
JS stuff, leveraging these decorators,

71
00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:04.232
with components and services and
framework concerns.

72
00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:07.267
So to make this logout button work,

73
00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:12.839
I want this team sidebar component
to have access to the service.

74
00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:13.927
And currently,

75
00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:19.225
this is one of those components we created
at the beginning with just an hbs file.

76
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:22.644
So we're gonna need to
do one of two things.

77
00:05:22.644 --> 00:05:26.646
But ultimately, we need access to
this service in the template so

78
00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.754
that we can wire up the dom event for

79
00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:32.559
the logout button to this logout
action we've just created.

80
00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.439
One, which we're not gonna do,
but we could,

81
00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.483
is you could create a helper that
gives you access to that service.

82
00:05:39.483 --> 00:05:43.278
And this would let us keep that HPS file,
it's the only thing that's required for

83
00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:44.052
this template.

84
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:48.961
This is not a common approach that's
taken, but it's not a bed one.

85
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:51.930
We are going to just apply
the same pattern instead, but

86
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.468
injecting a service onto
a JavaScript module.

87
00:05:54.468 --> 00:05:56.875
Because we will need that
JavaScript module later.

88
00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.757
So, here we go, and
follow this instruction carefully,

89
00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:05.681
there is a question that will pop up,
do you want to write over an HBS file?

90
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:07.647
Do not write over it.

91
00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:13.565
Ember generate component, team sidebar.

92
00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:19.687
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And there's our question,
so this, whenever you're using ember

93
00:06:19.687 --> 00:06:23.368
CLI's code generation,
it's not gonna blindly write over stuff.

94
00:06:23.368 --> 00:06:25.581
In fact I could type d, and

95
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:31.431
see a diff of what it wants to put in
there versus what it would remove.

96
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.163
Obviously we would lose a lot of
content there, so I'm going to say no,

97
00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:36.733
I don't want to delete this.

98
00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:38.833
But this is a nice tool
that you see over and

99
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:41.367
over, even when you're
upgrading an ember app.

100
00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:45.923
Oftentimes you'll see this where you can
just kind of compare, I could make some

101
00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:49.747
changes and save them and the see
the diff again in this little tool.

102
00:06:49.747 --> 00:06:54.047
So, don't override the template, and

103
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:58.727
what we've got is a JavaScript module now,

104
00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:05.320
the path of it is right here,
app components team sidebar js.

105
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.810
And here we'll import inject as

106
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.802
service from ember service, and,

107
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:22.952
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There is our off and

108
00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:27.541
actually we don't even,
we may need it later.

109
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:32.615
But since we're using it into template and
there's no autocomplete for

110
00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:38.121
this in a template, I'm less excited
about putting this here, the comment.

111
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:43.341
So finally team sidebar hbs,
we're gonna go to that logout button,

112
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:47.122
which earlier in the course
we made this a LinkTo.

113
00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:51.298
Remember we just said, from now all
we care about is I click log out and

114
00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:53.389
I find myself at the login screen.

115
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:58.824
But now we need to do more,
now we wanna instead of just using LinkTo,

116
00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:02.400
we wanna use the off
services logout action.

117
00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:07.531
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So that the local storage
gets cleared along the way, right,

118
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:09.775
without that we're not really logging out.

119
00:08:09.775 --> 00:08:13.263
User will refresh and
they'll still be there, so

120
00:08:13.263 --> 00:08:17.013
let's scroll to the bottom
of team-sidebar.hbs.

121
00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:22.047
There's our LinkTo, so
we wanna keep our html the same and

122
00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:26.584
it turns out we'll need to
put this back as a button.

123
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:30.382
Cuz LinkTo is not gonna take care
of our local storage concerns.

124
00:08:30.382 --> 00:08:33.775
So, I'm just gonna delete this, and

125
00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:39.300
we're back to a button, and
we have to listen for a DOM event.

126
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.356
What do we use for this?

127
00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:42.476
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: An on-modifier.

128
00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:43.812
&gt;&gt; Mike North: On-modifier.

129
00:08:43.812 --> 00:08:45.404
Very good.

130
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:48.922
What dom event should we listen for?

131
00:08:48.922 --> 00:08:50.820
All right, and here's something cool.

132
00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:59.097
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We don't even have to let
this component worry about handling this

133
00:08:59.097 --> 00:09:00.428
action, right?

134
00:09:00.428 --> 00:09:05.557
We're binding straight from
this component's template,

135
00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:13.008
going into the service and landing on its
logout action, that's pretty cool, right?

136
00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:16.491
I like the idea of actions and
services this is nice,

137
00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:20.688
a lot less code that would just
be sort of catching something and

138
00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:24.262
throwing it along the way,
we don't need to do that.

139
00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:26.030
Just let it go where it needs to go.
