00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt; Mike North: My name is Mike and

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.090
this is my 11th course with
Frontend Masters, which is pretty amazing.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.590
And I'm super excited to share
Ember Octane with you today.

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.090
I work at LinkedIn as a staff engineer and
I worked very closely

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.410
with the Ember core team there where
we've been building all this stuff.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.390
So I've been seeing it for the past year
and a half, or two years, slowly and

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.500
painstakingly coming together.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.510
And it is so
cool to be able to not only unveil it, but

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.260
to be able to start building apps with
it and start reaping the benefits and

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.520
seeing that things are simpler and
easier and way more fun.

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.300
So, if you are new to Ember, it's an open
source framework for single page apps.

12
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.100
So it sort of is in the same space
as react or view or angular.

13
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.910
Ember puts a high level of importance
on developer productivity.

14
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.340
So we're interested in
empowering developers to

15
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.350
focus most of their energy
on building product.

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.600
Building features, fixing bugs,
solving interesting problems.

17
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.820
And not so
much in deciding between three or

18
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.710
four equivalent options, or almost
equivalent options to get something done.

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.139
That is a means to an end.

20
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.140
So Ember has ambitious apps in mind.

21
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.260
And this means apps that have
a lot of data going through them.

22
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.850
A lot of interactivity
that they have to handle.

23
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.260
And this is part of why
LinkedIn is invested

24
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.735
in the Ember community,
and the Ember framework.

25
00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:46.499
LinkedIn.com is probably the biggest
single page app in the world.

26
00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.145
It is an Ember app with many sub parts but

27
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:56.200
about 250 people working on
it committing code everyday.

28
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.810
So it is certainly an ambitious app and
we hope that the stuff that we do

29
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.210
in the open source community,
helps lift everyone else up as well.

30
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.530
Ember is opinionated,
which is a good thing.

31
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.770
That means that we can more effectively
than any ecosystem I've seen,

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.230
leverage common solutions,
to choose a common path and make it good.

33
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.760
And everyone walks down that path so

34
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.298
we don't have to worry about maintaining
three or four different things.

35
00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:31.689
And we even know that in the future,
once there is a solution for

36
00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.211
some problem, we're all gonna
be able to take advantage of it.

37
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.753
Ember puts a high amount of value
on stability without stagnation.

38
00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:44.197
And that means that we
don't leave teams behind,

39
00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:48.610
we try to make sure that the upgrade
path is as easy as possible.

40
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.620
And I am very proud of the fact that
we've managed to take our community and

41
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.570
bring them from the IE eight
ages up to the present

42
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.760
while having a reasonable migration path.

43
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.080
It's not perfect.

44
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.370
It never can be.

45
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.480
But there are no points in
time where we just said

46
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.060
it's time to rewrite from scratch.

47
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.700
So in this workshop, we're gonna talk
a lot about the important things

48
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.310
one needs to know in order
to build a modern ember app.

49
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.658
And we're going to do so by building
an app together so if you've taken classes

50
00:03:23.658 --> 00:03:28.551
for me before sometimes I do a bunch of
like slides and we talk about things and

51
00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:32.911
then we do some exercises,
we're gonna do it differently today and

52
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.762
we're just gonna collaboratively
build an app together.

53
00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:43.790
I want this to be a miniaturized version
of a real world development experience.

54
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.135
So we're gonna make sure that
each step along the way,

55
00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:54.653
we make sure our tests pass and we kind of
evolve this starting from regular HTML and

56
00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:58.911
CSS all the way to a an interactive
full featured app.

57
00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.880
But we wanna do so in a sustainable way.

58
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.404
Feel free to ask questions.

59
00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:08.060
All of the stuff I'm showing
you here is very, very new so

60
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.680
almost nobody is an expert on all this.

61
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.979
I may not even be able to answer some of
your questions, but I will try my best.

62
00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.100
And I think we're gonna have a lot of fun.

63
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.470
I really,
really enjoy working with Ember Octane.

64
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.920
So, here is the app that
we're going to build today.

65
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.650
You may recognise this as Slack,
the popular

66
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.390
team chat app, where we have on the left
side, you can select different teams.

67
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.830
Then for a team,
you have a list of channels and

68
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.670
each channel has some messages.

69
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.838
So we're gonna deal with all of
the problems around this like routing so

70
00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:50.727
that your URL takes you to the right
place creating chat messages,

71
00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:52.062
deleting them, etc.

72
00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:54.940
And this app is going to be fast.

73
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.490
So simulating a mid-range
phone on a 3G network.

74
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.750
Our first meaningful paint is at 0.7
seconds, 2 seconds is a pretty reasonable

75
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.610
and respectable score for
a full fledged system so

76
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.590
you can imagine that we have over a second
of headroom for an API that might

77
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.630
be a little bit slow or do you have some
database queries that take a little while.

78
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.420
And this is on a mid-range phone.

79
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.250
If we look at desktop performance,
we're in the 0.1 and 0.2 second range.

80
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.990
And the only number
smaller than those is 0.

81
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.690
So this is blazing fast and

82
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.060
we're gonna use the combination of
some really fast client side code,

83
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.020
server rendering and some progressive
web technologies to get here, but

84
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.980
this is from a human perceived performance
standpoint, this feels instant.

85
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.360
This is approximately the amount of time
it takes to, when you flip a light switch,

86
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.870
the lights come on, we think that's
instant, that's the way our brains work.
