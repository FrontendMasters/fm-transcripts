1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.750
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So let's take care of it.

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.880
Import, fetch from fetch.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.980
And here we've got a team ID we're
gonna say resp = await, fetch.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.587
We gotta make this an A sync function so
that we may await.

5
00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:26.860
&gt;&gt; Mike North: api/teams${teamId}
just like that, right?

6
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.515
Drop the team ID in the correct place.

7
00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.828
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
decode the body to json.

8
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:41.019
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry, responsive design,

9
00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.500
that's why we were not
seeing the side bar.

10
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.180
Two more teams had popped up.

11
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.170
That is a pretty convincing indicator that

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.340
there is certainly more data there
than what we were seeing before.

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.895
Now let's try clicking on one of these.

14
00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.680
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, so
now, the team is being loaded.

15
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.820
And there is a second API
call being made down here.

16
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.560
You can click on that and you could see
here is the API response coming back.

17
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.110
And it looks like there
are channels in that team,

18
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.410
so let's iterate over those channels
to build up the channel list, right?

19
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.639
We've already passed the whole
team to that sidebar component,

20
00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.057
this shouldn't be too bad.

21
00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:33.544
So let's go team-sidebar.hps and
what looks like a channel here,

22
00:01:33.544 --> 00:01:37.814
channels, okay, so it's coming up.

23
00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:38.650
This looks like it.

24
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.590
That link certainly looks like what
we would expect the channel to be.

25
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.810
Data channel ID that I'm
99% sure at this point.

26
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.876
So let's give it a shot,
each team channels as channel,

27
00:01:54.876 --> 00:02:02.250
there's our little array .for each and
we need a link too.

28
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.261
Instead of the a tag, right?

29
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:15.620
Our route name,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Is team channel.

30
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.510
This is the innermost area in here.

31
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.620
And channel ID, we can swap that in.

32
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.600
We need to provide so that we're
getting an error message right now.

33
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.430
The next thing we're
gonna do is address that.

34
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.310
You attempted to generate a link for
this route, but

35
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.260
you did not pass the models for
generating its dynamic segments.

36
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.540
I love these error messages like there.

37
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.740
This is actionable, right?

38
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.684
Gotta pass the model.

39
00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:55.130
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Model, and
will be the channel ID.

40
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.340
And then we should save,
error message goes away.

41
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.370
We should put the channel.name here.

42
00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.090
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,
that is not general, that says top secret.

43
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.851
And if we go from team to team,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Looks

44
00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:18.160
like we've got different
channels showing up.

45
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.700
Now, this looks weird.

46
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.630
From using Slack before

47
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.180
I usually expect there to be a bar on
the currently active channel, right?

48
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.770
That background highlighting.

49
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.150
And it looks like we always get this.

50
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.730
So I'm just gonna search through the CSS
applied to this, the classes, and

51
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.910
see if I can find something that
looks like a background color.

52
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.140
That looks like it.

53
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.250
What we want is
a conditionally applied class

54
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.050
if this links happens
to be the active link.

55
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.999
And Link2 has something for
this, active class.

56
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.181
&gt;&gt; Mike North: PGTL dark.

57
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.220
Because no class is active right now,

58
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.210
we're just at teams/LinkedIn with no
slash channel of any kind after that.

59
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.530
But if we click on either of these we
should see I can alternate one and

60
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.350
the other, and one and
the other, and it works, right.

61
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.880
And in fact, this is when
the channel HPS is showing up.

62
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.650
So it seems like once we have our full URL
built with all of the pieces required,

63
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.763
things are starting to look good.

64
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.752
&gt;&gt; Mike North: One last thing we
want to do is make a request for

65
00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:39.040
that channel data.

66
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.310
Channel data what might have
some messages in there for us?

67
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.161
So let's go to our channel route.

68
00:04:47.824 --> 00:04:49.280
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Import fetch from fetch.

69
00:04:52.547 --> 00:04:53.500
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're gonna have model

70
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.135
hook,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That we're

71
00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:02.200
gonna make a fetch in there at some point.

72
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.070
I wanna check our little API
examples thing to make sure

73
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.689
that we're gonna hit the right URL,
so let's check it out.

74
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.797
Get a team which includes channels.

75
00:05:18.378 --> 00:05:22.072
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
we can get a single team,

76
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:27.100
we can get team channel messages.

77
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.950
So I think we're just gonna do this
in two steps, seems okay to me.

78
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.030
So this is the path we want to
hit to get data about a channel.

79
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.584
And we can really easily just
bring that up here and experiment.

80
00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:47.709
There's our teams, the name of the team,
channels the name of

81
00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:54.147
the channel and,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Get a channel.

82
00:05:58.287 --> 00:05:59.861
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
there's a little button popping up.

83
00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:05.098
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting,
let me give it a quick little check.

84
00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.570
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry,
I think we gotta do that now.

85
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.468
LinkedIn, channels, recruiting.

86
00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:24.400
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There we go.

87
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.740
I just had to use a channel name and

88
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.470
a theme name that
are actually in our database.

89
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.920
That's the only thing I had to tweak here.

90
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.520
And there we go.

91
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.780
So we get our channel data and
we'll deal with messages in a moment.

92
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.550
But this looks good to me and

93
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.260
we can bring that into our route and
then call this step complete.

94
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.710
Const to response = await fetch.

95
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.240
And then back tix cuz we're gonna
replace this with something and

96
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.320
replace this with something.

97
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.780
Now, here things are getting a little bit
interesting because we've found ourselves

98
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:11.850
at a route where although we get
the channel ID we do not get the team ID.

99
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.870
And so we kinda need to get
a clue from our parent,

100
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.260
from the parent route, the team route.

101
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.160
What were the parems that you were passed?

102
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.290
What were the arguments that you
received in your model hook?

103
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.400
And there are two ways we could do this.

104
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.550
If you've used Ember before you're
probably familiar with modelFor, right?

105
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.350
modelFor would let us get whatever
the model is for the team route.

106
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.960
So this would get us that team object and
it's the same rules as in

107
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.790
route templates where this will get you
whatever a promise resolves to write you.

108
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.650
You won't get the promised, you'll get
the resolved value, so you've seen this

109
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.450
before, the best practice here and
I mean this seriously, only reach up.

110
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.840
Only go from child route,
to parent route, to grandparent.

111
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.240
You want to do that because
you can be assured that

112
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.970
they've all recently loaded their data and
their stuff is still valid.

113
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.560
If you reach to the side,
like to your brother or

114
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.140
sister route,
that data could be really old.

115
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.560
And that route could never
have been called yet.

116
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.150
It may never have had a model, right?

117
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.840
We never hit that URL yet.

118
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.450
So you can run the risk of getting
nothing, getting stale data.

119
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.290
It's generally gonna not be a good time.

120
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:43.612
So only reach up your ancestry
to your parent and grandparent.

121
00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:47.333
A new thing that's been added recently
is we don't have to call modelFor

122
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:48.132
necessarily.

123
00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:51.170
We can call paremsFor.

124
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.916
And that gives you, for
the same route, for the team route,

125
00:08:55.916 --> 00:09:00.050
what did its model hook
receive as arguments.

126
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.880
So here we'll be able to get team ID.

127
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.420
And now we can plug this together,

128
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.610
I expect a build error cuz
I saved at a weird time.

129
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.410
teamId and channelId,
so that's our response,

130
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.660
return resp.json.

131
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.220
And that should give us the channel.

132
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.276
And we'll just wire that up real quick.

133
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:31.852
And we can say, the title is now gonna be

134
00:09:31.852 --> 00:09:37.176
this.model,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Title.

135
00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.723
We'll try name.

136
00:09:42.887 --> 00:09:46.200
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I see I have
an undefined in my URL down here.

137
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.552
What did I do wrong?

138
00:09:48.552 --> 00:09:51.358
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You need teams- [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thank you.

139
00:09:54.597 --> 00:09:56.320
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, perfect.

140
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:56.900
That was it.

141
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.960
That's all it took.

142
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.260
So now we've got recruiting,
job hunting, right?

143
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.360
That's icing on the cake.

144
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.320
This model description.

145
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.482
There we go.
Now our headers are changing and

146
00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:18.783
our channels, our list of channels
changed as we go between teams.

147
00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:21.748
When we pick a channel, we can see
the header changes with the title and

148
00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:23.164
the description of the channel.

149
00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:29.390
We can see that all of these API calls are
going out, they’re fetching real data so

150
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:35.634
we have now through basically swapping out
hard coded array in our routing layer.

151
00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:39.189
We replaced them with promises
that resolved to similar data,

152
00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:41.684
we didn’t have to touch
too much of our app.

153
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:45.974
I mean, the only way we touched our
templates in other ways was to start using

154
00:10:45.974 --> 00:10:47.126
this data, right.

155
00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:49.838
To start consuming it in a deeper and
more involved way.

156
00:10:53.496 --> 00:10:55.467
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just checking
the test before I recall it.

157
00:10:58.478 --> 00:11:01.560
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What's going on?

158
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.659
Our tests are hard coded for
a channel name called general.

159
00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:10.020
So team sidebar test and

160
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.386
we can pass this a team,

161
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.019
&gt;&gt; Mike North: right, so

162
00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:23.410
team sidebar wants a team now.

163
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.139
And we could say,

164
00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:33.108
this set my team name general

165
00:11:33.108 --> 00:11:38.579
description looks like,

166
00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:45.390
that's fine, let's see.

167
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.182
We expected this and we got this.

168
00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:56.186
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So there's the username,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I

169
00:11:56.186 --> 00:11:58.840
think I made the wrong fix here,
let me just back this up real quick.

170
00:12:05.297 --> 00:12:07.280
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,
so we got the side bar.

171
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.020
We've got the user, channels, okay.

172
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.850
So we have to worry about
a channel called general and

173
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.990
I was passing it a team called general,
that was the problem.

174
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.607
So we'll go back into that.

175
00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:26.335
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And we don't need
to worry about the team's name,

176
00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:32.475
we just need to have,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Something like that.

177
00:12:36.859 --> 00:12:37.649
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Title.

178
00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:45.467
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let me just
look at my template so

179
00:12:45.467 --> 00:12:48.418
I don't go too much deeper into this.

180
00:12:48.418 --> 00:12:51.493
There's my model.name.

181
00:12:51.493 --> 00:12:54.674
So it should be name and
description for the header but we're-

182
00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:56.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE] array brackets.

183
00:12:56.174 --> 00:12:57.065
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Pardon?

184
00:12:57.065 --> 00:12:57.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Your channels.

185
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.073
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thank you.

186
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:08.744
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And this should be
name in fact and we're good to go.

187
00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:13.057
All right, so the further we parameterize
these components, we have to go back and

188
00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:17.450
do little tweaks to our tests, because
they're getting empty stuff at this point.
