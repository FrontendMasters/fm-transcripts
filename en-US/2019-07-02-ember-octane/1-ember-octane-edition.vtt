00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.230
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Before
we get into the code,

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.690
I wanna talk a little bit about editions.

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.921
So I'm not here telling you
about Ember 4.0 or 5.0.

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.910
This course is titled Ember Octane.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.320
And part of the reason we have
editions is unlike a lot of

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.910
software you're used to consuming,
Ember's major releases are really boring.

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.830
All we do in a major releases is we strip
out old code that's been deprecated,

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.249
and warning you that it's disappearing for
awhile.

9
00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.498
And we dropped support for
legacy browsers.

10
00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:37.993
We never, ever introduce new
features in a major release.

11
00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:41.490
And this is part of our
commitment to stability.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.561
We want people to be able to
get over that threshold and

13
00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:48.468
not worry about these new features
potentially causing problems.

14
00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:53.493
And increasing the complexity of
getting over that threshold and

15
00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:56.050
making that transition.

16
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.040
But this deprives us of the ability to
trump it at those major release numbers.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.490
That everything's changed, and
these are the new things that you can do.

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.380
We don't really have those big milestones.

19
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.780
And in the beginning of the class,
when we're going around and

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.608
introducing ourselves,

21
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:20.830
somebody pointed out that it's kinda hard
to know when we want to look at our app.

22
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.840
And decide whether it is
the right time to upgrade.

23
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.130
Every six weeks we get a minor release and
a new feature or

24
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.610
two will have landed, and
that's a pretty regular cadence.

25
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.306
Too regular you might say,

26
00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:39.190
to be constantly re-evaluating whether
you need to go and take another look.

27
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.420
So this is the way editions work and the
way they kind of give us a clearer signal.

28
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.850
We begin by setting goals and then
over a period of time we do some work.

29
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.900
And we often will land this
work in stable releases.

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.300
We just won't update the docs.

31
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.190
I won't come out and

32
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.780
film a new version of the video
course until the edition completes.

33
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.420
Once it completes, then we know that's
the signal that we should all look in,

34
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.490
the last piece of a larger
puzzle has dropped.

35
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.110
And now we can sort of shift to something
big, something new and exciting.

36
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.991
So Octane is the first
manifestation of an edition.

37
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:25.273
But we're gonna be repeating
this process over and over.

38
00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:30.773
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So,
in terms of Octane's goals,

39
00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:34.750
it emphasizes modern productivity and
performance.

40
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.340
And that modern productivity to us means,
modern JavaScript syntax.

41
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.490
So until now Ember has not
been officially compatible

42
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.010
with native JavaScript classes,
but now it is.

43
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.260
And in addition to this,

44
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.740
we have a new component model
that is dramatically simpler.

45
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.660
I think it's 90% simpler than what
people are used to having to work with

46
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.850
for a couple reasons.

47
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.550
But we're gonna see that
they're almost like 3 or

48
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.589
4 things you have to remember
instead of 30 or 40.

49
00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:15.427
Performance-wise we have shrunk
the size of the hello world app.

50
00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:19.070
And one of the ways we've done this
is we've made jQuery optional, right?

51
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.941
We don't need to support IE8 anymore,
that was the main motivation for

52
00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:24.025
including jQuery.

53
00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:29.165
So in addition to that we've
made investments in tree-shaking

54
00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:34.790
which allows you to discard any parts
of libraries that you do not use.
