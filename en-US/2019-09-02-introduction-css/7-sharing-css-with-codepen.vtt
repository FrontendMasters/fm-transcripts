00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We had a lot of creativity
going on here in the classroom.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.360
And I saw some really awesome stuff.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.300
Nice job, Shawn on, on slack.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.760
And so, what I'd like to do is we can
share a little bit what we have created.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.170
And so, an easy way of doing
that is using code pen.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.100
We went through code pen in
the internet fundamentals course.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.830
But just to remind you how we can go about
setting this up and then sharing it.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.430
I'm going to walk you through that now.

9
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.650
So the website you want
to go to is codepen.io.

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.840
And hopefully you've already
created an account here.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.250
If you have created an account you'll be
able to share this with everybody else.

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.030
If you need to log in,
go on ahead and do so.

13
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.600
There should be a log in button
up there on the top somewhere.

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.500
I've already logged in, that's why you can
see me in the upper right-hand corner.

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.740
Then we're gonna go ahead and
click on Create.

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.350
And we're gonna say create a New Pen.

17
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.330
Create New Pen.

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.840
And this is gonna give you boxes for
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.310
We don't need JavaScript so you can just
sort right off the screen, all right.

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.080
We just need the boxes for HTML and CSS.

21
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.960
Just click and
drag to get rid of the JavaScript box.

22
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.810
You can move around the division between
HTML and CSS just click and drag.

23
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.160
Now when we go back into
our visual studio code,

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.270
what we need to do is we
need to copy our HTML.

25
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.640
But, you do not need to copy all of
the HTML you only need to copy part of it.

26
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.920
And the part you need to copy is the part
right here inside of the body tags.

27
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.720
So from body to just before slash body,

28
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.530
not including the body tags but
what's inside the body.

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.320
That's what needs to go up on code pen.

30
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.394
So go on ahead and copy all of that.

31
00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:04.267
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we can go ahead and

32
00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:08.936
put that on the code pen and HTML.

33
00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:14.114
So my HTML is starting with
the line the h1 all about me.

34
00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:18.986
Okay, and you should be back
to your usual ugly web page.

35
00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:25.280
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, then we're gonna
do exactly the same thing for our CSS.

36
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.130
And in case of our CSS, we just
copy the whole entire CSS document.

37
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.510
Copy the whole document.

38
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.020
Copy.

39
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180
And then go ahead and
paste it here into your code pen.

40
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.740
And your styling should go on ahead and
pop up right here, on your webpage.

41
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.710
We're still making ugly web pages,
aren't we?

42
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.670
[LAUGH] We will get to pretty things.

43
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.300
Okay.

44
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.340
So this is kind of what I did here,
I changed some colors,

45
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.595
I'm pretty proud of my quote there.

46
00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:17.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Very nice, okay?

47
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.099
And so once you've got that, all that
stuff pasted up here on your code pen.

48
00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.240
If you go on ahead and

49
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.380
click the save button up here
in the top right corner, okay?

50
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.485
Once you click the save button and
not before.

51
00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:34.940
Once you click the save
button you now have a URL.

52
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.560
And that URL you can copy.

53
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.810
And you can share it right here in slack,
just like that.

54
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.120
Okay?

55
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.880
So everybody can see my fabulous web page.

56
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.060
So if anybody wants to
share what they have done,

57
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.330
I've showed you my page and
my fabulous styling.

58
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.250
I assume yours is kind of similar to that.

59
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.250
So if anybody wants to share, go on
ahead and post your link on up there and

60
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.716
slack and let's see what's happening.

61
00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:07.543
Okay, Megan.

62
00:04:07.543 --> 00:04:10.060
Yay, Megan.

63
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.340
So here's what Megan did.

64
00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:23.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Meghan's actually
got some design skills.

65
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.070
Hers is much prettier, okay?

66
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.320
So she's got some text
coloring going on there.

67
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.630
Ooh, she did some cool
stuff down here with tabs.

68
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.820
You must have gotten that code somewhere
off the internet, and copy and

69
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.880
pasted it in.

70
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.550
We will be talking about how to
take bulleted lists like this and

71
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.380
turn them into navigation bars,
that will be later in the course.

72
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.930
So you too will learn how to
do that kind of cool stuff.

73
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.600
It is a very nice background
color you have there Megan.

74
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.920
So that's fabulous.

75
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.500
Well done.

76
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.280
If other people want to share here.

77
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.720
So we got Lei.

78
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.038
Lei went ahead and shared.

79
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:12.045
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

80
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.360
And so, she centered a bunch
of stuff here on the page.

81
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.230
Very nice.

82
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.000
She's playing around with line height and
the paragraphs.

83
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.940
You see here that the text isn't all
stacked on top of each other so tightly.

84
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.030
See how she's got some
nice breathing room here?

85
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.950
That's the line height property she's
applied to the paragraph style.

86
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.510
So she's got some good stuff
going on here, well done, Lei.

87
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.304
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, here's John's.

88
00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:50.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and so John has
played around with some font sizes here.

89
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.200
He made some nice dashed boarders
here around his around his headings.

90
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.270
Good stuff and

91
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.940
a different a different dash boarder
around the other heading here.

92
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.100
He's changed some, some links here.

93
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.240
So you see that he's turned
off some underlines for links.

94
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.790
Okay.

95
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.140
Cool, nice, well done John.

96
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.250
David there you are.

97
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One of my my changes I'm not
seeing right now the border I put around

98
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.680
the H2's.

99
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.695
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not sure why,

100
00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:28.560
but
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's interesting.

101
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.120
Okay, so Dave visited place puppy.

102
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's a different puppy
than I have on mine, mine's cuter.

103
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.578
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] So maybe if we
refresh, maybe we'll get a different one?

104
00:06:40.578 --> 00:06:43.946
Let's try.

105
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:44.700
Nope.

106
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.460
No, no joy today.

107
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.380
Okay.
So

108
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.370
he's got kind of a busy background there,
doesn't he?

109
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.750
But it's a very cute puppy.

110
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.590
So what I would recommend here Dave,
is make your text white, so

111
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.275
we could actually read it.

112
00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:05.115
[LAUGH] Yeah,
as you can see from this example and

113
00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:10.085
I'm going to pick on Dave here just for
a second.

114
00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:15.855
We are kind of making like mid
1990s web pages today, right?

115
00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:20.085
This is what we did in the mid 1990s is
we put up these these background images,

116
00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:23.355
they tile you see how they
tile going across the page and

117
00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:25.410
they tile going down the page.

118
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.112
And you see that it can be very hard to
read text and it's hard to pick a good

119
00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:33.150
text color in this situation because we
have a brown dog on a white background.

120
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.898
So if we pick white text,
it's going to wash out in a few spots,

121
00:07:36.898 --> 00:07:40.280
if we pick black text,
it washes out in some other spots.

122
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.220
So one of the things that we often do
in this kind of situation where we

123
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.370
really want to have this
cute puppy everywhere.

124
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.200
But we still wanna be able to read our
text is we'll actually take this, and

125
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.990
we'll apply some opacity filtering to
it to make it a little bit transparent.

126
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.060
Or we'll wash out
the picture a little bit or

127
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.610
maybe blur it a little bit in
order to make it not quite so

128
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.360
overpowering as a background and
make our text a little bit more readable.

129
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.227
You can also see one of the things
that I did in my pen here.

130
00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:16.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So where I did
the same idea here with the cat.

131
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.470
So I have my words on the top or white.

132
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.660
Worked pretty well.

133
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.080
Underneath for my name,

134
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.690
what I actually did was assign
a background color for my text, and

135
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.930
that would be another approach here to get
your text to show up on top of the picture

136
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.510
here when you're not really sure what
the picture is gonna look like, okay?

137
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.520
Here we go.

138
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.760
Same idea, same kinda puppy.

139
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.604
Maybe it's cached on my computer.

140
00:08:42.604 --> 00:08:43.750
Look at that.

141
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.260
[COUGH] So she's made use here of papyrus,

142
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.040
and this is probably a generic
cursive font, I would imagine.

143
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.570
This is what Macintoshes do when they
don't know what the font is, but

144
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.450
the generic is set to cursive.

145
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.940
I think it's Zapf Chancery or
something like that.

146
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.450
So we've got that going on here.

147
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.060
Very nice.

148
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.180
Very nice, all right so
well done everybody.

149
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.470
I'm so glad that you had fun doing
this and your code pens look great.

150
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.120
Are there any questions that came up
while you were working on that exercise?

151
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.310
Anything you wanna ask about?

152
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.600
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What if I want to make

153
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.649
the back down image like an image from
my own computer rather than from online?

154
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: An image from
your own computer, okay.

155
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.610
So if you wanted to do that, you’re gonna
need to do the same kinds of things that

156
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.810
we did yesterday with the image locally.

157
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.670
So you’ll make an images folder,
you’ll copy your image from wherever it

158
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.269
is on your computer into the images folder
that’s inside of the day two folder.

159
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.020
So everything,
this is a really important point.

160
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.230
As you start to gather up resource
to put together your website.

161
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.850
You want to make sure that you entire
website will be contained in that day

162
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:57.560
two folder.

163
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.400
So if we were going to add some images
here, we would want add an images folder.

164
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.860
And put any images that we want to use
inside of that images folder, okay?

165
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.570
And then you can use them as background
images using the correct path, or

166
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.780
whatever happens to be, makes sense?
