00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now I have one more
trick that I wanna show you here, and

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.970
that has to do with a thing
that happened here.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.850
When I made my font size bigger, see how I
made my font size bigger on these links?

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.382
I happen to have a link over
here in this paragraph too,

5
00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.542
and see how that link
font size got bigger too?

6
00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:21.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's not what I wanted.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.000
I wanted my links to look that way, but

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.660
I didn't really want that font
size to go throughout my document.

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.940
I only wanted it to happen over here for
my links, that are here in my fine links.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.200
So, does anyone have any suggestions,
how I can

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.050
create the font size to be bigger just for
the links that are here, in this document?

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.690
Just in the my fine links section, yeah?

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Get more specific
on what you're targeting.

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, I need to get
more specific on what I'm targeting.

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.940
That's absolutely true, okay?

16
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.227
So, how could I go about doing that?

17
00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.089
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Use a list and line?

18
00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I could try using li,
that would be a good thing to do.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.675
So I could say-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You have another list except

20
00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:06.770
it's unordered list and
ordered lists, I don't know.

21
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.176
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, so I do have only
one list one ordered list one an ordered

22
00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:18.208
list in this document, so
I could say something with that UL, right?

23
00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:19.290
Nothing else there, yeah?

24
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.548
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

25
00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.085
I could say something with the UL right?

26
00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:27.765
But we already decided that calling
the UL to change the way my links look,

27
00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:29.662
that doesn't work, right?

28
00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:32.337
But we can put these two things together,

29
00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:36.707
in order to target our links a little
bit more specifically, okay?

30
00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:40.522
And the way I would go
about doing that is,

31
00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:46.642
let's just start up here with my
regular old unlinked stake here.

32
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:51.550
If I said UL space A link, okay?

33
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.890
So the space here is really,
really important.

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.263
So what I'm saying is, for all unvisited
links located inside of an unordered list.

35
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:08.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is called
the descendant selector, okay.

36
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.775
So for all unordered links,
or unvisited links

37
00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:17.404
inside of an unordered list,
do the following.

38
00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.091
Yeah.

39
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:24.266
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I saw this
term descendant selector.

40
00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:25.168
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's

41
00:02:25.168 --> 00:02:28.320
basically just something
with n in another element.

42
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.
So we're talking about family here.

43
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.820
There are parents and children involved
in our html here, does that makes sense?

44
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.740
So, for example, for this A tag
here what what would its parent be?

45
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The list?

46
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.484
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yet the list item, the Li,

47
00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:48.924
where would the parent
of the list item be?

48
00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:50.487
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Unordered list, the UL.

49
00:02:50.487 --> 00:02:52.192
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The unordered list the UL,

50
00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.169
what would the parent of
the an ordered list be?

51
00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: H2?

52
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, not the H2.

53
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.902
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The body?

54
00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:02.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably
the body tag right?

55
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.620
Or we'd have to scroll all the way up here
to the body tag to find something that

56
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.260
encompassed that H2, right?

57
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.970
Okay, so, what would be the relationship
between this H2 in this paragraph?

58
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Brothers?

59
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
they're brothers, they're siblings.

60
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.790
They're siblings, that's exactly right,
they're siblings, okay?

61
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.170
So the H2, the paragraph, the UL,
these are all siblings, okay?

62
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.960
That those relationships will
come in really handy when we talk

63
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.090
more about some of these
relationships tomorrow.

64
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.390
But, they're handy to keep in mind, when
we talk about the descendant selectors.

65
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.160
So descendant meaning we have ancestors
and we have descendants, right?

66
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280
And we could be talking about
our parents or grandparents or

67
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.180
great grandparents, right?

68
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.100
We could be talking about our children,
our grandchildren,

69
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.290
our great grandchildren.

70
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.770
We're not being real specific here.

71
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.860
We're just saying ancestors and
descendant.

72
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.890
So with the ancestor and descendant or
sorry with the descendants selector here

73
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.350
in our CSS, we're simply saying that for
all of the a's that live inside of the UL.

74
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.721
And these A's live inside of a UL,
don't they?

75
00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:11.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They definitely do.

76
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.090
Okay, so
that will affect these links here.

77
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.404
So let's see what happens on our web
page when we save that and take a look.

78
00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:22.754
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right?

79
00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:25.403
So my other link down
here in my main text,

80
00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:31.220
it's back to its regular old size and
whatever styling it had by default, okay?

81
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.170
And see my only big links that
are left are these ones here.
