00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what would happen if I
wanna put these two paragraphs down here

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.390
on top of each other?

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.270
I don't want any space between them,
just the line, just the border.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.200
What am I gonna do to put these two
paragraphs down here in box two?

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.020
I want to put them on top of each other,
what should I do?

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you use the p tag and
put in zero margin?

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, so first of all,

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.310
we have to determine where
that space is coming from.

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.550
Where is that space coming
from between those paragraphs?

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.236
Its margin, that's assigned to which tag?

12
00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The P tag.

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's
assigned to the paragraph.

14
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.737
Right, so we know that,

15
00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:43.570
that space in between is margin
coming from the paragraph.

16
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.930
So what we need to do to
get rid of it is do what?

17
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.603
We need to say the paragraph
would have margin of zero.

18
00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:02.704
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Don't need to specify RAM,
or pixels or anything just zero.

19
00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:06.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Zero is zero, you can
say zero RAM, you can say zero percent,

20
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.960
you can say zero pixels it doesn't matter.

21
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.702
Zero is zero, so
you can just say plain old zero.

22
00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can put the margin with

23
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.700
the other p tag also, can't you?

24
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.650
You don't have to have two separate?

25
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, we could.

26
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.310
We could certainly
combine these two styles.

27
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.390
Absolutely, we could
combine those two styles.

28
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, I was just,
that's what confused me.

29
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [CROSSTALK] Okay,
yeah, that's fair.

30
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.290
Yep, we can totally
combine those two styles.

31
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.790
Okay?

32
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.082
Yes?

33
00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:40.374
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you do that for
just box2?

34
00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:41.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could do it just for
box2.

35
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.562
How do we do it just for box2?

36
00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could we put
a comma after the box2 class?

37
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.312
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
what do you want me to do here?

38
00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:57.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Put a comma after box2
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put a comma after box two.

39
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And add in the P.

40
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And put in a P.

41
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

42
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.230
what does that selector say?

43
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.230
Dot box two comma p,
what does that actually say?

44
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.188
Yes,.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Box two and

45
00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:09.613
paragraph for box two.

46
00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:12.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: For box two and
for the paragraphs.

47
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.220
But we want the paragraphs
inside of box two.

48
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.289
What does our selector
look like when we do that?

49
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Use dot instead of comma.

50
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.990
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Use a dot
instead of a comma.

51
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.768
Well, we put a dot in front of
our class names, that is true.

52
00:02:28.768 --> 00:02:30.056
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And then .p.

53
00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:33.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: P.box 2
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: P.box2 that

54
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.180
would be a paragraph with a class of box2.

55
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Box2 p?

56
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's it,
box2 p, box 2 space p.

57
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.992
So for all paragraphs inside of box2 we're
gonna apply this style so see that that

58
00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:54.411
applied to those paragraphs down there on
the bottom but not to the one in box 1.

59
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:59.249
Let's do something else here in Box2.

60
00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.640
So I'm going to change my html in box2.

61
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm going to go ahead and add an h1.

62
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.667
My heading.

63
00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:13.799
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

64
00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.211
So down here in box two I've
gone ahead and added an H1.

65
00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:20.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right?

66
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
So you see we've got my heading and
then I have a big, great big huge space.

67
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.890
And then I have my paragraphs.

68
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.840
Something that's very common and people
wanna do, is they look at that big space,

69
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.950
especially designers,
they look at that big space and

70
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.780
they go, that's too much,
I want less space.

71
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.830
How do we go about making that less space?

72
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.097
Anyone wanna take a guess?

73
00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:49.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Heading with some negative

74
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.100
properties?

75
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.440
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well,
that might be one possibility.

76
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.890
Do we have to go negative?

77
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or zero?

78
00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Could be zero.

79
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.980
What do you think?

80
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The same way that we
assigns like a different margin to the P,

81
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.580
do the same with an H2 or H1.

82
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The same with the h1?

83
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

84
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.200
if we said h1 has got margin 0, like that.

85
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.990
Cool, all right?

86
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.210
So that definitely got
rid of that space there.

87
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.660
Well, let me show you this.

88
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.160
This is because we have
zero margin on our h1 and

89
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.740
we have zero margin on our paragraph.

90
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.630
If I get rid of the margin on
my paragraph, what happens now?

91
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Default comes into play.

92
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're back to that
space in between the heading in

93
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.860
the paragraph, aren't we?

94
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.200
Because the paragraph has a margin, right?

95
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.830
The heading has a margin.

96
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.280
If we wanna get rid of all those margins,
we need to get rid of the bottom margin on

97
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.415
the h1 and the top margin on the paragraph
in order to get rid of that big gap.

98
00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:06.220
Okay.

99
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.584
So the way that code would
look would be margin bottom,

100
00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:19.680
0, or sorry, margin top on the paragraph.

101
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.806
And on the h1,
it will be margin-bottom, 0.

102
00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:32.563
So now, I've just gotten rid of the space
between the heading and the paragraph.

103
00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:36.509
You have super fine control over
the placement of all of these elements on

104
00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:37.292
the webpage.

105
00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:41.558
The hardest part about the whole thing
is figuring out first of all, a,

106
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:44.310
where is the space coming from?

107
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.510
Okay, the space cut which which
HTML tag did that space come from?

108
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.860
And is the space margin or
is it padding and once you

109
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.350
know those two things you can eliminate or
create any space you want on your webpage.

110
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.800
That's what I'm trying
to demonstrate here.

111
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.010
How's everybody doing?

112
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.910
You okay?
All right.

113
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.880
Yes.

114
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.603
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are there any defaults that
you would run into where the browser is

115
00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:14.030
just like overpowers whatever you do?

116
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No,
that's a great question though.

117
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.470
No, there is not a spot where
the browser styles will quote

118
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.435
overpower or be more specific than what
you write in your own style sheet.

119
00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:28.395
That's part of the cascade.

120
00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:30.765
The browser styles are the least
specific of all and

121
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.875
they're very easy to override
with your own style sheet.

122
00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:34.755
Done by design.
