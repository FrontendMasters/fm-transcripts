00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, there's one thing
that I think everybody should do as

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.940
the very first thing that they
should do in their document.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.630
And that is change the font.

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.510
There is nothing worse than looking at
a whole page of Times New Roman font

5
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.350
on a webpage.

6
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.930
Do you agree?

7
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.126
It's just awful to read and
it looks horrible.

8
00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:20.010
So we're gonna go ahead and start writing
our CSS by changing the font on our entire

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.040
document from Times New Roman, which is
the default that set up by the browser,

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.400
we're gonna change it all to Arial.

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.340
So how do we go about doing that?

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.880
Well, CSS is based on our HTML,
we have to take a look at our HTML and

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.496
how it's set up.

14
00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:42.590
And that's gonna sort of dictate what
we're going to create in our CSS.

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.040
And the first part of our declaration,
these are called declarations in CSS.

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.880
The very first part of that is
a thing called the selector.

17
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.260
In this case,
we're gonna work with the body tag.

18
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.100
So this is a selector called body.

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.600
And it's gonna apply to
everything on the body tag.

20
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.080
And so,
you just need to type that word body.

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160
So any HTML tag you can
just type on in there,

22
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.530
nothing special you need
to do just body like that.

23
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.560
And then we're gonna go and put in
a pair of curly brackets just like that.

24
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.490
And it tends to be the habit of
people working in the industry

25
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520
to separate your brackets
on to two lines like this.

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.480
So you put your brackets on two lines
just like that and everything is you type

27
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.370
all of your various style declarations
in between those curly brackets.

28
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.120
So every style declaration
is made up of two parts.

29
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.230
It's made of a property and
a value, property, value.

30
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.721
You'll hear a lot about property,
value pairs and programming, okay?

31
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:46.720
When you get to JavaScript, you hear
a lot about properties and values.

32
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.010
Same kind of thing here inside of body.

33
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.822
So we're gonna go ahead and

34
00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:57.650
start with font, hyphen family.

35
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.960
That's our property.

36
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.010
And as you saw as you started typing here,
there were several of these.

37
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.430
That VS code will go ahead and
suggest for you.

38
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.190
So there's a whole bunch of
things that you can adjust.

39
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.370
Be aware that just because it's in this
list doesn't mean that you should be

40
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.420
using it, right?

41
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.890
Just because you can
doesn't mean you should.

42
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.196
Some of these have better
browser support than others.

43
00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:23.350
Everything I'm gonna be telling you
about today has great browser support,

44
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.270
you're not gonna have to worry about
it working in one browser or another.

45
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.740
So we're looking at font family.

46
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.500
And then if you happen to
continue on here with VS code,

47
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.469
it's gonna give you a long
list of a pile of fonts, okay?

48
00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.603
Fonts happen to be something that come
from the computer that's right there in

49
00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:43.180
front of you.

50
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.005
And we can make the assumption that
everyone in the world is gonna have

51
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.950
Arial on their computer,
but not everybody does.

52
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.540
And so, what we need to do is we
need to have choices of fonts.

53
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.499
They'll try to go the browser will try to
load the very first font on your list.

54
00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:03.070
It can't load that font,
it goes to the second font on the list.

55
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.910
And if it can't load that one then it
will go to the next one on the list.

56
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.720
And it will just continue on that way
until it finds a font that is installed in

57
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.780
your computer to display.

58
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.620
So the one I'm going to choose here
is Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif.

59
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.960
And we end that line with a semicolon.

60
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.130
So this is gonna try to load Arial first,
Helvetica second, and

61
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.740
then just a generic font for
the third spot.

62
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.630
And so
these generics are called sans-serif,

63
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.000
serif, monospace is another one, cursive.

64
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.920
There's a couple of these,
fantasy I think is another one.

65
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.940
Usually you Serif or San-Serif.

66
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.779
Those are pretty much the ones.

67
00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.790
And what do we mean by the way by serif or
san-serif?

68
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A little curly
Q on the end of the letter.

69
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's the little
lines on the ends of the letter.

70
00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.450
So if you think of a capital T, for
example, we think of a capital T.

71
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.930
This one here, this T,
this is serif or san-serif?

72
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.790
&gt;&gt; Audience: San-serif.

73
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: San-serif,
it's very, very simple T.

74
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.170
Sometimes if you take a look at T,
maybe on your webpage?

75
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.730
In fact, we can just go ahead and do that.

76
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.615
Let me make a great big huge T.

77
00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:22.997
You don't have to do this.

78
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me just,
this is just for demonstration.

79
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.080
So you see the big T up there
at the top of my webpage?

80
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.790
See how it's got the little
thingies hanging off the edges?

81
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.110
Those little thingies are called serifs.

82
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.400
And for all you French speakers out there
you know that if there's no serifs,

83
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.350
it san-serif, right?

84
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.250
So that's where it comes from.

85
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.130
Okay, I'll go ahead and
get rid of that and we'll get rid of that.

86
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.102
All right, so if we're going ahead and

87
00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:02.259
now save your style sheet,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's go ahead and

88
00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.750
take a look at that webpage
in your web browser.

89
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.337
Remember how we do that,

90
00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:11.024
you can just right-click somewhere
where there's no text in your HTML,

91
00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:15.502
right-click or command click and
just say open and default browser.

92
00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:19.750
And that will go ahead and open up your
webpage for you, and hopefully it worked.

93
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.850
It looks like mine didn't.

94
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.546
Did yours work?

95
00:05:23.546 --> 00:05:24.403
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

96
00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:25.932
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yours work?

97
00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:30.175
Cool, anyone see the problem
was to why mine didn't work?

98
00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:31.115
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You didn't save it.

99
00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I didn't save that.

100
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.230
Okay, so this happens to everybody.

101
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.080
That's the first thing you should check
when something quote doesn't work.

102
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.159
Make sure that you saved it.

103
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.780
All right, so now when I refresh the page,
now what we work, okay?

104
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.190
Doesn't it look better already?

105
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.500
It's amazing how one little
change can change everything.

106
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.950
Shall we continue on trying
to petrify this thing?

107
00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I have a question.

108
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

109
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So you said that you could
list different fonts and so it will choose

110
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.560
the first one and then like if it doesn't
find it, it will choose the second one.

111
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.800
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So you could have,

112
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.950
like if you have downloaded
others fonts onto your computer,

113
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.910
you can use fonts there and
then hope that somebody else has it but

114
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.520
then also have the contingency of you
can put it in Arial or Helvetica.

115
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That is
completely legitimate.

116
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.640
So when I was teaching very earlier
on I had a student who was very fond

117
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.070
of the Wonton font.

118
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.340
And he did everything on his websites in
this Wonton font, but I didn't have it so

119
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.300
I never saw the wonderful world of Wonton.

120
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.050
So it probably hardly anyone
had Wonton on their computer.

121
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.400
So in the old days,
that is in fact what we did.

122
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.080
We could list all the fonts
that were on our computer,

123
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.590
hope that somebody else had them.

124
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.990
There were whole websites that would tell
you what percentage of the world had that

125
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.650
font installed.

126
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.890
These days, there's actually some
fonts online that we can access.

127
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.810
We're gonna talk about those
later on in the course.

128
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.300
But for right now there's
like seven choices, okay?

129
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.605
Where we are at the moment,
Arial, Helvetica, Times,

130
00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:09.030
Georgia, Courier, Trebuchet,
Comic Sans, [SOUND] go Comic Sans.
