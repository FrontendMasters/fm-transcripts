00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That was a lot of stuff.

2
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.653
There was a huge amount of
information to absorb today.

3
00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:10.047
So if you just managed to code
the nav bars, you got those working.

4
00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:14.083
Maybe you just managed to kind of
get the text next to the images.

5
00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:16.465
You're doing just fine.

6
00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:20.170
This was a whole lot of material
to absorb in three hours.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.120
Like I said I threw about five or

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.620
six weeks worth of material at you in
a normal class and then gave you this

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.197
assignment that had everything that
you just known for all of two hours.

10
00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.216
Here put all to work on a web page.

11
00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:34.862
So you are doing just fine,

12
00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:38.740
no matter where you are in
the process of putting this together.

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.265
This is your first real world project.

14
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:42.817
This is a very standard thing.

15
00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:46.376
You have a graphic designer that will
lay out a page that will look like this.

16
00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:49.575
And then you're gonna have
to be able to look at it and

17
00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:54.318
decide what technologies do I use where
to repeat what the designer has done.

18
00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:58.979
I wasn't super picky about the spacing and
so forth here.

19
00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.432
Trust me in real life, your graphic
designer is gonna be so picky.

20
00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:07.830
[LAUGH] That is two pixels too small,
that is two pixels too far to the left.

21
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.526
So as you get better at this,

22
00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:13.722
you'll get really good at putting
things exactly where you wanna go.

23
00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:17.247
For this assignment I'm really not too
concerned if you didn't get exactly

24
00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:18.577
the right shades of colors.

25
00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:22.941
I'm not concerned if you didn't get
exactly the right spacing or padding or

26
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:24.452
margin or anything else.

27
00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:29.350
If you got it mostly looking like this
you've done absolutely fabulous work,

28
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.073
considering you've been coding now for
three whole days.

29
00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:36.803
That's pretty good for
three whole days of coding.

30
00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:38.498
Right?

31
00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.527
Any other questions for today?

32
00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:43.956
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How do you
choose between flexbox and

33
00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:46.001
the other
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the inline block?

34
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.837
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

35
00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:50.946
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great question, so
how do we choose between flexbox and

36
00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:51.798
inline block.

37
00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.791
I think what we're gonna find
increasingly is that we're

38
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.611
gonna be using flexbox more and
more for these things.

39
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:01.672
Inline block is still a technique that's
out there and definitely is still in use.

40
00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.734
So reasonable thing for
you to know aboout.

41
00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:05.969
So, they basically do the same thing?

42
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.389
In the terms of the nav bar,
they basically do the same thing.

43
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.357
You're probably not gonna use Inline block
for laying out a whole web page whereas

44
00:02:14.357 --> 00:02:18.321
you definitely would use flexbox for
laying out a whole web page.
