WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we have margin.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.110
Margin is outside of the border,
margin can be positive or negative.

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.760
We could move things around in space,
right?

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.100
Separate boxes, bring boxes
together with margin, make sense?

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.250
Okay, so let's go on to the next one,
which is called padding, all right?

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.270
And we'll, Dave answer this one.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.380
So we've got all this text,

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.850
it's all shushed up against
the edges of the box, right?

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.920
Is that a good look?

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.440
Probably not, right?

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.040
We'd probably like a little
bit of space around that.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.730
So Dave, what should we do?

13
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.220
&gt;&gt; Dave: Let's move it to the right.

14
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's get
it off the edge of the box.

15
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.850
&gt;&gt; Dave: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,

16
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.450
let's get it off the edge of the box here.

17
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.778
So on my div property let's go ahead and

18
00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:51.333
say padding left one RAM.

19
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:55.485
Now I have a question for you.

20
00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.702
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you look at these boxes,
right, we just put padding on the left,

21
00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:03.060
and it moved off the left border.

22
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.898
But it already looks like we
have some space associated

23
00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:11.500
with the inside of the box on the top and
the bottom.

24
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.090
Anyone notice that?

25
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.869
See, my border isn't smashed up against
my text on all four sides, right?

26
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.650
It's only smashed up against
it on the left side.

27
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.506
And if my window was a little smaller,

28
00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:25.815
we could smash it up against
the right side too, right, like that.

29
00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:30.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sense, okay?

30
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.760
But I'm trying to catch my browser,
there we go.

31
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.960
But we don't, we actually have a little
bit of space here on the top and

32
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.980
the bottom.

33
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.210
Where is that coming from?

34
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.846
Anyone want to take a guess?

35
00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:44.490
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student2: Margin.

36
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is it margin and
if it's margin, margin from what?

37
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.800
&gt;&gt; Student2: Okay, so
it's more like the padding.

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It could be padding.

39
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.220
Where's it coming from?

40
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.300
&gt;&gt; Student3: The browser, the default.

41
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.084
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The browser
default is putting in what?

42
00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:03.079
&gt;&gt; Student3: CSS.

43
00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, it's definitely CSS.

44
00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.370
Yeah, Ryan.
&gt;&gt; Ryan: The divisions.

45
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The division is doing this,
the div tag?

46
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.330
Not the div tag.

47
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.960
&gt;&gt; Student2: P tag.

48
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's the p tag.

49
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.890
And how do we know that?

50
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.250
Okay, well,

51
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.859
let's talk about how we can go about
diagnosing these problems and issues.

52
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.137
We put in a p tag and we put in a border,

53
00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:33.730
one pixels, 2 pixels solid green.

54
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.990
That's gonna put a line
right around our paragraph.

55
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.437
This is really useful.

56
00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:44.762
Using borders are really useful
way to help diagnose problems and

57
00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:48.370
issues you might be having
inside of your code, okay?

58
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.140
So if we put a green border
around all of our paragraphs,

59
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.320
you see how tight the paragraph is around,
right?

60
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.710
There's no padding on the paragraph,
but there's clearly some space

61
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.810
between the outside of the border and
our div tag here, right?

62
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.260
So that must be what?

63
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.420
A div tag has no padding or
border or margin on it.

64
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.910
This space must be what?

65
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.260
Margin from our paragraph, okay?

66
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.023
And where is that coming from?

67
00:03:22.023 --> 00:03:22.917
&gt;&gt; Ryan: Not from the browser.

68
00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:24.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's
coming from the browser.

69
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.095
Because otherwise by default,

70
00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:30.117
all of our paragraphs would be all
smushed together on top of each other.

71
00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:34.905
If we looked at a web page with, quote, no
styling, right, like the ugly web pages we

72
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:40.190
made on HTML day All of our paragraphs
will be all stacked on top of each other.

73
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.550
So the browser's putting in a little
bit of margin on the top and

74
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.240
the bottom of your paragraph
to space your paragraphs out.

75
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.480
If you quote, don't apply styling,
which really means you don't apply your

76
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.680
own styling, there's just browser
styling in place, make sense?

77
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.140
So and you can also see here that
we pushed our paragraphs in,

78
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.070
you can see that there's a space
over there on the right hand side,

79
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.790
between our paragraph and our div.

80
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.190
But not, sorry, on the left hand side,
but not on the right hand side.

81
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.390
See how the paragraph goes all the way
up to the edge here of the div,

82
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.120
on the right hand side.

83
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.090
Because we didn't set a right margin.

84
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.148
Make sense?

85
00:04:20.997 --> 00:04:23.765
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or right padding,
where did I do that.

86
00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:29.782
Padding-left, see, so in here on the div,
I have a padding-left of one rim but

87
00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:33.260
I don't have a padding-right, make sense?

88
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.017
So we can add that too, padding-right.

89
00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:47.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
now both of those are off the edge, yeah?

90
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.650
&gt;&gt; Student2: Can you use
text orient center in

91
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.950
a p tag to-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can.

92
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.970
&gt;&gt; Student2: I mean,
to do the same thing as the padding,

93
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.920
or
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, well,

94
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.020
it doesn't actually do the same thing-
&gt;&gt; Student2: I'm sorry, the margin.

95
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Student2: Centered in the green border.

96
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
what did you wanna do here?

97
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.100
You wanna do a margin left?

98
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.542
&gt;&gt; Student2: Yeah, do you have to do
margin left so you can kinda center it in

99
00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:19.980
that box or would you use a different
one to center the text in the box?

100
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.874
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we could do it this way,
margin left and a margin right, okay?

101
00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:30.960
So now what is the space now
to the left of the paragraph.

102
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.010
The total space to
the left of the paragraph.

103
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.420
So, our paragraph has one
rim of margin on the left.

104
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.260
And we have in our div we have
one RAM of padding on the left.

105
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.110
So, the total space on the left
side is two RAMs, right?

106
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.934
Did you see it twitch when I
put in the additional styling?

107
00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:03.398
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I just lost you.

108
00:06:03.398 --> 00:06:09.494
[LAUGH]
