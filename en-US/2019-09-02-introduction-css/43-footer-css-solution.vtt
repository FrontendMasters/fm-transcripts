1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we have lots of
different ways to code this particular

2
00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:04.210
solution.

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.922
But so I wanted to go through
how I coded my solution.

4
00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:12.565
And you can see my solution,
it's in the end folder.

5
00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:16.682
So if you look in blog-end you'll
see what I did for a solution.

6
00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:20.107
Doesn't mean that your solution is
wrong because there's always a lot of

7
00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:21.610
different ways to code things.

8
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.988
And so mine is just a suggestion.

9
00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:31.471
If yours looks like the design that we
had here, then we're good, all right.

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:37.117
So here we are, I am in blog-begin.

11
00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:41.765
And let me get my space set up here.

12
00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.307
I've got the HTML open.

13
00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:49.080
I'm gonna go ahead and
open up the CSS as well.

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.655
Everybody's wrapping around.

15
00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:55.876
Make sure that's all good.

16
00:00:55.876 --> 00:01:02.755
Okay, and,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let

17
00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.825
me also open up the picture here.

18
00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:10.897
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
so let's go ahead and

19
00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:15.614
let's kind of work from the bottom up,
just for fun, okay.

20
00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:20.384
So if we start down here at the bottom
of the page, we have these icons that

21
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:25.254
are all next to each other along with
this legal disclaimer type of thing.

22
00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:30.821
And if we take a look at our HTML,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Scroll

23
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:33.035
all the way down there to the bottom.

24
00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:38.010
So what we've got here going on is we've
got a pretty much a social media bar.

25
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.758
So these all would all link to the alien
websites if we actually had websites to

26
00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:46.190
link to, and you can see that
they have images in there,

27
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.768
they all have their alt tags and so forth.

28
00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:54.283
So we needed to code this up as
some kind of navigation bar.

29
00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:58.378
Pretty simply, I'm gonna scroll
on down here to the bottom.

30
00:01:58.378 --> 00:02:01.833
The other thing that that you might have
noticed here is I've put in a few of

31
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.242
these additional HTML tags.

32
00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:07.536
I didn't have a lot of time to talk about
them today., but the footer tag is pretty

33
00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:11.727
much what you would expect it to be,
it's typically the footer of the web page.

34
00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:15.266
And it often contains things like
disclaimers and copyright and

35
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.280
privacy notices and sales and
social media links, and

36
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.310
all the usual stuff you've
come to expect in a footer.

37
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.177
And so that tag happens to
be a bit more semantic and

38
00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:27.865
describes the function of that
particular part of the web page,

39
00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:31.503
using the footer tag as opposed
to using just a generic div tag.

40
00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:35.053
Diff means nothing,
you're not communicating anything.

41
00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:38.968
Footer is a way better choice if that
is in fact what you're building.

42
00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:41.873
If that's what you're building,
call it a footer, okay.

43
00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:46.856
So far to start it we just had the text
aligned in the center and we had a font

44
00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:52.195
size that was set, but we didn't have
any other styling that was added here.

45
00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:56.118
And so what we need to do first
of all is let's go in ahead and

46
00:02:56.118 --> 00:03:01.913
code up,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our particular nav bar.

47
00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:07.391
So as always the very
first thing that we wanna

48
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:12.290
do is turn off our margin, our padding,

49
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.628
and set our list style type to none.

50
00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:19.461
Okay, so
that's gonna turn off the bullets.

51
00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:22.502
And that little formula there,
you can use that anywhere.

52
00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.834
And it's so incredibly helpful because
this is the way you're gonna start pretty

53
00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.978
much any kind of navigation of any kind.

54
00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:32.739
You gotta turn off the bullets, turn off
the padding, turn off the margin, and

55
00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.326
then you're set and ready to go.

56
00:03:34.326 --> 00:03:37.989
And then we're gonna say footer li.

57
00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:46.451
All we need to do is say
display: inline-block, okay.

58
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.412
So if we do that little,
all we did was turn off the bullets,

59
00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:52.270
turn off the margin of the padding,
and display inline.

60
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.226
That would be adequate to going ahead and
make this nav bar look like a nav bar.

61
00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:05.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Go on ahead and
load this up.

62
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.207
And you'll notice that the load time on
this page is a little bit longer than

63
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:09.749
the ones we've been working with.

64
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.898
We actually have some fonts that
are coming from the web in use on this

65
00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:13.403
web page.

66
00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:19.324
I'm gonna talk about how to
do that magic later tomorrow.

67
00:04:19.324 --> 00:04:21.922
But there's our footer, so there we go.

68
00:04:21.922 --> 00:04:27.221
We've got our navigation down there and
it's going horizontally on the page.

69
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.724
Some of you did this with Flexbox,
that's totally legit as well.

70
00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:34.027
You may have slightly different
spacing in between the links.

71
00:04:34.027 --> 00:04:37.888
Emma Weaver here was doing Flexbox
using that on the bottom, and

72
00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:40.903
she had a little bit more
space between the icons.

73
00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:45.142
We could argue that that's actually better
because then with our fat fingers as

74
00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:49.445
we're clicking on those things we're not
going to run into the other icon having

75
00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:51.551
a little bit more space between those.

76
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.703
But that's a design thing, okay.

77
00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:56.939
So that's that.

78
00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.803
The next thing that was causing people
a lot of problems were the double

79
00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:05.607
lines down here that are two
different colors, okay.

80
00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:08.722
The lines that are two different colors.

81
00:05:08.722 --> 00:05:11.558
And so how do we go about doing that?

82
00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:17.089
Lines on web pages often
come from borders, okay.

83
00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.291
So the horizontal rule is definitely
a thing, but if you're using a horizontal

84
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:25.761
rule just to make a line to make something
pretty you're actually misusing the tag.

85
00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:27.908
Remember HTML is all about markup.

86
00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:33.220
It's all about the various tags on the on
the page and what you're trying to convey.

87
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.948
As opposed to these pretty CSS borders
which are literally about making

88
00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:39.058
things pretty.

89
00:05:39.058 --> 00:05:43.524
So what we wanna do is we need to
have a border that's one color and

90
00:05:43.524 --> 00:05:45.855
a border that's another color.

91
00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:48.741
Wouldn't it be nice if
we just used two boxes,

92
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:52.663
we could make the top of the footer,
have a border of one color,

93
00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:57.473
and then we can take the bottom of the
section which is the tag just above here,

94
00:05:57.473 --> 00:06:01.928
we can make the bottom of the section
have a border of a different color.

95
00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:07.132
So the way we set that up,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Get my page back.

96
00:06:13.293 --> 00:06:16.447
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is actually
where it is to get my color.

97
00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:21.658
So here on the footer what we're gonna do

98
00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:28.557
is we're gonna add a border-top
of one pixel solid,

99
00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:33.936
and the color that I used was A61F11.

100
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:41.718
I think I've probably used it somewhere
else in the document, A61F11, there we go.

101
00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:47.773
So that's the more of the reddish color.

102
00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:54.329
And then we can put in
a section before that section,

103
00:06:54.329 --> 00:07:02.077
we're gonna do border-bottom:
1px solid #da0090,

104
00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:05.952
which gives me the pink color.

105
00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:09.271
If your colors where slightly different,
that's totally fine,

106
00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:11.178
we're not gonna pick on you for that.

107
00:07:11.178 --> 00:07:13.841
But these were the colors
that I used here.

108
00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:18.198
And if you go on ahead and
save that and refresh the page,

109
00:07:18.198 --> 00:07:22.280
those are actually two
borders right there, okay,

110
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.828
those are actually two
borders right there.

111
00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:30.246
They're on top of each other, boom,
right on top of each other like this.

112
00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:33.385
Okay, so what do we need to do
to separate the two borders?

113
00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:34.337
Anybody?

114
00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:36.069
&gt;&gt; Class: Margin.

115
00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:38.416
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We need a little
margin in order to separate these.

116
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:42.933
So we can either put a top margin on the
footer or a bottom margin on the section,

117
00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:46.711
doesn't really matter in this
particular case which one you do.

118
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:52.638
So what I did was I put
a bottom border on the section.

119
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.928
Sorry, a bottom margin, so

120
00:07:55.928 --> 00:08:00.868
margin-bottom is going to be 0.3 RIM.

121
00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:02.458
That was my magic number,

122
00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:07.023
your magic number might be something
slightly different, that's cool.

123
00:08:07.023 --> 00:08:10.409
We're not gonna pick up
on you about that either.

124
00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:17.901
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So there's our two borders,
kinda close together but different colors.

125
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:19.101
Any questions on that?

126
00:08:21.798 --> 00:08:25.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so that's kind of
a cool trick that you can whip out and

127
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.234
use on other web pages in the future.
