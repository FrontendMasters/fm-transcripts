WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.544
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Moving on,
we got the nav bar.

2
00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:05.897
So I did my nav bar with inline block.

3
00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:11.911
And I'm just gonna go ahead and
insert these styles right here.

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.298
So we have a nav.

5
00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:17.693
And this is where we're
gonna put our borders.

6
00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:22.728
So on that original picture
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We

7
00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:26.127
have once again a border on the top and
a border on the bottom.

8
00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:28.379
And they're those two
different colours again.

9
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.591
All right, so
what we've got going on there,

10
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:36.374
is we can just use nav
to do those borders.

11
00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:41.382
So border hyphen bottom will be

12
00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:46.390
one pixel solid E61F11 and

13
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.206
border hyphen top would be one

14
00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:56.606
pixel solid DA0090, okay.

15
00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:03.318
So that's gonna to give us our lovely
borders on the top and the bottom.

16
00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:04.461
Right.

17
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:09.909
Okay then

18
00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.677
NAB UL.

19
00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:16.302
What am I gonna do here?

20
00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:21.497
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're gonna
take out the bullets.

21
00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:22.573
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Take out the bullets.

22
00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:28.407
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: By doing text or
link style, list style.

23
00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:32.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: List display style type.

24
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.470
List, display, style.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: List, style, type.

25
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.973
That one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Good, none.

26
00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:35.922
Two other things.

27
00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:36.914
What else do I do?

28
00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.059
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Margin.

29
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Margin zero.

30
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.388
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And padding zero.

31
00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:44.841
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And padding zero.

32
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:51.918
Just like any other nav bar, you're
gonna do this every single time, okay.

33
00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:57.170
Then from my nav li,
what am I gonna do here?

34
00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:01.204
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Display.

35
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:05.517
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display inline block,
right?

36
00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:09.013
If you did this with Flexbox,
it's totally fine.

37
00:02:09.013 --> 00:02:13.253
You'll have different answers here,
but I did mine with inline block,

38
00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:16.116
sounds like most people here did as well,
okay?

39
00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:20.969
And then we can,
let's just see what we've got so far,

40
00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.183
we save that and look at our web page.

41
00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:25.901
So that's gonna give us our links and

42
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:28.402
they're all smushed together
on the left hand side.

43
00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:31.749
So what do we need to do
to make that prettier?

44
00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Text align?

45
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.932
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We needed
to somehow center it right?

46
00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:38.522
And what else?

47
00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:45.816
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Maybe a nice little
bit of spacing somehow, okay.

48
00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:48.648
So what we're gonna do than is nav a.

49
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:55.454
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
I said text decoration, none.

50
00:02:55.454 --> 00:03:00.607
So turn off the underlines under the link
will have a color for those links.

51
00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:06.948
And that happened to be 73352E.

52
00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:13.198
If I'm reading that right, display block.

53
00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:18.595
So that's going to expand those links, to
occupy the full area, occupied by the li.

54
00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:24.416
And we'll put on some padding on these,
0.5rem.

55
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:25.590
1rem.

56
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.449
So remember that's gonna
be 0.5rem is where?

57
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.796
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: When I put in, it's gonna
be on the top and and the bottom right?

58
00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:39.256
And whereas 1rem gonna be?

59
00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:41.167
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: On the left and right.

60
00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.473
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On the left and the right.

61
00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:50.134
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so if we look
at the page now, there's our links.

62
00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:53.584
They're still kind of smooshed
on over here to the side.

63
00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:58.163
So, I forgot something on the UL,
and that would be?

64
00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:00.570
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Text, align center.

65
00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.106
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Very good.

66
00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:08.735
All right, so now those should
be aligned nicely in the center.

67
00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:13.592
And then I also added a hover state
because right now the hover state

68
00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.853
turns the underlying back on.

69
00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:18.921
That's kind of the way
it is at the moment.

70
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:23.681
So what I did was I had a nav a hover.

71
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.987
That wasn't actually in
the the screenshot that I gave you.

72
00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:30.004
But here it is.

73
00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:33.938
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so
I made the background

74
00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:36.994
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Color, black.

75
00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:44.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I made the color,

76
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.041
I think it's green b,

77
00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:54.358
or 84, 84de37.

78
00:04:54.358 --> 00:05:00.831
And if we refresh the page, now I've got
this cool sort of hover state going on.

79
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:04.808
And apparently I need to turn off
the text decorate, text decoration.

80
00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:06.726
Yeah text decoration none.

81
00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:09.345
Turn it off here to text.

82
00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:13.461
Decoration none.

83
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:18.243
So there

84
00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:22.343
we go.
