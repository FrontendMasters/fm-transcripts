00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.277
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So I also talked about,
the flex item, which is the flex item,

2
00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:06.963
is that the period or is that the child?

3
00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:07.814
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Child.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Child,

4
00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:09.392
that's the child, right?

5
00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:11.643
The flex items are the children.

6
00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:15.651
So, this is something that
you'll want to pay attention to.

7
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:19.529
So right now we have all of
these boxes here on this page.

8
00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.870
And you'll notice that they're as big as
their content, and they look kinda messy,

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.604
don't they?

10
00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:26.878
They look messy because
they're all different sizes.

11
00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:30.998
Wouldn't it look nicer if
these were all the same size?

12
00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:34.266
That would be way better,
it would look way prettier.

13
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:40.636
So, there's a way that we can do that, but
we're not gonna use the width property.

14
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:45.400
So width property is basically
what the width property says is,

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.929
make it this wide all the time, if it's
25% wide, it's 25% wide no matter what,

16
00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.954
it's never 24.9, it's never 25.1,
is always 25%, makes sense?

17
00:00:57.954 --> 00:01:03.586
We have a different property we use
in flexbox, it's called flex-basis,

18
00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:07.467
and flex-basis is responsible for
the width here.

19
00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.592
And it means?

20
00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:15.039
Make it 25%, sort of.

21
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.717
Or make it some other percent, sort of.

22
00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:22.939
In other words, hey, flexbox,
if you're trying to fit these

23
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.158
boxes onto the line, and
it has to be a little more than 25%,

24
00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:33.102
or a little less than 25%,
that's cool, makes sense?

25
00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:35.725
So we have, how many boxes?

26
00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:37.104
I have seven boxes.

27
00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:41.679
So, how wide should we
set our flex-basis here?

28
00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.811
Let's try setting this to 10%,
how about that?

29
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:53.147
So, on our li we'll set
our flex-basis to 10%.

30
00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:57.359
And so now we have boxes that
are all the same size, see that?

31
00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.359
And they have beautiful spacing, it's so

32
00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.660
much less messy than what we had before,
isn't it?

33
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.995
That's just great.

34
00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:09.766
And it works beautifully well right
here on the page while it's big.

35
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:13.988
What happens is, we start to shrink it up.

36
00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:17.311
So your browser is madly doing math, and

37
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:21.037
changing the size of these boxes,
see that?

38
00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:24.481
Trying to keep them all roughly 10%,

39
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:29.050
and at some point that's gonna fail,
poor browser.

40
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.651
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: At some point
that will all blow up.

41
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:37.118
Okay, so see here?

42
00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:42.253
I think one might be starting to get
a little narrower than some of the others,

43
00:02:42.253 --> 00:02:44.623
can you see how that's happening?

44
00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:48.078
Maybe one's a little bit
narrower than some of the others.

45
00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:51.066
Blog looks a little narrower,
shop looks a little narrower,

46
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.563
contact looks a little wider.

47
00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:53.590
What's going on here?

48
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.002
Why did the browser choose to make about
and contact, boxes 6 and 7, wider?

49
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:04.268
And box number 4 and
5 are narrower, why is that?

50
00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:05.171
Yeah?

51
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.303
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The length of the text?

52
00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:09.272
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The length of the text,
that's what it is,

53
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.292
it's the length of the text.

54
00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:15.076
So some of these words are gonna
define the maximum width,

55
00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:17.172
or the minimum width of the box.

56
00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:19.809
It can't be any narrower
than the longest word.

57
00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:24.623
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cuz,
it's not gonna wrap that longest word.

58
00:03:24.623 --> 00:03:26.877
Makes sense?

59
00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:31.576
So this is what I mean about it
being kinda, [LAUGH] kinda 10%,

60
00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:35.856
because, clearly not all of
those boxes are 10% wide.

61
00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:37.724
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 10% of what?

62
00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:41.794
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 10% of the width of
the parent element, the flex container.

63
00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:43.313
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The parent element,
not of the screen.

64
00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:44.513
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not of the screen.

65
00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:47.312
But it happens to be,
that in our situation,

66
00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:50.195
the flex container is
the width of the screen.

67
00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because
a &lt;ul&gt; is a block element.

68
00:03:52.157 --> 00:03:57.215
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly,
that's totally right, yeah.

69
00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:01.100
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,

70
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.447
does this help with flexbox?

71
00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:06.441
And that's as far as I'm gonna go.

72
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:07.058
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One more question.

73
00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:07.767
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,

74
00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:11.555
is this flex-basis thing, as opposed to
using with, basically the reason you would

75
00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:14.290
want to use a flexbox,
cuz everything else that we've done,

76
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.594
you could just do with margin and padding
You could do with margin and padding.

77
00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:22.262
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is gonna solve
a bunch of problems for you,

78
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.141
the whole flexbox kind of thing.

79
00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:26.468
One of the things that it does is,

80
00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:30.387
notice that all of my boxes
are exactly the same height.

81
00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:34.329
If you try the same experiment, say,
using floats, or inline-block, or

82
00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:38.404
something like that, you're gonna wind
up with boxes of different heights.

83
00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:43.302
So boxes of the same height is a really
compelling reason to use flexbox,

84
00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:47.172
that's one of the big,
big advantages that it has here.

85
00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:51.503
There's also gonna be some advantages
once we get a little further onto

86
00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:55.771
responsive design, that is also
something that's very important.

87
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:56.284
Yes, Jenna.

88
00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:59.685
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
do you use this with responsive design?

89
00:04:59.685 --> 00:05:03.809
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You will use this with
responsive design, correct, correct.

90
00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.146
And hopefully we'll get
to that this weekend.

91
00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:11.199
So this is just a tiny little
bit of flexbox file this away,

92
00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.772
you're gonna need this for
your next assignment.

93
00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:17.692
Go ahead and, let's see.

94
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.282
So I think that's pretty much
everything I wanted to cover here.

95
00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:25.880
That's the tiniest little bit
of flexbox that you'll ever get,

96
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.454
[LAUGH] a tiny, little dollop of flexbox.

97
00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.810
We've covered floats,
we've covered inline-block,

98
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.995
we talked a lot about the box model,
not quite everything but a lot of it.
