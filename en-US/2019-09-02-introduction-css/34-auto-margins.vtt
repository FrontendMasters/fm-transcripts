00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.893
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
let's do something else while we're here.

2
00:00:03.893 --> 00:00:12.656
I'm gonna go ahead and add to my article,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: An article style.

3
00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:17.490
And this is a common technique
that you can use on websites.

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.390
Maybe you don't want your article to
stretch all the way across the page here.

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.755
Okay, those people who out there who have
worked in the print industry before,

6
00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.967
really, really hate the long
lines that we get on the web.

7
00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:34.209
Books are the size that they are because
our vision is only so wide right?

8
00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:37.307
It's actually really hard to
read things that are this wide,

9
00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.275
because you get to the end of the line and

10
00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:43.110
you have to work really hard to go back
to the next line to keep reading right?

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.789
So sometimes it's better to have
a narrower webpage to keep your reading

12
00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.308
a little bit more efficient.

13
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:54.317
So let's say that I wanna reduce
the width of my article overall, right?

14
00:00:54.317 --> 00:01:00.692
Let's make this width, say,
something like 25 rem, okay.

15
00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:04.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just to
see how that's working.

16
00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:14.767
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I'll put a border on
this too so we can see what we're doing,

17
00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:18.159
border 3 pixels solid red, okay.

18
00:01:20.032 --> 00:01:24.321
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what suggestions do
we have to center this whole thing on

19
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.113
the page?

20
00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:25.727
Yeah.

21
00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:26.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could we use text-align?

22
00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:30.497
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could try text-align,
what should we put it on?

23
00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:31.849
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Article.

24
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.181
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On the article itself.

25
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:38.151
Okay, so if we said

26
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:43.372
text-align:center.

27
00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:46.975
Okay, so that's centered all
the text inside of our article.

28
00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:50.097
But it didn't send her
the box on the page did it?

29
00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:53.386
Okay, what's something else we could try?

30
00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:54.385
Yeah, Jenna.

31
00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:55.226
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Body.

32
00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put it on the body tag?

33
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.499
Okay body.

34
00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.124
You want to do text align center here.

35
00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.661
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Only guess I got.

36
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.842
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

37
00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:12.516
Well that also aligned the text in
the article, but not the box itself.

38
00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:13.498
Okay?

39
00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:17.718
So that's not going to work either.

40
00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:20.375
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Something
like block center or

41
00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:21.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's something

42
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.052
funky going on there right?

43
00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:23.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can't work with text anyway,
I know that.

44
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.794
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
it's not gonna work with the text.

45
00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:27.186
Here's the trick.

46
00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:29.463
Margin, okay.

47
00:02:29.463 --> 00:02:34.977
It's gonna be a margin thing, and
we're gonna say the following,

48
00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:40.215
zero auto, and that will align
the box in the center on the page.

49
00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:42.853
So what does that mean, zero auto?

50
00:02:42.853 --> 00:02:44.490
We have two numbers here.

51
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.430
This is also part of shorthand.

52
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.255
So if we look at our shorthand,

53
00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:55.560
let's find the part with the two numbers.

54
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.395
Here we go.

55
00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:02.205
So when we have two numbers, as it says
here in your notes, one of the m's have

56
00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:07.316
padding to the top and the bottom and five
m's of padding to the left and the right.

57
00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:09.683
Okay?
So when there's two numbers, the top,

58
00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:11.908
the first number is gonna be the top and
bottom,

59
00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:14.034
the second number is gonna be left and
right.

60
00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:17.848
So what we have here our code
pen then is no padding or

61
00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:23.821
no margin in this case on the top and the
bottom and auto on the left and the right.

62
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:29.202
And what auto tells the browser is,
calculate how much extra space we have,

63
00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:33.083
divide it in two and
stick half on each side of this box.

64
00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:37.278
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
it would be centered on any device?

65
00:03:37.278 --> 00:03:38.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
it would be centered on any device.

66
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.304
See as I make the screen smaller,
it's staying centered,

67
00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:47.243
that's your browser doing math
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

68
00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:49.843
that is a very cool trick.

69
00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:53.844
And I know some of you really wanted
it yesterday for your book chapters.

70
00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:55.166
Okay?

71
00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.656
So that's how we can
center that on the page.
