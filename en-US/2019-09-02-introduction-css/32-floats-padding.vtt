1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so, so far today
we've talked a lot about the box model.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.540
I encourage you to take
a look at our web page,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.550
encourage you to take a look
at the website for the course.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.260
The frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp.

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.940
Make sure you take a look at that,
look at the layout page.

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.630
There's more information in there than
I've told you in class today just to try

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.980
to streamline our information.

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.750
Be sure you read through
all of that stuff.

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.900
Make sure you're asking questions online.

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.660
We started with the box model.

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.330
We looked at borders, padding,

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.480
margin, width and height, looked at a
whole lot of different ways of doing that.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.820
We've made our nav bars, gone a couple
of directions, vertical and horizontal.

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.070
We talked about display block,
inline, and inline block.

15
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.610
And now we're on to our next topic for
today, which is floats and clears.

16
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.930
This is probably one of the areas
where beginners get really,

17
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.810
really tripped up is with floats and
clears.

18
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.470
Fortunately, we're not using floats
the way we used to use them.

19
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.679
We used to use floats for
laying out whole web pages and

20
00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.320
you will still see that
done all over the Internet.

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.482
But fortunately as of 2018,
we have some great new tools for

22
00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:23.010
laying out web pages,
including flex box and grids.

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.562
We'll talk more about flex
box in our next unit.

24
00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:28.680
And grid is available,
it's out there online.

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.230
You can read about it, but for right
now we're gonna talk about floats and

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.620
images because this is where floats
were always intended to be used

27
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.400
in the context of images and web pages.

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.830
So a lot of you ran into this yesterday
while you were working with your book

29
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.150
chapters, you wanted to
put a picture in place.

30
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.770
And you wanted the text to wrap around it
really nicely like it was a magazine, or

31
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.200
a newspaper where you had an image
with text wrapping around it.

32
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.410
And that is what floats and
clears are all about.

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.794
So if you go on ahead into your notes,
there's a code pen here for you.

34
00:02:04.794 --> 00:02:06.870
Go ahead and open up that code pen.

35
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.450
This is exploring floats and clears, and
just for fun, we're now using place Cage.

36
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.350
We've been using place kitten.

37
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.770
This is Nicolas Cage, all right?

38
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.890
We have sane Nicolas Cage and
crazy Nicolas Cage here on our page.

39
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.140
And these are two images
inside of a bunch of text.

40
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.937
So we have some very simple HTML
going on here, if we look at that.

41
00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:35.472
Notice that I've used my article tag here,

42
00:02:35.472 --> 00:02:38.015
this is a whole article
about Nicolas Cage.

43
00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:42.936
Although it's in Latin, [LAUGH] says
My Wonderful Article is our H1.

44
00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:46.161
Then we have a paragraph,
we put an image inside of there and

45
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:47.849
then we talk about some stuff.

46
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.390
And then over here on the side,

47
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.420
I have another tag that I'm
introducing for you here.

48
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.110
This is the aside tag.

49
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.150
In the aside tag we have a block quote.

50
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.446
Remember block quote from yesterday.

51
00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:05.488
Here's a quote from a Nicolas Cage movie,
I'll be taking these Huggies and

52
00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:06.760
whatever cash you got.

53
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.160
Okay, he said this in
the raising Arizona movie.

54
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.660
What is the aside tag indicate?

55
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.013
Anybody have any idea what
the aside tag is for?

56
00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:23.456
What does it sound like, an aside tag?

57
00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:24.726
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, wait a minute,

58
00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:25.980
one at a time, Mohammed go ahead.

59
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Put it to the side.

60
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put it to the side,
thatâ€™s possible.

61
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.040
Dave?

62
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Put something
next to something else?

63
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Maybe put
something next to something else?

64
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.070
Possibly?

65
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.910
Although, all of that implies
the way something looks.

66
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.908
Remember that the aside tag is going to
refer to what are we trying to convey.

67
00:03:41.908 --> 00:03:44.111
And what we're trying
to convey here is that,

68
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.770
here's a little bit of information
that's extra about this webpage.

69
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.930
It's not to critical to the article,
if we were to take this out.

70
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.130
You could still read this article and
enjoy it.

71
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.130
But this is additional information
that might help you appreciate

72
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.480
the article a little bit more, right?

73
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.590
So that's what the aside tag is all about.

74
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.950
Frequently aside tags do in fact
appear as columns on webpages.

75
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.800
But we've gone ahead and
put it in here this way.

76
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.410
And then we go on down here we have
a final paragraph and I put an image

77
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.650
at the end of this paragraph down
here from the place cage website.

78
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.070
So our first trick of the day.

79
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.693
For this first image, what we wanna
do is we wanna get this text.

80
00:04:24.693 --> 00:04:28.010
Notice that the text starts
at the bottom of the image.

81
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.670
So the image is right here,
it's in the paragraph, and

82
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.970
the text starts right next to that.

83
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.590
So what does that tell you about images?

84
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.574
Are they block level or are they in line?

85
00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:42.078
How many say they're block level?

86
00:04:42.078 --> 00:04:44.440
How many say they're inline?

87
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.400
Right on, the inlines have it.

88
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.580
Why is it inline?

89
00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:50.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, Cassie.

90
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's on the same
line as the paragraphs.

91
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.922
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's on the same
line as the paragraphs.

92
00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:58.630
It's as wide as its content,
a picture is as big as a picture, right?

93
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.360
Yeah?

94
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can't you
make it a block element?.

95
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.280
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could
make it a block element?

96
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.730
Absolutely, we could use our trick that
we've used in the previous lesson.

97
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.300
Where we could say display block and

98
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.270
we can make our images take
up a larger amount of space.

99
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.774
But generally speaking,
images by default are inline elements.

100
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.600
And this is inside of our paragraph.

101
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.642
Images also, of course, have some
properties define that go with it, right?

102
00:05:27.642 --> 00:05:30.260
They have a width property and
they have a height, yeah?

103
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.380
Cuz that's how big the images,
it's that big, right?

104
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.180
So it's got a width and
height defined for it.

105
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.090
So here in our HTML, let's take a look
at our code for our first image.

106
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.100
All right, so
if I wanna style just this one image here,

107
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.820
not the other one, how am I gonna go about
doing that based on what you know now?

108
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Add a class.

109
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We need to have a class,
okay?

110
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.590
So I'm gonna call this class floatleft.

111
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.330
That's a class name you're gonna
encounter in a lot of webpages actually.

112
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.560
Floatleft, okay?

113
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.450
So I'm gonna make a class
called floatleft.

114
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.839
We're gonna put it in our HTML as well,

115
00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.570
class equals floatleft, okay?

116
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.465
So far nothing's happened.

117
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.979
And we're gonna add a property in here,
okay?

118
00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:30.939
Anyone wanna guess what we might put
in our floatleft property to make our

119
00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:33.475
image go to the left side of the page?

120
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.797
Cassie?

121
00:06:34.797 --> 00:06:35.899
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Float.

122
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.001
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Float.

123
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:38.540
What?

124
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.396
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Left.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about left?

125
00:06:41.396 --> 00:06:42.610
Great.

126
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.615
Hey, look, it worked.

127
00:06:43.615 --> 00:06:48.080
[LAUGH] Okay, floatleft.

128
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.580
So that's pretty much it.

129
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.410
All we have to do is say float left and

130
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.960
take a look at that our text
is now next to that image.

131
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.270
See how that is, okay?

132
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.240
Also look at our other image.

133
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.370
That's probably not where we
want that other image, is it?

134
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.930
Okay, let's not worry about
that other image at the moment.

135
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.480
So what should we call this
one cool looking Nicolas Cage.

136
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.130
Cool looking Nicolas Cage is right here.

137
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.440
He's floated to the left.

138
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.400
We have all of our texts smooshed
up against the side here.

139
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.410
If our window was a little bit smaller,

140
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.460
I'll just crunch down
my browser window here.

141
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.970
You'd see that the text would
eventually wrap around the bottom of

142
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.080
the image, see that?

143
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.890
Okay, so depending on the width of your
page or the width of your article and so

144
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.750
forth will depend on the behavior of
you text around that particular image.

145
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.460
Makes sense?

146
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.350
Okay, are people happy
with the way that looks?

147
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.354
No?

148
00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:54.970
What would you like to have?

149
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.800
Describe how that might look better.

150
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.100
Jana?

151
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I personally
did float right and

152
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.600
then there's a space between the right.

153
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.771
The paragraph writing and
the picture just done for you, otherwise,

154
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:18.120
in this example, I would wanna put,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Padding on the paragraph.

155
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.510
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We need to put something to
get some space in between the picture and

156
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.860
the text, right?

157
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.700
Smashing text right up against
the picture is kind of a fashion.

158
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.970
No, we don't wanna do that.

159
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.410
Okay, how could we figure this out?

160
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:32.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Try this.

161
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.551
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here's how
you figure this out, okay?

162
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:41.260
Right here, I'm just gonna do this
right in the same class for the moment.

163
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.383
I'm gonna put on a border.

164
00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:51.113
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, we're gonna put
a border on my image, all right?

165
00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:55.270
Now that you know where the border is,
now you can take a guess.

166
00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:01.869
So if I say padding one rim,
see where the padding goes?.

167
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.500
Is that what we want?

168
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.452
No, so if I switch it to margin,

169
00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:13.825
[SOUND] is that better?

170
00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:17.500
Yeah, so now you can just
turn off your border here.
