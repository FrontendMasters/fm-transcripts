00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So to get started writing
CSS, the first thing we need to do is make

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.900
a CSS document,
we need to make a folder for that.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.305
So let's go into the day2 folder.

4
00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And let's go on ahead and
make a new folder right here.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.283
And I'm gonna call it CSS,
because it contains CSS.

6
00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:25.419
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then once we have that folder in place,

7
00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.530
you'll see it here in VS Code.

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.810
And now we can go ahead and
make our CSS file.

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.112
So go on ahead and say, File, New File.

10
00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:39.498
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we'll immediately
go ahead and save this, so, File, Save.

11
00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:47.582
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'm gonna put that in my CSS folder,

12
00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:51.662
and we'll call that style.css.

13
00:00:56.076 --> 00:01:00.093
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, this is your basic
style sheet, you've made your first one,

14
00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:05.160
and we can put a little comment on the top
here to tell us this is a style sheet.

15
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.990
Commenting in CSS is a little
different than comments in HTML.

16
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.776
So, the comments in CSS looks like this,
it is a / followed by a *,

17
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:20.929
and you can say, my first css
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

18
00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.760
then you're gonna end it with a */.

19
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.930
So that's just the comment.

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.718
Once again, comments, remember,
are little notes to yourself,

21
00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:33.414
they're gonna show up anywhere for
anybody to see,

22
00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:38.877
anywhere on any web page, but, people
can view your CSS online, so be nice.

23
00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:41.200
Cuz they can read those comments.

24
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.520
So, now we have an HTML file,
we have a CSS file, that's great.

25
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.970
Do you think they're
talking to each other?

26
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not yet.

27
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not yet.

28
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.820
We just have two documents,

29
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.910
they're floating around out there
in space, never the two shall meet.

30
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.807
So we need to make sure that
the HTML is talking to our CSS.

31
00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:04.827
So the way we're gonna do that is,
we're gonna go back to our HTML, and

32
00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:09.320
in the head of our document, anywhere in
the head of the document, usually I put

33
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.770
mine right after the title, we're gonna
go ahead and link to our style sheet.

34
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.626
And, shockingly, we're gonna
learn a new tag to do this, and

35
00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:23.280
it's called the link tag, link, all right?

36
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.336
And we'll say, link href= and then quotes,

37
00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:32.040
we're gonna put in the path
to our CSS document.

38
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.390
And VS Code very happily goes ahead and
tries to help us with that.

39
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.556
So it is going to be in the CSS folder,
and it's gonna be style.css.

40
00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:49.530
The other thing that we need to add is
an attribute called rel="stylesheet".

41
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.270
The link tag can be used for
a whole bunch of different things in HTML,

42
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.070
sometimes it's used for a favicon.

43
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.480
Favicon is that little icon that shows
up in the tab of your browser window,

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.670
that little picture up there, or
some other things that it's used for,

45
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.010
that we establish what this link tag is
for, that's why we say rel="stylesheet".

46
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.537
And then you can just go ahead and
close that tag.

47
00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:17.438
This is another one of
those self closing tags,

48
00:03:17.438 --> 00:03:22.323
this does not require a slash
link in order to close the tag.

49
00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:25.197
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it matter
if rel comes before href?

50
00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.332
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nope.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because I used data

51
00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:27.739
combined, and then it did that.

52
00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's fine for
rel to come before href, great question.

53
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.470
In fact, in all cases in HTML,
it really doesn't matter what

54
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.920
order your attributes are in,
they can be in any order at all.

55
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.320
But I think you'll generally see
people write their CSS this way.

56
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.300
Usually the href comes first.

57
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.407
I think it's just like the whole
world just kind of agreed on,

58
00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:49.550
and that's the way they do it,
but you don't have to.

59
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.556
So now we have an HTML document,
it's linked to our style sheet,

60
00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:58.516
we're ready to write some CSS.

61
00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:02.423
Make sure you keep up with
saving your documents as you go.

62
00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:07.454
One of the cues that VS Code will
give you that the document isn't

63
00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:12.392
saved is this little circle icon up here,
you'll see that we go

64
00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:16.980
from an X when it's saved to
a circle when it's not saved.

65
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.298
If you ever see the circle,
make sure you save it.

66
00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:25.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And you'll have to
toggle over to your other document.

67
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.760
The other thing you can do here that
will make this kind of a little bit

68
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.160
easier to work with is the following.

69
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.540
I'm just gonna close my style.css
tab here, just for a moment.

70
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.815
And, if you hover over style.css
over there in that left bar, and

71
00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:48.100
right-click on Windows,
or Cmd+click on Mac,

72
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.990
you'll notice that we have an option
here called Open to the Side.

73
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.950
Go ahead and try that, and you'll see
that we have now these two documents

74
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.670
side by side, so
you can see both your HTML and your CSS.

75
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.320
And since we're not working with
the files anymore on the left,

76
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.110
just click that top left explorer button,
and that column will go away and

77
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.230
give you a little bit more room.

78
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.430
Always you can turn on the Word Wrap.

79
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.040
So I'm gonna turn on my Word Wrap,
Toggle Word Wrap.

80
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.100
And I'll do the same over here for my CSS.

81
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.472
Toggle Word Wrap.

82
00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:30.921
Now that we've got our whole work space
all set up, we're ready to go on ahead and

83
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:32.703
write some of our first styles.
