00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.377
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna try to cover Flexbox in about

2
00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:04.439
a half an hour or so,

3
00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:07.826
which obviously means I'm gonna
cover very little of Flexbox.

4
00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:11.615
[LAUGH] I do have a full course on
Flexbox here at Front End Masters.

5
00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:16.120
If you wanted to look that up on the Front
End Masters website it covers Flexbox and

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.112
Grid, and these are two of the most
modern ways of laying out web pages.

7
00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:24.639
In the interest, though, of boot camp and
trying to keep things compact, and

8
00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:28.698
small, and easy, I'm just gonna
cover a tiny little bit of Flexbox.

9
00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:31.339
So in your notes, if you take a look here,

10
00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.281
about three quarters of
the way down the page,

11
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:39.274
we have the notes here about introducing
Flexbox and how this is going to work.

12
00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:43.542
And so this is a great way of
taking boxes on your web page, and

13
00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:49.236
we're going to be able to assemble them
into a series of boxes next to each other,

14
00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:52.200
and a series of rows going down your page.

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.585
This is actually the beginning
of responsive design.

16
00:00:55.585 --> 00:01:00.175
So, the way we're going to go
about doing this in that code pen,

17
00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:02.733
let me go ahead and fork my own copy.

18
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:08.897
So the way that Flexbox often gets
introduced is we use an unordered list.

19
00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:14.526
And the reason why is Flexbox is
all about parents and children.

20
00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:18.703
Okay?
Flexbox is all about parents and children.

21
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:23.911
Okay so if we look at our unordered list,
what is the parent here?

22
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.291
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The unordered list,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The unordered list,

23
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:27.035
the UL tag.

24
00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:28.578
And what are the children?

25
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.086
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
so the UL is the parent.

26
00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:34.395
The LI's are the children.

27
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:38.279
So there's another name that we use for
these in Flexbox,

28
00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.700
we call the parent,
we call it the flex container.

29
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.666
And we call the children the flex items.

30
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:49.480
Okay, so we have a flex container,
and we have individual flex items.

31
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.153
All right?

32
00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:53.646
And there has to be this
relationship of parent and child,

33
00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.865
they have to be together,
one right after the other.

34
00:01:56.865 --> 00:01:58.701
You can't separate these in space.

35
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.067
We can't have grandparents and
grandchildren in Flexbox.

36
00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:03.106
That doesn't work.

37
00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:08.424
They must be parents and children in
order for Flexbox to work, right?

38
00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:09.596
Tattoo that on your forehead.

39
00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.781
They gotta be parents and children.

40
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:16.281
We can't have any of that grandparent
thing going on, all right?

41
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:21.862
So here in your notes,
you've got some examples of Flexbox and

42
00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:25.036
how these things are going to work.

43
00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:28.704
And so you can follow along in here
with what I'm going to talk about.

44
00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:34.126
But the first thing that we'll do here is
let's go ahead and make a style for UL.

45
00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:36.755
And here in the style for you UL,
the very first thing let's do,

46
00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.692
let's turn off these bullets,
cause they're annoying, all right?

47
00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.938
How do we turn off bullets again?

48
00:02:40.938 --> 00:02:41.968
I forgot.

49
00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:45.321
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Text decoration.

50
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:46.776
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not text decoration.

51
00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:48.357
What?

52
00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:50.159
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Style or styles.

53
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.939
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: List style.

54
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.453
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Type.

55
00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:53.666
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Type.

56
00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:55.368
It's a joint effort.

57
00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:59.837
List, hyphen, style, hyphen,

58
00:02:59.837 --> 00:03:03.541
type is set to none, right?

59
00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:09.540
And we can go ahead and set our padding
to zero, and our margin to zero.

60
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.106
Great.

61
00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:15.212
So that's not Flexbox, that's just list.

62
00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:17.863
So now we have a list of
stuff with no bullets.

63
00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.862
Awesome.

64
00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:24.378
Okay, so the very first step in working
with Flexbox is to declare that

65
00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:26.382
we're working with Flexbox.

66
00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:27.047
Okay?
So, so

67
00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:29.730
far today we've seen
the display property in action.

68
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.940
We saw display block,
we saw display inline,

69
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.319
we saw display inline block, and
got really confused by that.

70
00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.007
Here comes your fourth one.

71
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:40.397
We're gonna say what?

72
00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:43.704
Display flex.

73
00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:48.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And just like that,
it goes horizontal.

74
00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.424
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's all we did.

75
00:03:51.424 --> 00:03:56.878
Display flex, and
immediately it's gonna go horizontal.

76
00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:01.382
So to keep track of what we're doing,
let's go to our LI and

77
00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:03.555
let's put a border on that.

78
00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:09.991
Border three pixels, solid blue, just so
we can see what we're doing here.

79
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:13.537
So we had our list items,
and now we see them.

80
00:04:13.537 --> 00:04:15.521
They're going horizontal on the page.
