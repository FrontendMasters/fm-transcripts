00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.857
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
what I would like for you to do now,

2
00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:07.877
is I would like you to
take like 15 minutes, and

3
00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:12.801
what I would like for you to do,
I would like for you to look at

4
00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:18.643
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: the web page here.

5
00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:22.647
At the common CSS properties and
values, I'd like you to go on ahead and

6
00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.598
just sort of glance through this.

7
00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See if there's something
in here that you'd like to try out,

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.000
changing colors of text, for example,
changing, turning on and off underlines.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.270
Just take a look at some of these
basic sort of CSS styling here.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.550
And I'd like you to go on ahead and
just continue styling your document.

11
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.490
Go on ahead and aim to write about
at least five or six styles.

12
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.620
Okay?

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.540
And those can be those HTML elements.

14
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.470
They can be classes that
are exceptions to the rule.

15
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.310
Go ahead and write a few of those and
get familiar with that.

16
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.370
Apply them in your HTML.

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.220
Take about 15 minutes to go on ahead and
do that and

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.570
make this page look prettier in some way,
alright?
