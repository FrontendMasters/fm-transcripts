00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:05.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Alright now ,height
in general in web pages is bad, bad,

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.930
bad, bad.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.360
This is one situation where height is good
because you have a background image and

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.990
you need to be able to see it.

5
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.570
But generally speaking, you don't wanna
set height on your boxes in your web page.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.480
Why would that be?

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.750
Yeah.

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt; off screen: Because there's
a whole bunch of different

9
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.260
media that people use
to get on the website.

10
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's one reason.

11
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.890
There's a whole bunch of media people
are using to get on the website.

12
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.600
There's a new device every day.

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.710
You have no idea if your height is
gonna work on all those devices, but

14
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.440
there's more.

15
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.520
What else?

16
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.610
&gt;&gt; off screen: I read somewhere
that you're only supposed to

17
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.340
really adjust the width.

18
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.
&gt;&gt; off screen: Because otherwise things

19
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.440
get too distorted.

20
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It can potentially
distort things, what else?

21
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.950
You never know what people
are going to do with their website.

22
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.410
These days, the way we're
building web pages right now,

23
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.950
this is great for learning.

24
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.940
But these kinds of web pages where
you're actually writing code and

25
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.010
posting it online, this is actually
something that's done less and

26
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.520
less these days in web development.

27
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.440
More and more you're using something like
a content management system like Jumla or

28
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.920
Wordpress or Drupal or you're working
with a site like Wicks or Squarespace.

29
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.490
And what do people do when they
have access to those things and

30
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.600
they can put content in?

31
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.570
They will put content in and
they will put more content in.

32
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.850
And they will put more and more content in
and eventually that content will get very,

33
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.970
very, very long.

34
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.670
So if you've set a beautiful height and
everything's all lined up and

35
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.580
it looks lovely,
inevitably someone will come along and

36
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.820
put in more text and
your whole design is gonna break.

37
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.860
So you want your design to be flexible and
robust, so that it can adjust

38
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.010
to whatever people do later in terms
of putting content in web pages.
