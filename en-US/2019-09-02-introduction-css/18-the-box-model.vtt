00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:05.331
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What we're gonna talk about
today we're gonna talk about box models,

2
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:07.930
we're gonna talk about
the display property.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.390
We're gonna talk about how to make your
navigation bar so that they go horizontal,

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.060
vertical, look pretty,
we're gonna talk about floats and

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.940
we're gonna talk about flex box.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.840
That is about five weeks of material
we're gonna cover, [LAUGH],

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.510
which is why we need to go
a little bit long today.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.340
And then I have a project for
you at the end of all this,

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.250
that's gonna combine everything that
I've talked to you about today.

10
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.680
And you'll be able to put that together
into one document it's gonna be a blog

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.980
website that you're gonna lay out,
sound good?

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.490
So that is the roadmap for today.

13
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.685
So we are gonna rely heavily
on our website here at

14
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:50.020
frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp be
sure to click on

15
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.250
the third link for layout and
we're gonna be working from this today.

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.574
And there's links in here, a lot of links
to CodePens that we're gonna work with

17
00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:05.993
rather than doing so much in the VS Code,
we're gonna do more with CodePen today.

18
00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:11.690
So let's go ahead and get started then,
we are taking a look at that website,

19
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.686
and the very first thing that I have
here for you is a diagram, okay,

20
00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:22.300
and this diagram is a diagram of
the so-called box model in CSS.

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.760
Every single HTML element anywhere
on your webpage has a box around it,

22
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.870
that's all your website is,
it's boxes and boxes and boxes and boxes.

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.340
And the boxes are everywhere and
you can never get away from them, okay?

24
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.450
There are no circles, there are no
triangles, there are only boxes in CSS

25
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.340
and every box around every
element has three properties,

26
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.280
that we're going to discuss
in great detail today, so

27
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.290
these three properties are the margin
the border and padding.

28
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.910
So border is the easy one, right?

29
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.500
We did a little bit of work with border
yesterday that puts the pretty line around

30
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.250
whatever it is that we're working with,
so that one's pretty straightforward.

31
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.915
Border can be put together in
a whole bunch of different ways,

32
00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:12.645
you can have just one border in
which case that would make what?

33
00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:15.899
If you only had a border on one side,
that would be a?

34
00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.121
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Line.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A line, [LAUGH] okay,

35
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:23.600
so you can put a border just on
one side and make a line with it.

36
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.930
You can put it on two sides and
make parallel lines maybe, yeah?

37
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.590
You can put it two going this way.

38
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.520
You can put it on three sides.

39
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.240
So we'll talk about all
the ways to do that.

40
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.720
There is the distance between
the actual content, whatever you have,

41
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.940
whether it's words or pictures,
the distance between that content and

42
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.170
the border is called padding,
okay, that's padding.

43
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.880
So if you don't want your border
smashed up against your picture,

44
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.680
you want a little breathing space.

45
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.490
You don't want your border
smashed up against your text,

46
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.250
you want a little breathing space.

47
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.260
You do that with padding and once again,
padding can be on one side, two sides,

48
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.350
all the sides,
we'll talk about how to do that too.

49
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.810
And then finally,
margin is the space between the border and

50
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.130
the rest of your web page,
so that's the space outside.

51
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.630
So some of you yesterday wanted to put
space, wanted to have one big box here and

52
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.180
I wanna have a space, and
I wanna have a box here.

53
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.620
Margin is gonna be responsible for that
space in between those boxes, all right?

54
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.030
So that's how we define margin,
padding, and border and

55
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.180
I will show you here on the webpage just
so that you have this for reference.

56
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.726
We've talked about all of these
properties here in great detail,

57
00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:46.110
you can scroll through all this
wonderful stuff about padding,

58
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.890
margin width, read about it in detail.

59
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.608
And so with that I'm gonna go ahead and
start with the CodePen,

60
00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:57.436
so back at the top of that,
there is a CodePen here,

61
00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:01.645
just above that graphic,
go ahead and click that link.

62
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:08.305
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
it doesn't open in a new window, so

63
00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:11.908
I'm gonna open mine in a new window,
okay, [COUGH] and

64
00:04:11.908 --> 00:04:16.090
it's a very simple little CodePen
that we have going on here.
