1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.253
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, next let's
go ahead and tackle this header.

2
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:07.715
This header through a lot of people but
this is the flexbox portion of this.

3
00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:10.487
This is where I would really
recommend using flexbox.

4
00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:15.421
So let's think about what's going on here.

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.102
And it's often helpful just to
look at your starting picture,

6
00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.707
my starting picture went.

7
00:00:20.707 --> 00:00:25.323
Look at your starting picture, and
describe what's going on here, okay?

8
00:00:25.323 --> 00:00:28.047
Sometimes it just helps
to say it out loud, okay?

9
00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:31.231
So I've got an image over
here on one side, and

10
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.753
I have two lines of text
over here on the other side.

11
00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.060
And they're right next to each other,
right?

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.754
That kind of looks like two boxes,
doesn't it?

13
00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:43.797
Two boxes side-by-side, on the same row.

14
00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:46.791
Doesn't it look that way?

15
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:48.949
Yeah, kinda looks that way.

16
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.094
So let's look at your HTML, and
sure enough look we have a box here for

17
00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:58.636
our leftheader, and
we have a box here for our rightheader.

18
00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:00.066
And where's their parent?

19
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.167
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The header
tag is their parent, right?

20
00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.954
So our header is the what?

21
00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:08.252
Flex what?

22
00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:13.066
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Container.

23
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.314
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex container,
I know it was a lot of terminology today.

24
00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:19.208
[LAUGH] Flex container.

25
00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:23.116
Okay, and the div inside of that,
the div with the class of leftheader, and

26
00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.147
the div with the class of rightheader.

27
00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:26.383
They are what?

28
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.636
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Items, flex items, okay?

29
00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.286
So there are the children.

30
00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:41.459
So what we need to do then is put
these two things side by side.

31
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:48.108
So what we're going to do,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is read about here.

32
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.855
We'll go ahead and we're gonna put in our
header, we know we're gonna style that.

33
00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:58.806
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're gonna need to put
in our usual flex properties here, right?

34
00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:03.477
So what are the properties we need
to put in to make this flexbox?

35
00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:04.688
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Display.

36
00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:05.651
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display.

37
00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:09.529
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's the value?

38
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.087
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex.

39
00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:12.374
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex, okay.

40
00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:15.598
What else do I need to put in?

41
00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:16.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex-flow.

42
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.243
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex-flow,
and my values here?

43
00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:23.074
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Row nowrap.

44
00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:27.213
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Row, nowrap, okay.

45
00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.358
Anything else?

46
00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:35.691
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right?

47
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.241
So let's just do that launch and
see what happens, if we save that.

48
00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:44.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Refresh the page,
there we go.

49
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.023
So we've got our picture, and we've
got our text, kinda next to it, right?

50
00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:54.596
So this is good,
we're making progress, okay?

51
00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:57.662
So what else we can do here?

52
00:02:57.662 --> 00:03:03.914
What I did,
was I said we'll have a justify

53
00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:08.962
if in content, space-between.

54
00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:14.685
So that's gonna give me a little
bit of space between the two boxes.

55
00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:19.247
Then in terms of the boxes themselves,
we can write some styles for that.

56
00:03:19.247 --> 00:03:24.826
Leftheader,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And rightheader.

57
00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and so what are we
gonna put in here for leftheader?

58
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.826
We probably want to flex basis, right?

59
00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:42.230
Flex-basis of 40%.

60
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.292
Why 40%?

61
00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:46.606
Cuz I played around with it and
tried a bunch of different values, and

62
00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.451
I thought this was prettiest, okay?

63
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:53.330
We can do the same thing here for

64
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.342
rightheader flex-basis of 60%.

65
00:04:00.983 --> 00:04:08.081
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
if we look at page now, all right?

66
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.634
So wow, hard to say what's going on here?

67
00:04:12.634 --> 00:04:15.095
Do we have any suggestions for debugging?

68
00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:22.753
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing to tattoo on
your forehead, stick a border on it, okay?

69
00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:24.320
Stick a border on it.

70
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.623
We don't know what's going on,
put a border on it, border.

71
00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:31.823
3px dotted green, and

72
00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:37.743
we're gonna put a border
on the right here,

73
00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:41.583
border, 3px dotted blue.

74
00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:51.933
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And once we do that we can
see much better what's going on, right?

75
00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:56.582
So my image is shoved all the way over
here on the left side of this box.

76
00:04:56.582 --> 00:04:58.522
Where should it really be?

77
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.634
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Center.

78
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:02.423
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.

79
00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:04.227
On the right side of this box.

80
00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:06.640
How can I get it to
the right side of the box?

81
00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:12.275
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anyone have a suggestion?

82
00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.632
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you said float, right?

83
00:05:14.632 --> 00:05:16.766
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Float, right, maybe?

84
00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:18.284
But there's an easier way.

85
00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:24.297
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's actually not the left,
I'm sorry I need to be on the left side.

86
00:05:24.297 --> 00:05:27.262
How about just text-align?

87
00:05:27.262 --> 00:05:31.945
Right, just plain old text-align, right.

88
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:39.036
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Much better.

89
00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:40.782
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
that works even though it's an image?

90
00:05:40.782 --> 00:05:43.597
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Even though it's an image,
yep, it's an in-line element.

91
00:05:43.597 --> 00:05:49.522
So it's very happily we'll screwed them
over to the right-hand side of that box.

92
00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:50.105
Yes, Jenna.

93
00:05:50.105 --> 00:05:53.003
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm just gonna say,
for me flow it, and

94
00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:57.029
then the right didn't work
at all was really nice line.

95
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.976
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, yeah,
cuz it is flex is a flex item and

96
00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:04.690
trying to mix a rear flex with your
floats and that it's just bad form.

97
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.147
Don't do that, don't do that.

98
00:06:07.147 --> 00:06:10.870
Okay, so then I had some padding
things that I put in again,

99
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.829
it was a lot of trial and
error on my part to see what look pretty.

100
00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:18.879
But around this sort of out,
I'm gonna take out my ugly border,

101
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.270
and I'll give you my other
values that worked for me.

102
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.223
For the leftheader,
I had a flex-basis, a text-align,

103
00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:34.784
and a padding- right of 0.5 rem,
okay, for the leftheader.

104
00:06:34.784 --> 00:06:38.712
And then for the rightheader, and

105
00:06:38.712 --> 00:06:43.743
I had the flex-basis of 60%
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

106
00:06:43.743 --> 00:06:49.039
I have the margin-top of 3.75 rem,

107
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:54.662
so that's gonna push it down from the top.

108
00:06:54.662 --> 00:07:02.215
And I had some padding on
the left of 0.5 rem, okay.

109
00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:08.901
And so what that did was it went ahead and
aligned this very nicely in the middle.

110
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:14.454
Although these font sizes needed to change
in order for this to completely work.

111
00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:16.666
So let me give you those styles as well.

112
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:20.979
I think I over-deleted
some of these styles.

113
00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.756
Rightheader, h1,
what I had going on here for

114
00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:29.345
the rightheader h1 was margin 0.

115
00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:31.894
That's part of the problem
that's going on here.

116
00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:35.584
Why do we have that huge
gap in between the Blog and

117
00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:38.110
My So-called Light Speed Life?

118
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.061
That's a margin that's coming from the h1
or the paragraphs by default, right?

119
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:46.062
So one of the things we need
to do in order to tighten up

120
00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:49.355
the space between those is
turn off that default margin.

121
00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:55.104
So we turn that off color of da0090

122
00:07:55.104 --> 00:08:00.501
which is that lovely shade of pink.

123
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:07.650
So that'll make the each one that
pink color, and a font-size of 3 rem.

124
00:08:11.654 --> 00:08:16.779
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's a good
start there, a little bit bigger.

125
00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.910
And then did I do anything paragraph,
I did.

126
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.803
I thought that gap was still
a little bit big here.

127
00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:27.457
So for the paragraph,

128
00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:33.611
what I did was I added a rightheader p,

129
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:38.418
and I said the margin on the top

130
00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:43.241
should be 0.5 rem, okay?

131
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.919
So that will tighten up that space just a
little bit and make it look much prettier

132
00:08:49.023 --> 00:08:51.699
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool?

133
00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:55.322
So sometimes it's flexbox,
sometimes it's default margins that

134
00:08:55.322 --> 00:08:58.305
come with it from the browser
that you have to get rid of,

135
00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:01.182
sometimes you gotta add your
own margin and padding.

136
00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.950
But it's all boxes, and boxes, and boxes.
