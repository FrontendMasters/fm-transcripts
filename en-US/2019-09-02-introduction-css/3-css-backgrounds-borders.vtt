WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
other things that we can do here for

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.350
our body of our web page.

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.820
Maybe we're kinda bored with the fact that
this is a white background with black

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.790
text, maybe we'd like to
have a different color,

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.850
and maybe we want a different background
color for our web page, sound good?

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.431
All right, so we can go ahead and
continue to add properties and

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:22.601
values here for the body tag.

8
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:25.709
So let's go ahead and
add one then for a background color,

9
00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:28.509
anyone wanna guess what
the property name might be?

10
00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Background color.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.075
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have a background color,
background-color.

12
00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.915
All right, so after that,
we can put in color names, and

13
00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:42.355
you can type in color names and
you'll get colors,

14
00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:47.640
they may not be the ones you want or the
ones you expect but you can type in names.

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.223
So we could type in a name like yellow.

16
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:56.557
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And it will probably pick
a really, ugly yellow for you, okay?

17
00:00:56.557 --> 00:01:00.352
So that's one way of doing it.

18
00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.587
That's a pretty bright yellow.

19
00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:05.924
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

20
00:01:07.743 --> 00:01:11.647
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you don't want to have
colors like that, there are other choices.

21
00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can go ahead and
type in color values for this.

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.370
And the way color values work on the web
is that they are six digits long.

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.420
A number that's in so called base 16.

24
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.970
Maybe you had this somewhere in school we
talked about base ten numbers, one, two,

25
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.390
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

26
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.048
In base 16, we count one,
two, three, four, five,

27
00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:42.239
six, seven, eight, nine, A, B, C, D, E, F.

28
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:47.476
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then we're at one followed by zero, okay?

29
00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:50.762
So that's the way this works,
it has to do with binary numbers, and

30
00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:53.890
that's all you need to know about it,
it's just kind of magic.

31
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.837
So the actual color number will
look something like this ffffcc.

32
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:05.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which is
a much nicer shade of yellow.

33
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.000
So this is actually a six digit number,
I know it looks like letters, but

34
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.530
it's out there, they're actually digits.

35
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.990
The first two stand for the value of red,
the second two stand for

36
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.680
the value of green, and the last two
stand for the value of blue, all right?

37
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.721
And that's how you form
a color on your web page, and

38
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:28.285
why I know that this is a lovely shade of
yellow is because I've been using it and

39
00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:29.960
teaching for years, okay?

40
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:35.626
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So to all those people
who are out there on the Internet,

41
00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:39.680
you're right, there are like five or six
other ways we can write color on the web.

42
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.390
We're gonna stick with these ones for
right now.

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.100
We'll probably come back to some of the
other ways, we can write color on the web,

44
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.290
maybe later on,
maybe we won't get to it in this course.

45
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.445
But these this way of writing
color in the six digit format,

46
00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:58.359
works everywhere, and it's a great
way to manage color, all right?

47
00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.300
So if you go ahead and save that, let's
take a look at our web page one more time.

48
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.020
Much better, not quite so glaring.

49
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.930
All right, so I'm gonna refer
back to our document for today.

50
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.290
Remember, this is at
frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp,

51
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.529
click on the link for CSS,
this is our reference document for today.

52
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.520
And we have tons of things that
we're gonna look at today.

53
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.730
I wanted to point out to you that
these are all listed in here, so

54
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.300
scroll on down to the CSS properties and
values section.

55
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.160
This is where you can start looking into
font families, font sizes, font styles,

56
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.470
all kinds of interesting things
that we can do with fonts for

57
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.540
the most part for today.

58
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.300
And some background colors, all right?

59
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.195
So that document is here for
you to refer to anywhere along the way,

60
00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:53.342
if you happen to get lost.

61
00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:58.565
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

62
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:05.353
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
anybody have any suggestions for

63
00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:08.402
what you'd like to style in this document?

64
00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.777
What would you like to change
in order to make it look better?

65
00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have any suggestions?

66
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.426
Yes?

67
00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.686
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A frame around
the picture of the cat.

68
00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:23.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A frame around
the picture of the cat.

69
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.439
All right, let's think about putting
a frame around the picture of a cat.

70
00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.690
That would be kind of fun, wouldn't it?

71
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.390
So we have that lovely kitty cat there.

72
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.656
Somehow, we need to select
the picture on the web page, okay?

73
00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:40.710
And then we can write the actual code
to make it do a frame around that.

74
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.300
So one way of doing that would be what?

75
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.283
First of all, we need to select the thing,
so what is the thing?

76
00:04:47.283 --> 00:04:53.440
What is the HTML that we can
call to select the thing?

77
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.273
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The image.

78
00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:56.247
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: img, right?

79
00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:59.449
This is the img tag, the image tag, so

80
00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.166
all we need to do is just go ahead and
put img.

81
00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:08.684
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now,
to put a frame around this,

82
00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:14.560
there's a property that's called border
that we can use to take advantage of this.

83
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.270
Border does a whole bunch
of different things.

84
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.369
But we can just write it this way, border.

85
00:05:22.193 --> 00:05:23.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What color
would you like your frame?

86
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Neon green.

87
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Neon green.

88
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.906
Okay, so neon green, so

89
00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:35.467
let's say it's a 10 px solid green border.

90
00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:39.435
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?
So that's going to put a 10

91
00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:44.358
pixel wide line on all four
sides of that particular image,

92
00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:48.112
solid and green,
which will be neon enough.

93
00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:52.712
[LAUGH] All right, and if you go ahead and

94
00:05:52.712 --> 00:05:57.155
save that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

95
00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:59.094
refresh the page, did you get it?

96
00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:02.228
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet.

97
00:06:04.272 --> 00:06:04.848
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

98
00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:08.056
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Other suggestions?

99
00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:08.630
Yeah?

100
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.096
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What about
creating a box around our header?

101
00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:12.438
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Create
a box around our header?

102
00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.120
Sure, how do you think we might do that?

103
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.334
Based on what you know.

104
00:06:18.276 --> 00:06:20.844
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Go ahead and tell me.

105
00:06:20.844 --> 00:06:24.113
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Would we be
able to select this here, and

106
00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:27.200
just use the same sort of border name.

107
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.314
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, we certainly could,
so what would we select?

108
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.984
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: h1.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: h1, exactly.

109
00:06:36.534 --> 00:06:39.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then what would we say here inside of h1?

110
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Border.

111
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.268
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Border, once again.

112
00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.200
And then, what do you think?

113
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Five pixels.

114
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.250
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Five pixels.

115
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.860
Okay, we have solid, that's an option.

116
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.850
We also have dotted,
that might be kind of fun.

117
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.450
What color would you like?

118
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Pink.

119
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.637
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pink.

120
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.788
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
go ahead and save that.

121
00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:10.363
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
let's look at the web page again.

122
00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:14.866
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna
change mine to red, just so

123
00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:16.592
that it projects a little bit better.

124
00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.939
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

125
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.750
It's kinda all about me,
your name in lights, isn't it?
