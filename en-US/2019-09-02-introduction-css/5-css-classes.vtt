00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.658
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the next question that
i had was something about exceptions

2
00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:08.098
to rules, okay?

3
00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:11.300
So, so far we've been writing
our CSS just like this,

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.790
we've been listing our HTML tags,
we've been writing

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.380
all of these declarations about how we
want each of these HTML tags to loolk.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.930
Which is great, but it affects every HTML
tag that has that particular styling

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.160
on the whole web page, right?

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.150
Which sometimes you don't want.

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.520
Sometimes you want exceptions to the rule.

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.020
So you can code an exception to the rule
using something called a class, okay?

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.860
Classes can be called anything you want,
although I

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.270
recommend that you call them something
that tends to be self documenting.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.200
So when you look at the name of the class
you kind of have a sense of what it

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.630
does, okay?

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.530
So, for example, let's say that I would

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.720
like to take this paragraph right
here with this picture of the kitten,

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.800
and let's just say that I want to style
that one paragraph somewhat differently

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.730
than all the other paragraphs on the page,
right?

19
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.250
Let's say that I want to make the font
bold, and maybe a little bit bigger.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.840
Sound good?

21
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.991
Okay, so maybe I'm going
to call this class bigbold.

22
00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just like that, all right?

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.650
What we've done here is we've started
the class name with a period, okay?

24
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.470
Classes start with periods.

25
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.820
So that's the name, bigbold,
and then we can go ahead and

26
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.000
type in our description here.

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.170
So this would be font-weight: bold.

28
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.830
And maybe we want the font size to be,
I don't know, 1.5 rem or

29
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.180
whatever it is that you wanna do.

30
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.420
Maybe this one's 1.3 rem,
something like that, okay?

31
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.530
So that's the first part,
you can go ahead and

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.500
write your class,
then you need to apply your class, okay?

33
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.510
So come on over to your paragraph, and
we're now gonna add an attribute in our

34
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.170
HTML, and that attribute is
gonna be the class attribute.

35
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.680
And we type in the name of our class.

36
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.650
So this is bigbold.

37
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.830
Okay?
Just like that.

38
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.820
So this is our class name.

39
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.276
And we're gonna type in the name
of our class, no period.

40
00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:31.200
Okay, just bigbold just like that, and

41
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.780
then that is how it will know which
class to go on ahead and try.

42
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.550
So we have bigbold right here, and
there it is right there in the paragraph.

43
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.910
Yes?

44
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Will everything compile and

45
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.220
run if you reference something
that you've never called.

46
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

47
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.276
Okay, so what he said was,
[LAUGH] if you write

48
00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:59.307
classes that you never
actually call in your HTML,

49
00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:06.337
so let's just say I write a class
called testclass, and I don't know.

50
00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:11.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
now I have a class over here.

51
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.210
I'm not actually calle
it anywhere in my HTML.

52
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.170
Does anything blow up?

53
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.650
Nope, nothing blows up.

54
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.120
Nothing bad happens.

55
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.320
Likewise, if I had over here in my HTML.

56
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.820
Let's say I had a class of
testclass over here in my HTML,

57
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.320
but I don't actually
have the class in my CSS.

58
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.038
What's gonna happen?

59
00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:38.585
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nothing.

60
00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.149
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nothing.

61
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:41.680
Nothing.

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.330
Okay?

63
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.730
You may pull your hair out and
go, why isn't my style working?

64
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.630
Well, you didn't write it yet.

65
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.580
Okay, but nothing bad will happen.

66
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.140
Your web page is gonna display just fine.

67
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.510
All right.

68
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.900
Good.
So let's go on ahead and save.

69
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.155
And let's look at how our page is looking.

70
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:07.046
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here you go.

71
00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:10.464
So there's my paragraph, bigger, bolder.
