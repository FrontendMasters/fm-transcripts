WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:02.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so let's
just go ahead and get started here and

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.650
start looking at some of these properties.

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.680
So let's make a style for the div, okay?

4
00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:14.360
So is this going to affect box one,
box two, or both boxes?

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.310
Both boxes, right?

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.420
Okay, so let's start with the border
property which you learned yesterday and

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.880
I'm gonna put in a five pixel
blue solid border, okay?

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.410
So you can see here that
we have two boxes, right?

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.219
There's one paragraph in one box,
and two paragraphs in the other box.

10
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.010
So far so good?

11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.430
Border is always the easy
one to start with,

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.870
because it's really obvious
where the border is, okay?

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.800
So now that we know that,

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.250
what if I wanted to put some space
in between box one and box two.

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.640
So right now their two borders intersect,
you will notice that it looks like there

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.010
is a fat blue line between
those two paragraph one and

17
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.650
two, that's where div one is ending and
div two is starting, you have five

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.910
pixels of the bottom border, plus five
pixels of the top border together, right?

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.720
So you've got ten pixels
of blue line there.

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.920
What if I want some
space in between those,

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.296
what property do I need
to make that space?

22
00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:20.348
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Margin.

23
00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:23.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Margin, correct, margin.

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
So let's talk about how we can
put margin into our document.

25
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.162
Which direction do I
want this margin to go?

26
00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.136
Do I want it on top?

27
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.645
Do I want it on bottom, yes?

28
00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:37.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bottom.

29
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On the bottom, okay, we
could put it on the bottom and it's going

30
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.690
to go on the bottom of both of these
boxes and that should separate it, right?

31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.370
Where's another place we
could put the margin?

32
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Top, or top and bottom.

33
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or
you can put it on the top, right?

34
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.159
If we put it on the top
what's going to happen?

35
00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:58.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The page will move
down a little bit but it also have.

36
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Everything will
move down a little bit but

37
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.200
we'll also get some space in
between our boxes, right?

38
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.170
Which is right?

39
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020
Which is correct?

40
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It depends.

41
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.445
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends.

42
00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:08.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,

43
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.170
what do you wanna do
stylistically speaking?

44
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.930
So let's try both of these.

45
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.146
Margin top and let's say

46
00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:22.580
something like one rim, okay?

47
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.150
So see how nicely we just
separated those two boxes and

48
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.690
we've pushed everything down
just a little bit, okay?

49
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.317
And let's try the reverse to because
we could also do margin bottom

50
00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:37.691
right
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if we do margin bottom,

51
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:41.830
we still have these boxes separated, but
now we have more space on the bottom.

52
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.540
And that is a design decision
about which one you wanna do.

53
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.190
So there are a lot of margin properties.

54
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.893
Let's scroll on down to margin here.

55
00:02:54.503 --> 00:02:58.811
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so here in
the web page, you'll see that there is

56
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:04.790
a margin-top, a margin-right,
a margin-bottom, and a margin-left.

57
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.890
Those are all things.

58
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.106
And the other interesting thing about
margin is that margin values may be

59
00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:13.036
positive or they may be negative.

60
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool, who knew you
could have a negative margin, okay?

61
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.120
So let's try out some negative margin.

62
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.780
What would happen if I said my
margin bottom was negative one rem

63
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.470
anybody want to take a guess
what's gonna happen?

64
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.900
Yeah?

65
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They intersect.

66
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.204
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They were on top
of each other at zero, right?

67
00:03:37.204 --> 00:03:39.690
We had the two borders,
what's going to happen if we do negative?

68
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Overlapping.

69
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're going to overlap,
right?

70
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.550
They're actually going to overlap.

71
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.151
So if we do a negative,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That might actually

72
00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:51.970
be hard to see what's going on there.

73
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.870
How can I fix this so
it'd be easier to tell what's happening.

74
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.240
Anyone have a suggestion?

75
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.820
Yeah?

76
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Up to the amount of rim.

77
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could give it more rim,
sure.

78
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.240
We could give it,
let's give it two rim instead, minus two.

79
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.410
Getting worse and worse.

80
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.720
We love our ugly web pages.

81
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.110
What else could we do?

82
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Change the border
colors like border top?

83
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, let's try giving
each of these classes we have a class for

84
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.060
box one and a class for box two.

85
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.180
Let's give these different colors.

86
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.140
Okay?

87
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.720
So here's something that we can do that
will take advantage of the cascade.

88
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.490
All right,
where we can also change these colors.

89
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.850
So I'll show you two ways of doing this.

90
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.006
One way of doing this,
we could just say box one, our class,

91
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:41.081
and we could say what,
border is five pixel orange dotted.

92
00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:46.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
that's one way of doing this.

93
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.690
There we go.

94
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.590
You can now see that those two
borders are a bit more separated.

95
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.340
Now tell me about what's
happening here with box one.

96
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.850
We actually have two border declarations
for box one don't we, right?

97
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.210
We have the generic div,
five pixels blue solid.

98
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.460
And then later with our class we
actually said make it instead orange and

99
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.229
dotted, didn't we.

100
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.600
So that's kinda cool.

101
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.460
We're taking advantage
of the cascade there.

102
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.840
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm just wondering if

103
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.690
I know it sounds it's lower,
it's gonna run it.

104
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.560
Is the class technically
more specific too?

105
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the class is
technically more specific as well,

106
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.730
yep, yep.

107
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.120
Okay, so this is one way of doing this.

108
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.678
Here's another way that we could do this.

109
00:05:30.678 --> 00:05:36.860
In your border properties
here on the page,

110
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:45.020
way up there on the top,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Borders properties.

111
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.140
So far we've used the actual border
just by itself that puts a border on

112
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.810
all four sides, right?

113
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.629
Like one pixel solid red, but we actually
have a whole bunch of individual

114
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:56.736
properties that go with border as well.

115
00:05:56.736 --> 00:06:01.164
We can talk about just the border width,
just the border style, just the border

116
00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:05.281
color and we can also talk about borders
and space, the border on the top.

117
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.911
The border on the top has a width.

118
00:06:06.911 --> 00:06:10.640
The border on the top has a style,
make sense?

119
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.280
Yes?

120
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
this is all just a list of examples.

121
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.650
It's not all of them or
is this all of them?

122
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, you have to repeat
that list out from border top to border,

123
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.850
top color for the bottom,
the left and the right.

124
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.782
Yes, we got tired of typing.

125
00:06:25.782 --> 00:06:30.860
This is a lot of properties [LAUGH] okay.

126
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.120
So we can make use of these
border properties as well.

127
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.410
So instead here on box one of saying
this whole border once again,

128
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.660
we could just say something like this.

129
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.239
Border is, or I'm sorry,
border color is orange.

130
00:06:50.762 --> 00:06:52.875
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See how that's
working with the cascade here?

131
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So in the div we said
it was a five pixel blue solid border.

132
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.860
But now in box one we're overriding
it by changing the color to orange.

133
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.850
But the five pixel in the solid
part are still in effect.

134
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.744
Yeah?

135
00:07:09.744 --> 00:07:11.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we do
a background color and

136
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.330
see which one is really
overlapping with the other.

137
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure, that will be great.

138
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.910
Let's go ahead and do that.

139
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.880
Let's put in a background color.

140
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like it was
like they're both, like that.

141
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.254
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: F, F, F, F.
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

142
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: On the edges,

143
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.730
you can see the-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so

144
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.280
if you filled in the blue, it would
cover up everything in that box, right?

145
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.380
You wouldn't see the yellow anymore.

146
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, okay, let's go ahead
and put in, for that blue box, then.

147
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.234
Let's say that our
background-color is light blue.

148
00:07:52.808 --> 00:07:55.620
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is a really
interesting thing that we just did here.

149
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.320
What's going on?

150
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.060
What's going on?

151
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.540
Anyone would care to discuss
what's going on here.

152
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.325
Box one is the orange box,
box two is the blue box.

153
00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:11.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

154
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.970
Why does it look this way now?

155
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:15.750
What just happened?

156
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Box two
is lower down the HTML.

157
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So box one we have
box two box two lower in the HTML.

158
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And
therefore it Is showing up over box one?

159
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We've moved that
one up with negative margin, and

160
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.670
it's now on top of box one, isn't it?

161
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, so
the HTML wins over the CSS,

162
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.570
when it comes to the cascade, is that-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well,

163
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.610
no, there's just an order for these.

164
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.390
One will show up on top of the other.

165
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.010
And so the thing to remember
about your boxes is though,

166
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.770
while your boxes look like
they're in 2D space, right?

167
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.000
They're actually in 3D space.

168
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.580
So we could actually go into and
out of the page as well.

169
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.710
And there's a property for that as well.

170
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.850
It's called the z index.

171
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.340
Okay, so

172
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.390
we could change the order of these boxes
if we wanted to going up and down.

173
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.590
I'm not gonna go there today.

174
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.950
So we go back to positive numbers.

175
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.030
There's our two boxes.
