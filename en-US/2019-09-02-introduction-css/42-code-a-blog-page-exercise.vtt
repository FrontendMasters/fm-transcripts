1
00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:07.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing I wanna
do is I wanna talk about your task, for

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.768
today.

3
00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:10.640
So this is Code a Blog Page, all right?

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.985
From the website here,
scroll on down to the exercises.

5
00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:20.111
Take a look at Download Zip Files,
click on that link,

6
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:22.900
this is gonna put onto a GitHub page.

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.305
Go over here and find the Download button,
click the Download button.

8
00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.543
It's gonna download to
your downloads directory.

9
00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:38.842
From your downloads directory, drag your
zip file onto your desktop and unzip it.

10
00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:43.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so, there's my folder
right here with the exercises in it.

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.934
What I'm going to do now,
is I'm going to drag and

12
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.964
drop that folder, right on to VS code.

13
00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:56.393
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

14
00:00:56.393 --> 00:00:57.572
Great.

15
00:00:57.572 --> 00:01:02.971
And, I'm gonna take a look
here inside of the blog.

16
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.168
First of all, the blog begin,
can I show this.

17
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:11.305
Good.
I'm gonna start with blog.png form inside

18
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.491
of that folder, okay.

19
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.949
I'm gonna start with blog.png.

20
00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:21.289
So, this is a real world exercise for
you guys today, okay.

21
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.088
This is a picture, it's a specification.

22
00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:30.647
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And, the team of people who
are working at the company where you work,

23
00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:35.625
they've come up with this absolutely
beautiful web page layout for you.

24
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:41.554
We are going to try to make this,
from this picture we need to code this.

25
00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:43.910
Wow, that's a really big leap, isn't it?

26
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.110
No more ugly web pages,
we're now making pretty stuff, all right?

27
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.106
So, where you're gonna start,
is in the blog begin folder, okay?

28
00:01:55.106 --> 00:02:01.617
There's a file in here called blog.html,
go ahead and open that up.

29
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put on my word wrap.

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.056
And, I'm gonna go ahead and
display that [COUGH] In my browser.

31
00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:18.003
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?
And, this is the way it looks right now.

32
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.121
So I've given you a bunch of stuff.

33
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.809
I've given you a picture.

34
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:28.960
Here's some text, The funky fonts that
are in use here, we're gonna talk about

35
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.439
that later on, probably tomorrow, we'll
talk about how to do the funky font stuff.

36
00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.251
But I've done it here for you today.

37
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.795
Clearly we have a nav bar,
you know how to do that.

38
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:43.650
We've got some funny layout
stuff going on up here.

39
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.485
How might we solve this layout stuff here?

40
00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:53.100
We want to go from the way
this looks to our picture.

41
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.624
Let's put these side by side.

42
00:02:55.624 --> 00:03:01.040
Anybody have any suggestions for
how we can get.

43
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.271
All of this to layout like this,

44
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:09.056
based on the techniques
we talked about today,

45
00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:13.978
what's the technique that might work for
that?

46
00:03:13.978 --> 00:03:15.089
&gt;&gt; off screen: Float?

47
00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.055
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Could be float.

48
00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:19.077
Probably even better would be?

49
00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:21.460
&gt;&gt; off screen: Flex.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about Flex box.

50
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.722
Okay, so you can probably lay out this
header here with a little flex box.

51
00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:29.155
All right.

52
00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:30.754
How about this nav bar?

53
00:03:30.754 --> 00:03:33.935
How do we go about doing that?

54
00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:39.299
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have you
totally forgotten nav bars?

55
00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.679
It was before lunch.

56
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.148
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Inline block right?

57
00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:45.901
You could do it with a flex box too.

58
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:47.840
But inline block is how I showed you.

59
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.484
How are we gonna get those two lines,
the color line on the top and

60
00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:54.648
the color line on the bottom?

61
00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:55.914
How are we gonna get those?

62
00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:57.509
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].

63
00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.518
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably no,
actually not the horizontal rule but.

64
00:04:00.518 --> 00:04:01.564
&gt;&gt; off screen: Borders.

65
00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:03.638
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Borders.
We can do it with borders.

66
00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:06.544
Right?
So, we can find a tag that's gonna go all

67
00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:12.258
the way across like that and assign a top
and a bottom border of different colors.

68
00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:14.298
Right.
No left and right borders.

69
00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:16.898
Okay.
How about these pictures here.

70
00:04:16.898 --> 00:04:19.760
So, we have a picture and
then we have a bunch of text.

71
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.839
How are we gonna do that.

72
00:04:23.074 --> 00:04:24.108
&gt;&gt; off screen: Float.

73
00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:26.848
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Floats,
floats are one way of doing it.

74
00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:30.156
What's another way of doing it?

75
00:04:31.424 --> 00:04:32.640
&gt;&gt; off screen: Flexbox.

76
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.028
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flexbox,
Flexbox would be the other way to go.

77
00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:40.308
So, you can experiment and
try both of those.

78
00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:44.058
Notice too, then in our design
we have rounded corners here but

79
00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:45.769
there are pointy over here.

80
00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:50.203
How might we go about adding
some rounded corners?

81
00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:53.266
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Some of you have
managed to figure this out.

82
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.130
I didn't go over it in class.

83
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.825
&gt;&gt; off screen: Radius.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is a border radius

84
00:04:56.825 --> 00:05:01.357
property that will actually give
you some nice rounded corners.

85
00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.264
You can read about that in your notes.

86
00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:04.312
Okay.

87
00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:11.262
So then, down here at the bottom,
this is alien social media here, okay?

88
00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:16.684
Those are little alien social media links.

89
00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:20.929
Down here, at the bottom of ours,
we have, this.

90
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:26.489
Any idea how we can go from that to this?

91
00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:27.223
&gt;&gt; off screen: Flex Box.

92
00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:29.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex Box, or?

93
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.736
&gt;&gt; off screen: Inline block.

94
00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:34.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Inline block,
one of those two, all right?

95
00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:38.100
So, you see how this page is gonna use
everything I've talked about today?

96
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.572
Cuz now, on the top of all that,
you gotta throw in some padding and

97
00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:45.049
some margins to make it pretty,
give it a little space to breathe.

98
00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:47.828
Sound like fun?

99
00:05:47.828 --> 00:05:50.257
Yeah.
Cassie's like, yeah.

100
00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:51.444
So ready.

101
00:05:51.444 --> 00:05:54.094
Okay, so
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna give

102
00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:57.155
you about an hour here to get
started on this blog page.

103
00:05:57.155 --> 00:06:00.420
Okay, so put aside everything
else that you've been working on.

104
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.035
I want you to start working on this blog
page using the files that I've given you.

105
00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:05.385
Everything is here.

106
00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:09.101
You have blog.html,
you have a starter style sheet file,

107
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:10.894
it's all linked up for you.

108
00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:13.390
I've got some basic styling in place here.

109
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.127
You can just continue to add to this,
okay, you've got all the images you need.

110
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:22.957
They're all in here, and I want you
to try working through this blog

111
00:06:22.957 --> 00:06:27.386
example based on all of the stuff
that we've worked on today.
