00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:03.709
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
this URL is the validator for the CSS.

2
00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:10.258
So yesterday we talked
about validation and HTML.

3
00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:11.486
Iâ€™m gonna drop this on in here.

4
00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:14.804
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The validator.

5
00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:20.633
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So yesterday we talked
about HTML and the importance of

6
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.727
validating it as a way of checking errors
and making sure you're writing good code.

7
00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:28.020
There's a validator also
that's available for CSS and

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.880
it works pretty much the same way
that the HTML validator worked.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.692
So the URL here is
jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator,

10
00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:40.602
I think it's in your notes.

11
00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:45.300
And if you go here to this and
we go to the direct input tab.

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.589
Just like we did yesterday, you can
take your CSS, just copy it right out

13
00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.508
of your style sheet, drop it on into the
direct input window here, and check it.

14
00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:01.903
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And it will find any
mistakes or errors that you've made.

15
00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:06.324
Hopefully, it says just like this,
Congratulations No errors found.

16
00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:09.335
But if something, quote, doesn't work, and

17
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:14.694
you just can't find the problem this can
sometimes help you track down the problem.

18
00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:19.494
It's often a curly bracket that's missing,
or you forgot a semicolon, or

19
00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:21.820
some other crazy thing that you did.

20
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.490
That's often what the problem is.
