1
00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:03.200
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so we've talked
a lot about properties and values.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.355
I'm going to scroll back to
the top of my CSS document here,

3
00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:11.910
frontendmasters@github.io/bootcamp.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.330
Go to the CSS page.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.640
And I wanted to talk just a little bit,
again,

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.600
about some of this terminologies and
ways to include CSS in your document.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.820
Some quick little things you're gonna need
to know to complete your exercises today.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.130
So we've done a lot and talked about
the terminology in terms of properties and

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.260
values.

10
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.610
We talked about a declaration, okay?

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.910
So that would be like font-weight,
bold, font-family, sans-serif.

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.890
Those are a single property value pair,
that's a declaration.

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.010
And then a series of a whole bunch
of declarations together is called

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.150
the Declaration Block, okay?

15
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.780
You want to know all
the fancy terminology.

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.236
This is helpful when you're
looking something up and

17
00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:54.795
they start throwing around words like
this and you don't know what they are.

18
00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:57.690
[LAUGH] You refer back to this.

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110
That's where all those
words are coming from.

20
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.040
Okay, second thing I wanna talk about,
ways to include CSS in your document.

21
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.750
We only put CSS in our document one way so
far, we did the first thing,

22
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.320
which is with the external stylesheet.

23
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.920
Okay, so we created a separate document,
which we've made it up for CSS.

24
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.510
We linked it to our HTML,
we stuffed in full of styles, right?

25
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.700
Good stuff.

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.550
But there's other ways we can
put styles in as well, and

27
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.880
you may have seen some of these out there,
depending on what you've been doing.

28
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.240
So we also have what's called
an internal or embedded stylesheet.

29
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.520
And so this is something that occurs
in the head of your document, okay?

30
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.030
And there's also this inline style,
so we'll go ahead and

31
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.950
we'll try both of these
out here in just a second.

32
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.972
But I wanted to point out to you,
which should you use?

33
00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:58.346
99.999% of the time the external
stylesheet is the correct solution, okay?

34
00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:00.353
It's one you'll see all the pros using.

35
00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:04.100
But on occasion,
these things will come in handy as well.

36
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.020
It's helpful to know that they exist.

37
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.630
Make sense?

38
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.410
Okay, so why is the external
stylesheet preferred by professionals?

39
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.221
Can anyone take a guess?

40
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:16.765
Yeah?

41
00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:19.703
&gt;&gt; off screen: They have a lot
of Web pages to deal with

42
00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:20.571
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If we have

43
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.067
lots of Web pages, right?

44
00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:28.344
We have hundreds of pages on our website,
how many stylesheets do we need?

45
00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:29.840
&gt;&gt; off screen: A lot.

46
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One, one stylesheet.

47
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.736
We data one stylesheet and
we link it up to our 100 pages and

48
00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:38.097
it's a beautiful thing.

49
00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:43.966
Okay, if I'm putting my styles in the head
of my document in my 100 page website,

50
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:49.111
and I need to change something,
how many times do I need to change things?

51
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:49.626
&gt;&gt; off screen: 100.

52
00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:55.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 100 times, once for each
page that is a pain in the neck, okay?

53
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.190
But it gets worse.

54
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.510
What if I was doing an inline style?

55
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.480
Say coloring my paragraphs
on all those pages.

56
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.190
How many times now, when the boss said
I don't want purple paragraphs anymore,

57
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.470
I want green ones.

58
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.125
How many changes do I have to make now?

59
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.101
A bijillion, right?

60
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:17.560
All 100 pages, all individual times that
we talked about these inline styles.

61
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.930
So for maintenance purposes,

62
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.920
it's way better to be using
the external stylesheet.

63
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.540
Make sense?

64
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.500
But it's helpful to know that there's
other ways to include styles in your

65
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.390
document because you'll see them used
especially in documentation online.

66
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.280
In fact, you see them used here in

67
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.830
this very documentation
that you're reading, okay?

68
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.760
So let's go ahead and just try them out so
that you know what they are.

69
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.840
So when you encounter them,
they don't scare you, right?

70
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.390
So to make an embedded or

71
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.230
an internal stylesheet, in your HTML
scrolling up to the head of your document.

72
00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.310
And just before your slash head tag and
again anywhere in in the head is fine.

73
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.980
This is where I'm putting mine,
we'll put in a style tag.

74
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.670
So that's a style tag.

75
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.190
And this is where we can put in
whatever style we want to do.

76
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.070
But we can say all paragraphs
will now be something.

77
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.980
Color blue, okay?

78
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.470
And you can list up here
as many styles as you want.

79
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.690
Just it's just like regular old CSS.

80
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.468
Once you put that style tag in place
in the head of the document you

81
00:04:39.468 --> 00:04:42.578
can put as many styles
in here as you want.

82
00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:48.924
So when you refresh your Web page,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go,

83
00:04:48.924 --> 00:04:51.046
we have lots of blue paragraphs.

84
00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:55.125
Everything is blue, everything is blue.

85
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:59.685
Okay, the other thing you might have
noticed is I blew up all of my other

86
00:04:59.685 --> 00:05:02.120
colors for my paragraphs.

87
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.730
With this one style, okay?

88
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.710
Notice how this style to that declaration
comes later than my actual stylesheet,

89
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.231
doesn't it?

90
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.450
So what does that mean?

91
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.450
What styles win?

92
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.340
If I have a paragraph over here in
my external stylesheet that's red,

93
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.940
says I'll make all paragraphs red.

94
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.556
In fact, I'll just put it in,

95
00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:30.233
p color red, okay?

96
00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:33.004
So over here in my external stylesheet,
it says make the paragraphs red.

97
00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:36.098
And over here in my embedded stylesheet,
it says make them blue,

98
00:05:36.098 --> 00:05:37.239
which one is gonna win?

99
00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:40.050
And how many say we have red paragraphs?

100
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.230
How many say we have blue paragraphs?

101
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.400
Good job, everybody.

102
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.543
The blue paragraphs win, okay?

103
00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:48.102
Because this is later in
your document once again.

104
00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.048
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet.

105
00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:56.319
Okay, so
that's how you would do an embedded style,

106
00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.948
and then let's do an inline style as well.

107
00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:00.026
So-
&gt;&gt; off screen: Sorry,

108
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.171
can I ask real quick?

109
00:06:01.171 --> 00:06:06.271
If you move that embedded
style above the reference

110
00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:10.783
to the CSS stylesheet,
then is it reversed?

111
00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:11.793
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great question.

112
00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:18.341
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Actually,
before we go there, let's test this.

113
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:20.664
And make sure that we, in fact, did win.

114
00:06:20.664 --> 00:06:24.890
So I have red in the external,
blue in the internal or

115
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.140
embedded stylesheet, we decided that
blue paragraphs were gonna win.

116
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.050
And when we refresh the Web page, sure
enough blue paragraphs win, okay, cool.

117
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.099
So now we're gonna do
exactly what Dave suggests.

118
00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:45.412
We're gonna take our style or
embedded stylesheet here and

119
00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:50.940
we're gonna put it before our
external stylesheet, okay?

120
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.480
So we still have our red style over
here on the external stylesheet.

121
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.950
We have our blue over here
on the embedded stylesheet.

122
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.900
Now which ones gonna win?

123
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.599
How many say all paragraphs are red?

124
00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:08.296
How many say all the paragraphs are blue,
still blue.

125
00:07:08.296 --> 00:07:11.560
That was a lot of people not voting, okay.

126
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.140
Which is later in the document?

127
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.328
&gt;&gt; off screen: The external sheet.

128
00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:20.331
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The external stylesheet
is later in the document, right?

129
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.994
So these styles are going to win.

130
00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:27.865
&gt;&gt; off screen: One of my classes
stayed right even when I had

131
00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:33.140
the the paragraph color
below the stylesheet.

132
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; off screen: It was only one of

133
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.218
them now from that style.

134
00:07:36.218 --> 00:07:39.261
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If we have a style,
in a class like that,

135
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:43.570
it's gonna take priority over
just a plain old HTML tag.

136
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.730
It's getting into the cascade, and
we can go deep, we'll trying not to.

137
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.510
[LAUGH] Yes,
classes will be regular old HTML elements.

138
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.690
Last thing,
let me show you how to do an inline style.

139
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.120
So since we're coloring paragraphs here,

140
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.630
we still have our red here
in the external stylesheet.

141
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.150
We have our blue here and
the internal stylesheet.

142
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.921
Here, this first paragraph,
let's go ahead and

143
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:14.880
say p style = color:purple.

144
00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:24.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so an inline style
goes right inside of the HTML tag.

145
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.300
You can line up as many
styles here as you want.

146
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.580
Font weight, bold, right?

147
00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:36.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we can just line
up one style after the other.

148
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.240
Right inside of the style attribute.

149
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.460
That style attribute can be
applied to any of the HTML tags.

150
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.350
So once you've got that in place,
what color are our paragraphs now?

151
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.140
What color is this first paragraph now?

152
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.000
We have it red in the external stylesheet,

153
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.260
blue in the embedded stylesheet and
purple in this one paragraph.

154
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.470
So what color is this one
paragraph going to be?

155
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.000
How many say red?

156
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.134
It's totally red.

157
00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:07.699
Good, how many say it's blue?

158
00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:10.261
It's totally blue.

159
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:11.392
How many say it's purple?

160
00:09:11.392 --> 00:09:13.109
It's totally purple.

161
00:09:13.109 --> 00:09:15.306
Awesome, yes, it's purple.

162
00:09:15.306 --> 00:09:17.680
So and why is it purple?

163
00:09:19.924 --> 00:09:22.570
&gt;&gt; off screen: Comes last
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It comes last in document

164
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.572
once again.

165
00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:25.019
It's the last thing in the document.

there's my purple paragraph right there.

167
00:09:33.264 --> 00:09:38.675
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay and
once again if you write code like this.

168
00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:42.091
If you're writing, your paragraph is
red here and blue here and purple here,

169
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:43.610
you're a terrible programmer.

170
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.170
Don't do this, okay.

171
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.880

172
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.890
As you can tell,

173
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.130
it gets very confusing trying to figure
out how things are supposed to be when you

174
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.130
junk it up with lots of stuff
that doesn't need to be here.
