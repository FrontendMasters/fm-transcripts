00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.530
&gt;&gt; Teacher: The next thing I wanna do now,
while we're here,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.430
let's talk about the two kinds of
HTML tags that we need to discuss.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.190
Every HTML tag is assigned
one of two categories, okay?

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.350
One category is called
the block-level category and

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.320
the other is called the inline category,
okay?

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.250
So block-level HTML elements
are HTML elements that are as wide

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.460
as their containers.

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.190
In other words, these elements
we're working with here are divs,

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.496
are paragraphs and actually the H1 also.

10
00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:39.730
These are block-level elements and
you know that because their boxes stretch

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.300
all the way across the web page,
in this case, make sense?

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.870
These are all children,
all of these tags appear all these divs.

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.840
These are children of the body tag, right?

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.060
How big is the body tag?

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.750
How wide is it?

16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.890
&gt;&gt; Male Student: It's container?

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.590
&gt;&gt; Teacher: That wide [LAUGH] It's
as wide as the browser window, okay?

18
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.210
The divs are their children,
how wide are they?

19
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.540
As wide as the body tag.

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.060
How wide are the paragraphs?

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.510
As wide as their parents.

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270
Who's their parents?

23
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.989
The divs.

24
00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:18.480
&gt;&gt; Teacher: From the body, as a parent.

25
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.500
Make sense?

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.730
So everything is really,
really big and wide.

27
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.490
So those are the block level elements.

28
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.576
Can anyone give me an example of
a different kind of tag that's only as

29
00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:29.848
wide as its content?

30
00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:35.490
&gt;&gt; Teacher: And you know three or
four of these now.

31
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.060
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Image be one?

32
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.550
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Actually image is one,
but I was hoping for

33
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.500
one with text,
I should've been more specific.

34
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.150
&gt;&gt; Male Student 3: Link the A10.

35
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.000
&gt;&gt; Teacher: The link, let's put in a link,
so I'm gonna drop in a link right here,

36
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.780
a href equals.

37
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.718
Sometimes when we're practicing
code we just do it this way,

38
00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:58.319
nothing in particular.

39
00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:05.825
&gt;&gt; Teacher: All right, so
now I have a link here, okay,

40
00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:11.645
you see my word Lorem here at the top,
that is only as wide as?

41
00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.500
Its content, right?

42
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.320
These are inline elements, so
they have a different width.

43
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.480
By default,
they're only as wide as their content.

44
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.950
So if I put a border around my links,
let's say I did that a,

45
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.050
we'll put a border of 2 pixels
solid blue around my links.

46
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.556
See how they're only as, the border
is only as wide as the content there?

47
00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:38.875
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Okay?

48
00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.311
So those are inline elements.

49
00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:47.280
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Anyone want to give me
another example of an inline element?

50
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.300
Link is a great example,
there is a couple of others you did.

51
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.428
&gt;&gt; Female Student: Strong,
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Strong, yep, strong and?

52
00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:02.920
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Teacher: And m, right, strong and m.

53
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.186
Strong and m, so if we go ahead and
drop in a couple of strongs and ms.

54
00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.260
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Into our code.

55
00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:22.832
&gt;&gt; Teacher: And
then we can put that same border on them,

56
00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:26.800
just separate those by commas.

57
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.050
So you see there, those are number
of other inline elements, okay?

58
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.180
And these are just assigned
by the standards people,

59
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.449
the people who make standards.

60
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.610
Some things are blocks,
some things are inline.

61
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.850
And it kind of makes sense,

62
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.050
I mean you don't want your entire
paragraph to be a big honking link, right?

63
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.190
It's gonna be a few words.

64
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.210
You don't want your entire paragraph
to be bold usually or strong or m.

65
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.854
So you're gonna go ahead and
just make those as wide as their content.
