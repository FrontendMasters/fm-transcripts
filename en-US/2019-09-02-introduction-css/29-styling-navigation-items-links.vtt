00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.713
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now what would happen
if you're using this on a phone?

2
00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:08.094
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody ever
clicked on a link on a phone?

3
00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:12.848
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Don't necessarily hit the
correct one cuz they're so close together.

4
00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:15.345
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're kind of close
together for your fat finger, aren't they?

5
00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.181
[LAUGH] And
everybody has fat fingers, all right?

6
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:21.745
So we need to put a little
bit of space between these.

7
00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:23.305
How might we go about doing that?

8
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.163
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Margin?

9
00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:31.187
Add the bo-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Could be margin,

10
00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:32.792
could be padding.

11
00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:37.056
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And on which element?

12
00:00:37.056 --> 00:00:40.819
[SOUND] There's a lot
of possibilities here.

13
00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:41.552
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

14
00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:42.598
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: On the links themselves?

15
00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:46.877
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It could be on the links
themselves, it could be on the li.

16
00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:49.436
Okay, most of the styling going forward

17
00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.597
now that we've gotten our
ul all cleaned up here,

18
00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:57.433
most of the styling going forward is
either gonna be the li or on the a, okay?

19
00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.760
And so I'll show you some examples
of things that we can do here.

20
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.633
Let's say that we wanna make all of
these buttons look like all, I'm sorry,

21
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.911
all of these links look like a button,
okay?

22
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.378
In other words, we wanna have
a nice looking box, all right?

23
00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:18.436
Let's say we wanna have a nice looking box
and we want the whole box to be clickable.

24
00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:20.429
Sound good?

25
00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.126
Okay, so let's start by saying that

26
00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:29.980
we're gonna assign a width to our li.

27
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.042
Let's say that that width is, and
you can make it whatever you want,

28
00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:40.995
let's say it's 100 or sorry,
10rems cuz that's a nice convenient size.

29
00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:43.889
And since it doesn't look
like anything happened there,

30
00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:52.025
let's also give it a background color,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Of red, okay?

31
00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:53.878
So there's the start of our buttons.

32
00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:00.263
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What should we do next?

33
00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:09.324
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Change the-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Emma?

34
00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.027
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Change the border so
it's visible.

35
00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:12.893
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You wanna change
the border so it's visible?

36
00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:16.081
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Around each of the-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You wanna see the li-

37
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:16.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

38
00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:18.735
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the a or?

39
00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:19.713
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Under li.

40
00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:21.872
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You wanna see the li?

41
00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:29.622
Okay, I'm gonna change my green to
something else, let's make it yellow.

42
00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:34.155
I try never to use green and red together
online because there are a lot of color

43
00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.595
blind people out there,
I'm also gonna make this solid.

44
00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:40.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I guess that would make
the whole thing a button though?

45
00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:43.396
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
that's what's going on there.

46
00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:48.213
And then just so
you can see what's going on here

47
00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:53.633
let's go nav a and
let's set up a border here as well,

48
00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:58.104
border: is 3 px solid, or dotted orange.

49
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.548
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, can you see that?

50
00:03:03.548 --> 00:03:04.705
Maybe white is better.

51
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:11.981
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

52
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.860
So you can see that those links
are only as big as their text, right?

53
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.435
Whereas the lis or
nice block level elements,

54
00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.193
they're al lined up nice and neat.

55
00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:25.790
What might be something you
wanna do next for these buttons?

56
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.671
Yeah?

57
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.223
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you could add spacing.

58
00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:32.014
And what if you change
the size of the text then with

59
00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:34.907
the spacing increase too-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could change the size of

60
00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:35.470
the text.

61
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.223
All right, so
do we change the size of the text where?

62
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.319
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Will do nav a.

63
00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.648
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On, the a?

64
00:03:46.648 --> 00:03:52.388
Okay, so let's change the size
of the text on the a,

65
00:03:52.388 --> 00:03:57.359
font-size, let's say 1.5rem, okay?

66
00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.770
So we made them bigger, good.

67
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.052
What else would people like to do?

68
00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:07.197
Are you happy with link color?

69
00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:09.540
You want green on a red background?

70
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.209
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You said-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: White.

71
00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.166
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You like using red and
green?

72
00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:12.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I don't like using red and
green.

73
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.183
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE] White.

74
00:04:13.183 --> 00:04:14.348
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Don't [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,

75
00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:16.149
there are a lot of color
blind people out there.

76
00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.820
10% of the population is color blind,
we avoid red and green.

77
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.674
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I made them white.

78
00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:21.274
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: White?

79
00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:25.234
White sounds like a lovely color, okay.

80
00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:28.386
Color: white.

81
00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:30.906
Do we want them bold?

82
00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:31.725
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

83
00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:32.285
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

84
00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:33.206
Sure, we want them bold.

85
00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:37.872
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Font weight: bold, great.

86
00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:39.950
Are you happy with
the way they're lined up?

87
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:43.126
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Centered.

88
00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:44.212
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You want them centered?

89
00:04:44.212 --> 00:04:45.909
How do we center them?

90
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:46.788
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Text-align.

91
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:47.993
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Text-align.

92
00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:55.259
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Whoops, that didn't work.

93
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.574
Why didn't that work?

94
00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:02.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it because the margin is
only around that part of the word and so

95
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.091
there's no room to move?

96
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:05.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly.

97
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.403
That's exactly it.

98
00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:10.309
So these are inline elements,
they're only as big as their box, so

99
00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.832
by putting my text-align center on my
a I centered them inside of their boxes,

100
00:05:14.832 --> 00:05:16.903
did exactly what we told them to do.

101
00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:19.403
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I hate it when that

102
00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:20.123
happens.

103
00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:22.416
So we need to move this somewhere else.

104
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:24.874
Where might be a good place to put that?

105
00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:25.625
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Li?

106
00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.019
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'll bet on the LI, okay.

107
00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:32.991
So the nav li let's put our
text-align center there.

108
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:36.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is a reason not to do it
in body just because it's lower down or?

109
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.554
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, if you did it on body
then everything on your web page would

110
00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:40.192
be-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

111
00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:40.998
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Align center-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah-

112
00:05:40.998 --> 00:05:41.498
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right?

113
00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:41.998
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes so we're just working

114
00:05:41.998 --> 00:05:42.850
with [INAUDIBLE] right not.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,

115
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.962
you probably don't want that, okay.

116
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.737
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I hear a graphic designer
online screaming that they really,

117
00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:53.953
really hate the underlines,
am I right on that?

118
00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:54.477
Okay.

119
00:05:54.477 --> 00:05:58.376
Nobody here in the classroom's screaming
about it, but somebody out there is.

120
00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.480
So let's go on ahead and
get rid of the underlines.

121
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.549
How do we do that?

122
00:06:03.408 --> 00:06:03.999
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

123
00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We need to go to the a,
or I suppose forward here.

124
00:06:07.687 --> 00:06:09.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, nav a, mm-hm.

125
00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:13.139
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We can do
text decoration none.

126
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.833
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Text decoration: none.

127
00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:17.466
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

128
00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.762
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anything else?

129
00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:24.325
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are you happy
with the size of the buttons?

130
00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:26.663
The spacing of the buttons?

131
00:06:26.663 --> 00:06:29.345
The clickable area of the buttons?

132
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.842
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'd want
more space between them.

133
00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:34.132
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You want more
space between the buttons?

134
00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:38.833
Okay, how would we get some
space between the buttons?

135
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.324
How many say that's padding?

136
00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:42.921
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Two votes for padding.

137
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.452
How many say that's margin
between the buttons?

138
00:06:46.452 --> 00:06:50.019
Three people say that's margin, four
people, five people say that's margin.

139
00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:52.192
The margins have it.

140
00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:54.970
Okay, and
where are we gonna put that margin?

141
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.483
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The bottom?

142
00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:57.826
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You're gonna
put the margin on the body?

143
00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:02.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We wanna put
margin between the buttons.

144
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I said
the bottom of each button.

145
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.658
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The bottom of each,
which one?

146
00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Li-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: At the bottom of each

147
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.156
LI, okay?

148
00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:14.139
So we'll say margin bottom:

149
00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.306
something like 1rem.

150
00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:18.886
Did that help?

151
00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:22.268
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Little much?

152
00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:23.999
Wanna do a little less?

153
00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.736
You can play with this stuff for

154
00:07:26.736 --> 00:07:32.430
hours trying to find the perfect
dimension, okay, all right?

155
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.533
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can we make the whole

156
00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:34.799
background area clickable?

157
00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:37.741
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, we can make
the whole background area clickable.

158
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:41.890
That is a fabulous trick.
