WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.068
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so let's go ahead and

2
00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:06.135
move on to my next example which
has to do with navigation bars.

3
00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:10.145
And this is one of my favorite things
to do when talking about the box model

4
00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:13.327
because we got a lot of boxes
going on in navigation bars.

5
00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:17.959
So if you scroll through your notes, there
we, go styling nav bars in a horizontal

6
00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.814
and vertical direction, so that's about
three-quarters of the way down the page.

7
00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:26.876
And we'll start with
vertical navigation bars, so

8
00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:30.303
go on ahead and
open up the code pen for that.

9
00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.451
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we're gonna
start on vertical navigation bars.

10
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:50.417
Anyone wanna make a comment on
the HTML that we're starting with?

11
00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.996
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

12
00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:57.956
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They all
go to the same place.

13
00:00:57.956 --> 00:00:59.806
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They all go to
the same place, that is true,

14
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:01.257
it is not much of a navigation bar.

15
00:01:01.257 --> 00:01:03.992
[LAUGH] They all go absolutely nowhere.

16
00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:05.632
They're just links that go nowhere.

17
00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.938
Yeah, what else?

18
00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:10.235
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Vertically aligned
instead of horizontally?

19
00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:14.778
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These are vertical to
start with because these are the default

20
00:01:14.778 --> 00:01:16.183
browser styling.

21
00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:19.472
And we've marked up our
navigation bar using a what?

22
00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:20.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A nav tag.

23
00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:23.002
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have a nav tag but
also what?

24
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:23.608
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Unordered list.

25
00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:24.881
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: An unordered list.

26
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:27.636
Why do we use an unordered list for
a navigation bar?

27
00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:31.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It doesn't matter?

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.398
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is a list of links,
isn't it?

29
00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:37.952
In the end,
the navigation bar's just a list of links.

30
00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:41.845
And it really doesn't matter what
order we put those links in,

31
00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:45.377
although marketing will tell
you differently, right?

32
00:01:45.377 --> 00:01:49.531
It doesn't matter what order those links
go in because nobody is necessarily,

33
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:53.127
you don't have to visit the home first,
and then go to products, and

34
00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:56.481
then go to services, and
you better not go out of order, right?

35
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:59.060
You can go to any of
those pages at anytime.

36
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.745
So an unordered list is
the right way to mark it up.

37
00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.955
Surrounding that we have the nav tag.

38
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.765
See the nav tag up there on the top?

39
00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:08.026
Okay.

40
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:11.072
And so nav stands for?

41
00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:12.788
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Navigation.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Navigation.

42
00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:13.480
Okay, so

43
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.020
your navigation bar on your web page
you're gonna mark off with the nav tag.

44
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.382
And that's gonna help you differentiate
this particular list from other lists on

45
00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:24.844
your web page, isn't it?

46
00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:28.043
Using your friend,
the descendant selector.

47
00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.096
Okay, yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you're were gonna use

48
00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:31.354
header-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mm-hm.

49
00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:32.677
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would your nav go in

50
00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:33.858
the header or-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It

51
00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:34.535
can-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: After it?

52
00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:35.572
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or it can go after it.

53
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.979
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so it's either or?

54
00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.553
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends, yep.

55
00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:40.554
All right, good.

56
00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:44.423
So this is the way our
navigation bar looks right now.

57
00:02:44.423 --> 00:02:49.074
Anybody wanna just a way that we could
start to improve how this navigation

58
00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:49.833
bar looks?

59
00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.095
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Give it a font.

60
00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:52.081
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's give it a font.

61
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.273
[LAUGH] Always a good choice.

62
00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.939
So let's start with the body tag,
let's give it a font.

63
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.751
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

64
00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.982
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
much better, are we done?

65
00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:21.696
No?

66
00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:22.381
Okay.

67
00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:24.190
What else should we do here?

68
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.296
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Get rid of the bullets.

69
00:03:25.296 --> 00:03:28.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's get rid of those
bullets, those unsightly bullets.

70
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.651
Okay, so
we should get rid of those bullets.

71
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.406
Where are the bullets coming from?

72
00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:35.316
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Unordered list.

73
00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:37.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're coming
from the unordered list.

74
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.054
So we can say nav ul.

75
00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:44.954
So the reason I'm putting
nav in front of my ul is

76
00:03:44.954 --> 00:03:49.174
because I want the unordered list
inside of the navigation, right?

77
00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:53.012
I know this web page only has a navigation
bar on it, but chances are if you code

78
00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:56.870
a navigation bar in the future there
are other things on your web page, yeah?

79
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.627
Okay.

80
00:03:57.627 --> 00:04:05.314
So, nav ul, and the way we're gonna
turn off the bullets is this,

81
00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:09.571
list-style-type: none, okay,

82
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:15.454
list-style-type: none,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

83
00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:17.800
that will turn off the bullets, yay.

84
00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.604
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Something
else you wanna do?

85
00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:27.022
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Bullets went away,
anything else?

86
00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.393
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

87
00:04:30.393 --> 00:04:31.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Get rid of the underlining.

88
00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:35.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Get rid of the underlining,
but

89
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.397
before we go there let me
just put in a style for

90
00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.703
nav Border: 1 px solid.

91
00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:48.922
I always have to make them fatter so
you can see them on the screen,

92
00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:50.010
3 px solid red.

93
00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:52.492
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

94
00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:55.552
Is that where we want the nav bar?

95
00:04:55.552 --> 00:04:58.115
You see how it's kind of indented
off the page a little bit?

96
00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:03.180
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are you happy with that?

97
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.432
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When it's vertical,
it doesn't make any sense, right?

98
00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:07.373
It's wasting all your space.

99
00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.188
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

100
00:05:08.188 --> 00:05:09.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: To the right of it.

101
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.008
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so are you saying
you wanna get rid of that space?

102
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:15.698
Would shove everything
on over to the left.

103
00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:17.182
So how might we do that?

104
00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.718
What style do we need, and
what do we need to change?

105
00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:23.478
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
what happens if we have no idea?

106
00:05:25.864 --> 00:05:27.121
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Google it?

107
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:31.477
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You could Google it but
you could also figure this out, right?

108
00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:40.258
Let's put on a Border of 3
px dotted blue around my ul.

109
00:05:40.258 --> 00:05:43.438
Does that help tell you the answer?

110
00:05:45.448 --> 00:05:49.253
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If it doesn't,
you can keep adding borders.

111
00:05:49.253 --> 00:05:54.126
Okay, nav li border:

112
00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:58.491
3px dashed green.

113
00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:05.448
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
what we got going on here, everybody?

114
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.419
So we've got some boxes in boxes right?

115
00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.730
I've gone ahead and
put borders around my boxes.

116
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.824
So I have a nav box,
that's the red one on the outside,

117
00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:18.210
then I have a blue dotted box,
that's my ul.

118
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.855
See how nicely that blue
dotted box fits inside?

119
00:06:22.855 --> 00:06:25.422
And it goes all the way
up to the edge right?

120
00:06:25.422 --> 00:06:28.131
Right inside of that nav.

121
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.019
And then we have our lis.

122
00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.299
And our lis what does that tell you?

123
00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:37.754
The lis start at the words and
there's a gap in between.

124
00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:39.046
So what's going on here?

125
00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:41.278
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You need to get rid
of the margin the left of li is

126
00:06:41.278 --> 00:06:42.205
that what it this?

127
00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:46.554
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's a margin on the li,
what's the other possibility?

128
00:06:46.554 --> 00:06:48.547
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Padding on the ul.

129
00:06:48.547 --> 00:06:51.533
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Padding on the ul.

130
00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:55.885
There's either padding on the ul or
margin on the li.

131
00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:57.489
Does that make sense to people?

132
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Need to give
you a minute to digest that.

133
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.646
Yes, Jenna?

134
00:07:04.646 --> 00:07:09.232
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just I'm just wondering,
in the CSS-

135
00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:09.734
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mm-hm.

136
00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:13.512
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I would think to
do it what you just did you

137
00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:17.744
would've had to do nav
ul li to get specific.

138
00:07:17.744 --> 00:07:19.927
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But you don't, that's-

139
00:07:19.927 --> 00:07:21.328
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends.

140
00:07:21.328 --> 00:07:22.047
It depends.

141
00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:24.210
It depends on what ils
you are trying to do.

142
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.160
But this descended selector says nav li,
all that is saying is for

143
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.325
all lis descended from nav.

144
00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:31.858
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

145
00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:35.825
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And these lis are
definitely descended from nav aren't they?

146
00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:39.542
Now we could also say nav ul li
there's nothing wrong with that.

147
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.681
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I know it
worked the same though.

148
00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:41.556
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It worked exactly the same.

149
00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:42.334
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

150
00:07:42.334 --> 00:07:46.469
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because that still
lines up with what we've got here.

151
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:48.921
But this is three characters
less in terms of typing.

152
00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:55.262
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, all right, so let's
try turning off either the padding or

153
00:07:55.262 --> 00:07:56.515
the margin, right?

154
00:07:56.515 --> 00:08:00.217
So we can always say
padding 0 here on my ul.

155
00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:04.656
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now I happen to know

156
00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:08.978
historically that this ul sometimes
it's been margin in some browsers,

157
00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:11.289
it's been padding in other browsers.

158
00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:14.514
So it's probably a healthy thing
just to throw this in too,

159
00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:22.537
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

160
00:08:22.537 --> 00:08:25.420
we've just set our padding and
our margin to 0.

161
00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:32.164
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now everything
all lines up with our big box.

162
00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:34.420
See how that works?

163
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.294
Okay, so what I'm gonna do now,

164
00:08:37.294 --> 00:08:41.718
is I'm just gonna go ahead and
set my borders to 0.

165
00:08:41.718 --> 00:08:45.671
So 0 pixels wide, in other words, they
won't show up on the web page but I still

166
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:49.997
have them, so I don't have to re-type all
of that later if I'm debugging something.

167
00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:54.067
But I can still see what I'm doing,
[LAUGH] okay?

168
00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:57.185
We can get rid of that code later but
we may need to refer it again for

169
00:08:57.185 --> 00:08:58.280
debugging purposes.
