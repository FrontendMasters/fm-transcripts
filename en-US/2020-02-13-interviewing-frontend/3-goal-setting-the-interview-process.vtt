1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.138
A note on success and failure.

2
00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.549
Major League Baseball.

3
00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.293
People that get paid millions and millions
of dollars to spend literally their entire

4
00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:14.180
lives training to do one thing, and
it's generally to hit a ball with a bat.

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.082
That's American baseball for
those not familiar.

6
00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:23.700
This 0.300,
this is considered a good batting average.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.468
This actually considered
an excellent batting average.

8
00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:28.926
This means that every time that you
step up to bat, swing that ball,

9
00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.030
you have three tries, or
four or five, it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.525
Every time you go up to hit,
seven out of ten times you're gonna miss.

11
00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:40.156
So you're gonna fail most of the time.

12
00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.460
But if you succeed three
out of those ten times,

13
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.426
you're considered a very good hitter.

14
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:45.961
You're considered excellent.

15
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.990
Excellent player, you're probably getting
paid millions and millions of dollars.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
So what I wanna do is reframe
thinking about failure,

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.965
because there's winning and
then there's learning.

18
00:00:57.965 --> 00:00:59.639
Cuz you can always learn
from your failures.

19
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.862
Really what I wanna do is get us at 0.500.

20
00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:09.677
That means about one out of every two
interviews, you're gonna succeed,

21
00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:11.220
which is amazing.

22
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.031
It sounds like failure.

23
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.096
And at the time's where you're
getting rejected and rejected,

24
00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.208
you're thinking,
interviewing's hard, I'm a failure.

25
00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:19.015
I'm not a good engineer.

26
00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:19.829
Maybe I'm not smart enough.

27
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.518
But if I can get you to half,

28
00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:27.260
as in you pass half your interviews,
you are doing phenomenal.

29
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.567
And I talked to a lot of people,
nobody's at this.

30
00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.162
I don't know a single person that can
pass one out every two interviews.

31
00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:35.058
Smart people, too.

32
00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:35.805
People that you've heard of.

33
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:36.776
People that have written libraries.

34
00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:38.873
People that have changed the way
we think about JavaScript,

35
00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:41.200
they couldn't pass one
out of two interviews.

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.737
I'd like to get us there,
as a community, as a culture.

37
00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.890
And I wanna get you to 0.501.

38
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.234
So I wanna get you slightly better
than half, cuz that's pretty good.

39
00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:54.407
Today we're gonna go through
the steps of an interview.

40
00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:56.252
We're gonna start with the application.

41
00:01:56.252 --> 00:02:00.148
We're gonna go into that initial call
with the recruiter or the hiring manager.

42
00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:02.423
We're gonna go into the code tests.

43
00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:03.968
And then we're gonna talk
about the phone screen.

44
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:06.490
Then we're gonna get to the onsite,
kind of the meat and

45
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.486
potatoes, if you will, of interviewing.

46
00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:11.034
And then we're gonna talk about
the results, how to deal success,

47
00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:12.026
how to deal with failure.

48
00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:15.493
And if you're saying Jem, why can we just
skip straight to the on-site part cuz

49
00:02:15.493 --> 00:02:17.064
that's the part that I care about?

50
00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:19.570
I got some bad news for you.

51
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.290
Statistically speaking,
most of you will never get to the on-site.

52
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.733
That's just a numbers game.

53
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.403
I would say a lot of the big companies,

54
00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:31.508
they probably hire maybe 10%
of the people that apply.

55
00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:35.189
It's easier to get into Stanford or
Harvard than some of these big companies,

56
00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.602
just by running the numbers.

57
00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:40.819
So I wanna talk about the steps
to get to the on-site.

58
00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.214
And then we're gonna cover a lot of
the questions that you might get, or

59
00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:47.860
the style of questions you're gonna get.

60
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.492
