00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.050
Now, we're at our first problem of
the day, the phone screen problem, so

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.670
I'm gonna click this link, the link is
clickable, and I'm using for this one.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.930
And I'll pretend like I'm the interviewer,
like hey, blah, blah, blah.

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.850
I'm Jim Young,
I'm a senior software engineer in Netflix.

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.460
I really appreciate you taking
the time to interview with me today.

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.260
I know we're all busy people,
and no one likes interviewing.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.910
So we'll try to make
this pleasant possible.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.260
Take a minute to read over the questions,
read of the requirements, and

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440
let me know if you have any questions.

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.404
Then I'll give them a minute or two.

11
00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:39.500
I'll say, okay, if you want any questions,
let's go and get started.

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.900
Make sure you code below the line.

13
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.590
Here, and
make sure you follow the requirements.

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.560
Don't import any libraries,
just write in pure, vanilla JavaScript.

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.790
And also, you have till some time.

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.230
So right now, let's go ahead and
tackle this problem.

17
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.440
It's deceptively simple, it's not a trick,
but this is similar to questions

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.290
that I would actually give during a real
interview, go and tackle this problem, and

19
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.770
see how far you get, and then,
we'll go over what my solution was.

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.660
And there are multiple
solutions to this problem.

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.080
And also, one thing to ask is, you said,
can I use Google, or Bing, or Facebook,

22
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.590
whatever, when you use Facebook, but, yes,

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.730
you're allowed to look
up anything you want.

24
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.368
This is the only part of this course where
you'll be doing coding on your computer.

25
00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:31.578
Everything else,
I recommend doing it on a piece of paper,

26
00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:33.270
cuz that's how you do
it in a real interview.

27
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.790
For this part, I'm looking for
a specific output.
