00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.070
So this next one is,
it's more race because I love the race.

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.500
This next problem is one that
I've gotten multiple times at

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.530
many different interviews.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.610
It is without using that flat,

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.160
which is a new method,
which didn't exist until this year.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.170
Which will do this for you.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.838
But without using .flat, create
a function that will flatten an array.

8
00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:27.160
And by flattening an array it means,
it's an array of arrays, of arrays,

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.760
it doesn't matter how deeply nested it is.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.270
Then I want you to take
out all the arrays and

11
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.710
just give me one arrays,
with all the values into one array.

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.710
Any questions on this one you would
ask in an interview right now?

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.110
Yes.
&gt;&gt; So

14
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.380
we don't know what the structure
of example array is necessarily?

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.200
I mean, it is an example, but
can it add more levels or less levels?

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.800
&gt;&gt; Yes.

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; It could have no levels.

18
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.928
&gt;&gt; Okay.

19
00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:53.880
&gt;&gt; It could just be an array of numbers.

20
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.400
It might have 30 different
arrays nested within each other.

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.990
You don't know that.

22
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.600
And this is a question that like I said,
I've gotten in multiple interviews before,

23
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.630
so chances are at some point
you'll probably run into this one.

24
00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:17.628
And give another hint, I shouldn't give
you so many hints, using recursion for

25
00:01:17.628 --> 00:01:19.930
this one will help you out.

26
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.870
It makes it easier to reason about.

27
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.890
You don't have to use recursion.

28
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.071
You could do it,
I won't say anything else.
