00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.630
Let's start with the application.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.640
How to get your foot in the door?

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.370
That initial, I don't know, probe into,
maybe I want to start looking around.

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.280
Maybe I wanna see what
this company is about.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.930
Maybe I wanna see if they even notice
me if I put in my application.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.200
I've got some tips on that.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.200
The first thing before you even apply,
even before you think about applying,

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
think, what do you like
about your current job?

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.250
Is it, it's a learning environment and
people are friendly?

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.600
Is it you solve these incredibly complex
challenges and it's very rewarding?

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.490
Is it the free food?

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.680
Is it your company has a lot of
notoriety as an engineering culture?

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.100
Think about what do you like
about your current job?

14
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.286
And then think,
what do I want in my next job?

15
00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:55.630
That's important.

16
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.950
A lot of times we apply it blindly
to companies just trying to see

17
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.450
where we'll land and
we don't do it with direction.

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.720
We don't do with purpose.

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.540
We don't think I wanna be at this next
job, but you didn't get any thoughts.

20
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.548
You get hired, you work there for
a year and you're like I am unhappy.

21
00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:14.772
And then you do that again, and
then you do that again, rather than, let's

22
00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:18.965
find a home where you know you can grow
and you can build and you could learn.

23
00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:23.490
And over time you say I'm very satisfied,
I can move up the ladder,

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.640
I can build cool things.

25
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.830
I just have a lot of job satisfaction.

26
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.220
Most people don't do that.

27
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.740
Because interviewing is
kind of a crapshoot.

28
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.240
We just hope we get a job somewhere.

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.173
But I encourage you when you're applying
for job, do it with intentionality,

30
00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:40.620
do it with a purpose.

31
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.880
Say, I wanna work at this company,
and here's why.

32
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.760
Also what companies have
appealing engineering cultures?

33
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.410
Is it your company?

34
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.580
Is it the companies you
read about in the news?

35
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.870
Are there companies you think are bad,
are there companies you think are good?

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.460
Consider that carefully, because
engineering culture is really important,

37
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.230
and we never focus on it.

38
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.640
We focus on getting the job, rather than,
will I be happy this next job?

39
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.040
Does the culture vibe with me?

40
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.156
And I can say for a fact there are
companies that I would not enjoy working

41
00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:18.056
at, big companies, they pay me a lot of
money, but I wouldn't be happy there.

42
00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:21.156
And what's the point of doing any
of this if you're not gonna be

43
00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:21.936
happy doing what you do?
