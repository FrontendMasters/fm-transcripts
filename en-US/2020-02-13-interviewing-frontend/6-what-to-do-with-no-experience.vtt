1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.000
So this is a question I get a lot.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.820
I get a ton on Twitter or
people talking about and happy hour.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.955
They say what do I do if I
have little to no experience?

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.897
Now, what would you recommend?

5
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:18.133
We all started somewhere.

6
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.433
That is one thing we all share.

7
00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:20.914
We all started somewhere.

8
00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:23.038
How did you get your foot in
the door at the first job?

9
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.574
Anybody, this is an open question.

10
00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:27.319
Yeah?

11
00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.564
&gt;&gt; I applied to a QA position.

12
00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:34.770
And then I kind of worked my way
into more of a development position.

13
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.500
That worked for me.

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.510
&gt;&gt; That's a great path.

15
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.740
I didn't even think of that, yeah.

16
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.282
If you have no experience in UI,
is someone gonna you as a UI engineer?

17
00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:46.670
Maybe, maybe.

18
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.235
But is another way of just applying for
a different role and

19
00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:52.290
then working your way into that?

20
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.220
That's a very effective role.

21
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.470
I've seen people do it themselves.

22
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.930
Move from office manager
to sales to QA to engineer.

23
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.288
Why not?
The easiest way to get a new job is to

24
00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:06.660
stay at your same company, just keep
moving sideways, or move up or down,

25
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.586
wherever you want.

26
00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:08.168
That's a great tip.

27
00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.103
Yes?

28
00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:14.359
&gt;&gt; In the early days, I just knew
everybody was gonna take advantage of me,

29
00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.271
so I just built a bunch of sites for
local businesses and just like for

30
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:20.495
way under cost.

31
00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.619
But then, the future people didn't
know how much those people paid.

32
00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.246
So I would charge them a more fair
price and every time getting money for

33
00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:31.390
the next project.

34
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.100
&gt;&gt; That's a good-
&gt;&gt; I started with just getting

35
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.035
taken advantage of.

36
00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:37.752
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But then, eventually just charged

37
00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:41.593
higher and higher prices until
I was getting really good pay.

38
00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:45.523
&gt;&gt; You two have suggestions
I didn't even think of yet.

39
00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:48.164
Yes, start out freelancing on the side.

40
00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:51.281
Charge low rates, someone will hire you.

41
00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.075
I'll say a warning about freelancing.

42
00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:56.323
It's not as glamorous as you may think.

43
00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:59.996
You're like I do cool code and
I get to build something new every day and

44
00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.248
people pay me for that.

45
00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:04.614
No, as anybody who has
freelanced will tell you,

46
00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.270
it's not necessarily that pleasant.

47
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.370
But if you find the right person,

48
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.950
the right client,
you can really work together.

49
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.716
And if they say this person's
a good engineer, you're like well,

50
00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:16.339
I'm looking for steady work.

51
00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:17.414
You're hired.

52
00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:20.645
We don't have to interview you cuz
we've seen the work you have done.

53
00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:22.235
That's a great path to getting in if

54
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.065
you don't have that much
professional experience.

55
00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:25.678
&gt;&gt; It's s mostly a means to an end.

56
00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.485
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great example.

57
00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:30.865
Any any other suggestions?

58
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:31.930
These are good.

59
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.240
These are questions that
I get all the time.

60
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.479
So these are really helpful.

61
00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:42.425
I know a lot of people say you should have
a robust GitHub with a ton of examples.

62
00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:45.788
Yeah, you should.

63
00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.728
But that's not gonna help
you get noticed by anybody.

64
00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:53.916
You may think people are constantly
trolling GitHub for wow, this person's so

65
00:02:53.916 --> 00:02:58.530
smart, look at this algorithm they
implemented, or this is a really cool UI.

66
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.440
Probably not as much.

67
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.430
What I recommend is, yeah, have a GitHub,

68
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.560
have something on there that shows you
can code, and shows your style of coding.

69
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.285
And then, join Twitter.

70
00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:11.374
Post out some of the things you do.

71
00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:15.040
Post it in a code pen and say here's
this animation of me doing cool stuff.

72
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.330
I can't guarantee you that's gonna land
you a job, but it'll get you noticed.

73
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.080
Another thing I'd say is what
you absolutely have to do is you

74
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.602
have to network.

75
00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.530
I know.

76
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.722
When I was in college, I'm like,
I'm so smart, I got a CS degree,

77
00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:29.124
everybody's gonna hire me.

78
00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:30.433
And then nothing.

79
00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.253
Because who was I?

80
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.552
I was just another college graduate.

81
00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:35.790
But what I did was, I made friends.

82
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.897
I got my first job via my roommate
because he had a position at the startup

83
00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:40.522
he was at.

84
00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:43.998
And he's like hey, they're looking for
a junior part-time person.

85
00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:46.605
And were they taking advantage
of me with very low pay?

86
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:47.524
Probably.

87
00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:48.626
But did I care?

88
00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:51.375
No, it got me experience,
it got me in the door, and

89
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:54.449
it got something on my resume
that I can tell people about.

90
00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.399
And that's another Jim tip.

91
00:03:58.564 --> 00:04:00.270
Don't swing for
the fences on the first job.

92
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.740
You have no experiences.

93
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.446
You may have heard people at Google or
LinkedIn or

94
00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:09.673
FrontendMasters getting paid $200,000 a
year or something as front end engineers.

95
00:04:09.673 --> 00:04:11.330
That's not gonna be your first time out.

96
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.270
Unless you are truly exceptional and
get really, really, really lucky.

97
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.460
You're probably gonna take a pretty
low pay when you start off.

98
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.100
That's just the nature
of having no experience.

99
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.204
But make sure you take advantage
of the people around you.

100
00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:28.159
Leverage the time to learn.

101
00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.490
Leverage all the knowledge and
things you can get out of this job.

102
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.690
Yes?

103
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.520
&gt;&gt; Online, there's a few suggestions.

104
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.774
Personal projects,
contributing to open source, and

105
00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:42.314
volunteering coding for an NGO.

106
00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:45.266
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are all solid, too.

107
00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:51.205
My only issue with people saying yeah,
have a GitHub, contribute to open source,

108
00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:55.970
and all these things, is you have to
leverage that into a job somehow.

109
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.660
Otherwise you're kind of doing work.

110
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.831
The strongest one I always
recommend is networking.

111
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:02.874
Network, network, network.

112
00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:06.290
It's unpleasant, they don't teach
it to you in college, they should.

113
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.113
But you have to know
people who know people.

114
00:05:08.113 --> 00:05:09.256
And just make friends.

115
00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:12.047
It just shows you the type
person they wanna work with.

116
00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:15.316
How I got my job at Netflix was
I was working at a start up and

117
00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:17.650
I applied to a conference, and I got in.

118
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.600
And then, I gave a talk on React,
EX6, and doesn't really matter.

119
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.695
But it turns out, my future boss
was there at the conference.

120
00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:28.746
Like hey, I wanna talk to this guy.

121
00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:32.489
He seems like a personable person.

122
00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:35.308
You can tell my personality
by how I give talks.

123
00:05:35.308 --> 00:05:39.335
And then, that turned into an application,
and that turned into a job eventually.

124
00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:43.010
So go to conferences,
go to meetups, talk to people.

125
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.071
And network, network, network, network.

126
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:50.669
In fact, real story, and
I have plenty of real stories.

127
00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:57.200
Part of the preparation for this workshop
is I applied for jobs at places.

128
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.683
I didn't get reached out from recruiters.

129
00:05:58.683 --> 00:06:02.217
I just tried to, with my resume and
the things I've done, and my talks and

130
00:06:02.217 --> 00:06:04.384
workshops and all that,
I applied for jobs.

131
00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.445
Do you know how many
people responded to me?

132
00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:09.923
Zero, nobody.

133
00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:12.947
I applied for a job at Amazon.

134
00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:14.602
They never got back to me.

135
00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:17.682
And I'm not saying I'm
the world's greatest engineer.

136
00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:20.351
Probably not even saying the world's
second greatest engineer.

137
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:21.499
Third?

138
00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:23.233
Maybe, no.

139
00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:26.616
The fact is they get thousands and
thousands of people.

140
00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:29.270
And if you don't match whatever
their algorithm or criteria is,

141
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.700
you're probably just
gonna get passed over.

142
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.040
So the real way to do it
is to make friends or

143
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.000
just follow someone who
works at Amazon on Twitter.

144
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.970
And then eventually you
have a interaction.

145
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.180
And I don't mean this to be manipulative,
but

146
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.457
establish a genuine
interaction with people.

147
00:06:45.457 --> 00:06:48.939
And then, say hey,
you got me open rules, I'm looking?

148
00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.176
And almost everybody will help you out.

149
00:06:51.176 --> 00:06:53.538
Anybody that's ever asked for
a referral to Netflix,

150
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.986
I've never not helped them out.

151
00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:57.786
It's not really gonna help you
[LAUGH] that's not the way we work.

152
00:06:57.786 --> 00:07:00.351
But I will always help you out.

153
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.680
I think most people will in the community.

154
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.960
We're all generally good people.

155
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.430
We understand what it's like
to try to find a new job.

156
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.250
So I'll say that again.

157
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.207
Network, network, meet-ups, and talks.

158
00:07:09.207 --> 00:07:13.618
Yes, that's what you should
do if you have no experience.

159
00:07:13.618 --> 00:07:15.450
And also have a web page.

160
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.940
I need to know what you can do.

161
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.860
And this last piece of advice is a bit
distasteful for me, cuz I'm not a fan.

162
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.410
But I talk to a lot of hiring managers,
and

163
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.060
they said you need to
have a LinkedIn profile.

164
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.740
And it should list where you've worked and
what are your skills.

165
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.320
You have to.
That's one of the primary ways they find

166
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.020
people is LinkedIn.

167
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.980
This is my personal opinion,
I'm not too wild about it,

168
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.950
the interface is kind of clunky.

169
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.080
But these are things we have
to do as professionals.

170
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.846
So have a LinkedIn profile,
have a webpage, and network.

171
00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:47.926
Yes?

172
00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:52.685
&gt;&gt; So maybe, I guess it's
a question what do you do with

173
00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:57.241
experience that you have
that's not CS related?

174
00:07:57.241 --> 00:08:00.570
Is there a way to work it
into your application?

175
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.904
&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's-
&gt;&gt; Or do you just ignore it completely?

176
00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:08.110
&gt;&gt; No, no, that's a great question.

177
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.140
What I put, and you can see it even on
my resume, is I have a lot of experience

178
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.820
from my previous life before
being a software engineer.

179
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.860
So I list my professional
experience there.

180
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.890
So that means it's not it's not entirely
encompassing of everything I've ever done.

181
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.918
But when you sit down with someone and
you say hey,

182
00:08:25.918 --> 00:08:28.930
do you have experience managing people,
you're like yes, I did.

183
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.890
I managed people at a theme park
through college for a couple of years.

184
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.076
So work it in there.

185
00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:38.681
But on your LinkedIn, probably leave out
the less relevant experience unless you

186
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:40.360
really feel it's critical.
