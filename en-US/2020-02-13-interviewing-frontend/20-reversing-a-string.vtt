00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.573
All right, so now it's the time,
I'm gonna roll up the old sleeves.

2
00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:09.520
Realistically, metaphorically,
proverbially, whatever you want.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.620
I recommend, at this portion,
I recommend, close your laptops.

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.350
It's too tempting to look stuff up.

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.087
In a real interview, you can't go on
Google, you can't pull out your phone.

6
00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:25.400
I recommend a piece of paper and a pen,
old school or whiteboard, if you have one.

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.870
If you're watching this at your work
with a bunch of people in a classroom,

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.830
a whiteboard is good too.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
But practice what it's like to code.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.286
Just mentally,
not using a computer at all.

11
00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:39.270
There's no linters,
there's no helpers here.

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.610
And I really think if you do these,

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.490
you'll understand much stronger about
the problems we're gonna solve here.

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.354
All right, so for this challenge,

15
00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:51.467
I want you to create a function
to reverse a string.

16
00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:55.065
I even gave you some, I even helpfully
gave you some sample output here.

17
00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:59.740
I don't wanna say it's a warm up question,
but it is kind of warm up question.

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.014
If you had a little trouble, that's okay.

19
00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:06.190
We're going to get used to the coding
without our computers for a bit.

20
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.780
I of course,

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.185
I'm gonna use my computer because you
can read my writing if I wrote it out.

22
00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:14.343
And I was told I'm not allowed to use
a whiteboard because my handwriting is

23
00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:15.470
atrocious.

24
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.140
So I'm just gonna code it here but
I'm not gonna run it.

25
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.082
For this particular function I
want it to be actually correct.

26
00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.266
A lot of the questions
I'm gonna ask later,

27
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.993
if you get in the ball park
I think that's pretty good.

28
00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:30.825
It's enough for the interviewer to get a
good concept of like they understand what

29
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:31.697
you're talking about.

30
00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:35.009
You might be missing a bracket or
a semicolon, it doesn't matter.

31
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.842
For this one, though,

32
00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:39.300
I would wanna get it pretty accurate
since there's many ways to do it.

33
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.740
And I won't say there's a wrong way,

34
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.630
but there are more efficient
ways to do it than others.

35
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.216
So for this one,
I'm gonna say use a Jem tip,

36
00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:53.400
which is talk outs what we want.

37
00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.564
So I want a function, and I'm gonna call
it reverse cuz that's what they called it.

38
00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:03.910
And I know that function's
gonna take a string.

39
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.810
Cool, this is a good starting place.

40
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.680
If you ever get stuck,
just talk out what you want.

41
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.120
If they want a function that
it's gonna be later invoked,

42
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.714
you know you want a function
that returns another function.

43
00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:18.773
And by talking that out and

44
00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:21.290
getting the structure really
helps you mentally picture it.

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.750
So I want to reverse a string,
there's a few ways to do this.

46
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.990
I'm gonna do this in the shortest
way that I can think of.

47
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.017
So I want to return a string.

48
00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.250
But I'm not going to create a new one yet.

49
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.640
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna split that string.

50
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.010
Split, what that does is it takes
the string, breaks it into an array.

51
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.440
And now I can use reverse.

52
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.755
I know, some of you are like I
reverse iterated over a loop and

53
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.357
then I'm gonna join it back together.

54
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.066
And that is reversing a string.

55
00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:03.150
Again, you could use a for loop.

56
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.974
You could break into an array, use a for
loop, and iterate over it backwards and

57
00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:06.494
return that.

58
00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:09.070
That would also work,
this is essentially what we're doing here.

59
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.280
This is just using those built in
utility methods to do it for us.

60
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.400
All right, not too bad, yes?

61
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.140
&gt;&gt; So this would be a good place to
ask the interviewer a question, right?

62
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.405
May I use reverse?

63
00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:23.810
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.070
Generally for these and
for most interviews,

65
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.400
unless they explicitly
say don't do something.

66
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.277
And in about two questions there
will be something I ask you to code.

67
00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:36.415
And I'll say, don't use this
method cuz it'll do it for you.

68
00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.240
But this is something I
want to see how you think.

69
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.730
Generally I think you're fine
to use whatever tools you can.

70
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.963
Cuz again, you're whiteboard
coding these most of the time.

71
00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:46.216
All right, so that was good,

72
00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:49.240
I know some of you probably struggled
a little bit with coding on paper.

73
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.525
It's a little weird, but
this is how a real interview would go.

74
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:54.170
It's good to get those muscles going.

75
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.240
But in general, I always say,
use an array if possible.

76
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.530
Array is one of my
favorite data structures.

77
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.310
You can do pretty much anything
you wanna do with array methods.
