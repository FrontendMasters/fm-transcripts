00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.670
So why is interviewing for
front end specifically so difficult?

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.930
There are many answers to this,
but give me some.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.440
Give me your best.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.523
&gt;&gt; The tech changes quite fast.

5
00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:14.219
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does.

6
00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.146
If you were to hit your head
go into a coma wake up,

7
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.640
you would have no idea what's
going on in front end anymore.

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.730
Browsers work completely differently,
technology's completely different.

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.360
You're like, what's an angular?

10
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.020
What's a view?

11
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.060
Is that like part of MVC?

12
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.111
They're like, [LAUGH] MVC?

13
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.240
How old is this person?

14
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.810
What else?

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.910
Why is interviewing for
Frontend so difficult?

16
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.320
I've got a few.

17
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.220
One, what is the Frontend?

18
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.279
It could be so many things.

19
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.495
If you're programming for, I don't know,
a Tesla, is that not a front-end,

20
00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:48.967
something you interact with?

21
00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.755
You're programming, I don't know,
a refrigerator, a tablet for

22
00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:56.090
your refrigerator, that's the frontend.

23
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.700
Browsers, desktops, mobile devices.

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.840
Frontend is such a broad category
that it's really hard to say

25
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.400
this is one thing for
frontend and it's only this.

26
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300
No, no, it's so many broad things.

27
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.560
And of all the parts of engineering,
UI is probably one of the newest.

28
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.610
Yeah, it's 20, 30 years old,
around there, maybe a little bit older.

29
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.860
But in terms of other
parts of computer science,

30
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.840
the frontend is still very new and
it's evolving quickly.

31
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.900
Also what makes front end interviewing,
it's crazy broad.

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.460
It's so huge.

33
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010
The topics we can cover.

34
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.470
If I said HTTP headers, that's front end.

35
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.280
That's definitely something you deal with.

36
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.530
Actually anything with HTTP I would
expect you might have to know as

37
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.540
a front end engineer
depending on your job.

38
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.200
Accessibility, workers,

39
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.280
any sort, browser compatibilities,
CSS, I can

40
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.410
keep going of the things like you might
have to cover in Frontend engineering.

41
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.680
And you can say, yeah, these are valid
Frontend engineering questions.

42
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.665
Yes.

43
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:06.170
&gt;&gt; The online they're saying
that it's a ton of different

44
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.840
things that are lumped together
as quote unquote one skill set.

45
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.020
&gt;&gt; Yes, and we don't know what those those
are because again, we don't understand

46
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
what frontend engineering is half
the time that's a lot of the problem.

47
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.170
So collectively we agree
there's a problem.

48
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.640
And another problem,
I think this is hilarious.

49
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.910
I'm not laughing, I'm laughing inside.

50
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.240
Another one problem is we all
have a different idea about

51
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.140
what the core concepts are.

52
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.490
Something as foundational
as scope in JavaScript I

53
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.920
tweeted this out the other day,
I got so many responses from people,

54
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.030
much more response than my dog pictures,
I'm very disappointed with the Internet.

55
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.560
Then I got response from
engineers weighing in, in much,

56
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.200
much smarter engineers than me.

57
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.550
And they all had a slightly different
definition about what scope is

58
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.060
in JavaScript.

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.280
That's part of the problem is,

60
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.620
we don't share this collective language
about what front end engineering is.

61
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.980
Heck, we don't even understand
the core concepts of JavaScript and

62
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.400
just saying that in a universal way.

63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.710
And that's a lot of the problem too.

64
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.430
My idea of how to build a website is
probably different from your idea of how

65
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.450
to build a website.

66
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.500
So how do we get past that?

67
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.890
How do we establish this
kind of level field

68
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.290
where we understand what
we're talking about.

69
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.340
We can communicate effectively.
