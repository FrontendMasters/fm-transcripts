00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:04.877
Now we're to the on-site portion,

2
00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:08.723
the part where we all think
all of the interviewing lies.

3
00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.520
And a lot of it does,
cuz this is the final step.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.749
Usually it's the on-site, and
then you either pass or you fail.

5
00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.172
You get an offer or you don't.

6
00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:18.833
And this is the part where
everybody has anxiety.

7
00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.317
So we're gonna cover a lot
of JavaScript questions.

8
00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:25.730
We're gonna cover JavaScript fundamentals,
things that are relevant.

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.989
But we're also gonna cover as
the interviewer, what am I looking for

10
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.610
when I ask this question?

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.144
What does it tell me about
their engineering background?

12
00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:35.792
What does it tell me
about their skill set?

13
00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.110
What does it tell about how they think?

14
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.520
And as the candidate,
you're trying to give the best showing.

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.620
Cuz as my friend Brian Holt once said,
when you get this far into the company,

16
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.830
they wanna hire you.

17
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.753
They obviously need a talented engineer.

18
00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:52.605
So they're really just looking for
a reason not to hire you and

19
00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.464
don't give them the reason.

20
00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:58.760
Remember, think out loud,
solve the problems, and write it all out.

21
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.270
But above all, practice doing this on
a piece of paper, not on a computer.

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.246
The on-site, the part you've all
been waiting for, it's writing,

23
00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:10.175
depending on how confident
you feel in your skills.

24
00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:14.259
Or how confident you feel in me
that I won't try to trick you.

25
00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.818
Which is always tempting to trick people,
but I'm not going to today.

26
00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:22.780
We're gonna cover about nine or
ten problems that I think represent

27
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.260
a good breadth of skills as a UI engineer,
as a JavaScript engineer.

28
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.709
They're not gonna be all encompassing,
I can't possibly answer and

29
00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.041
ask every single question
you're ever gonna get.

30
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:38.244
But hopefully, when you have real
life interviews with real companies,

31
00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:40.225
you'll see variations of these.

32
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.487
Or if you're only gonna see variations,

33
00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:45.534
understand the skills of
what we're looking for here.

34
00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:48.560
And understand these core concepts
that you should really know.
