00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.259
So to prepare the application,
cuz we're starting at step one,

2
00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.186
let's talk about your resume.

3
00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:12.498
Yeah, Jem, this is front-end interviewing
course, why aren't we doing problems yet?

4
00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:16.345
Again, you gotta get in there first
before you can solve these problems.

5
00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:19.090
So your resume should be one page.

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.288
Unless you're a, I don't know,
accomplished Nobel laureate and

7
00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:26.091
you've got 20 patents to your name,
even 20 patents,

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.742
you can probably cut that down to 5,
the 5 good ones.

9
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:34.030
But you want one page, because as
a hiring manager or a recruiter you're

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.820
looking at thousands of resumes, thousands
and thousands and thousands of resumes.

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.740
So you want it quick and to the point.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.454
You wanna list your skills,
you wanna list your experience,

13
00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:43.978
the companies you've worked at.

14
00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:47.859
You wanna look at your, they wanna
see your technology familiarity,

15
00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.200
what sort of stacks have you worked with?

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.240
They might wanna see your education.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.482
Some companies have a hard requirement
on CS, on a computer science degree,

18
00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.865
some companies don't.

19
00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:03.146
That is, we could do a whole other
course on do you need a CS degree for

20
00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.690
front-end engineering, or any engineering?

21
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.380
Different time, different place.

22
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.539
But some people wanna know your education,
or any boot camps you went to,

23
00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.700
any sort of certifications you have.

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.530
They wanna know your accomplishments,
and that's it.

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.045
You can gussy this up,
this is a snippet of my resume.

26
00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:28.803
So I'm not lying to you, if I was applying
for a job this is what I'd send out.

27
00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:31.409
But that's it,
don't overthink it too much,

28
00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.333
don't spend too much time making it
pretty with graphics and all that.

29
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.757
You can if you want,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

30
00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:40.200
Actually, I am gonna tell you what to do,
don't do that.

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.060
Spend your time getting to
the core requirements of what

32
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.770
someone's looking for.

33
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.040
So remember, think empathy, think, what
is the person who is trying to hire me or

34
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.890
hire your engineers,
what are they gonna look at?

35
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.184
And if you had to do that 1,000 times,
what do you wanna see,

36
00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:55.830
what's gonna jump out
to you really quickly?
