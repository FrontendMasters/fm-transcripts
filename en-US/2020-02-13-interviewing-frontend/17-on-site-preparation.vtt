1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.030
Nice job.

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.500
Congratulations, you're
moving on to the next round.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.113
You're now on to the on-site.

4
00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:10.538
The on-site is,
when people think about interviewing,

5
00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:15.450
they think on-site, they think
whiteboarding, that's what they think of.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.660
Nobody thinks that the other steps.

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.044
But like we said earlier,
most people won't get to the on-site.

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.970
Even if you do,
it's going to be a bit challenging and

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.970
we're going to try to solve that today.

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.760
But really, getting to the on-site
is an achievement in itself.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.250
You should be proud of yourself if,
even if you bomb completely.

12
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.990
That's okay.

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.870
At least you have the opportunity to
interview with some really good engineers,

14
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.410
hopefully that really good engineers.

15
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.280
And hopefully you take something away and
you learn something from that.

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000
So if you made it this far,
give yourself a round.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.620
Nice job.

18
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.170
You made it to the outside.

19
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620
Now let's talk about the things you want
to prepare for, for the onsite interview.

20
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.510
practice writing code without a computer,
on a piece of paper on a whiteboard.

21
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.710
If you have one, you have a fancy house or
something I don't know.

22
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.070
I don't have room in my tiny
San Cisco partner for whiteboard.

23
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.110
So I do things on piece of paper.

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.740
And all the exercise we're going to
do today during the on-site portion.

25
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.510
I want you to do on a piece of paper
because that's how you'll be doing it real

26
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.720
life or whiteboard.

27
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.150
If you happen to have one your fancy,
but do all these paper because

28
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.300
generally there won't be any computers
help you there's no linters.

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.890
There's no internet to look up and
honestly it slows you down.

30
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190
Writing a piece paper is more
flexible because I can draw,

31
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.650
I can cross stuff out and
I can think a bit more flexibly.

32
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.020
And that's what you'd be doing things.

33
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.530
I get whiteboard anxiety.

34
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.900
I know someone standing there watching me,
so

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.090
it's better just to like practice solving
problems and saying them out loud.

36
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.750
Another tip is to go over
general sample problems.

37
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.140
Kind of like the ones I'm gonna give
you or ones you can look up online.

38
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.520
Practice doing those
without a computer and

39
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.310
don't focus on the solutions,
focus on how you got there.

40
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.920
Cuz I promise you probably won't see
the same questions over and over again.

41
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.390
You'll see some, there's always
be something you haven't seen.

42
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.200
It's important to learn how
to break down a problem and

43
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
say What are they looking for
in the specific problem?

44
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.770
How would I break that down,
how would I explain that to somebody?

45
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.390
Because at some point, you're gonna
get stuck, you're gonna get stuck and

46
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.770
you're gonna get freezed, and
you don't know what to do next.

47
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.310
And practicing helps
alleviate some of that.

48
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.470
Ask your friends to test you.

49
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.550
Do a video chat, call a stranger.

50
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.610
There are actually companies out there
that will Live interview you as practice.

51
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.560
Take advantage of that.

52
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.900
It is a different scenario.

53
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.240
You're like, I aced this.

54
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.750
I got all these questions right.

55
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.390
I nailed them.

56
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210
Jem, he doesn't know he's talking.

57
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.310
I'm way smarter than him.

58
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400
I solved all these problems, no problem.

59
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.190
And then you get up to the whiteboard and
there's two people watching you and

60
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.790
you're like, aah.

61
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.500
How do I implement binary search?

62
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.200
I know how to do this.

63
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.800
I've done it before,
but you just freeze up.

64
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.290
So get someone else to test you.

65
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.870
It changes your perspective on
things.And if they will ask what

66
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.070
style of technical questions
Is it going to be?

67
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.580
Is it going to be Html, CSS,
we're actually building something.

68
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.260
Is it going to be high level component
design like I'm designing a component that

69
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.110
other engineers will use?

70
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.010
Are they going to be
algorithmic questions?

71
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.910
Usually, the interviewer will tell you and
they'll tell you kind of what to expect,

72
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.900
like some algorithms some of this or
they'll be.

73
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.170
They're all just relevent JavaScript
problems that you're gonna solve.

74
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.490
Try to get assessment ahead of time.

75
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.330
If it's a lot of algorithms,
study algorithms.

76
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.790
If it's a lot of JavaScript questions,

77
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.710
make sure you know JavaScript foundations,
things like that.

78
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.970
Just try to like ask at a time.

79
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.458
It'll help you get rid of some of
the nervousness if you know what's coming.

80
00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:44.310
So, this is something you
will do in your career.

81
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.050
As an engineer.

82
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.800
You may not ever do a phone screen or
have to create a code tests or

83
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.520
even talk to a candidate on the phone.

84
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.450
You will interview someone,
if you haven't already.

85
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.740
What I really want you to take away
as the interviewer is empathy.

86
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.040
Remember what it's like to interview and
remember how much it sucks.

87
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.650
And try to be the person that gives
the best possible interview as possible.

88
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.560
Yes, that's possible with you.

89
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.850
You figured it completely wrong,

90
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.870
you want them to walk away saying,
that was a good experience.

91
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.980
I learned some things,

92
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.600
clearly I have some learnings to do
before I'm qualified to get this job.

93
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.190
But you want to walk away
with that experience?

94
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.720
Not that Jen was a jerk,he
didn't help at all,he

95
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.990
was typing on his computer all the time.

96
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.020
He's I think he's on Twitter,
making fun of me maybe, like,

97
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.360
yeah, which I want to know.

98
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.160
Like, you want them to

99
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.950
have the best possible experience because
interviewing sucks and we can do better.

100
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.810
It's just a We get there on
the other side of the table and

101
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.350
it's like we forget what it's
like in all the hours of work.

102
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.480
It's like to get to where this person is.

103
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.410
And remember that you are one of seven or
eight people, maybe even 10 or

104
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.360
20 that they're gonna
talk to you in the day.

105
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.590
So don't try to stand out and

106
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.660
remember interviews are not
about showing how smart you are.

107
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.040
You're trying to say is this
person Good to work with.

108
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.400
Do I understand the way they think?

109
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.500
Do I agree with the way
they solve problems?

110
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.720
Is it a way that I think will
fit in with this company?

111
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.500
The first thing to do is make sure they
questions are relevent to the role.

112
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.190
Are these questions that you've had
to solve in a real life scenario?

113
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.100
If so it's probably a good question.

114
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.340
These are this is a problem
you've had to solve before.

115
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.130
But if it's an arbitrary algorithm problem
that's fine if you want if you look for

116
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.550
someone to memorize problems and
solutions, but it's not gonna really tell

117
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.110
me how they think it tells me they're
good at memorizing algorithms.

118
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.870
I want questions that
you've run into edge cases.

119
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.770
How do I render a list with a million
items, or something like that?

120
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.070
How do I paginate something?

121
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.480
Things that we've done as UI engineers.

122
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.520
These are relevant to being a UI engineer.

123
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.230
Have backup interviewers, again, empathy.

124
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.320
They spend a long time and
a lot of work, and a lot of stress and

125
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.260
anxiety to get to the on-site If you're
like, we're gonna reschedule because

126
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.600
blah blah blahs out sick or
react to pull someone at the last minute

127
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.390
who was not prepared to give
an interview their heads down a problem.

128
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.150
They're going to Google some like
JavaScript interview questions

129
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.590
real quick have backup interviewers.

130
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.800
Let them know that their the backup or

131
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.410
have ideally have two
people do an interview.

132
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.400
I always recommend to people.

133
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.340
Doing an interview because one,
it eliminates bias.

134
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.180
Two I didn't like that guy.

135
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.110
He's an Eagles fan.

136
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.470
I don't like Eagles fan.

137
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.840
But developers say well,
I thought they did pretty well.

138
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.900
I think you have a little bit of bias.

139
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.530
But generally try to have two people.

140
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.140
If your company has the size
of engineering to do that.

141
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.380
It really helps get up more
even A more even interview.

142
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.600
Book the room for the entire day.

143
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.180
Again, you're stressed out the mechanics
stressed out, they're sweating,

144
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.730
they're nervous, they may have got
the problem right they may have gotten

145
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.480
wrong they don't know yet
you won't know until finish.

146
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.070
But having them move around and
grab their backpack and all this stuff and

147
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.680
shuffle around.

148
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.430
That's not helpful.

149
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.240
Have them book the room for the day.

150
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.360
Make sure you have plenty of time for
breaks, bathroom, lunch,

151
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.150
if they're there all day.

152
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.580
Make sure they have drinks, snacks
like anything they need to make them

153
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.050
comfortable as comfortable as possible.

154
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.620
Because again, interviewing sucks,
but you can help make it better

155
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.580
really easily just by being friendly and
giving plenty of time.

156
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.260
But above all,

157
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.260
remember, it is not about you is about
the person on the other side of the room.

158
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.980
There's an old saying that
A player's hire A players,

159
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.640
B players hire C players, C players
hire D players and so on and so forth.

160
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.710
Because known when we interview we
often like this person smarter than me.

161
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.920
I am intimidated by that.

162
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.290
As your ego gets in the way, and

163
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.190
I say these things because i have been
guilty of this and asked trivia questions.

164
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.790
I have given poor interviews in the past,
because my ego is in the way.

165
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.460
No, you want to work with people
that are smarter than you,

166
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.520
because they'll make you smarter.

167
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.510
They are not going to make you look bad.

168
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.440
That is what you are worried about, but
they are going to make you smarter.

169
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.920
Ideally, everybody's smarter than you and

170
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.810
they help raise you up because you want
to be the best interviewer you can.

171
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.060
That's why you're taking this course,
right?

172
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.100
So again, you can discard everything
else I've said if you remember empathy.

173
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.030
Just remember what it's like
on the other side of that.

174
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.860
And it's really hard to do especially
when you've been with the company for

175
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.569
a couple of years cuz you're like, I don't
even remember what it's like to interview.

176
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.390
But if that's the case,
go out and interview and

177
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.100
remember what it's like, You will
come back with a lot more empathy.
