00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.300
Timing and JavaScript, this is,
I try not to say which

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.740
companies gave me these questions, because
there's a lot of them that I've talked to.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.070
But this is a real company,
it's a big one.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.510
That's not helpful at all.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.170
This is a real problem that I
have solved before about timing.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.660
But to start with timing,

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.660
what do we know about how to
schedule things in JavaScript?

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.250
So let's say I wanted something
to happen every 200 milliseconds.

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.530
How would I do that in JavaScript?

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.976
Let's say I wanna print hello world
every 200 milliseconds in JavaScript,

11
00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:37.111
how would I do that?

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.280
&gt;&gt; setInterval.
&gt;&gt; setInterval, that's right.

13
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.314
setInterval, have something happen
on a loop until you cancel it.

14
00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:47.175
So if I say setInterval, it'll execute
some function at x milliseconds.

15
00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:52.011
setTimeout means it'll wait whatever
seconds, 500, whatever you pass in, and

16
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:53.632
then it'll that function.

17
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.251
So those are the two ways of
doing timing in JavaScript.

18
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:00.388
We'll talk about request
animation frame for

19
00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:06.040
a different sort of timing, but
I didn't wanna mix that up into here.

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.733
All right, so talking about timing,
what is debounce?

21
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:17.480
&gt;&gt; It's a way to throttle things, so
you don't do it too much, I guess.

22
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right,
it's a way of slowing something down.

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.150
A good way of thinking about
debounce is autocomplete search.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.474
I don't want every single character
that I type to be firing off requests.

25
00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:33.912
So if I'm typing,
how do I become tall like Jem,

26
00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:35.877
that means as long as that sentence is,

27
00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:39.763
that means I'm firing off every single
request, so we wanna debounce that.

28
00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:43.410
So we wanna set the debounce to,
say, 500 milliseconds.

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.303
So that means,
whenever someone stops typing,

30
00:01:45.303 --> 00:01:46.926
that's when the debounce is gonna fire.

31
00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:50.130
So let's implement debounce.

32
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.150
I actually got this one on
a phone screen not too long ago.

33
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.340
So I'm not just making these
questions up to be hard.

34
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.430
These are real questions that people ask.

35
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.601
And it's a fascinating insight
into someone's understanding,

36
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.362
setting my debounce.

37
00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:13.180
I'll give you a hint, you're gonna
need either setInterval or setTimeout.

38
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.830
I would probably use setTimeout,
but you do you.
