00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.289
At the some point in
the interview process,

2
00:00:02.289 --> 00:00:05.123
you're going to have to do probably
a phone screen or a code test.

3
00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:10.118
A lot of companies that I've interviewed
before do phone screens because it's

4
00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:13.857
a good chance to have an engineer
talk to another engineer.

5
00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:17.475
So usually it's over video or
it might just be over telephone.

6
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:22.078
But, really, it's a chance to kind of
meet your first reach out on both sides.

7
00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:24.687
You meet the kind of person
you're gonna be working with.

8
00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:31.115
You meet and you kind of understand
what sort of questions do they ask.

9
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:32.721
How do they word questions?

10
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:33.963
How friendly are they?

11
00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:36.431
Do they joke around a lot,
and like kind of relax?

12
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:40.511
Are they very, very stiff and
vary by the book.

13
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:42.935
And all these things will depend and
it's a good chance for

14
00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.062
you as the candidates to get a feel for
the company,

15
00:00:45.062 --> 00:00:48.004
it's a good chance as the interviewer
to get a feel for the candidate.

16
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.341
Are they at ease when they code?

17
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:52.880
Are they relaxed?

18
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.200
But hopefully, you'll give them the option
of the phone screen to code test.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.285
A lot of times, I prefer the phone screen,
we get right to it.

20
00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:03.767
I don't spend any extra of
my time doing code test.

21
00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:08.799
Phone screens generally, say 30 minutes
to an hour, somewhere in there.

22
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.205
And they're done live coding.

23
00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.018
So, some people that get a little nervous,

24
00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:17.067
it's good to practice these things
which we're gonna do in a little bit.

25
00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:21.539
But really kind of get the nerves out life
code it's really helpful to kind of see

26
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.434
how someone works through a problem
when I'm giving a phone screen.

27
00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:31.918
As the candidate for phone screen, when
you're in the middle of it ask questions.

28
00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:35.216
I really want someone to ask me
questions like hey, can I do this?

29
00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:36.151
Should I do this?

30
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:37.670
Is this the right way?

31
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.480
Not too many questions for it's like well
now I'm just solving the problem for you.

32
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.729
But I want someone to ask me questions
cuz that's how it is in real life.

33
00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.451
No one assigns your projects and
like good luck see you in a month.

34
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:52.660
No, you have the dialogue and
that's what I want it with the coterie and

35
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.568
that's what you should try to
establish with the interviewer.

36
00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:56.891
Are they helpful?

37
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:58.906
Or are they dismissive.

38
00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.149
Are they friendly and outgoing, you're
like, I understand, phone screens suck,

39
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.878
interviews suck.

40
00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:07.232
And they're friendly, or there always
like, this is a waste of my time,

41
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:09.283
I can't believe I'm doing this.

42
00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:12.775
Why, doesn't this person
understand what I'm talking about?

43
00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:16.057
These are things you should vet out during
the phone screen, so ask questions.

44
00:02:16.057 --> 00:02:19.715
Talk out your solution,
especially if you get stuck.

45
00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:20.960
It does not help anybody.

46
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.787
If you're sitting there
thinking inside your head.

47
00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:25.410
You have to talk out
loud in any interview.

48
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.491
That's what you have to do you
want to establish here's how I'm

49
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:29.816
thinking about a problem.

50
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:34.360
And you might be absolutely right
the interview say yeah, good thinking.

51
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.712
Yeah, no,
I think you're on the right path here or

52
00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:38.698
they might be like you're way off course.

53
00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:40.548
And the way you're thinking about
the problem is completely wrong.

54
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.419
And here's a better way to think about it.

55
00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.091
But either way, you can't get
there unless you talk out loud and

56
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.099
talk about how you're
thinking about the problem.

57
00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.319
And get comfortable in the environment.

58
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.611
If using code pen or code tests,
there's a lot of them.

59
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.285
Ask ahead of time,

60
00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:00.082
they'll generally send you a link to
the environment you're gonna be using.

61
00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:01.825
They'll say it's a CodePen link,
or something like that.

62
00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:04.603
Get comfortable,
understand the debugging scenario there.

63
00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:06.361
Some environments, you can debug.

64
00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.467
Some environments,
it's challenging to debug.

65
00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.075
But understand that,
are you gonna be running the code live?

66
00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:13.933
Is it gonna output something, or
is it just, they wanna see how you code?

67
00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:18.229
That's not necessarily
gonna be executable.

68
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.976
As the interviewer for the phone screen,
are you in a quiet area?

69
00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:26.961
Being in a quiet area is just respectful,
they took an hour of the day as busy

70
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.202
people to do this phone screen the least
you can do is give them something quiet,

71
00:03:31.202 --> 00:03:33.637
not people find ping
pong in the background.

72
00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:37.526
I once had a terrible call and
this wasn't the phone screen,

73
00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:41.350
this was recruiter, but
I was like, I can barely hear you.

74
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.218
It's like, my name's blah, blah,
blah I'm with blah, blah, blah company.

75
00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:47.177
I'm like, I can't hear you.

76
00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:48.113
Sorry we're in a WeWork.

77
00:03:48.113 --> 00:03:51.939
I'm like, cool,
we work with the glass walls.

78
00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.847
But that's not my problem.

79
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:57.564
Your job is to have this conversation
with me, the least you could do is

80
00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:00.533
be respectful and
be in a quiet area where I can hear you.

81
00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.011
That's not too unreasonable [LAUGH].

82
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.820
And the only thing to ask on their phone
screen is, is the problem well worded?

83
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.608
Are they gonna spend 15 minutes or are you
gonna spend 15 minutes of that an hour or

84
00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:14.453
45 minute time explaining
the problem to them?

85
00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:16.892
If so, that's probably not a good problem.

86
00:04:16.892 --> 00:04:19.603
They should be very clear and
very concise about what they need to do,

87
00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:21.866
what they need to execute on,
what you're looking for.

88
00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:25.509
Ideally, two three minutes at most.

89
00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.303
It should be a very
straightforward problem.

90
00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:31.308
Does the candidate know what
the requirements and restrictions are?

91
00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:35.370
Did you say hey, you can't use jQuery,
you can't use React,

92
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.365
you can't use any libraries.

93
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.535
It's just pure vanilla JavaScript.

94
00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:42.242
Or hey, you can import whatever you want,
whatever gets the job done.

95
00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:43.942
But does the candidate know that?

96
00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:46.476
Make sure they know when you're
giving that interview or

97
00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:49.449
you're given a phone screen,
what exactly you're looking for.

98
00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.465
And did you leave time for
question at the end?

99
00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:56.500
You should always leave time for
question at the end, always.

100
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.800
Again, you're not even
trying to establish.

101
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.314
Can they solve this problem?

102
00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:02.743
We're trying to understand
how do they think?

103
00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:04.474
Are they capable of moving
on to the outside world?

104
00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:06.748
We'll establish,
can they solve these problems?

105
00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:09.380
What we're really trying to get to
how they think about a problem,

106
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.154
how they approach it, do they ask
a lot of questions things like that.

107
00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:15.164
But it's these dialogue, so the dialogue
needs to go back the other way.

108
00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:17.067
Leaves time for questions at the end.

109
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:21.497
Make sure it doesn't matter if you're
like, we got 45 minutes and so

110
00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:22.615
we ran out of time.

111
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:24.168
Again, it's about respect.

112
00:05:24.168 --> 00:05:25.412
It's about empathy.

113
00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:27.614
If I'm talking to someone I want to know,
well,

114
00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:29.350
how long have you been at the company?

115
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.268
I want to know what the SEC is.

116
00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:33.164
What team are you on?

117
00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:34.689
Are you even the UI engineer,

118
00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.904
oftentimes they may not be you might get
a generic general engineering question.

119
00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.429
You might get a front end question.

120
00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:43.313
It might be someone that it's their
first time giving a phone screen.

121
00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:46.674
All these things, but you wanna give time
for questions at the end because again,

122
00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:48.584
it's about the dialogue
between two people.

123
00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:51.818
Yes.

124
00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:56.474
&gt;&gt; Is it good practice as a candidate
to ask the interviewer what type of

125
00:05:56.474 --> 00:05:58.689
questions they're gonna ask?

126
00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:59.199
&gt;&gt; Yes.

127
00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.682
And we'll talk about that for the on-site.

128
00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:04.570
The phone screen, they may not tell you or
they might tell you.

129
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.728
I know it's not helpful at all.

130
00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:10.131
Some companies will say, hey,
it's a frontend focus question so

131
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.148
you're gonna be building something.

132
00:06:12.148 --> 00:06:15.268
Or they might say,
it's a general CS problem,

133
00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:18.935
kind of a leaked code style
general CS problem solving.

134
00:06:18.935 --> 00:06:20.158
It doesn't what's the language.

135
00:06:20.158 --> 00:06:23.228
But that's a great question,
asked what language can I code in?

136
00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:26.617
Some places,
they're like our problem is in Python.

137
00:06:26.617 --> 00:06:31.134
I'm like cool, I don't do Python,
I'm a JavaScript engineer.

138
00:06:31.134 --> 00:06:33.805
But that's a great question you
should ask this ahead of time.

139
00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:37.159
And generally you gonna
get two types of problems,

140
00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.371
they're gonna CS style general
Leech ODZ medium around there or

141
00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:46.687
your gonna get specific UI problems like
build carousel or something like that.

142
00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:49.260
Which, 45 minutes, I think?
