00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.860
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So for this exercise,
let's test some web pages and

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.570
focus just on the keyboard.

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.810
Like any web page, any application,
just start tabbing through and

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.290
see if you get stuck anywhere.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.282
Try to not use your track-pad or
your mouse and see kind of like

6
00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:23.185
what What you encounter,
how did your keyboard testing go?

7
00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:28.780
It's pretty wild how pervasive
keyboard issues are.

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.517
Like if you could turn your mouse off,
like have no mouse Fridays or

9
00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:36.055
no mouse Mondays or something and
have your whole team do that,

10
00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.024
I think it would make a big impact.

11
00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:42.054
Just because It's amazing
to me how few websites and

12
00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:45.450
web applications do support the keyboard.

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.420
And it really is something
that benefits all of us.

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.624
So for our next few exercises.

15
00:00:50.624 --> 00:00:55.570
I'm gonna set a few up and then we're
gonna do another debugging break.

16
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.240
Where you'll go do some testing on your
own but you can test multiple things and

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.880
kind of play around with
whatever you wanna focus on.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.840
So the first thing is to
run a browser extension.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.228
So you could have AXE, either in Chrome or
Firefox, Accessibility Insights,

20
00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:13.174
I think it's Chrome,
maybe Firefox, Lighthouse,

21
00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:17.121
which is another tool that you could
test performance at the same time.

22
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:22.005
Both lighthouse and Accessibility Insights
use the AXE core API

23
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:26.460
under the hood, so
it's really similar rule set.

24
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.180
If you want to change you a completely
different accessibility rule set,

25
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.280
you could use the WAVE extensions.

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.025
And then there's a color contrast
extension called NoCoffee.

27
00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:38.980
You can simulate with someone
who has a color deficiency or

28
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.520
just sees colors differently.

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.510
You can simulate, that's pretty common.

30
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.210
So browser extensions, you could test
with the accessibility developer tools.

31
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.740
And I use these together.

32
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.530
So the reason I'm telling you about these
at the same time is that often I will

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.310
switch back and

34
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.250
forth between an accessibility browser
extension and the developer tools.

35
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.750
And Chrome, which I'll show you another
tool that I like a lot here in a second.

36
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.900
They have this color picker and the
accessibility pane that we saw earlier.

37
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.940
There's also some new tools in Firefox.

38
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.616
They have an accessibility inspector and
some color contrast stuff.

39
00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:21.668
And in the slides are links to more
information from the Chrome team and

40
00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:26.150
Mozilla about if you need
help setting those up.

41
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.420
So let's look real quickly
at this color picker.

42
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.130
So if I inspect in Chrome, and
I pull up an element that has a color,

43
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.300
if I click on that and
open this color picker dialog,

44
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.610
it has a contrast ratio indicator
right in the color picker.

45
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.880
Which is outstanding to me, I'm so
excited about this color picker.

46
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.820
So it will tell you the contrast ratio.

47
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.800
So the ratio refers to the colors in
the foreground and the background.

48
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.590
So there needs to be enough of
a difference in those colors.

49
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.410
That's how we can tell how color
will stand out on its background.

50
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.690
So for these links they're dark gray
on white, they have great contrast.

51
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.816
The ratio is 12.63 to 1.

52
00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:11.230
So it's always a comparison
of the ratio of to one.

53
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.344
And there's two levels indicated here,
double A and triple A.

54
00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:19.054
And we're not really getting into
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

55
00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:21.961
really at all today, or
the legal space at all.

56
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:28.290
But the double A and triple A levels
are thresholds that you can aim for.

57
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.909
A double A is less stringent than triple
A, if you can hit triple A, amazing.

58
00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.658
But double A tends to be a standard in
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

59
00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:42.842
And that just means that your
contrast ratio 4.5 to one for

60
00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:47.040
small non bold text and 3 to 1 for
larger text and bold text.

61
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.997
And this contrast ratio,
I can go and drag it around and

62
00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.940
see what colors,
like how they change the ratio.

63
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.520
So if I had a color that
wasn't passing I could do and

64
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.640
drag it on this color picker and sometimes
it just means tweaking it slightly so

65
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.990
that your design team doesn't know.

66
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.100
You have to go back to them and be like,
you know these colors don't pass if

67
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.370
you can kind of squeak it in there,
maybe they won't know.

68
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.380
But maybe it's a brand color,
that's a bigger conversation.

69
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.420
But this tool just being able to play
with the colors in the dev tools

70
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.490
is a game changer.

71
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.425
So that's that, I close the dev tools and
keyboard shortcut is

72
00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:31.950
Option+Command+I on the Mac and
on Windows is Control+Shift+I.

73
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.470
That's how I toggle it with the keyboard.

74
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.000
So also some testing with screen readers.

75
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.310
I have the cheat sheets for
voiceover, NVDA and jaws.

76
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.760
So jaws is another window screen reader.

77
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.428
I changed my text color.

78
00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:47.752
Refresh it.

79
00:04:47.752 --> 00:04:53.420
[LAUGH] JAWS is super common with people
who rely on assistive technology.

80
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.280
NVDA is really similar, like they both
works similarly, and NVDA is free and

81
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.080
open source, so I'd probably start there.

82
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.700
But I included both cheat sheets
just because JAWS is so common.

83
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.620
So we'll play with that a little bit and
really what I'm looking for

84
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.510
with testing with screen readers is just
turn it on and start navigating around.

85
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.732
Refer to the cheat sheets for just how to
navigate through elements, screen readers.

86
00:05:20.732 --> 00:05:23.214
You don't need to make
everything focusable,

87
00:05:23.214 --> 00:05:25.580
because they have other
ways of navigating.

88
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.200
Like going through headings,
going through landmark elements and

89
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.530
various things on the page.

90
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.569
And the cheat sheets will tell you
what the commands are for those.

91
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.830
And some combinations for
screen reader testing, OS10, voiceover and

92
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.520
Safari are really common.

93
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.939
Like, I would recommend using Safari
before Chrome with voiceover,

94
00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.710
just because that is what people
who use it would be using.

95
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.050
NVDA and Firefox on Windows.

96
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.620
NVDA works with a lot of different things,
you could probably use it with Chrome.

97
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.500
I tend to test it with Firefox on Windows.

98
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.990
JAWS and IE11 or Edge on Windows.

99
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.170
IE11 still kicking around,
mainly because of the support with JAWS.

100
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.310
If you have an iPhone or
an IOS device, voiceover and

101
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.570
Safari on mobile is a really
good thing to play with.

102
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.540
And so that's an interesting interface.

103
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.120
You can go into your operating system and

104
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.680
turn on the setting to just
triple tap the home button.

105
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.460
That's how I turned it on.

106
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.460
Android accessibility was
formerly called talkback,

107
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.850
that's the screen reader
on Android devices.

108
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.379
And then if you're hold out on Linux,

109
00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.473
there is a screen reader
on Linux called Orca.

110
00:06:34.473 --> 00:06:38.967
And then the last thing you could play
with would be magnification, so zoom in,

111
00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:40.120
zoom all the way in.

112
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.580
Like if I hit Command plus and I go way
in, and I can go all the way to 500%.

113
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.612
And actually, I've used relative font
sizes here, so mine actually will resize.

114
00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:57.070
So if you're using pixel font sizes you
might see that it doesn't want a resize.

115
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.150
So you might want to change
it to relative Ms or M units.

116
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.500
There's also the operating
operating system level Zoom.

117
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.280
There is assistive technology that
people use, like Zoom text, so

118
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.010
we can play with that.

119
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.330
So yeah, we will test with magnification,

120
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.950
screen readers, Dev Tools and
browser extensions.
