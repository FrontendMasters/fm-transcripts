00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.430
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Let's go test that and

2
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.330
just make sure I've got
this logic correctly.

3
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.540
Pretty sure that's it.

4
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.880
So I've got in this,
here's the Linton output, by the way.

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.751
I need to go report some
issues to that repo.

6
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:18.881
So I'm going to kill my development server
on my Gatsby site just because I'm gonna

7
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:22.150
run tests and
I'd rather use this terminal NVS code.

8
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.360
So to run the test,
I'm just gonna say npm test.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.846
And I'll show you briefly
where that script live.

10
00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:33.060
So in package.json,
I've got this script section and

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.050
npm run test or
npm test just run the jest test.

12
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.660
So that's what we want.

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.747
So I'm gonna open.

14
00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:43.370
Let's back up.

15
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.820
So jest it's gonna fire up.

16
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.500
It's going to import that component.

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.020
Okay, cool.

18
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.520
So that has been focused.

19
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.930
And maybe I could like because
I didn't do this with TDD or

20
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.492
test driven development,
maybe I just changed it to a div.

21
00:00:57.492 --> 00:01:00.480
I just want to see,
is it gonna fail the test?

22
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.508
It did, awesome.

23
00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:03.720
Okay, so thank you.

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.730
They have wrote a really awesome API for
jest and that's why it's awesome.

25
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.020
That's why it's great because it is
actually, this is a good accessibility

26
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.880
test because if that focus of all element,
get swapped out for something else.

27
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.680
Ta-da, they broke the tests,
so it's pretty cool.

28
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.070
Okay, let's go back to a button.

29
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.130
So now I'm gonna go back here.

30
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.070
I've got that focus.

31
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.436
So that's the condition number one and
maybe I could separate these into

32
00:01:30.436 --> 00:01:32.720
different tests but
I'm just gonna keep going.

33
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.897
So now I want to activate the dropdown.

34
00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:41.660
So I'm gonna say, activator.click
just to fire that event, I believe.

35
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.217
Or is it a fireEvent?

36
00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:45.110
Let's go look at that.

37
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.810
This is a lot of what you actually
have to do with testing and

38
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.134
go look at the hip hop's.

39
00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:54.470
So fireEvent takes the element
that you want to fire

40
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.804
the event on and
then the event that you want to happen.

41
00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:03.430
So fireEvent.click,

42
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.105
pass in the element, and
then the event objects.

43
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:12.868
So this is where if we were doing key up
or a key up test or something where we

44
00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:17.729
would pass in the key code, or the key,
that's what we'll end up using.

45
00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.506
But I'm just doing a click here so

46
00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:25.672
it would just be fireEvent.click and
then I pass activator.

47
00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:31.130
And I believe that's it cuz I don't
care really about the event object.

48
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.014
That how you could pass something else in.

49
00:02:34.014 --> 00:02:35.870
Let's go see.

50
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.280
I'm gonna run npm test.

51
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.660
Let's see, no, it did not like that.

52
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.620
It made it very angry.

53
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.270
Let's go see.

54
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.787
It cannot read property focus of null.

55
00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:53.634
So interestingly enough,

56
00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:58.630
we're getting in here for
the use effect rand.

57
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.627
So right now I'm looking at the test
result is inside of the is open,

58
00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:04.251
the part of the use effect.

59
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.700
So that means that it's actually
like running that code.

60
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.180
So that's interesting.

61
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.580
But why is dropdownListRef undefined?

62
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.510
It's kind of peculiar.

63
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.160
Let's go see.

64
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.431
So fireEvent.click the activator.

65
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.410
Gosh, okay, so dropdownListRef.

66
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.760
I mean, in my logic,
I could address this just by saying,

67
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.010
if (dropdownListRef), if that exist,
maybe that would work.

68
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.700
Let's try it.

69
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.293
So thinking that through,
maybe the use effect hook what

70
00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:50.581
that's supposed to do is
wait until it's rendered.

71
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:55.145
It waits until that state variable is
change and then it does things like focus.

72
00:03:55.145 --> 00:04:00.090
I don't think it was actually
failing on the focus part.

73
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.380
No, it is.

74
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.731
Cannot read property 'focus' of null.

75
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:09.044
So the ref itself is coming up null,
which could happen sometimes like if

76
00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:14.720
you had a CSS animation that wasn't ready
yet and before the use effect took.

77
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.530
I saw this a lot where I'd have to do
really gross hacks like a set time out or

78
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.360
something and wait until it's fully
open and then I could send focus.

79
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.830
But that's not really what's
supposed to be happening here.

80
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.440
So this might pass the test,
we'll see, no, it shouldn't.

81
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are you passing an?

82
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.760
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Yes, nice.

83
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.065
I think that exactly,
the same thing trip me up before, too.

84
00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:45.950
[LAUGH] Nice teamwork.

85
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.750
Okay, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's it.

86
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.420
So the API for this dropdown activator,
it's missing the items.

87
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.180
Yeah, good call.

88
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.430
So maybe my dropdown component
should be more graceful.

89
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.940
And I think I ended up adding,

90
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.810
I didn't add it here, but
if items is null, add something.

91
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.130
Like items.length is empty or

92
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.949
something, not items.length,

93
00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:22.102
I could just return an empty element or
something.

94
00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:26.511
Yeah, I think what I'd rather do
is just to go back to my test and

95
00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:28.687
implement the API correctly.

96
00:05:28.687 --> 00:05:32.692
[LAUGH] So I'm gonna go in here and
just say items.

97
00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:35.570
I'm gonna give it a little test object.

98
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.180
An item number one, I think it takes
text: 'item 1', and it takes the url,

99
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.224
I'm just gonna pass in a hash symbol cuz I
don't really care where it goes right now.

100
00:05:47.224 --> 00:05:51.226
For item number two,
I'm literally gonna call it item 2,

101
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:54.060
we'll say url, pass it hash again.

102
00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.124
So that should if I pass it,
items we'll pass items here.

103
00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:03.240
So that should work.

104
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.191
So yeah, let's go see.

105
00:06:08.063 --> 00:06:09.466
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Hopefully it's
something simple like that.

106
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:11.042
Woohoo, so good call and

107
00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:15.410
yeah, it's funny how I repeated
the exact same issue twice in a row.
