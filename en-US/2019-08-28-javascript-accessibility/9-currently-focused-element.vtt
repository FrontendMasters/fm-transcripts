00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.020
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: A little hack,
just something that I use quite often,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.760
especially if I'm testing a web page
that I don't have control over.

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.880
Maybe the source code is all bundled and

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.000
it's obfuscated and I don't even know
how to begin debugging this web page.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.450
And I can't figure out
where focus is going.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.443
This event listener, it's document
dot body dot add event listener,

7
00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:24.620
and it's a focusin listener.

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.630
And I can pass it a callback function
to get a hold of the document dot

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.330
active element property.

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.560
And document dot element will tell you
which element in the browser is focused.

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.090
And this is super helpful because I can
just copy, open up the devTools console.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.850
I can hit paste.

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.242
It says undefined but
it's in the background there.

14
00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:49.282
So now, well, I clicked and

15
00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:54.129
it told me I'm focused on the wrapper
element of this application.

16
00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.243
And if I hit Tab,

17
00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:59.690
it will log to the console every
element that has been focused.

18
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.300
And sometimes, that's really helpful,
because if you can't see the element or

19
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.950
maybe there's an extra tab stop in there,
and you're trying to figure out, okay,

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.760
where am I right now?

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.688
That tool is a hack that, now that I
have used it a few times, I just hit

22
00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:20.190
document dot body and hit Tab and console,
and my browser will just autocomplete.

23
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.928
So a lot of times, once you've run it
a couple of times, your browser will just

24
00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:27.855
remember it if you start typing, so you
don't need to always remember yourself.

25
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.516
So that's a handy hack no
matter what type of website or

26
00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.756
web application you're using.

27
00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:39.238
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: And if you're in Safari,
which is a really important browser to

28
00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:44.530
test on the Mac platform, especially with
voiceover, cuz it works better together.

29
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.420
There is this setting in the Safari
preferences that you have to enable this

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.630
Press Tab to highlight
each item on a webpage.

31
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.880
It's kind of a silly setting that I don't
understand [LAUGH] why it's like that but

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.830
this question comes up often enough,
that if you are just getting

33
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.890
started with Safari,
you will want to go and check that,

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.930
to make sure that you can reach everything
that's supposed to be reachable.
