&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So
let's talk about progressive enhancement.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.880
I mean, speaking of like thinking you
know best for all your users, it is very

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.140
pervasive and persuasive, I guess,
to require JavaScript for everything.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.550
I mean we're talking about
JavaScript applications, right.

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.183
So a lot of web apps make that hard choice
of if you don't have JavaScript on,

6
00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:24.040
you can't use this app.

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.870
And I think that's okay for
a lot of use cases.

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.170
For a website that has content on it
that people are supposed to read, we

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.500
shouldn't require JavaScript just to read
the content, or just to do some things.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.240
And people do turn off JavaScript
with legitimate reasons, maybe

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.240
you have network constraints, and this app
is just downloading a ton of resources.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.070
I've heard people for

13
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.790
accessibility reasons turn off
JavaScript to get away from animation.

14
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.730
That's been a reason why people
have turned JavaScript off.

15
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.460
People have their reasons,
and I think that's okay.

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.915
I think at the very least,
if you do require JavaScript,

17
00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:06.790
put a no script tag in your HTML, and
say this site requires JavaScript.

18
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.900
That's what Gatsby sites do by default.

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.810
But they do work without JavaScript,
and we'll see in a moment.

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.620
And to really make something that is
progressively enhanced means that you're

21
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.430
emphasizing the core
web page content first.

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.590
Starting with the HTML part, and then
adding these layers of presentation and

23
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.900
features on top, as browsers and
network connections allow.

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.741
So if JavaScript's enabled and the scripts
download, that means that JavaScript's

25
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:39.610
running so it's gonna take over and
re-hydrate that application.

26
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.513
But you should have something render
to the screen without it turned on.

27
00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:46.598
And it reminds me of when I was
working on Flash applications, and

28
00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:48.347
I didn't have any kind of fallback.

29
00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:51.224
And I was like going to a potential
client going to show them

30
00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:54.336
my like flashy Flash website,
and it had no fallback and yeah,

31
00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:58.150
guess who was really embarrassed
when their site didn't load?

32
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.270
I mean, fast forward to now with
JavaScript rendering a lot of these

33
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.580
applications, it's not just
an embarrassing rookie move.

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.660
It's like somebody not being
able to use a website.

35
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.340
So we can do things like provide
baseline accessible markup.

36
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.310
If you're adding ARIA and more
interactivity, using JavaScript to add

37
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.740
those attributes instead of just
having them there by default.

38
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.340
And then to make this more
realistic because honestly,

39
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.910
this does have a cost in
terms of engineering and

40
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.750
maintenance effort, prioritizing
the core user flows of your site.

41
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.420
If there's something that
is really important for

42
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.380
sales and keeping your site running,
keeping the lights and the business going,

43
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.270
prioritize those, let people check out.

44
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.030
Add some kind of server
back-end infrastructure, and

45
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.990
I know that has a cost too.

46
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.110
So just prioritizing, what's the most
important part for the user can help you,

47
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.170
so you're not trying to do this for
absolutely everything.

48
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.780
And one of the really big reasons why
I started using Gatsby for my site and

49
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.130
why I went to work there was that it does
this server side rendering by default.

50
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.085
So if I run Gatsby build,

51
00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:16.650
it will compile my React components
into raw JavaScript or sorry, raw HTML.

52
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.540
And if I turn JavaScript off,
I have pages.

53
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.000
I have pages, that's awesome, but

54
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.820
I wrote all this stuff with React,
how does that work?

55
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.515
With the power of Node and
Gatsby's infrastructure, they create these

56
00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:32.730
server-side rendered pages, and
I don't even have to think about it.

57
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.800
It's great for performance, it's great
if people wanna read my website without

58
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.150
JavaScript turned on,
which is perfectly reasonable.

59
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.850
So we can do that by default at
build time, which is pretty cool.
