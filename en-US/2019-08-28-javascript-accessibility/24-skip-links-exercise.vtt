00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.413
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: You can choose
how you wanna work on this.

2
00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:06.731
So you can play around with that
onRouteUpdate method in Gatsby and

3
00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:08.206
play with it in React.

4
00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:13.888
I think success would just look
like handling focus somehow.

5
00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.701
It's up for exploration and
playing around.

6
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:20.018
I also have a vanilla.js
version here that,

7
00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:24.471
because the routing in Gatsby
is kinda hidden away from you,

8
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:30.343
I think it can conceptually be a little
bit harder to follow what's happening.

9
00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:36.103
So I added this little sandbox that I'm
using to debug Gatsby itself, actually.

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.724
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: This
little routing prototype,

11
00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:43.107
you just can switch
between these two routes.

12
00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:45.379
It's pretty rudimentary, but

13
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.606
it gives you all of the scripts over
here for actually rendering the page.

14
00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:54.343
So this is like what a JavaScript
framework is doing under the hood,

15
00:00:54.343 --> 00:00:56.385
is replacing what's on the screen.

16
00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:59.470
And so, this gives us a little
more handles to go in and

17
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.055
play with focus handling.

18
00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:05.795
So I've added a marker where
you can go and play with focus.

19
00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:10.587
So let's experiment with, as you're
changing routes, where focus goes.

20
00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:14.797
And make sure that you test it
with not just the mouse, but

21
00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:18.580
play with the keyboard and
see where your focus is.

22
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.482
And I guess the the one last thing I will
mention that's different between the two

23
00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:28.329
versions is that in this prototype,
it's just got the browser default focus.

24
00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.912
In the Gatsby version,
I'm using focus visible,

25
00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:36.260
which I'm going to actually show
you where that is hooked up.

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.652
So there's a layout CSS file in that site
chrome directory, just if you're curious,

27
00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:49.748
that's where I'm handling to specify
what the focus should be doing.

28
00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:53.314
So this is doing this for keyboard users.

29
00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:57.941
And I believe that in the layout.js file,
which is also in this directory,

30
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:00.490
that's just where I'm importing this.

31
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.736
I didn't really cover that earlier,
so just in case you're curious.

32
00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:09.704
So yeah, let's break for 10 minutes or
so, and we'll play with routing.

33
00:02:09.704 --> 00:02:14.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that JS focus
visible class for the poly fill?

34
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.464
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Yeah, so
that's for a poly fill.

35
00:02:15.464 --> 00:02:18.636
Eventually, wouldn't need that, hopefully.

36
00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:20.867
[LAUGH] See how long that takes.

37
00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.686
So yeah, this import is purely just for
the poly fill purpose.

38
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:28.120
And then, if I go out to the layout CSS,

39
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.747
there is some poly fill remnants
here of it adds a js focus visible

40
00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:38.767
class to the body, and
that's how i can safely use this.

41
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:42.187
What I wanna avoid is if
the poly fill isn't there and

42
00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:46.637
it's not supported, I don't want
to turn focus off for everyone.

43
00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:51.433
That's what I want to avoid, and
that's why the poly fill's important.

44
00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:55.897
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So yeah, those are the
differences between the code pen and

45
00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:57.511
the Gatsby version.

46
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.653
So let's go for it.
