00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: I want you
to raise some unit test now.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.500
And so that test shell is in.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.439
I am gonna push those tests that I wrote
up cuz since I accidentally deleted

4
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:11.820
them earlier.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.930
They will be in the examples directory,
if you want to refer to them.

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.980
Otherwise, in the better components
directory, there is a starter test.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.180
I also have another alternative.

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.160
I have Jasmine implemented here on code
pen, which I have to give credit to

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.890
Brian Holt because he had all of his
tests on code pen and it's magical to me.

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.310
So I had started with that.

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.390
And there is a modal window here,
that if you had a Modal component

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
that you needed to test that it opened,
it makes sense to me in a unit test.

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.552
But it is kind of annoying when it
automates cuz it's the finished example,

14
00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:54.082
you'll be like, whoa, that automated
it and really opened the Modal window.

15
00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:55.670
[LAUGH] I think that's okay.

16
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.370
But I don't think it needs a load and
integration test land.

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.900
But this is an example.

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.532
I guess it has.

19
00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.759
This has the setup.

20
00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.894
So the motor dialog is
added here in this mark up,

21
00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:12.344
it's kind of just like a quick and
dirty way to add it.

22
00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:14.680
But then the assertion here are blanks.

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.030
So that's an alternative if you wanna
play with that instead of just.
