00:00:01.114 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: One last note
on humans in this process.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.214
And I touched on this at the beginning,

3
00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:11.297
that working with people with
disabilities is just so valuable.

4
00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:12.770
I wish I would have done it earlier.

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.920
I mean I guess I did with Targets QA team.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.780
So I have been doing that for
a while, but not on every project.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.339
And there are groups that
you can engage for this.

8
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.500
There's access works from nobility.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.620
There's also a startup in
Toronto called Fabled Tech Labs,

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.265
that's who I worked with for
Gatsby's user testing.

11
00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:36.137
And they have a platform, at least
some Fables case where you can go and

12
00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:41.271
sign up for maybe a 30-minute meeting
with someone with a disability.

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:45.345
And they will walk through trying
to use a prototype or a product or

14
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.390
something and you can get that feedback.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260
You can record the video and
then you have an artifact of it,

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.360
you could share it with your team.

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.700
So awesome.

18
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.192
And so, coming up in October 2019,

19
00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:02.929
I am doing a talk for
the inclusive design conference.

20
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.140
It's a 24-hour virtual
accessibility conference.

21
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.687
And those videos will live on like
the past years are all on there so

22
00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:12.050
it's kind of timeless.

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.894
I'm doing a talk there with one of
the testers from Fable to talk about user

24
00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:16.880
testing.

25
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.780
And I'm hoping to get this routing
pattern that we worked on today in front

26
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.081
of this tester to get more feedback on it
cuz now that I've got recommendations,

27
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:28.330
I wanna fine tune them.

28
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.099
So stay tuned for that, yeah,
that's in October, I think October 10th.

29
00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:34.980
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So that's it.

30
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.876
And, I think we've had questions
kind of throughout the day, but

31
00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:40.428
if anyone has any other questions,
I'm happy to answer.

32
00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:42.550
You can always tweet at me too.

33
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.676
So thank you so much,
this has been a lot of fun.

34
00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:50.780
&gt;&gt; Applause: [APPLAUSE]
