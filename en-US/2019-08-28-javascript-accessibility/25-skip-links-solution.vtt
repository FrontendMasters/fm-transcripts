00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So
we're back and we found a bug in

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.820
the implementation of focus visible which
we talked about right before the break.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.184
It was my error,
all we need to do is in the CSS.

4
00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:17.137
So to make sure that the focus being
turned off for everyone [LAUGH]

5
00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:22.650
problem is fixed by limiting it to
when the polyfill actually matches.

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.280
So we're sort of back-filling
support that isn't everywhere,

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.890
including in Chrome apparently.

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.190
I don't what setting I have enabled, but

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.820
I will commit this to the code and
push it up.

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.951
And you can learn more about how to
use the focus-visible polyfill on the,

11
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.429
let's go pull it up.

12
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:41.339
Focus visible,

13
00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.840
the web incubator community group is the
one that I'm getting the polyfill from.

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.570
This is on GitHub.

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.370
And they have usage, and information, and
explainers, and all kinds of good stuff.

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.130
So if you're curious
about how to get to that,

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.020
it's GitHub.com/wicg/focus-visible.

18
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.940
Okay, so client-side routing,
how did the the routing go for everyone?

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.290
Sort of an abstract thing, but hopefully

20
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.420
we can bake some of the stuff into
frameworks to make it a little bit easier.

21
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.790
It does help to know what's going on.

22
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.320
And I'm gonna pull up the vanilla
JS version that I had added.

23
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.200
I'll zoom in a little bit.

24
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.770
So I added a similar option
with a route skip link.

25
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.610
And the answer is linked in the slides.

26
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.380
But it's pretty similar,
I'm adding a lot of the same stuff,

27
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.730
like having it skip
back to the navigation.

28
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.136
Giving an RA label back to navigation.

29
00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:48.710
And then in the init route

30
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.990
area of this little prototype is
where I'm going in a pending list.

31
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.460
So in each route element, I can go and

32
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.300
find the h1 and
I can just insert this little link.

33
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.590
So now it's down here next to the H1.

34
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.870
And if I tab in here and

35
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.320
go to the next route it will do
that focused management for me.

36
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.960
It's sort of a lo fi way to prototype
routing outside of any framework.

37
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020
So that's where that lives.

38
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.361
I think, there is a little
more logic in the online 36,

39
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:31.563
I don't know what line it was in
the vanilla JS version, it was line 26.

40
00:02:31.563 --> 00:02:34.626
There's a little bit of logic
here to check whether I'm

41
00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:38.483
loading a route the first time or
whether the users clicking through.

42
00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:41.628
And just making sure that if there
is one of those route skip links,

43
00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:44.115
that's where I'm handling,
sending focus to it.

44
00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:48.000
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Okay,
so that's some routing.

45
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.780
Think no matter what
solution you decide on,

46
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.140
the sort of thing to land on is that we
have to manage focus in our applications.

47
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.540
Because they're client rendered and

48
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.590
so I think there will be more
evolution with that to come.
