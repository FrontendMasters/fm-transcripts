00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Okay, so some more tools
for your own debugging cuz I'm gonna send

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.980
you off to do your own debugging
journey here in a moment.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.100
This could be come in handy for you.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.750
So hidden versus visible CSS.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.890
This can really impact things like,
where are your focus can go?

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.700
What HTML is actually read
aloud in a screen reader?

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.827
And I have a Demo button here that I can
go and play with in developer tools.

8
00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:28.610
I'm gonna dock the dev tools over here on
the right so we can see what's going on.

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.350
So this Demo button,
if I Ctrl+Click and Inspect element,

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.430
I can play with it in this Styles panel.

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.660
So I have a CSS class here
called visually hidden and

12
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.100
this is a utility class that I have
in every CSS file of every project.

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.370
It might be called like sr-only.

14
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.990
It might be visually hidden without a dash
in it, you can call it whatever you want.

15
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.650
But the general premise is that it will
take an HTML element and render it so

16
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.200
that it's part of the pages accessibility
information, but it's hidden visually.

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.932
So this can be useful for

18
00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:10.012
things like spans that have
screen reader text in them.

19
00:01:10.012 --> 00:01:13.834
Headings that you wanna add to
a section for semantic purposes, but

20
00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.524
aren't in the design or
aren't in the layout.

21
00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:21.080
Visually hidden is a really common
utility, but it does render.

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.940
So sometimes it's not the right tool
because you wanna hide something from

23
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.240
everyone which would be displayNone.

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.220
So let's play along with this.

25
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.160
I'm gonna start by adding visually-hidden,

26
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.670
since I have that class in this files,
now we can see it matches.

27
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.692
And that button, it's rendering,
but it's pulled out of the flow

28
00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:47.288
of the document, so
it's not reserving that space anymore.

29
00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:52.966
And if I go over here in the dev tools,
I have the Accessibility inspector.

30
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:57.260
And I can see that it has
contents of Demo button.

31
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.214
So for a screen reader or
assistive technology,

32
00:02:00.214 --> 00:02:04.113
I'm still putting that information
through accessible APIs.

33
00:02:04.113 --> 00:02:06.121
So let's go back to this button,

34
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:11.095
let's play with this other options that
we have here cuz there is multiple tools.

35
00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:14.966
So I'm gonna delete that class and
the next one we look at is a opacity.

36
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.990
So I'm just gonna add the style,
I'll do opacity: 0;.

37
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.090
It reserved its space.

38
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.826
So it has not been pulled out
of the flow of the layout.

39
00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:30.208
It's reserving space, so that might
be something I could use to animate.

40
00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.824
If I need to transition something in,

41
00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:36.760
visually hidden those
properties are not animateable.

42
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.950
displayNone, which we'll look at in
a second is also not animateable.

43
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.341
So opacity is a tool that you
might use in your toolbox.

44
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:49.360
But if I go and look at this,
it also says, Demo button.

45
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.880
So its contents are being passed through
just like the visually hidden class.

46
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.660
So it's a way of visually hiding
things that reserve the space and

47
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.790
still get rendered, technically.

48
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.570
So let's look at the next one.

49
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.320
So that's opacity: 0.

50
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.060
Let's do display: none;.

51
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.050
So that pulled it out of the flow,
that hid it from everyone.

52
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.100
displayNone is also a really
common tool that you might use

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.900
because it hides it from the display and
it hides it from assistive technology.

54
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.050
Let's see, refresh this.

55
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.730
So sometimes if you change
the styles on the fly and you're

56
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.000
using the Chrome Accessibility Inspector,
you might need to click off the button or

57
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.740
element and come back because
it needs to refresh the tree.

58
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.710
But it's now saying that this element
is not rendered and it's being ignored.

59
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.210
So there is no accessibility information.

60
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.840
And if you have things that are maybe
inactive, there are parts of your

61
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.040
interface that you aren't using right
now and they're hidden from view and

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.410
from everyone, displayNone is
a really great tool for that.

63
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.876
And then the last one we'll
look at is visibility: hidden.

64
00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:58.808
So this one also reserved the space for
the look at the accessibility of this,.

65
00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:02.820
Click off again and come back,
just to make sure that it's up to date.

66
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.870
This one will, so
it reserves the space, but

67
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.020
it hides its accessibility information.

68
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.710
So it's kind of like opacity,

69
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.570
except that it is taking that
accessibility information away.

70
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.290
So that's another tool that you might use.

71
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.832
Maybe you, let's see,
when would you use visibility hidden?

72
00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:26.039
Sometimes you just need something in
the layout that's gonna stay there but

73
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.230
you don't want it to be adding to
the accessibility information of the page.

74
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.733
So when you're debugging and
looking for keyword issues and

75
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:39.620
looking at these things, these are some of
the styles that you might be looking for.

76
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.508
Maybe it's applied just in the middle
of a larger class or something.

77
00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:48.380
It's good to know how those CSS
properties impact accessibility.
