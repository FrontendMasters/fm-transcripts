00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.475
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So that should be it for
this custom route heading.

2
00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:06.093
And now, I'm gonna go implement it.

3
00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:10.094
So I've still got an import here.

4
00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:14.240
It's looking for
it in the better directory.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.399
So we're in the right spot.

6
00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.460
It's grayed out, because I haven't
actually referenced it yet.

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.751
But I'm just gonna grab that component
name, and I'm gonna change this

8
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:29.050
h2 to route target heading opponent,
I'm gonna pass in a level of two.

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.793
So it'll give me that h2.

10
00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:35.521
And a quick note about headings, is that
we want to start with h1 on a page, and

11
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.320
go in order.

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.262
So the h1 on our app is this top level
accessibility in JavaScript applications.

13
00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:48.188
Sometimes, you wanna change the h1
to be the name of the page.

14
00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:49.867
You can play with the heading
levels a little bit.

15
00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:52.734
Just, I think, the most important
thing is that they go in order,

16
00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:54.133
so that you don't skip levels.

17
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.996
So I'm not skipping straight to h2.

18
00:00:56.996 --> 00:00:59.825
I already have an h1 elsewhere.

19
00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.289
So I've got that.

20
00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.380
The other property to pass in, is target
ID, and I'm just gonna say navigation.

21
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.003
And if we go, I think,
I need the back here in my site

22
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.538
chrome directory,
I have a navigation snippet.

23
00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:21.069
So what's nice about working with react
components, is you can break up different

24
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.058
parts of your site chrome
into different components.

25
00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:28.652
They're reusable, but also you can just
focus on that one part of your site, or

26
00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:30.722
that one part of your application.

27
00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:36.221
And this is where my navigation lives,
and there is an ID of navigation here.

28
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.326
I've also got a visually hidden
heading here in the nav section, so

29
00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:44.516
in that left sidebar, there is
a heading here that says navigation.

30
00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:48.559
But the part that I really wanna focus on,
are these demos.

31
00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:52.208
If I'm coming from the drop
down link here in the left, and

32
00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:56.976
I wanna send focus into its matching
content, and then, I wanna skip back,

33
00:01:56.976 --> 00:02:02.140
I think the most appropriate place, is to
focus on these links where it came from.

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.548
So that's why I'm putting
the ID right here.

35
00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:09.785
So navigation that will
match this use case.

36
00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:14.417
So I'm actually gonna copy this,
because we need this on all of our pages.

37
00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:17.951
I've just used h2s here.

38
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:22.764
I'm gonna go change these real quick, so
that when I'm clicking around, they match,

39
00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:26.684
and it won't matter what page I'm on,
so I'm gonna change all these.

40
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:28.751
And hopefully,
we can just automate this stuff.

41
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:30.917
So it's easier, and
you don't really have to think about it.

42
00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.425
But for now, this will work.

43
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:35.483
I mean, this is how frameworks get made.

44
00:02:35.483 --> 00:02:38.453
We prototype it, we see if it works,
we get more user testing,

45
00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:39.977
which is something I'm doing.

46
00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:44.291
And then, we see how can we make
that easier for everyone, so

47
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:49.545
RouteTargetHeading, and you can
honestly call this whatever you want.

48
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:53.200
Naming things is one of the hardest
things in computer science, so

49
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.779
maybe the name will change.

50
00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.352
Maybe it makes sense to me,
and no one else.

51
00:02:57.352 --> 00:03:00.649
I think I've got two more here.

52
00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:06.527
I kept the imports in there,
so it should, should be fine.

53
00:03:06.527 --> 00:03:09.415
The semantics pages an example for
you all to use later.

54
00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:11.601
Rep target heading is not fine.

55
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:15.556
Okay, so
I do need to import that somewhere.

56
00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:21.492
Let's see, which one was complaining,
the Index page.

57
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:26.966
So I'm just gonna paste this import, so
it knows where to find that component.

58
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:33.218
So now, if I would hover here, I've got
this little anchor thing that shows up.

59
00:03:33.218 --> 00:03:36.520
It looks kinda funky,
because there's a carrot and an underline.

60
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.065
So I'm actually gonna go
turn off the underline.

61
00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.877
For this case, it's an interactive thing,

62
00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:47.027
I really recommend keeping underlines
on for regular text links.

63
00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.920
This is sort of a special case.

64
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.366
So I'm gonna say text-decoration, none,

65
00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:57.344
for this one little interactive thing.

66
00:03:57.344 --> 00:04:02.096
And probably, I would use it a more
graceful arrow, but that's what I had,

67
00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:03.965
[LAUGH], on the top of my head.

68
00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:09.989
So I think the other part that I need
to hook up, is back in Gatsby browser.

69
00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.253
So I guess, let's go, what I'm gonna do
here, so at this level, this API method,

70
00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:20.608
doesn't really, I don't really have
insight into what's inside my application.

71
00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:22.920
And frankly, I don't really wanna know.

72
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.165
I just wanna go look on the page,
and see, is there a skip link,

73
00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.143
kind of like the one I'm looking for.

74
00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:32.196
I'm just gonna write it like that,
if, let's go see,

75
00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:36.010
I'm gonna do set a variable,
and call it skip link.

76
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.443
And I'm just gonna go look for
it, document.query.selector.

77
00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:46.315
And it was called route skip
link was the CSS class that

78
00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:49.461
I added in here, route skip link.

79
00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:52.293
So if, if there's a skip link on the page,

80
00:04:52.293 --> 00:04:55.300
I don't wanna error out
if there isn't one.

81
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.034
And if there isn't one,
it will fall back to reach router,

82
00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:01.735
doing some routing focus handling for us.

83
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:06.536
But if there is a skip link,
I'm gonna say skiplink.focus.

84
00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:10.007
And so, this will go look for
that component.

85
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:13.153
In the event that there
is a previous location,

86
00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:17.952
because we've navigated, that'll be
null on the first load of a page,

87
00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:22.535
cuz you're just getting there,
there isn't a previous location.

88
00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:28.770
So now, if I use,
let's go see, I have an error.

89
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.883
And by the way, if you see this unchecked
run time last error message in the dev

90
00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:34.797
tools, I see that all over the web.

91
00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:38.917
It might be from your browser extension or
something, it doesn't actually have

92
00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:42.386
anything to do with this application,
so don't worry about that.

93
00:05:42.386 --> 00:05:45.650
So I don't think I got my
conditional right here.

94
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.129
So I'm actually gonna do
a little bit of logging, and say,

95
00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.183
console log location, prev location.

96
00:05:53.183 --> 00:05:56.813
And we'll just go make sure
that this method is working.

97
00:05:56.813 --> 00:06:01.037
So yeah, we've got a location,
and null here for,

98
00:06:01.037 --> 00:06:07.565
when there is a different one, I was
on the drop down page already, I think,

99
00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:14.304
maybe some styling to indicate to me that
that's the page I'm on would have hoped.

100
00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:20.057
So it's actually working, because this
showing our little route skip link.

101
00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:21.380
So I'm gonna do that with the keyboard.

102
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.921
I'm gonna close the Dev tools.

103
00:06:22.921 --> 00:06:26.193
And that was our focus
outline on the navigation.

104
00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:28.618
So it's actually working.

105
00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:31.400
So I can go back and forth.

106
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.311
It's working better than kicking
me all the way back to the top of

107
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.475
the application.

108
00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:40.241
So I'm pretty happy with that.

109
00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:44.072
I can go on one of these links with
the keyboard, hit the enter key,

110
00:06:44.072 --> 00:06:48.605
it sends my focus to skip link that it
doesn't take up much space on the screen.

111
00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:51.602
I could opt to style that however I want.

112
00:06:51.602 --> 00:06:55.208
I can make it look like an icon button,
and give it an accessible name.

113
00:06:55.208 --> 00:07:00.603
I could make it look like an actual
skip link, and say, skipped navigation,

114
00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:04.919
so there's some subjectivity
involved with the design, but

115
00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.417
it functionally serves purposes.

116
00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:11.907
We're not just sending focus to this
rapper element, and then, being like,

117
00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:16.276
all right, you're on your own, go tab
around and figure out where you are.

118
00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:18.588
This link is actually useful.

119
00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:21.661
It serves a purpose, and
so, through research,

120
00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:24.671
I've found that that just
made a lot more sense.

121
00:07:24.671 --> 00:07:28.549
That's for where we skipped back to,
we could play with that a little bit.

122
00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:32.616
I'm sending focus back to the wrapper
element of the nav, maybe,

123
00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:35.313
I should send it back to
the link I came from?

124
00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:38.723
That's an improvement that we could make,
potentially.

125
00:07:38.723 --> 00:07:41.982
But that's how I would
build this component.

126
00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:45.904
I guess, one more thing we should look at,
is the accessible name of this,

127
00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:48.413
just to make sure that
we've got that working.

128
00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:50.837
So I'm gonna focused on this and
the DevTools.

129
00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.709
I'm gonna go over the accessibility
inspector, and it says,

130
00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.034
skip to navigation.

131
00:07:56.034 --> 00:08:01.580
So the aria label is stomping over
the contents of that pseudo element.

132
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.638
Because aria label on the parent will take
preference over whatever's inside of it.

133
00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:11.328
So something good to know about that, and
I can, I can see in this accessibility

134
00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:15.808
inspector how the accessible name
calculation is like, what's winning,

135
00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.178
if I have multiple things,
trying to like give it a name.

136
00:08:19.178 --> 00:08:23.171
I love this tool,
because it will show me which one wins.

137
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:24.934
That can get a little tricky sometimes.

138
00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:28.604
And so, I love that it shows
what's crossed out, and

139
00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:33.021
what's actually going to be
exposed to assistive technology.
