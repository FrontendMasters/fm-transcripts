00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So,
I'm gonna spend a little bit of time

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.990
writing some integration tests in Cyprus.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.315
So the convention for this, and Cyprus
kind of sets this up for you by default.

4
00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:15.004
Close this components directory and
the example.

5
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:19.162
So when you run Cyprus,
it will add this cyprus directory for you.

6
00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.522
I think you can configure it.

7
00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:26.560
You can add fixtures in here and
plugins and things.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.170
The commands, it adds this file
by default and to use Cyprus Axe,

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.360
which is a binding for the Axe
accessibility testing API for Cyprus.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.090
I just import the commands in this
commands JS file in the support directory.

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.000
And then I've got the integration test
directory is where my tests would go.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.080
And so, this is pulling in those Cyprus
bindings for the underlying API.

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.210
So I'm just gonna start
writing some tests.

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.330
So let's do some accessibility tests.

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.276
Can give it whatever name I want.

16
00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:08.637
I am going to,
I'm just gonna write my first assertion.

17
00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:12.340
Let's see, what am I gonna test?

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.990
That's probably a better thing to look at.

19
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.244
So we've got our application here.

20
00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:18.767
Yeah, I was going to test
the client side routing that

21
00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:24.110
I added with this little skip link thing
that we created earlier in the day.

22
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.070
So, from an interaction.

23
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.200
I mean,
I think about the testing in terms of,

24
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.370
what am I trying to mimic
that a user would do?

25
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.340
And for this, I want to reach

26
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.240
one of the items that is actually going
to execute this skip link behavior.

27
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420
So I want to go onto a link.

28
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.500
I want to click it.

29
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.740
I went back, I hit it twice.

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.209
I want to assert that the focus
is sent to a skip link.

31
00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.363
Seems pretty straightforward.

32
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.910
I am gonna pull up the cyber stocks.

33
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.365
So it's cyprus.io.

34
00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:03.126
I like to have the the docs for whatever
API I'm working on because especially when

35
00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:05.337
you're kind of going back and forth.

36
00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:10.910
Let's see, guides.

37
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.690
API is probably where I want to go.

38
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.340
So there's assertions here.

39
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.960
I think commands might be the way to go.

40
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.100
Commands, yes.

41
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900
So there's things like click.

42
00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:31.186
So side.click if I was or side.get,
whatever you're trying to get and

43
00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.228
then click on it.

44
00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:36.440
This is where that focused
API comes in handy.

45
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.329
Okay, so that helps me,
I'm going to get this in here.

46
00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.462
So I'm going to say it should
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: It

47
00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:51.610
should send focus to a skip link.

48
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.640
Let's see, let's think about this.

49
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.140
So.

50
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:56.884
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: It should.

51
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:04.830
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Take the user's focus
[LAUGH] But keep it the way it was.

52
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.570
It should send focus to a skip link.

53
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.370
When the route changes.

54
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.350
So that's mostly just indicating that I'm
going to test the mechanics of sending it,

55
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.170
focuses skip link.

56
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.530
It's not really talking about
the the link click that I'm coming from.

57
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.220
So I'm trying to think of
a way to capture that.

58
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.600
It's like it should,
when the route changes from a link click.

59
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.615
This is a very long test title all of
a sudden but I'm just going to leave it.

60
00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:33.880
I'm going to wrap text, too.

61
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.960
I try and keep my test names short.

62
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.080
Maybe I write,
maybe these are two different tests.

63
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.200
I can play around with that.

64
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.220
So the first thing I need to do is go and
tell it what page I'm going to.

65
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.859
And that API.

66
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.170
Now let's see.

67
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.424
We had it in our, I'm gonna cheat and
go back just in the interest of time.

68
00:03:56.424 --> 00:04:00.570
So I'm gonna do cy.visit.

69
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.200
You could do it before each test.

70
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.910
I'm just gonna do it in the test
cuz I'm just gonna write the one.

71
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.380
So I'm gonna say cy.visit and
I'm gonna give it the local host,

72
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.500
port 8000 rather than the slash for
the homepage.

73
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.628
I've just had more success with giving
it the local host URL in this case.

74
00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:24.683
Something that would be a nice enhancement
would be to make this port more dynamic.

75
00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:27.799
Like go read it from node process or
something, but

76
00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.831
I'm just gonna leave it for now.

77
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:34.115
Cuz that way, say if I have two gatsby
sites and it gets opened in 8001 or

78
00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:38.266
something like that, then it's nice
to know that I'm on the right one.

79
00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:45.090
So cy.visit, I want to cy.getByText.

80
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.880
Maybe, is that the one I want,
getByText Dropdown.

81
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.406
Let's see, is there more than one,
that seems sort of brutal.

82
00:04:55.406 --> 00:05:00.309
Because on homepage, there might be

83
00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:04.903
more than one of those, so maybe.

84
00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:08.128
Let's see, get.

85
00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:11.140
Let's go look at that API.

86
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.540
So I can use a selector, that's probably
the best, so cy.get instead of getByText.

87
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.247
So I'm gonna say, let's go look at this
element and see what it's got on it.

88
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.612
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So I could go,
maybe, add a class name to this,

89
00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:35.710
I could probably say, page navigation and
then go get it that way.

90
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.390
Page navigation and then the first anchor.

91
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.746
That might return me a collection,
I guess we'll just see.

92
00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:44.460
So I'm gonna click it.

93
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.890
And then I'm gonna keep going,
just try and write the rest of this test.

94
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.045
So I'm gonna expect then that cy.focused.

95
00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:56.414
Let's go look at that API, go back.

96
00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:03.761
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Focused.

97
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.212
So I think that that gives me,
cy.focus should have so

98
00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:18.279
I can assert,
I could say should have class probably.

99
00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:24.188
I think that's what I'm going to do,
cy.focused.

100
00:06:24.188 --> 00:06:28.958
And, how quickly I forget,
.should have .class and

101
00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.800
it was routeSkipLink, I believe.

102
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.896
And because that was being baked into the
component, that's probably pretty stable.

103
00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:43.360
This get page-navigation ones,
maybe not as stable but let's try it.

104
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.830
So to run these tests,
I'm gonna go kill off my server.

105
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.768
I'm gonna do npm run e2e.

106
00:06:48.768 --> 00:06:51.315
It's test:e2e.

107
00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.799
So this is going to open Cyprus.

108
00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:59.248
Run it, firing up my application cuz
that's what it's actually gonna test

109
00:06:59.248 --> 00:06:59.880
against.

110
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.510
Instead of testing a virtual
in-memory snapshot,

111
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.920
it's actually going to
fire this up in a browser.

112
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.470
And I'm gonna turn my doc on so
we can see it.

113
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.510
Try and open.

114
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.820
There it goes, Cyprus open, so
it's opening the Cyprus application.

115
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.900
Here it goes.

116
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.100
Okay, so now this is the interface
that took so much energy to download.

117
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.520
So I'm gonna click this.

118
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.560
And this is when I can actually
open it in a Chrome instance.

119
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.030
It's gonna go hit that page.

120
00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:36.930
Yeah, I was right.

121
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.720
So, that can only be called
on a single element.

122
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.000
So, if i just want to
get a single element,

123
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.380
I could probably get it from an array.

124
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.880
Maybe?

125
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:53.240
Let's see a dog first
of its in a list item.

126
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.370
So I probably want to do LI first of type.

127
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.523
So this will kind of leverage CSS.

128
00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:03.670
See if that works.

129
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.280
Just use CSS to go and
get it instead of trying to do something.

130
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.819
Okay, so that worked.

131
00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:13.020
That actually, I got the first link.

132
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.320
It was focused,
I'm pretty satisfied with that.

133
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.120
So to get out of Cypress,
I'm gonna kill off the browser.

134
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.650
I can hit Stop or I could just close it.

135
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.840
So I'm gonna do that and that is a test.

136
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.180
That has inserted that feature that we
added earlier today which I'm pretty

137
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.700
psyched about.

138
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.540
So if I were shipping that real component
and I were implementing it on a site,

139
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.740
that's when I would write
an integration test for that.
