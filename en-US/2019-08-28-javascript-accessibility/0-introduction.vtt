00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: We're gonna talk about
accessibility in JavaScript applications,

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.660
a topic that I've had kind of in my
head space for a couple of years now.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.830
And so, with this course,
it can get pretty technical.

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.640
So if you're maybe more
familiar with accessibility and

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.750
less on the JavaScript side or vice versa,
maybe you're stronger in JavaScript and

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.690
less in accessibility, we'll try and
wind through that journey.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.980
And I'm happy to answer questions,
if you have any of them.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.920
But my goals for today, are for you to
leave this course feeling like you know

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.370
the concepts that go into making
an accessible JavaScript application.

10
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.730
Because there's so many of them out there.

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.260
And we can be purists and

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.560
say we want static websites because a lot
of times those are more accessible.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.190
But in the real world, there
are a ton of JavaScript applications.

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.296
So we might as well try to make those
more accessible in any ways that we can.

15
00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:56.718
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So who am I,

16
00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:59.480
who is this person who's going
to be talking to you today?

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.850
I'm Marcy Sutton.

18
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.090
I'm currently the Head
of Learning at Gatsby,

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.580
which is a website framework startup.

20
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.862
There is an Intro to Gatsby course
taught by Jason Lengstorf here at

21
00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:11.660
Frontend Masters that you could check out.

22
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.040
And so I'll be doing some Gatsby
development in this course.

23
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
There's also some Vanilla JavaScript
component, so we'll try and

24
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.580
cover both of those angles, and I'll
get into that a little bit more later.

25
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.610
I have worked in accessibility for
a number of years and

26
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.890
I worked on the aXe core team, which is a
tool you'll hear about a little bit later.

27
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.415
So I've been working in
accessibility testing, so

28
00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:38.100
automated testing, learning how to bake
accessibility in your application.

29
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.530
Once upon a time I worked
on the Angular core team.

30
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.370
So that's sort of where my journey
in JavaScript framework started.

31
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.730
And I'm living much more in the React
space being on the Gatsby team.

32
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.000
But accessibility is something
that I can't turn off in my brain.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.120
And if I could have
an outcome from this course,

34
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.400
it would be hopefully that you have
that switch flipped in your minds,

35
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.880
if you haven't already, that accessibility
is a lifestyle and a culture.

36
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.900
And it's something that we can take
into our work all day, every day.

37
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.730
So in Seattle, back in Washington State
where I'm from, I co-lead a meetup for

38
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.770
accessibility.

39
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.690
And there's meetups for
accessibility all over the world.

40
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.080
So I encourage you to find one
in your local area or start one.

41
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.620
So how I got into accessibility,

42
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.290
I was working as a front end developer
at an agency in Seattle, and

43
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.030
I was tasked with working on the Target
account, the retailer here in Minneapolis.

44
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.150
And as part of that engagement,
I had to make accessible websites and

45
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.730
web applications.

46
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.460
And I didn't know anything
about accessibility.

47
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.800
It was just a something
that happened in my career.

48
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.510
And I learned from working with
Target's QA accessibility team,

49
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.820
like how much of an impact I could have in
the lives of people with disabilities and

50
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.260
really all of us.

51
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.450
And so through that work,
I just kept getting closer and

52
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.530
closer to accessibility.

53
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.760
And you can use it in your work in the
mainstream, as developers, as designers.

54
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.160
You could choose to go into
accessibility full time if you like.

55
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.670
I think we all have
different roles to play.

56
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.350
But there's some parts of it that
we should all take into our work

57
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.359
as technologists.

58
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.650
So you can find me on Twitter and
Github at Marcy Sutton and

59
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.580
my website is marcysutton.com.

60
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.830
It's also built with Gatsby.
