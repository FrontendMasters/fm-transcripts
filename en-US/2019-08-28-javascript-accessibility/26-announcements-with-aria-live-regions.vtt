00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.830
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So
let's move on to our next topic.

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.680
We've talked about focus management in
two different ways with drop downs and

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.460
client side routing.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.330
By using focus management and
sending focus to an area of the screen,

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.210
we move the user's focus there and
make Announcements.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.060
So, that skip link that I sent focus to
should announce to a screen reader skip to

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.010
navigation when they land on it.

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.170
Sometimes you don't want
to move the user's focus.

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.470
Like maybe you're typing in a form and
there's no submit button because

10
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.140
it's slicker to just save, maybe it's
just Asynchronously saving to the server.

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.423
Well you don't want the user to worry
that they are gonna lose their work.

12
00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:43.745
So you'd probably display
something like saved or

13
00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:46.920
you've made changes like
CodePen will do that.

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.470
When you are typing and it will say
13 changes since your last save.

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.830
You wanna announce that message
to your screen reader and

16
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.100
the techniques to do that
is with Announcements.

17
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.010
Some other use cases would be
like if you had a Combobox, and

18
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.170
you are typing and
it's filtering a list of options.

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.830
We'll see an example of that in a second.

20
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.962
Things like Chat widgets,
like on Facebook.

21
00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:12.590
They're a little Chat widget,
which there's multiple.

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.003
Which I heard a kind of funny
bug I'm going to tell you about.

23
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.893
That they had an Announcement on those
to say what time the last message had

24
00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:20.531
been sent.

25
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:24.190
And it had kind of gone rogue cuz it was
saying like one message one minute ago,

26
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.210
two minutes ago, one minute ago just
like launching off these Announcements.

27
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.670
So you want to make sure you test them
with assistive technology running

28
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.950
because you might have no idea otherwise.

29
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.150
Because these Announcements only
affect assistive technology.

30
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.580
Which is why I touched on focus
management first because that impacts

31
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.590
everyone that uses a keyboard.

32
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.890
And we can do a lot with that,
especially for screen magnification.

33
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.900
If you send focus to an area,
your focused on it,

34
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.220
you're sent to that part of the screen.

35
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.470
But if I make an Announcement like a toast
notification elsewhere on the screen,

36
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.810
someone who's zoomed way in over here
won't necessarily see what's happening

37
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.640
on this side.

38
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.540
So you want to be sort of
subjective about how you do this.

39
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.520
I've also seen these
Announcements used for

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.750
title changes like instead of
the focus that we've just worked on.

41
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.110
So you can use it for various things,
I think the Asynchronous saving and

42
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.890
filtering is probably
the most recommended ways.

43
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.910
So to create these announcements you can
use ARIA in the Live Region portion.

44
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.606
So it's basically like
a Message command center and

45
00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:32.850
there is two levels of importance.

46
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.230
Do you interrupt what the screen
reader is saying or do you wait.

47
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.360
And so those levels are indicated
in two different ways.

48
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.650
There's sort of two APIs you can use for
this.

49
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.850
So the role of status and role of alert.

50
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.730
I think there's a role of log as well.

51
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.090
The role of status is what we
call a polite announcement.

52
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.282
It will wait until everything is done
announcing before it says something.

53
00:02:55.282 --> 00:03:00.084
Which is a bit more polite, good to wait,
not everything is an emergency.

54
00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:04.914
Or as an alert is like hey, you need to
know this right now, like this is urgent.

55
00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:10.060
And so, it's again kind of subjective,
so role of alert will do that.

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.280
You can also use the ARIA Live property.

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.880
So ARIA Live of polite or
ARIA Live of assertive.

58
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.260
I think ARIA Live of assertive
used to be called rude.

59
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.930
If you had to think of it that way,
it can be kinda rude.

60
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.030
But you can use either one of these.

61
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.980
Sometimes maybe if ARIA Live

62
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.010
isn't behaving right you can try
the role see if that changes things.

63
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.470
But those are pretty synonymous role
status and polite, role of alert and

64
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.999
assertive.

65
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.640
So an example that you can find out in
the wild is the Downshift component

66
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.680
by Kent C Dodds and open source community.

67
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.270
I've got an example here with a Star Wars
character filter, and I can tab into it.

68
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.000
I could type in these names of characters
and they get pulled back from this list.

69
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.440
And I'm going to fire up
Voiceover using cmd+F5.

70
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.100
Okay so I've got Voiceover running.

71
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.050
I'm gonna start typing.

72
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Six results are available.

73
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.430
Use up and down arrow keys to navigate.

74
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.120
Han Solo (1 of 6), Bastila Shan (2 of 6).

75
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.220
N for A, 18 results are available,
use up and down arrow keys to navigate.

76
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.110
Press Enter key, F5, VoiceOver off.

77
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.850
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So it's making those
announcements of how many items

78
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.920
are coming up.

79
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.440
And that information it's
not the label of the input.

80
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.820
Like my focus is there.

81
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.710
I don't wanna move your focus
because you're actively typing.

82
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.790
So this is a perfect use case for
an ARIA Live Region.

83
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.718
And Downshift does this pretty well.

84
00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:42.507
It's open source, and so
if you ever find bugs and things.

85
00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:46.346
This is a great way to create accessible
components is because we're all testing

86
00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.564
in different browsers and
different assistive technologies, and

87
00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:52.800
we can kinda crowd source that and
make one really great component.

88
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.410
And I think Downshift is
a good example of that.

89
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.370
So some tips of Live Regions, including
multiple Live Regions of a given level

90
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.530
can help sometimes when the screen reader
doesn't consider the content has changed.

91
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.240
And I guess a little more note
about how these APIs work is that

92
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.700
these are elements that when you append
text to them, It will just announce it.

93
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.460
So typically, they're visually hidden.

94
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.090
They're kind of put off screen.

95
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.510
And if you append text to them,
however means necessary in React maybe.

96
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.450
It's some state variable
that if it's truthy,

97
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.210
it'll output that's what
I'll play within a minute.

98
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.500
Maybe with vanilla JavaScript,
you just set its text content or

99
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.819
you append a child or some way to like
change the contents of these elements.

100
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.750
When the role of status or the ARIA Live,
those Regions are there when the page

101
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.220
loads, the children that you append to
them is what will actually get announced.

102
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.070
So you wouldn't like add an ARIA
role of status to an element

103
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.457
like while the user is interacting.

104
00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:02.510
That's something that's always there
pulling for changes from load time.

105
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.550
So sometimes you might hit
these gotchas where it just for

106
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.140
whatever reason the content's the same and

107
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.570
the screen reader's trying to help you by
not repeating the same thing over again.

108
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.030
But maybe it's causing you issues.

109
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.230
Sometimes making an API or
a custom component where you have multiple

110
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.880
regions and you just kind of trade off,
that's a technique that I've seen used.

111
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.200
There's an example of this in
Almero Steyn's React ARIA Live component.

112
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.850
He took inspiration from an Angular
solution called ng-alley

113
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.000
that was an older component.

114
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.470
And that's just things that people
who are actively doing accessibility

115
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.920
testing have run into.

116
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.024
This is another area we're having
a site-level API to manage these

117
00:06:47.024 --> 00:06:51.920
announcements might help so that you
have more control over what's happening.
