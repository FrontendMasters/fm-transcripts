00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.660
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So some debugging steps.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.455
These are the general steps that I
take when I'm auditing a web page for

3
00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:07.588
accessibility, if I'm doing a test.

4
00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:10.506
Maybe I'm evaluating a pattern library, or

5
00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:14.910
some sort of third party tool
that I'm considering using.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.350
I render it in a web browser.

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.640
So looking at raw HTML
source code is cool.

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.370
But you want to see how CSS and JavaScript
could impact that markup in the browser.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.530
Cuz you only have so much time to test,
that's a good place to start.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.989
I test the controls with the keyboard and
by controls, I mean interactive things.

11
00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.940
Like buttons, links, inputs, text areas.

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.060
Not every element on the page
needs to be interactive.

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.760
And we'll touch on that a little later.

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.030
But the interactive things,
like if I'm using my mouse on it and

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.560
I can't reach it from the keyboard,
that would be an issue.

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.010
I use accessibility web extensions like
AXE and the Accessibility Insights

17
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.360
because it can highlight a lot
of low-hanging fruit issues.

18
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.200
That if you're catching those,
you probably have major problems for

19
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.620
accessibility.

20
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.900
You can't catch everything with those but
it's a really good kinda smoke test to

21
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.900
figure out the health of an accessibility
tool or an accessible webpage.

22
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.969
Color contrast is something that I check.

23
00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.368
That is far and away the number one
accessibility problem on the web,

24
00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:20.370
is color contrast.

25
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.570
Not being impactful enough,
small font size and low contrast.

26
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.380
Testing with screen readers, I would save
this like for those of us who aren't super

27
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.460
proficient and screen readers,
you're not using them daily.

28
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.490
It's really good to pair with
someone who does use them daily,

29
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.510
get some user testing and we'll talk
about that a little more later to.

30
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.080
But I do fire up a screen reader,
at least to do some basic testing.

31
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.060
And I've got some cheat sheets in the
applications and a little bit later on.

32
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.830
And we'll do some screen reader
testing a little bit later.

33
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.980
So those are valuable tools.

34
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.370
Cuz sometimes you can just get an answer,
is it working or not?

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.189
Even if you don't know all
of the keyboard shortcuts.

36
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.640
And then lastly, magnification and zoom.

37
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.430
This is a big one,

38
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.020
because there's a lot of low vision
users like way more than blind users.

39
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.788
And so zooming in to see what's,
sometimes you're holding your phone like

40
00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:18.114
really close because you can
see it if it's close to you.

41
00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:21.787
So zooming way in, we wanna make sure
that we're not breaking layouts and

42
00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:23.870
making a really horrendous experience.

43
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.978
So those are kind of
the basic steps that I take
