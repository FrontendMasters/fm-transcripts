00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.375
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: There are so
many JavaScript frameworks, though.

2
00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.765
We're gonna talk about React,
I've got some Vanilla JavaScript in here.

3
00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:10.054
But there's a lot of other frameworks,
and what's the joke,

4
00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:13.606
there's a new JavaScript framework
every six hours or something?

5
00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:18.002
So there's React, Ember, Angular,
Polymer, for the Web components crowd,

6
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.640
Vue, Svelte, and Vanilla,
which just means there's no framework.

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.531
But really, people don't care
what framework you've used.

8
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:31.247
Users just wanna use your site, they don't
care about the JavaScript framework flame

9
00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:33.170
wars or anything like that.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.040
And I have Elmo shrugging
because the average user is not

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.220
worried about how your application
was built, they just wanna use it.

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.550
So kind of keeping that end-user goal
in mind is something that we should

13
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.050
think about.

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.090
And I found through user research and

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.640
user testing that responsive design
is really good for accessibility.

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910
I mean, this is something that's
been written about before,

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.750
I think I already intuitively knew that.

18
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.070
But I got a good reminder when I watched
a low vision user use screen magnification

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.160
on some prototypes that I'd made that
were not built for responsive design.

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.746
So they didn't have a meta viewport tag,
and they were just meant for the desktop.

21
00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:17.950
And I watched this person zoom in on these
interfaces, and it was pretty difficult.

22
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.190
They were having to
horizontally scroll and

23
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.720
figure out where these
patterns were going.

24
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.240
So if you can design your layouts
to be mobile/single-column layouts,

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.342
it's actually really helpful for
accessibility.

26
00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:33.800
And I've heard it from multiple people
with disabilities that say that they

27
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.150
prefer mobile sites because
they're streamlined.

28
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.733
They have less clutter,
less information, they're often simpler.

29
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.242
And so
that can be a really helpful tool for

30
00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:48.629
you as you're creating these layouts and
things, so keep that in mind.
