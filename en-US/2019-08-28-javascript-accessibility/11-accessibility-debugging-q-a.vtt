&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So there's obviously
a lot of stuff that you could be

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.130
testing with and we could have done
a whole day work shop on just debugging,

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.610
so it's kind of hard to cram it in so
we can focus on other things.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.310
A few things I did want to mention were
that, with magnification in particular,

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.130
there was a question about media queries
and trying to react to this browser zoom.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.820
And I zoomed in quite a bit in
my slide deck, I can go all

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.950
the way to 500% whether someone's actually
gonna do that I'm not really sure.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.060
I think the web Content Accessibility
Guidelines talk about 200%, so

9
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.790
if you make stuff work, if there's a level
the aim for I think 200% is the way to go.

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.470
But also this slide deck is more,
it's got a fixed footer,

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.380
it's a different experience than, say the
application which has a responsive layout.

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.910
And if I zoom all the way in here, this
flows a little bit better because it goes

13
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.340
down to one column, and
I don't get horizontal scrolling.

14
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.560
So depending on what kind of
an application you're working on,

15
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.190
that might change what you need
to change a little bit but

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.050
magnification is super helpful
in a lot of different scenarios.

17
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.780
So lots to do with debugging and

18
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.220
that's something you can do all
the time like with a website,

19
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.010
in your personal life, you pull up
a website and just, what's this doing?

20
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.149
And that's something that I look for
a lot and

21
00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.762
if you find something that working
really well, I'd love to hear about it.

22
00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:32.780
I catalog what I call
accessibility wins on my blog, and

23
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.114
it's hard to find good
examples to be honest,

24
00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:41.514
I think New York Times is gonna go on
there now it's a really great example.

25
00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:44.688
So yeah, if you find good things
out in the wild let's celebrate it

26
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:47.241
because it's really worth
highlighting the wins and

27
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:51.230
focusing on what's working as we debug
things that maybe aren't working as well.
