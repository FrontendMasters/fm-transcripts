&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So I talked about ARIA a
little bit, and it is a specification for

2
00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:11.740
supplying accessibility information in
your websites and Web applications.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.603
It's something that I didn't
really get into right away, so

4
00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:19.108
this is definitely an advanced
part of accessibility.

5
00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:24.000
But you'll see it come up often enough
that it's worth diving in a little bit.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.980
So there's three major components in ARIA,
the role, state, and

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.590
property, the role is what is the thing.

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.130
We saw a div go from a div,
which is just a generic container,

9
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.260
to a button, so
that's what type of an element is it?

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.767
The state is what's happening to it,
is it disabled, is it selected?

11
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:47.162
So there's ARIA attributes,
like aria-disabled, aria-selected.

12
00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:50.057
And the property's kind
of a catch-all bucket for

13
00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:53.290
other things,
like aria-label is a good example.

14
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.020
And that's just describing what's
the nature of it, what's its name?

15
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.377
And I also have to say that the first
rule of ARIA is don't use ARIA.

16
00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:06.250
And that's why I say it's a bit
more of an advanced topic,

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.019
cuz it shouldn't be the first
thing that you reach for.

18
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.376
If you can use a button element or
a native form control,

19
00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:16.830
you get a lot of behavior for
free that you don't have to recreate.

20
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.730
But for cases,
really custom Web applications,

21
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.280
that maybe you're inventing new
patterns and there isn't a default HTML

22
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.370
component for you to use, that's where
ARIA can become a really useful tool.
