00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.920
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: And now we're gonna do
some testing on apps in the wild, and

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.820
I'm not picking on anyone.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.380
A lot of the issues that we'll find,
there's like strengths and

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.090
weaknesses in these examples, and a lot
of these things are not unique to them.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.060
So I'm not picking on anyone,
one person or one company.

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.390
So this first link is a slack JSON file
viewer and it's from the Gatsby slack.

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.190
So I'm the only one or

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.310
people on that slack are the only ones
who can view this particular link.

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.200
But you can sort of look at the URL and
it is an uploaded JSON file.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.020
So if you're in a slack workspace, and you
upload either a text file or a JSON file,

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.120
you can find this interface.

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.040
So let's open it and
see what's going on with this.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.620
So they've got this web page.

14
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.000
And this might not be core to
the slack application, but

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790
I'm sure it's got some interaction on it.

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.850
And I put it in the camp of
accessible web applications or

17
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.028
its not super accessible, but
in the things that we could be evaluating.

18
00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:06.420
So this JSON file is some feedback that
we've been collecting on the Gatsby js.org

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.210
website it's got just a data dump of
the comments that people have made.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.010
And if i tab through the web
page I can't really see

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.100
where I am, and so
a kind of hot tip if you're having trouble

22
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.490
figuring out where you are on the screen
for the sighted testers in the audience.

23
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.410
You can just kind of click in the web page
to set your focus point just to figure out

24
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.810
like okay, am I at the end of the page or
something, what's happening here?

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.460
Little quick tip.

26
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.330
So there's a number of items
here that I can't reach.

27
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.740
And if I hover over this little star,
it's says star this file.

28
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.720
It's got a tool tip, but
I couldn't get to it.

29
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.360
And there's some controls over here in the
top right of this little widget that say

30
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.460
Actions.

31
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.810
And there is a little pop up menu
here that I couldn't even get to.

32
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.640
So for a keyboard user or a screen reader
user, you just can't use that feature.

33
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.100
Which is not equal, we should do
more to make that more accessible.

34
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.220
So there's that problem.

35
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.210
And then once I had tabbed,
I'm actually trapped in this content

36
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.700
editable region where the data lives,
where this JSON raw file is.

37
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.770
Because there's something going on here
where it's trapped my keyboard focus and

38
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.070
I can't get it out.

39
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.310
I can't shift tab,
I can't hit tab, I'm locked in.

40
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.060
So that's a pretty blocking issue that

41
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.880
you might not even uncover unless
you're testing with the keyboard.

42
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.260
So there's a couple of issues there.

43
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.920
And to debug real quick, what I would
do to figure out what's going on is I

44
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.400
inspect the element in the developer
tools and I can go and

45
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.050
look at what is going
on with this element.

46
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.860
So there's a button here.

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.960
Its focusable so
if my focus is landing on this button.

48
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.790
But in the CSS, there is an outline zero.

49
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.230
And I actually,
from looking at this earlier,

50
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.620
found that there's two outline
zeroes on this particular button.

51
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.710
So now if I tab onto it,
I can see where I am on the screen.

52
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.521
And we'll talk a little bit more about
CSS later on but we wanna make sure we're

53
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.780
actually testing with the keyword so
we can see where we are on the screen.

54
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.160
Cuz if you can't use the mouse,
that's a pretty fundamental feature.

55
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.860
And through user testing
I've found that those visual

56
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.040
outlines are really helpful for
a lot of people.

57
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.680
So there's the slack viewer.

58
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.870
One more thing I was gonna show you about
this actions menu to see what's going on

59
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.620
with this one.

60
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.910
So, this is an anchor tag,
which is a link element.

61
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.850
And we'll talk about links and
buttons a little later on.

62
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.570
But this anchor tag is not focusable
because it's missing an H ref attribute.

63
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.720
So, whenever you're writing HTML, and
we'll talk about semantics more as well,

64
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.630
we wanna make sure we're using
elements to their full potential.

65
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.040
So, that way we're not missing these,

66
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.740
like really core features
of elements like anchors.

67
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.068
So they're focusable,
they're controls, like I mentioned,

68
00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.930
they're supposed to
navigate a user somewhere.

69
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.870
So this maybe wasn't the best
element to pick like maybe a button

70
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.950
would be more accurate for
something interactive like this.

71
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.120
But the lack of an h ref just
means I can't get to it at all.

72
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.160
So that's how I would debug things
like go figure out what is, you know,

73
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.570
see what the interactions are missing and
then go dig into the dev tools and

74
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.920
see what okay, well,
what elements did they use?

75
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.840
Like, why is this not working?

76
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.690
So let's go to the next one.

77
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.300
I've got GitHub and GitHub's been doing
a lot of work around accessibility,

78
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.760
which is great because there's a lot
of developers with disabilities and

79
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.770
a lot of developers with repetitive
use injuries like myself.

80
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.930
And so you wanna be able to use the
keyboard to be that power user and or even

81
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.080
just regular user you know, average people
who just need to use the the website.

82
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.180
And so if I tab through this one, they've
got a skip to content link at the top.

83
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.144
Some pretty great features here.

84
00:04:57.144 --> 00:04:58.967
I'm going to skip by some of the stuff so

85
00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.940
they've got some menus here that if I
tab onto a button, hit the enter key.

86
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.558
I am now in this little menu and
I can use the arrow keys.

87
00:05:06.558 --> 00:05:10.600
I can hit Esc, and it will send
my focus back where I came from.

88
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.230
So this is an improvement on
the one we saw from slack and

89
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.250
that is focusable and
interactive from the keyboard.

90
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.160
And I'm gonna run a browser
extension on this page.

91
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.070
So I've got ax installed in Chrome,

92
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.430
I'm going to go over here,
pass the elements tab and go to ax.

93
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.930
And I've got this page rendered so
I can hit analyze and

94
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.390
it will return some results for me.

95
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.430
And I'm gonna pop this DevTools window
out so we can see a little bit more.

96
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.110
So it found 37 issues that we
would need to go through and

97
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.000
see like okay what is it returning?

98
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.800
So it says an ID attribute must be unique.

99
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.040
It's on a details menu like it tells
me where in the page this lives,

100
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.650
which element it's talking about.

101
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.960
So I guess there's an input,
that might be the one it's referenced.

102
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.677
I'll have to go look so to figure
out what element it's referring to,

103
00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:07.000
I have a couple options.

104
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.430
I can hit this highlight button.

105
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.940
And put this on the bottom maybe.

106
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.530
So highlight, see where was it.

107
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.090
It might be a hidden element or like
a mobile view or something so what I can

108
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.990
also do is hit, inspect node, and
I can find the element in the dev tools.

109
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.010
And if I Ctrl click on it and
say scroll into view.

110
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.470
Yeah, this has got to be like,
hidden somehow,

111
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.760
maybe something further up the DOM
tree we'll go to the next one.

112
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.730
Sometimes it takes a little bit of
debugging to figure out cuz we can do

113
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.560
a lot of really tricky
things with web pages.

114
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.120
So the next rule that it returned was

115
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.520
elements should not have a tab
index greater than zero.

116
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.190
And we'll talk about tab index.

117
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.030
This one has a tab index of one.

118
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.700
This one is labeled as best practice.

119
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.630
So it's not what we would call
an accessibility violation,

120
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.950
which is something that you
absolutely have to fix.

121
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.520
Best practices are things
that are good to consider.

122
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.530
But you can actually filter these over
here so I can filter by violations.

123
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.750
And the only one that's actually returning
is this idea attribute must be unique.

124
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.900
So that's where I would start,
is like focus on the violations and

125
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.960
make sure you're addressing
the things that are actually issues

126
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.410
because the best practices
are sort of subjective.
