&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: For
working in JavaScript applications.

2
00:00:02.062 --> 00:00:07.000
A lot of times now, CSS is being written
with JavaScript and in JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.030
So it might be a good idea
to add a stable CSS class.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.060
And I have an example of this,
in the slides.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.150
So let's zoom out a little bit.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.166
So in this presentation.

7
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:27.550
I have some CSS in JS and

8
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.740
you can observe that these CSS
class names are randomly generated.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.160
And for a user to try and restyle that,
like i hear about this on Twitter.

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.380
People wanting to change the way
that the Twitter interface works.

11
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.667
If you add some stable class names,

12
00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.949
you can give users a bit more of
a handle to write user style sheets.
