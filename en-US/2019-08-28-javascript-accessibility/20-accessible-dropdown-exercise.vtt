00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: I have two options for

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.020
you, you can step through something
similar to what I just created.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.680
I also have a series of code pens that
you can play with if you wanna work with

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.260
Vanilla JavaScript.

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.110
So this one, the vanilla.js shell.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.104
It has the styles for
you kind of similar to how I had.

7
00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:22.040
But you would go and
write the markup and the ARIA and

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.540
then write some Vanilla JavaScript.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.370
And so in the next break,
that's what we're gonna do.

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.038
So we've been working on dropdowns.

11
00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:32.402
A couple things I wanted to mention.

12
00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:37.211
I didn't really wanna spoil it, but
the answers are in the slide deck.

13
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:42.100
If you found them, they are listed on
the read me on GitHub and in the project.

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.127
So for
each of the exercises we go through,

15
00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:50.187
there will be an answer on the next
slide if you really need to look at it.

16
00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:53.405
In the project, if we go back over here,

17
00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:59.024
there is this examples directory,
and that's where the files live.

18
00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:02.180
They aren't running out of that directory,
but you could open it and

19
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.770
compare what you've been working on.

20
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.109
So that's where those live.

21
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.610
One other thing that I forgot to mention
was that in this dropdown component that I

22
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.860
made in React using an unordered list,
when I was testing this with Safari.

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.990
I found because of the CSS that I'd used,

24
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.470
that made it look just set of
links without bullets in them.

25
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.098
Safari has added a heuristic that
oftentimes people are using lists and

26
00:01:29.098 --> 00:01:33.010
styling them to not
really be lists anymore.

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.620
So to have voice-over announce
how many items are in that list,

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.130
which for a dropdown would be useful,
you have to put the ARIA role of list

29
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.300
back on the UL and on the list item,
I put a role of list item.

30
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.410
That'll just make doubly sure that
assistive technology will announce

31
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.160
how many items are in a list.

32
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.330
And that pattern you might come
up with in all kinds of contexts.

33
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.711
And that's something that if you're
testing with voice-over in Safari,

34
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:02.636
that you might start to uncover.

35
00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.760
There's also a vanilla.js component.

36
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.069
So every time we have answers, there
will be a React one and a Vanilla one.

37
00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.367
For each of these answers we'll have
a React version and a vanilla.js version.
