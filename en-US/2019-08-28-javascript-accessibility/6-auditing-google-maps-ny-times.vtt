WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.391
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Okay, so
GitHub's doing pretty well, I think.

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.570
It's a big site,
there's a lot of features.

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.064
I'm sure they have more
work to do like we all do.

4
00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:11.410
But I think they've done
a lot of really great work.

5
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.230
And let's go look at Google Maps.

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.650
So this is the Google Maps'
web application, not the API.

7
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.340
So the the API that you might
embed on your own website.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.290
The last I checked was not as accessible.

9
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.301
But the web application,
I think they're doing pretty well.

10
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:32.429
So let's see if I look for a dog park, it
suddenly focused directly to this input.

11
00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.510
So I can just start typing.

12
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.756
I can hit arrow keys to go through
the items that it's suggesting to me,

13
00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.860
and it will refresh the map.

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.439
And so this is pretty awesome because
I can just use my keyboard and

15
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.110
I haven't even touched the mouse yet.

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.467
So Andy's Bark Park.

17
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:50.890
Let's see.

18
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.600
I can check that out.

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.503
I hit the Tab key and it sent my
focus into the region of the map.

20
00:00:56.503 --> 00:01:00.850
And you can go pretty deep into
Google Maps' accessibility features.

21
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.740
I think it's brilliant,
at least from a keyboard perspective.

22
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.451
So there's always the keyboard
component we need to consider and

23
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.260
then the screen reader component later on.

24
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.880
So that's where I would start.

25
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.246
But I think that they've done
some really great work here and

26
00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:18.103
maps are inherently difficult.

27
00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:22.948
Trying to represent a map just in
your mind could be very difficult.

28
00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:28.559
And so I think they are solving some
pretty hard problems with this one.

29
00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:33.730
Does anyone one have a web application or
website that they would like to test?

30
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.200
Sort of throw that out there, yeah.

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Go to newyorktimes.com.

32
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.396
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: All right,
let's do it, nytimes.com.

33
00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:47.270
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Okay, page is loading.

34
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.150
I have been shopping for
origins apparently.

35
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.797
So there's a big ad at the top,
thank you, cookies.

36
00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:55.720
All right, so my first step,
start with keyword.

37
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.850
The ad actually has focused
elements in it, which is fun.

38
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.450
It's kind of like a nice thing actually
have ads aren't accessible because then if

39
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.390
you have a disability and you're like,
whatever, I can't even get to this ad.

40
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.085
But sometimes if they're not accessible,
it'll be like reading out an image source

41
00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:15.000
cuz there's no alt attribute and
yeah, it can go horribly wrong.

42
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.053
So I'm gonna fire a voice-over to
test this with a screen reader.

43
00:02:18.053 --> 00:02:21.190
And on a Mac you have
a screen reader built-in.

44
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.260
And I can start it on my Mac keyboard,
I'm gonna hold function command F5.

45
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: VoiceOver on Chrome,
The New York Times- Breaking News,

46
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.030
World News &amp; Multimedia- Google Chrome,

47
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.660
window, The New York Times- Breaking News,
World News &amp; Multimedia.

48
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.100
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: And if you ever
want to silence the screen reader,

49
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.400
you can hit the Ctrl key.

50
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.090
So if you're giving
a presentation like I am,

51
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.310
you can get it to stop reading out
which is really nice sometimes.

52
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.270
So I'm gonna try and

53
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.260
reach interactive controls just
by tabbing through this web page.

54
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.680
So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: link, image, Advertisement.

55
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.870
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Get pass the ad.

56
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Leaving frame,
Leaving frame.frame, leaving frame.

57
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.920
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So the ads are an iframe,
so that's what you're hearing,

58
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.560
leaving frame, leaving frame.

59
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.840
And now I'm into the main
body of the content.

60
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.010
I am on a navigation button.

61
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.940
So Sections Navigation,
button, it's in the banner.

62
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.489
So it's in the header,

63
00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.909
which means that header has been
marked up with a banner, a header.

64
00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.530
So I am on this button.

65
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.220
I should be able to hit the Space key.

66
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.663
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Home Page World U.S.
Politics N.Y.

67
00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:23.208
Business Opinion Tech Science Health
Sports Arts Books Style Food-

68
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:23.800
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Pretty awesome.

69
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.610
So it sent my focus into the menu when
it opened and I can use the arrow keys.

70
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.932
I might need it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Travel Magazine T

71
00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:33.198
Magazine Real-
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So with voice-over,

72
00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:35.583
with the raw keyboard
I can use arrow keys.

73
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:39.121
With voice-over I need to hold
it like a combination and

74
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:43.126
I am usually having to remember
what those are, so let's see.

75
00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:44.570
So voice-over.

76
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: heading level 3, link, STYLE
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Nope.

77
00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.341
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: First heading,
heading level 3, link, STYLE.

78
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.450
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So what happens-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sections, F5, VoiceOver off.

79
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.310
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: It really helps to pull
the cheat sheets that I have included

80
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.020
in the application.

81
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.539
So what you could do, you wanna make sure
that you're making things that work with

82
00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.952
the keyboard and
then also work with the screen reader.

83
00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:07.502
And you can see how I just ran into
something that I wasn't expecting which is

84
00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:09.434
why we need to test super often.

85
00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:14.848
But it also that with screen reader
commands especially with voice-over,

86
00:04:14.848 --> 00:04:17.480
users have to learn those commands.

87
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.501
So there's a combination of keys,
the voice-over key, and

88
00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:25.215
usually the arrows will
navigate through application or

89
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:29.411
interactive components like that
with the screen reader keys.

90
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.250
So it can be different than
just a raw keyboard experience.

91
00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:36.280
So I'm gonna just go back and

92
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.150
test this right now for
times' sake with the keyboard and

93
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.870
then I can go look at the screen
reader experience a little bit later.

94
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.814
So it did send my focus into the menu.

95
00:04:46.814 --> 00:04:49.630
It looks like when I move my
mouse it actually close it.

96
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.420
So there's some like extra layer,
interactive layers going on there,

97
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.608
which is pretty cool.

98
00:04:54.608 --> 00:05:00.910
And if I hit the Enter key, it will take
me to a section like the Politics section.

99
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.106
If I hit Enter on this
little search field,

100
00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:05.180
it sends my focus into the search field.

101
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.950
If I type something,
it will enable the GO button,

102
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.410
which is pretty cool so it's disabled
until I actually type something.

103
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.600
There's some skip links in here.

104
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.570
See, really awesome, and
kudos to the New York Times team for

105
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.690
all the work that you've done on this
because I have checked this before and

106
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.240
it was not as accessible before.

107
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.340
All right, so thank you for that.

108
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.277
And you can test apps out in the wild
all the time and it's good practice.

109
00:05:32.277 --> 00:05:35.666
Obviously, I need to do more
to learn voice-over command so

110
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.510
that they're top of mind.

111
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.020
It's also fine to have
a cheat sheet next to you.

112
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.500
And on our application,
those are right here.

113
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.290
So that's something to keep handy, cuz not
everything is going to work with Tab and

114
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.990
work with the right arrow keys.

115
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.680
I found that NVDA on Windows

116
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.840
is a little bit easier because of
the browse modes that it uses.

117
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.650
Voice-over uses these key
commands instead of browse modes.

118
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.780
So you can play around with both of those.

119
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.008
And if you're a Mac user,
I use a virtual machine to test NVDA and

120
00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:09.762
maybe we'll fire that up a little later.

121
00:06:09.762 --> 00:06:13.794
But you can get free VMs from
Microsoft and use parallels and

122
00:06:13.794 --> 00:06:16.060
then you download NVDA for free.

123
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.570
And so that's how I end up
testing windows on my Mac.

124
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.500
Okay, so debugging in this Gatsby app.

125
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.500
So I mentioned earlier and you probably
saw that you can run Gatsby develop.

126
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.380
And that way, when you're working locally,
making changes, and

127
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.790
you hit save on a file,
it will refresh in the browser.

128
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.810
But that's the debugging mode,
the development mode.

129
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.420
So it's not actually going to
do a full production build.

130
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.090
So if you run Gatsby build and
Gatsby serve in your command line,

131
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.590
that will actually produce static web
pages that do this hydration step.

132
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.130
So that if you turn JavaScript off,
that's how you get the fully built pages.

133
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.860
So there is a bit of a difference
between Gatsby develop and Gatsby build.

134
00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.742
Just want to point that out.

135
00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:02.498
And if you do this Gatsby serve command,

136
00:07:02.498 --> 00:07:08.440
your app will be running locally at local
host port 9000 instead of port 8000.

137
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.740
And so
you can debug a lot with develop mode.

138
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.000
But if you're testing things like
progressive enhancement in particular,

139
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.412
which we'll talk about later, that's when
you would need this Gatsby build and

140
00:07:18.412 --> 00:07:19.078
Gatsby serve.

141
00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:23.225
And you need to regenerate
the build if you make changes.

142
00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:27.579
It's not something I work with all
the time, but I do build Gatsby app

143
00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:31.800
just to make sure that when I'm like,
all right, let's deploy.

144
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.130
That I haven't don't
have broken layouts or

145
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.330
just quirks that sometimes you
need to work out ahead of time.
