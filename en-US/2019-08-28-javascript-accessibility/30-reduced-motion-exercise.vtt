00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.780
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: So, let's play
with this for a couple of minutes.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.830
There's similar to the other ones
there's the empty or like the card flip.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.210
You can go play with
what I just worked on.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.250
Maybe the bad example, you could play
with adding some reduced motion there.

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.080
And then there is a,
let's go see what's in here.

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.420
This is just like a blank canvas one.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.920
That, at least yesterday,
when I was playing with code pen, for

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.050
some reason CSS wasn't working.

9
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.250
It was bizarre.

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.458
So hopefully that'll work for
you today and

11
00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.613
not be the hotel WiFi
problem I was having.

12
00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.584
But you can just add some
sort of a transition and

13
00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:37.710
then add the media query to turn it off.

14
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.960
And the reduced motion setting is
supported a lot of places now.

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.872
I think it's Safari, Firefox, Chrome,
and Edge is chromium based, so

16
00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:48.630
they should have it too.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.300
So it's used widely enough that I think
we can safely fall back on that one.

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.950
So that's some animation.

19
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.150
How did that go for everyone?

20
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.050
Awesome, yeah,

21
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.080
I love that media query because it's
pretty easy to play around with.

22
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.060
It's a good thing to start with,
and you can see that

23
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.200
effect that it has by toggling that
operating system level preference.

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.430
I'd love to see something similar
to that reduced motion for focus,

25
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.310
like we saw with focus-visible.

26
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.448
Like if the user could go and toggle
that on and off, that would be amazing.

27
00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:23.417
So, let's go, keep going.

28
00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:28.862
So reduced motion, we saw the example
with the the little card flip widget,

29
00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:31.850
just being able to change how that works.

30
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.550
The vanilla JS one,
I believe is, yeah, it's that

31
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.300
same example with the circles, if you want
to go back and play with that one later.

32
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.199
It just kinda hard to look at though.

33
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:50.308
I feel like it's amazing how like,
there's so many pulsing animations and

34
00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:53.850
autoplay all over and it seems like
everyone else is fine with it.

35
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.270
And then there's like, always,
when I present things like this,

36
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.920
it's always like visibly affecting people.

37
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.970
So I think it affects more people than
a lot of folks in the industry realize.

38
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.550
So it's great now that we have more
tools and more capabilities to try and

39
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.330
make things more personalized and safe.
