00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Let's talk
about some motion in animation,

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.730
because with a lot of the interactivity
that we're adding to sites,

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.660
the delight that our design teams
are lovingly asking us to add,

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.610
can be unsafe for people with
certain impairments, disabilities.

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.220
People who are motion sick have
sensitivity to a lot of animating

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.640
things on the Internet.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.070
Autoplaying videos come to mind, and

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.050
we can cause actual harm to people if we
aren't more careful with our animation.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.302
Fortunately, we have
a really awesome tool for

10
00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:33.080
this now in CSS called
prefers-reduced-motion.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.510
It's a CSS media query that we can
use to change how our animations

12
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.940
display depending on an operating
system level preference.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.314
We can also do things to help
the situation with motion by adding more

14
00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:51.163
controls to our interfaces,
so regardless of support for

15
00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:56.192
something like prefers-reduced-motion,
if we add playback controls to

16
00:00:56.192 --> 00:01:01.138
give the user more control over
interfaces, and it should say opt-out for

17
00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:06.195
autoplay, like let the user opt-in,
if they want something autoplayed.

18
00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:08.290
Don't just like put
autoplay on everything.

19
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.288
That can be a difficult conversation to
have with some people at your company

20
00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:18.598
sometimes, so I definitely get that, but
this is where, if we can use tooling,

21
00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:22.997
and user preferences,
we can start to make safer interactivity.

22
00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:27.174
And there's a great article linked
here on the opennews.org site about

23
00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:30.188
your interactive is making me sick,
especially for

24
00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:34.844
people who work at news organizations,
like a New York Times, or Public Radio,

25
00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:39.022
you get a lot of interactives that
are really thoughtfully created, and

26
00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:43.780
they maybe they weren't thinking about
motion sickness or motion sensitivity.

27
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.090
So it's good to read more about that.

28
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.870
I have an animation, I have to give you a
content warning, like that's another thing

29
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.900
you could do, if you have something that's
flashing, adding a content warning.

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.007
Maybe you don't show it, or you don't
animate it until the users like, okay,

31
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:06.789
that's fine, because if I want to animate
this, I'm going to open it up on code pen.

32
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.790
And actually,
I know what's happening here.

33
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.270
So I have prefers-reduced-motion
turned on on my machine, so

34
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.460
it's not animating, which is cool.

35
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.010
So if I go to my preferences,
System Preferences on the Mac, and

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.610
I go to the Accessibility-Display, there
is this setting here called Reduce motion,

37
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.100
and if I turn that off, it should start
animating if this is working properly.

38
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.932
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You didn't
hit the button to it.

39
00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:34.983
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: And
I have a toggle button.

40
00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:37.069
Okay, so
there were two things happening here.

41
00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.890
This interface uses reduced motion and
local storage.

42
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.620
So I've obviously interacted with this
before, because it was turned off, and

43
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.710
thank you [LAUGH] for the tip.

44
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.770
So I added a toggle button here,
and if the user preference,

45
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.400
I'm going to turn the animation off,
if I change this reduce motion,

46
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.020
I can react right away to turn it off, and

47
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.160
I'm using that media query to
hide that toggle button as well.

48
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.260
So with CSS, I can do some pretty cool
things to turn animation on and off.

49
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.750
I don't want to leave
that up here too long.

50
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.040
But what I like about that is it gives
the user multiple ways to control it,

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.700
including this toggle button,
which would work in every browser.

52
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.100
It doesn't depend on support for
prefers-reduced-motion.

53
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.566
So here's what the media query looks like.

54
00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:28.929
You say @media (prefers- reduced-motion:,

55
00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:34.050
and then you can add
different qualifiers here.

56
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.260
I'm saying : reduce, so
(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce), and

57
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.331
then I can target any CSS
classes that have animation or

58
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:45.100
transitions applied to them,
and turn them off.

59
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.192
And it helps, like, if you have crafted
animation through your application,

60
00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:55.132
it's good to kind of fine tune your
turning off of it, because it's like a big

61
00:03:55.132 --> 00:04:00.089
blanket, turn it off for everything
hammer doesn't always work that well.

62
00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.474
There's also a JavaScript API for this.

63
00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:06.150
You can use match media to
match that CSS media query.

64
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.284
You can technically do that for
any media query.

65
00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:11.180
But then I can add a listener.

66
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.540
So I've got the motion query for
match media.

67
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.150
I can add a listener, so
if it changes I can go and

68
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.930
adjust the animation, which if my
styles are coming from JavaScript for

69
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.030
some reason,
that might be a nice tool to use.

70
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.749
And some places you can learn more about
this or the WebKit guide, cuz this was

71
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:34.625
originally proposed by WebKit, and
then the Mozilla Developer Network docs.

72
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:40.064
So for a reduced-motion demo I've got,
I'm going to go back to my app and

73
00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:45.594
I've got an animation section here
with my two furry friends, Rainier and

74
00:04:45.594 --> 00:04:51.960
Bagley, and I've got this one on the left
that's the completely inaccessible one.

75
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.506
It only works with a hover,
so that has other problems,

76
00:04:55.506 --> 00:05:00.259
but the Bagley one I can skip down here,
and I've changed that one enough so

77
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.693
that it's actually keyboard interactive,
so it's got a button wrapping it, and if

78
00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:10.551
I hit Enter, it will open that animation
and send focus to the close button.

79
00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:13.943
So the one with Rainier doesn't
even have a close button, so

80
00:05:13.943 --> 00:05:17.670
a keyboard user can't even get
to this Twitter link back here.

81
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.110
He does not have a Twitter account, but

82
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.150
if he did a keyboard user wouldn't be
able to get to it from this link, and

83
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.776
this was taken from,
kind of repurposed from a real web.

84
00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:31.740
So these interactivity

85
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.630
examples where they only work with
a mouse, they come up in real life.

86
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.190
So for this one I'm just gonna go at
a media query to change that kind

87
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.190
of like scaling motion to be
more of a fade in and fade out.

88
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.520
So for this one it is in this animation,
so I've got some CSS here.

89
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.970
To turn, no, that's even a different one.

90
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.860
It's card flip.

91
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.300
Sorry, [LAUGH] card flip is the one that
I'm actually going to go change, and

92
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.750
this is a mostly accessible component,
it's better than the one in the bad.

93
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.840
There's a card flip in here too.

94
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.550
And the fix for this that I'm gonna add
is just right at the bottom in the CSS.

95
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.110
So if I go look in here for, so

96
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.400
I've got transitions,
there's using some vendor prefixes here,

97
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.320
there's a few, I think that's pretty
much it, there's no animation.

98
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.820
But you can just kind of go search around,
what's animating,

99
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.330
what do I need to turn off?

100
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.940
And in this case,
I'm just gonna go down here.

101
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:38.246
I'm gonna say @media
(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce),

102
00:06:38.246 --> 00:06:42.323
and in here, I can go and target,

103
00:06:42.323 --> 00:06:47.434
I think it's team-content-overlay.

104
00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:48.090
Did I see that?

105
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.489
There it is, team-content-overlay.

106
00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:53.750
So it's transitioning everything.

107
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.060
Everything that will be animatable that
is changing when I add this active class,

108
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.230
which I'm toggling with JavaScript.

109
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.143
So some of the animatable properties
here are margins, max height,

110
00:07:06.143 --> 00:07:09.700
opacity, and so
this transition is just easing,

111
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.869
animating anything that is
changing that is animatable.

112
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:16.390
So that's what I'm going to turn off.

113
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.740
I'm just going to say transition: none.

114
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.449
So inside of the selector I'm just
going to say transition: none,

115
00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:31.421
and sometimes you might need a bigger
hammer and saying, !important.

116
00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:35.424
Don't recommend that most of the time, but
if you really want to turn off animation,

117
00:07:35.424 --> 00:07:38.036
like I think the user would
appreciate that working, so

118
00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:41.870
I wouldn't recommend that all the time,
and I don't think I need it in this case,

119
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.705
but if specificity is tripping you up or

120
00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:47.950
something I think a reduced motion media
query is an acceptable place to do that.

121
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.250
Question?

122
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.732
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: More of a comment,
if you don't mind.

123
00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:53.246
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's an article on

124
00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:59.547
CSS Tricks about this, and
it's recommended to change the animation

125
00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:06.168
duration to like 0.001 milliseconds so
that any SVG that builds up,

126
00:08:06.168 --> 00:08:09.104
and it's like a mini video-
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Yeah.

127
00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:13.254
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Actually loads otherwise
it would nothing, nothing would load.

128
00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:13.760
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: Yes.

129
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.931
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
that was something that people found.

130
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:18.110
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton: That is a great point.

131
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.150
So I do wanna pull up this other one.

132
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.640
Sorry for the flashing.

133
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.010
So this one actually has, I've turned off
the transition, and then I'm replacing

134
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.910
the the styles with something else,
so there's some circles in here.

135
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.043
If I go to so there's these pulsing
styles here, and this no animate,

136
00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:43.107
I'm using a mixin in SAS, and this one
I am turning on and off if you click

137
00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:47.919
that button, or if you use the media
query, which is why I like SAS,

138
00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:53.174
I could make something reusable and
call it from two different use cases.

139
00:08:53.174 --> 00:08:56.476
But in this one I'm saying
animation: none !important, and

140
00:08:56.476 --> 00:09:00.896
then giving it something else, because
otherwise, yeah, it was coming up blank,

141
00:09:00.896 --> 00:09:04.640
because it was growing from zero,
and there was nothing to stop on.

142
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.800
It was just blank.

143
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.530
So yeah,
depending on your animation, yeah,

144
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.790
maybe you want to play with
animation delay or duration.

145
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.690
Maybe you want to replace it with
some other CSS styling or something,

146
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.790
so yeah, you can play with that.

147
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:24.226
I think from its simplest,
just turning stuff off should work.

148
00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:29.714
So I'm going to go back over
here to my little Bagley demo,

149
00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:34.890
and I have not,
I think I turned reduced-motion off.

150
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.760
So now it's just open, closed,

151
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.460
there's no scaling and going back down,
and that was a big thing with iOS.

152
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.280
When they had the scaling effect
that was making people sick, and

153
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.300
that moving motion, and
so these effects now,

154
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.860
we can actually do better on the web,
which I think is really cool.

155
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.370
So I can turn Bagley's animation on and
off.

156
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.680
This one I probably could too,
even though it's not keyboard accessible,

157
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.880
I could add that same CSS.
