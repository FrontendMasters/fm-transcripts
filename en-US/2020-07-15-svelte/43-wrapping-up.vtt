00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.454
Questions that are coming in around,
one is

2
00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:09.460
your plans for snowpack or
thoughts on snowpack and spelled.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.940
So that's happening.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.400
Luke Edwards on the core team has
been investigating snowpack and

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.700
Veit a lot recently.

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300
And I think we're gonna have some, well so

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.560
there's already an official spell
integration that Snowpack provide.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.426
And I think we're gonna have an official
Veit integration pretty soon.

10
00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:37.389
So that is something that I'm really
looking forward to cuz that is to

11
00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:41.165
me the next evolution of of
how we build better apps.

12
00:00:42.553 --> 00:00:47.138
&gt;&gt; Another question is with,
if you have an existing framework,

13
00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:52.931
existing website, and you just wanna put
spelt into one component on the page,

14
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:57.620
what's the best way to to build
a bundle into your existing app?

15
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.100
&gt;&gt; So in the same way that in the main
section of the workshop when we built

16
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.051
the Kamiya Parison game,
we had in our main.js you

17
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:16.110
imported app.spelt and
then rendered it inside document.body.

18
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.970
You can render inside any element at all.

19
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.730
So you can just have an empty div and
render your application in there.

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.500
Or you can have some markup that's already
existing and you can hydrate that markup.

21
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.730
Doesn't matter if the markup was
generated by smell in the first place,

22
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.130
it will hydrate anything that it sees.

23
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.010
So is pretty flexible in
terms of allowing you to

24
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.160
to put components inside
non-spelt controlled pages.

25
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.040
And in that way it's a pretty easy
option for incrementally adopting.

26
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.340
So we'd love for you all to get more
involved with a small community.

27
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.040
Stop by our discord server and
spell.dev/chat.

28
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.110
Visit spell society on Twitter.

29
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.280

network of meetups.

30
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.480
And that's our workshop.
