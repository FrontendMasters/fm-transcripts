00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.283
Draw some types of transitions
that just cannot be done with CSS.

2
00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:10.242
For example, we want to have this text
writes on one character at a time as if

3
00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:13.892
someone would type in
the letters out on a typewriter.

4
00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:24.912
And so this is the components marker,
got the paragraph inside this

5
00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:30.370
invisible block and we've already
applied the in typewriter transition.

6
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.940
All that remains is to implement
the typewriter function.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.791
So first we're gonna make sure the node
the transition is been applied to is

8
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:43.913
valid, which is to say that it
just contains a single text node,

9
00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.360
And throw an error if that's not the case.

10
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.550
We're gonna get a reference to
the nodes text content, call it text.

11
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.110
And then we'll set the duration of
the transition to be determined

12
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.461
by the length of the text multiplied by
the speed option that is passed in, or

13
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:14.342
we'll use the default option in
the second argument to the function.

14
00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:16.826
Then we'll pass back that duration, so

15
00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:20.049
that slot knows how long
the animation should take.

16
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.575
And then this time,
instead of passing a CSS method back,

17
00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:24.550
we're gonna pass a tick method.

18
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.992
Again, it takes t,
a value between 0 and 1,

19
00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:32.406
where 0 is fully off screen,
and 1 is fully rendered, and

20
00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:38.352
then we're gonna count the number of
characters that represents that t value,

21
00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.092
T times text.length.

22
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.262
And then we're gonna insert, That

23
00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:57.240
value, Into the element.

24
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.990
I think I've messed up somewhere.

25
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.350
So I'm just gonna refresh the page and
press the Show me down.

26
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.040
And we have a typewriter transition.

27
00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:18.545
And just like the built in transitions,
we can parameterize this,

28
00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:22.134
we can pass it some options,
make it run very slowly.

29
00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:26.918
That was very fast.

30
00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:33.162
Very slowly, Or very fast.

31
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.193
Now, transitions generate events on
the DOM element, which is something

32
00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:51.403
that you occasionally need to do if you
need to chain transitions together.

33
00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:56.906
So we can add event listeners for those
events just like any other DOM element and

34
00:02:56.906 --> 00:03:02.001
then we're gonna have on this paragraph
element which has the transition

35
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:09.879
fly transition added some event handlers,
When the intro starts.

36
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.629
We're gonna set the status to,
Intro started.

37
00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.976
We need to do the same for intro end,
outro start, and outro end.

38
00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.560
And so the status is shown here.

39
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.156
And as the transitions take place,
the status updates.

40
00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:04.030
And that's transitions.
