00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.480
So just like any other
attribute of a DOM element,

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.350
you can set the class of an element
using JavaScript inside curly braces.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.330
But this is such a common pattern
that we have a special directive for

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.650
classes specifically that allow you to
toggle classes based on some condition.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.494
So instead of having current ===
'foo' 'active' otherwise empty,

6
00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:30.150
we can just replace that whole thing
with class:active = current === 'foo'.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.534
And we can get rid of those quotes,
we're not asking anything.

8
00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:37.460
Apply that to all of those.

9
00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:46.927
And now the current class will,

10
00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:51.225
oops, I forgot to add the active.

11
00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:58.106
So now when we click on these,
the active class,

12
00:00:58.106 --> 00:01:03.238
which adds this background style
to the button, will get applied

13
00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:08.296
whenever this condition is true for
each of the buttons in turn.

14
00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:10.857
And that's just less stuff to write.

15
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.954
Just like with the bind value shorthand
and source equal source shorthand that

16
00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:26.089
we've already encountered, you'll
very often have a situation like this

17
00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:32.050
where the class that you're toggling is
the same as the name of the condition.

18
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.730
And so you have something like this
class:big = big, which works like this.

19
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.579
We can just get rid of
the = big part of that, and

20
00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.949
spell it will fill in the blanks for us.
