00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.450
So, we left things with this big to
do on line 35 to do and the game.

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.750
And we need to do better than that,
we need to show the user the results and

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.530
then we need to take them back to
the welcome screen once they exit.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.270
So, let's add another value
less done equals false.

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.437
And then in here,
just change that to done equals true.

6
00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:29.227
Done means that we've
answered all 10 rounds, and

7
00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:31.340
we're ready to see what what happened.

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.370
And then inside our game container,

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.830
we need to represent that somehow.

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.670
Let's add an if done block,

11
00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:51.400
And then add an else block.

12
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.928
I'm just gonna put all of this
await stuff inside the else

13
00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:13.069
And inside here, we're gonna have
an element giving us our results.

14
00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:19.645
Leaving that blank for

15
00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.860
now because we don't have
a representation of the user school.

16
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.560
We're gonna have a message that pops up,
message goes here.

17
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.985
And we're gonna have a button
that takes us back to

18
00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:41.412
the home screen, back to screen.

19
00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:44.090
Okay, let's tackle this bit first.

20
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.770
We want to have a value that is
derived from the results array,

21
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620
that represents how many
answers you got right.

22
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.160
And that's easy enough to do
using a reactive declaration.

23
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:03.011
We can do dollar colon score
= results dot filter for

24
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:06.949
the ones where x is right.

25
00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:10.400
And then just grab the length of that.

26
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.010
That is going to be our score, and

27
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.410
we can replace the three
question marks with that.

28
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.760
And that should be in curly braces,
my bad.

29
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.451
For the message, we're gonna
wanna have a function that will

30
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:34.749
pick out a message that is customized
based on how the person did.

31
00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:39.235
So let's create a thing, pick message
= P which is a value from zero to one,

32
00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:43.600
where zero is you didn't get any right and
one is you got them, all right.

33
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.680
And let's import our pick random function
that we're using in the select module.

34
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.960
All that's gonna do you pass in an array,
and it will randomly select an item from

35
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.540
the array by choosing a random number and
multiplying it by the length of the array,

36
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.680
flooring that, and
then returning that element of the array.

37
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.390
Sleep and pick random, and

38
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.140
then we can implement our pick
message function like this,

39
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.520
if P is less than naught 0.5,

40
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.060
we can return a random
one of messages like,

41
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.470
ouch that wasn't very good.

42
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.052
Must try harder.

43
00:03:44.052 --> 00:03:47.530
If they do up to 8 out of 10,

44
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.414
can give them more encouraging message?

45
00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:59.707
Not bad, keep practicing

46
00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:12.489
If they get up to the eight or nine,

47
00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:20.016
Then good so close.

48
00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:22.350
Almost there

49
00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:29.460
Otherwise they got the top results.

50
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.063
So, return,

51
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.067
Something a little bit more celebrated,

52
00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:45.650
you look flawless victory.

53
00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:52.685
Okay, and
then we can use this function inside our

54
00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:57.206
template replace this message
goes with pick message,

55
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.555
And then school divided by results.length

56
00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:11.540
is gonna give us a value between 0 and 1,

57
00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:21.023
That is pretty much everything,
except that we need

58
00:05:21.023 --> 00:05:25.510
to add an event handler
when we click the button.

59
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.943
We're gonna do dispatch,

60
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.904
Oops, having some trouble
with the meeting software,

61
00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:45.590
dispatcher restart event.

62
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.710
It's under strain that in yellow
because dispatch has not yet

63
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.650
been defined, so
we need to do the same thing once again.

64
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.890
Import create event
dispatcher from svelte.

65
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.734
And create the dispatch function.

66
00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:15.479
And just to bring things
full circle inside app,

67
00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:22.740
when we hear the restart event
coming from the game component,

68
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.317
we just set the state of the app
as a whole back to welcome.

69
00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:37.349
Okay, and
we can check that this is working by,

70
00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.818
I'm just gonna turn this
down to say three rounds.

71
00:06:44.543 --> 00:06:48.420
And then we'll go through
a three round game.

72
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.910
Let's say Anthony Michael Hall?

73
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.550
Yes, was it David Herman?

74
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:03.890
No, voice of Siri, wow,
that's gonna be worth something crazy.

75
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.378
Okay, so it's given us our done screen.

76
00:07:08.378 --> 00:07:10.362
And now if we click on
back to main screen and

77
00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:13.461
hopefully it's gonna take us back
to the welcome screen and it does
