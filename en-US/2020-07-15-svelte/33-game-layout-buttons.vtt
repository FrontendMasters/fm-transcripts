1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.962
Okay, so it's time to start building
the UI a little bit further.

2
00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:08.019
We're gonna create some cards for
the celebrities, and

3
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.733
then use those in the game component.

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.230
And that means we're gonna
create a new component.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.193
There's no a screen but

6
00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:21.850
is a, A separate component.

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.885
So I'm gonna create a new directory
inside source/components.

8
00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:34.866
And I'm gonna create
a component called card.svelte.

9
00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.631
And then inside the game screen,
I'm gonna import that component.

10
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:55.540
And there's really no sorta conventions
about how you organize your components.

11
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.300
I've put this in a separate
components folder, but

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.760
you could also put it next to
the game thoughts component.

13
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.140
It's really up to your
personal preference, and

14
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.607
then we're just gonna
replace these with card

15
00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:13.676
celeb = a, and
then the same thing down here.

16
00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:16.257
Except with b.

17
00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:23.600
I've got an error here.

18
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.210
What's happening?

19
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.810
I did that wrong.

20
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.339
It should be components/card per cell,
thank you, hold up.

21
00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:43.872
And then the card component is obviously
gonna need to export a celeb prop.

22
00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:50.610
And let's just do celeb.name again.

23
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.309
So we can see that something is happening.

24
00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:57.730
Okay, that's working.

25
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.580
So let's flesh out the layout a little
bit of our main game component.

26
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.800
Sorry, yes the main game component.

27
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.340
CSS is not my forte,

28
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.438
so don't mind me if I just copy what
I figured out earlier this week.

29
00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:25.058
Game is gonna use display grid and

30
00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:29.355
we're gonna have three rows.

31
00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:33.786
We're gonna have a row for
the celebrity on top, and

32
00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.020
then a little row, and then a big row.

33
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.410
And the way that that works with
grid is we do 1 fr for fraction,

34
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.333
and then a set height is two ends,
and then another one fr.

35
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.795
And so those files are just gonna fill as
much space as left after you've subtracted

36
00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:55.460
the two M's out of the middle.

37
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.556
And we're gonna give
that a little gap of 0.5,

38
00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:07.922
and make it all the way big and
all the way tall.

39
00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:14.905
But also give it a max width,
just as a way of

40
00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:19.940
preventing the layout from getting crazy.

41
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.020
I'm gonna give it a minimum of 100% or
40 Vh and margin

42
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.569
0 auto just so that it stays in the middle
of the screen instead of wandering off.

43
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.730
Okay, so inside the gang component,
we have these three divs here,

44
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.530
and they all need to have
some styles in common.

45
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.691
So we're just gonna do game,
and then div is a descendant,

46
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:56.290
they're gonna use display flex,
With a line items center.

47
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.260
That's gonna give us nice vertical
centering when we're in desktop mode.

48
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.270
So that's the mobile layout taken care of.

49
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.772
But we also wanna have
a separate desktop layout,

50
00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:16.143
which is gonna kick in
above 640 pixels wide.

51
00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:25.904
So on mobile, we've got celebrity,
same celebrity on desktop,

52
00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:31.258
one celebrity, same celebrity, because
we wanna use the space available to us.

53
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.777
And we're gonna get rid of the template
rows because it's all gonna be columnar at

54
00:04:44.777 --> 00:04:47.337
this point, and had grid template columns.

55
00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:58.104
And similarly we're gonna have 1fr,
8m's and then 1fr.

56
00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:03.867
Now I found a really weird Safari bug
when I was building this earlier, so,

57
00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:11.003
I'm just gonna add some extra styles,

58
00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:15.739
max height: calc 100vh- 6m.

59
00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:20.945
And one day I will build
a project that doesn't have

60
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:25.679
weird Safari bugs, but
today is not that day.

61
00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:30.262
And in desktop mode,
then we want to take that button.

62
00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:34.288
This button class equals same and

63
00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:39.470
we're gonna give that a height of 8m's.

64
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.450
All right, so that is more or
less what we want.

65
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.180
Obviously it looks a little
bit wonky at the moment,

66
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.589
because we haven't put
the celebrity cards in yet.

67
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.190
But that's the layout that we're after.

68
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.432
So let's go over to the card style
component and start implementing that.

69
00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.960
I'm gonna create an element to contain
everything called likecar.outer.

70
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.930
And then inside that,
we're gonna create a button.

71
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.210
And the reason that we're using a button
is because these are interactive elements.

72
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.920
They're things that the user
supposed to click on.

73
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.250
And a nice thing about using buttons is
we get a lot of accessibility properties

74
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.240
for free.

75
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.520
So right now on the diploid site,
if I'm someone who uses the keyboard

76
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.640
instead of the mouse for whatever
accessibility reasons I might have.

77
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.560
I can press the Tab key, and it will take
me between the elements on the page.

78
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.480
So if I think that David Herman
is the better paid,

79
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.050
then I can tap to his face and
then hit the spacebar.

80
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.520
And I'm wrong, but
I'm gonna get this one right.

81
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.961
Definitely, Eric Roberts,
let's get back on this, okay.

82
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:07.215
So we're gonna use buttons in all three
cases for both the celebrities and

83
00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:10.120
the same price thing in the middle.

84
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.975
Button class = card inner.

85
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:24.708
And the button is gonna have
the background image that corresponds to

86
00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:26.256
the celebrity image.

87
00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:33.209
style = background- image.

88
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:40.990
And that's what that is gonna look like.

89
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.480
And then inside there,
we're gonna have these details elements.

90
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.950
I'm just gonna grab one of
those from the existing site.

91
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.648
Copy outer HTML.

92
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.924
And just tidy it up a little bit.

93
00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:12.963
Get rid of the scoping classes.

94
00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:21.742
And what we're left with
is some static markup,

95
00:08:21.742 --> 00:08:24.915
that is specific to Jess Walton.

96
00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:30.359
It's gonna replace that
with the properties

97
00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:38.821
of our celebrity objects at
celeb.id celeb.name and celeb.type.

98
00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:48.490
Then we need to add some styles.

99
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.270
So right now, this is unstyle.

100
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.871
So it's rendering all the correct
marker but it looks like garbage, so

101
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.899
we need to fix that.

102
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.940
First up, cut outs that needs to
fill the space available to it.

103
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.989
And then the button needs
to fill that space.

104
00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:33.166
Okay, that works okay on mobile but
not on desktop yet.

105
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.138
Fix the background so

106
00:09:38.138 --> 00:09:43.714
that it's centered in the middle
of the element and doesn't repeat.

107
00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:59.920
And far that should be this.

108
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.630
Background size cover just means
that the background image is gonna

109
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.660
scale to fill the entire element,
regardless of the relative aspect ratio.

110
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.140
So if you have a square image and

111
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.950
you have a slightly oblong button,
then the image will expand outwards.

112
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.040
Did you see everything?

113
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.070
The position here is 50% 0,

114
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:24.502
that defines the position within
the image about which it gets scaled.

115
00:10:24.502 --> 00:10:29.497
So 50% zero means, if you have an image
like this, it's gonna take this point

116
00:10:29.497 --> 00:10:34.581
right here, and it's gonna expand from
that point outwards to fill the element.

117
00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:41.988
Hide everything else
inside of the element,

118
00:10:41.988 --> 00:10:44.250
take the default button styles off.

119
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.660
We don't want any padding and we don't
want the text to be central lined too.

120
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.580
We want it to be left lined.

121
00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:11.176
I'm gonna go ahead and
steal some styles from the site.

122
00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:17.442
Details, I'm just gonna grab
all of this stuff here.

123
00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:31.196
Similarly, for the h2 element,
which is just his name here.

124
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.340
Out Loud that's the anchor tag.

125
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:46.253
Let's go up on, select that h2
just needs some margin, my sneezy.

126
00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:55.157
And then the spirit which is
the type of celebrity as reported by

127
00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:59.074
the celebrities themselves,
just grab all of that.

128
00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:03.008
Add a new type selector.

129
00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:11.170
And finally, we need to add a media query.

130
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.960
Again 640px cuz that's
the breakpoint that we've chosen.

131
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.530
And that is gonna change
the shape of the card.

132
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.510
So that on desktop it becomes a square
that always sits in the middle

133
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.240
of its container as opposed to
trying to fill the container.

134
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.010
And we do that with a little trick, we set
the height of the element to zero, but

135
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.730
then we use padding to expand it back out.

136
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.430
There is an aspect ratio
property come in to CSS but

137
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.240
it's not supported everywhere just yet.

138
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.551
So for now, we're gonna do
the padding aspect ratio trick.

139
00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:55.189
Hopefully, okay,
that is giving us perfectly

140
00:12:55.189 --> 00:13:00.617
square celebrity's on desktop,
and then on mobile.

141
00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:03.800
Well, it looks a bit terrible on mobile.

142
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.861
I think I might have missed
something somewhere.

143
00:13:09.592 --> 00:13:12.702
But let's not worry about that just yet.
