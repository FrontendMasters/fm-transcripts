00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.540
Occasionally it can be quite useful
to inspect the piece of data

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.060
as it's flowing through your application.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.850
One approach that we've already
seen is using console.log.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.240
And you can use console.log inside your
markup as well as inside your script tag.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.980
But if you want to pause execution as
if you're using the debugger statement

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.300
in JavaScript, you can use the debug tag
with a comma separated list of all of

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.240
the values that you want to inspect.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.531
So let's take this console.log here and
replace it with debug user.

9
00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:39.545
And now when this changes,

10
00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:45.120
It actually pauses execution
of the entire application.

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.320
And it shows us where we are and

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.696
then you can inspect the values
as if you were using

13
00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:59.075
the debugger tag in your
own JavaScript modules.

14
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.154
And that's it, we've completed
the entire Svelte tutorial.

15
00:01:07.154 --> 00:01:09.130
So we've covered a lot of ground.

16
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.660
We've covered everything from the very
basics of what a component looks like

17
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
through to all of the advanced features
that you might need to lean on

18
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.290
when you're building
a real world application.

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
&gt;&gt; Okay, so one question is what's slots?

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.946
You have to bind a slot to an element,
like a physical, or

21
00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:31.796
like a div, or whatever,
if you didn't want that markup,

22
00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:36.266
is there a way to,
that extra markup of the container?

23
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:40.123
Is there any way to have
that container markup?

24
00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:42.273
&gt;&gt; No,
it's something that's been talked about,

25
00:01:42.273 --> 00:01:44.329
right now you need to
have a container element.

26
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.708
Or you can add display contents and

27
00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:52.427
it will be as if it wasn't there
&gt;&gt; With page transitions,

28
00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:55.525
what's the easiest way to accomplish that?

29
00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:56.601
Are you gonna get into that?

30
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.802
Like routing and
stuff with sapper or what?

31
00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:02.580
We are but
we're not gonna cover page transitions.

32
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.356
It's basically like any other transition,

33
00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:09.373
we don't have a really good set
of examples of page transitions,

34
00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:12.599
that's something that we
need to work on honestly.

35
00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.130
It would be a little bit out of scope for
today's course though.
