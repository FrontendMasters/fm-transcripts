WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.395
So we're gonna take everything that we
learned previously in the course and

2
00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:06.582
we're gonna apply it to building a game.

3
00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:10.977
And the game that we're gonna
build is based on data from

4
00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:15.220
a website that I absolutely
love called cameo.com.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.640
Now Cameo is a wonderful website,
it's a place where celebrities

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.446
including a bunch of people that
you've heard of, will in exchange for

7
00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:32.094
money record a 30 second personalized
clip for you the Cameo user.

8
00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:36.399
So you can get the Insane Clown Posse
to roast your friends or

9
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.249
wish your spouse a happy anniversary.

10
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.747
And once I discovered this site,

11
00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:48.581
I became obsessed with the idea that if
enough celebrities join this platform,

12
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.022
then because they're all kind
of adjusting their prices and

13
00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:57.811
responding to market pressure,
then we finally have a way to form

14
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:03.410
a definitive star power ranking across
all different kinds of industries.

15
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.161
We've got movie stars,
rock stars, NBA stars,

16
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:12.290
wrestling stars, every kind of star,
they're all in here.

17
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.860
And they're all waiting for you to go and
ask them to make a personalized video.

18
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.880
Now, unfortunately,
there is no official Cameo API.

19
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.450
So we're gonna have to use
some scraped data that I've

20
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.397
made available this URL
cameoexplorer.netlify.app.

21
00:01:33.397 --> 00:01:37.242
This is just a very simple app that
I built for exploring this data and

22
00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:38.500
exposing it.

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.590
And so
you can see that Dennis Rodman is in here.

24
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.890
Susie Essman from Curb Your Enthusiasm.

25
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.920
In addition to the the data
that is available

26
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.330
through these celebrities' Cameo profiles,
we've also got this most similar to.

27
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.140
So what this API has done is it's
compared all of the little tag lines,

28
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.550
like HBO Curb Your Enthusiasm.

29
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.510
It's compared those with
everyone else's to try and

30
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.190
find the phrases that are most similar.

31
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.540
So if we flick on Saverio Guerra,
for example, it's Mocha Joe.

32
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.670
And he's also related to this
guy Ryan Vasquez who's also in

33
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.619
Curb Your Enthusiasm.

34
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.060
And this works pretty well, and

35
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.030
this means that when we build our game,
we're gonna be able

36
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.670
to take people who have been in the same
shows and put them against each other and

37
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.370
you can see which member of the Office
cast is worth the most, for example.

38
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.060
So here's Dean Norris,
who is Hank from Breaking Bad.

39
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.858
And he is most similar to
Steven Michael Quezada, who is Gummy

40
00:02:54.858 --> 00:03:00.950
who was Hank's partner in the DEA and
best friend for many years.

41
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.087
And yet can only charge a fifth, $40,

42
00:03:05.087 --> 00:03:10.500
of what Dean Norris can charge,
which is outrageous.

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.367
Okay, so all of this data is
available at celebs.json.

44
00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:22.490
And this is what we're gonna
be using to build our game.

45
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.270
So we're gonna begin by
cloning the starter repo.

46
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.430
There's a link on
the spelt workshop website.

47
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.960
Again, if you're not on that website
right now, I recommend that you go to it.

48
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.520
It contains all of the useful links
spelled-workshop.netdefy.app.

49
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.608
And we're currently on
the building a game section, and

50
00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:49.317
it contains a link here to the starter
repo which is github.com/RichHarris,

51
00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:54.874
my name, /kamiyaparisonstarter,
Kamiya Parison is the name of the game.

52
00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:57.315
So grab that,

53
00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.476
And then just clone that repo CD into it.

54
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:22.086
And while it's installing dependencies,
I'm gonna show you what the final version

55
00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:24.737
of this game that we're gonna
build together is gonna look like.

56
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:30.046
So we have two screens,

57
00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:34.079
we have this welcome screen where you can
pick one of seven categories, actors,

58
00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:37.900
athletes, comedians, creators,
models, musicians, and reality TV.

59
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.140
And then, oops, failed to load data,
that's not a good start.

60
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.610
Then it will present ten pairs of
celebrities, and your job when you're

61
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.870
playing the game is to decide which of
these you think is worth the most money.

62
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.412
In this case, I'm going to go with Oscar.

63
00:04:57.412 --> 00:05:00.600
And I was right.

64
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.740
And we'll just go through
that one at a time.

65
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.352
I've started to get pretty good at this.

66
00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:10.170
And I'm gonna go with Duncan.

67
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.920
No, bad guess.

68
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.310
And once you've completed all ten,
it'll tell you the results and

69
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.720
take you back to the welcome screen.

70
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.730
So it's pretty simple,

71
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.900
but you can see there's a few
different things going on here.

72
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.480
We've got some transitions happening,

73
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.680
we've got some asynchronous
data loading happening.

74
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.930
And various little bits of motion, we've
got one of those crossfade transitions so

75
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.180
that when you click on a face and the big

76
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.020
result icon appears, it then sort of
goes down into the results row there.

77
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.842
And we're gonna be building all of this
in the next section of this workshop.

78
00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:55.770
So dependencies are installed,
let's get started.

79
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.030
NPM run dev is going to launch
our development server.

80
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.881
In fact, you know what, I'm going to
launch this from the terminal inside VS

81
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:07.276
code because that way we'll be able
to see everything all in one go.

82
00:06:10.554 --> 00:06:11.280
Just bring that open.

83
00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:20.050
Open my terminal.

84
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.288
Do MPM run dev.

85
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.517
Okay app is ready and
running on local host 5,000.

86
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.418
Right, and this is basically what
you would get if you were to

87
00:06:35.418 --> 00:06:38.750
claim the spelt default starter template.

88
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.070
There's just a couple of small additions,
which is that I've replaced

89
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:49.530
the fav icon with a logo for
Kamiya Parison.

90
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.620
And I've added some little
utilities here that we're gonna

91
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.549
use when building the game.

92
00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.879
And I've added some icons for,

93
00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:05.209
The green check and the red cross.

94
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.645
But other than that,
it's just the default starter template.
