00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.427
Okay, so
now that we've created the buttons,

2
00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:06.191
we've got the buttons inside this
Card component for the selectors, and

3
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:09.850
we've got another button for
the same price, we need to wire those up.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.534
Which means employing
createEvent dispatcher,

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.567
Creating a dispatch function.

6
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.535
And then once the button gets clicked,

7
00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.779
I'm just gonna make that slightly neater,

8
00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:45.524
we can do on:click=()
=&gt; dispatch('select').

9
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.175
And then in our Game component,

10
00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:00.510
we can add a select handler to
both of the celebrity cards.

11
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.783
Now, we don't yet
know what's gonna happen there, so

12
00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:18.977
I'm just gonna leave that blank, like so.

13
00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:26.943
And we're gonna add a similar thing to
the button, except instead of on:select,

14
00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:29.095
it's gonna be an on:click.

15
00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:33.328
And then we need to create
a function that is gonna get called

16
00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:35.875
when each of these things happens.

17
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:40.209
We'll call it submit, because the user
is submitting their response.

18
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.012
And what submit is gonna need is, is it's
gonna need the celebrity on the left and

19
00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:54.394
the celebrity on the right and some sort
of representation of the user's guess.

20
00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:59.100
And the way that we can do this is, and
there's many ways that we can do this, but

21
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.768
the way that I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna pass in

22
00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:04.860
the celebrity objects as
the first two arguments.

23
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.060
And then the third argument is gonna be a
sign, which is gonna be either -1, 0 or 1.

24
00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:18.275
And then we will see

25
00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:23.404
if, The Math.sign(),

26
00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:27.654
which is a function that's a Math.sign(),
if you give it a positive number,

27
00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:31.570
it will return 1, if you give it
a negative number, it will return -1.

28
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.311
If you give it 0, then it will return 0.

29
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:35.085
So that's very useful for
this particular use case.

30
00:02:35.085 --> 00:02:39.042
Math.sign(a.price- b.price),

31
00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:45.100
that value is gonna be 1 if a is
the more expensive celebrity.

32
00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:50.730
So if that matches the sign
that was passed in,

33
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:03.380
Then the result is right,
otherwise it's wrong.

34
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.100
Then we can console.log that result.

35
00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:20.705
And then once that's happened, we can
increment the index of the current round.

36
00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:27.770
If i is less than the number
of rounds in the game -1,

37
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.170
then increment it, otherwise,

38
00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:38.880
We're gonna end the game, but
we'll leave that as a to-do for now.

39
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.430
So now we just need to call this function
from each of those event handlers.

40
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.384
on:select you're gonna submit a, b.

41
00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:49.566
And then if we have clicked on
card where the celebrity equals a,

42
00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:53.601
then we're guessing that a is
the more expensive celebrity.

43
00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:58.180
So the sign is gonna be 1,
because a.price- b.price.

44
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.393
And then it will be the reverse for
the other celebrity, -1.

45
00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:14.010
And then, finally, for the guess where
it's the same price, it's gonna be 0.

46
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.780
So let's try that.

47
00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:24.870
Let's guess Carrie St. Louis.

48
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.635
I was wrong.

49
00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:28.911
I don't know if you can see that
on the video, but down here,

50
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.300
it's telling me that the result was wrong.

51
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.242
Two people from Big brother.

52
00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:37.547
I have no idea who.

53
00:04:37.547 --> 00:04:43.219
It'll actually click through to,
cameo.com.

54
00:04:45.758 --> 00:04:49.222
Gary Busey is definitely the more
expensive than these two.

55
00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:53.620
Also, his videos are completely unhinged.

56
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.270
I got that right,
result code on the right.

57
00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:02.721
Okay, so
we need to display that result somehow.

58
00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:07.590
But we've got everything pretty much
wired up the way we need it to.

59
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.040
So let's move on to app.
