00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.640
Okay, gonna go to the lighthouse tab.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.390
So this is a really useful way of catching
any obvious mistakes that you've made in

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.175
your app before you deploy it.

4
00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:13.000
Gonna click on Generate Report here,
and it's gonna warn that Lighthouse and

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.090
then do some checks.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.161
Okay, so Chrome extensions negatively
affected this page's load performance,

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.940
try auditing in incognito mode.

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.125
Great tip, so, I'm gonna open

9
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:35.100
an incognito tab and just close that.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.096
Run Lighthouse again.

11
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.627
Okay, we're missing some
SEO recommendations,

12
00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.220
document needs to have a meta description.

13
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.130
And tap targets and
not sized appropriately.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.534
So this is telling us that we
need to add a meta name equals

15
00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:57.836
description content equals something.

16
00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:01.660
So the index.html file is
where stuff like that belongs.

17
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.335
It's gonna add meta name=description,

18
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:15.945
content=CameoParison: the Cameo

19
00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.361
comparison game.

20
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:23.671
Those tapped targets being too small, so

21
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:30.072
it's telling us that these buttons
here are not big enough for

22
00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:34.390
a mobile user to be able to use reliably.

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.458
So, it says that those should be

24
00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:44.159
at least 48 by 48 pixels.

25
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.655
So we're gonna go back to our
CSS on the welcome screen and

26
00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:52.696
change that padding to
1em instead of 0.8ems.

27
00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:58.174
And I think that looks
a little bit better as well,

28
00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:02.567
just check that still fits onto
an iPhone 5 screen, it does, great.

29
00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.277
So we can use that.
