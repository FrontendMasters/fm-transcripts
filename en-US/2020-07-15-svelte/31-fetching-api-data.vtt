WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.107
So we're gonna import
on mount from console.

2
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:16.527
And then inside on mount.

3
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:22.303
We're gonna load a load of celebrities and

4
00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:27.152
we're gonna assign the value of
the celebrities to, in fact, no we're not.

5
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.640
We're gonna create a promise

6
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.510
that represents the result
of that asynchronous call.

7
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.100
Let's call it celebs promise.

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.093
Like that.

9
00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:44.709
This will make more sense in a moment,
side here,

10
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:50.606
we're gonna do celebs
promise equals load celebs.

11
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.390
Then we just need to implement
the load celebs function.

12
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.985
There's gonna be an asynchronous function.

13
00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:12.123
That's gonna fetch some data from.

14
00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:17.860
The cameo explorer that we
were looking at earlier.

15
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.972
So specifically,
this file is the one that we want.

16
00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:34.604
And we'll just desalinize that as Jason,
and then log it out.

17
00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:45.632
So now you can see that as soon
as the application starts and

18
00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:50.508
that unmount function runs,
we load the celebrities and

19
00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:55.283
we get this list of 2,629
different cameo celebs,

20
00:01:55.283 --> 00:02:00.891
including Dennis Rodman,
Bangman Brandon and various others.

21
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.684
We're not gonna use all 2,600 of them
though because some of them are,

22
00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.908
frankly not people that anyone
is gonna have heard of.

23
00:02:07.908 --> 00:02:13.600
So, we're gonna use a simple
heuristic to subset that list and

24
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.410
only include the ones that we care about.

25
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.050
And that is how many reviews they've had.

26
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.700
So you can look at.

27
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.591
Each of this and see the bangbangbrandon?

28
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:28.352
Despite being the most expensive
of all of the celebrities,

29
00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:31.723
in this set, he set his price at $999.

30
00:02:31.723 --> 00:02:34.170
Has anyone reviewed?

31
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.160
So he's probably not as big
a deal as Dennis Rodman,

32
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.770
who has the comparatively cheap
price of $600 for a 30 second video.

33
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.720
But has 24 reviews but
a lot of them have even more reviews.

34
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.766
Let's see, James Murray down here.

35
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:59.494
Who I think is the guy
from impractical jokers.

36
00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:04.941
Maybe yeah, this guy, okay,
so he has a lot of reviews so

37
00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:08.800
he is probably using cameo quite a lot and

38
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.128
making a nice little
side income off of that.

39
00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:20.896
And we're gonna set a threshold
if someone has had 50 or

40
00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:25.410
more reviews then we consider them
worth including in a quiz because

41
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.096
it's no fun if you go through the quiz and
you don't have anyone in it.

42
00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:34.247
We're also gonna need to
create a lookup of these maps

43
00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:37.910
from a celebrity ID to a celebrity object.

44
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.920
For reasons that will
become clear later on.

45
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.636
So I'm gonna create a new map.

46
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:54.005
And then we're gonna populate that
look up, like so, lookup.setc.id.

47
00:03:54.005 --> 00:04:01.480
See, then you can see what that,
looks like.

48
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.700
It's a map of Id object.

49
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.920
And then we're gonna create a subset
of the celebrities that we care about.

50
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.613
It's gonna loop over that list.

51
00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:23.732
And if.

52
00:04:25.172 --> 00:04:30.994
A celebrity has more than or
equal to 50 reviews.

53
00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:37.048
Then we're gonna add them to the set.

54
00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:43.736
And if that's celebrity has anyone that
they're similar to then we're gonna give

55
00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:45.505
those people a pass on the threshold.

56
00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:49.311
We're gonna include those as well,

57
00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:53.983
just cuz it makes the quiz
more interesting.

58
00:04:57.142 --> 00:05:00.642
And we can use the lookup that we
just generated to find those people.

59
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:12.350
Then we're gonna return both the subsetted
list, which is gonna be an array like so.

60
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.955
Array dot from subset.

61
00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:18.848
And the locker [SOUND] Okay, so

62
00:05:18.848 --> 00:05:26.634
that is the function that's
gonna get the external data and

63
00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:32.565
process it for
the needs of our application.

64
00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:37.880
So, all the remains is to switch
over to the playing state

65
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.307
once that data has loaded, so
we're gonna make this start

66
00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:48.770
handler a sync function now,
because then we can do this.

67
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.630
Get that data from the promise now we need

68
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.820
to figure out which of these celebrities
are gonna be included in our quiz.

69
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.833
So we're gonna make a selection.

70
00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:09.720
Create that selection state.

71
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.261
And then we're gonna use the The select

72
00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:18.158
function is already
included in the start repo.

73
00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:20.830
We're not gonna bother implementing
this during the workshop,

74
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.200
but you can take a look and
see how it's working.

75
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.420
It's taking the list and the lookup.

76
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.150
It's filtering them on category.

77
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.570
And then for
as many rounds as there are, it's taking

78
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.140
a celebrity at random, removing them from
the eraser and they can't be picked again.

79
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.429
And then, randomly if they
have similar celebrities, and

80
00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:49.503
plays a three and
four chance that it will pick one of them,

81
00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:53.971
otherwise it will just
pick any random celebrity.

82
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:56.432
Put that into our selection array,

83
00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:02.018
make sure that they don't get picked again
later, and then it will return that.

84
00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:07.085
So, we're gonna import that

85
00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:13.173
select function from select.js.

86
00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:18.350
[BLANK AUDIO] And we're

87
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.750
gonna filter it on the slug of

88
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.060
the category that was selected.

89
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.618
So that's gonna look like this

90
00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:42.033
the.detail.category.slug and

91
00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:46.306
then we just need to go to

92
00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:50.796
state equals playing and

93
00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:56.240
so now, hang on a minute.

94
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.260
What we got here lookup is not a function.

95
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.940
So it's telling us that on line 33
of app.spelt we've got a mistake is

96
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.020
where it says subset.add lookup,
parentheses ID,

97
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.590
that should be lookup.get
because lookup is a map.

98
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:16.530
So, replace that and
no more console errors.

99
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.250
So now if everything has worked correctly
when we select one of these categories,

100
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.630
it's gonna take us to the game screen,
which we haven't yet implemented.

101
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:31.810
So that is checkpoint one that is the
first step of building this application.

102
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.560
And the next step, we're gonna start
building the actual game play.
