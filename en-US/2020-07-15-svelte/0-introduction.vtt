00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.290
Welcome, friends and enemies, to the first
ever Frontend Masters Svelte workshop.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.226
I'm your instructor, Rich, and
we've got a full day ahead of us.

3
00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:10.730
I hope you're ready.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.840
I am gonna be reading from this website,
which is svelte-workshop.netlify.app.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.980
I recommend that you open that website
on your own browser because it contains

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.110
useful links that we're gonna be working
through as the course progresses.

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.490
After the course ends, this is gonna
live on as a companion resource.

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.780
It lives on GitHub.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.850
So issues and pull requests are welcome,
if there are any changes or

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.800
any fixes that you spot that need making.

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.450
But other than that, let's get into it.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.630
So about this workshop.

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.270
The idea is that we're
gonna go from assuming that

14
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.336
you have absolutely no knowledge
about Svelte whatsoever,

15
00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:55.700
to being able to build a fully dynamically
server-rendered progressively enhanced,

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.150
personalized, interactive application.

17
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.290
And we're gonna deploy that all
in the space of a few hours.

18
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.950
It's gonna happen in four parts.

19
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.760
We're gonna have the introduction where
I'm gonna explain what Svelte is,

20
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.760
why you might consider using it.

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.660
Then we're gonna have a series of short,
interactive exercises so

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.180
that you become familiar with
the syntax of a Svelte component and

23
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.790
you understand what features Svelte has.

24
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.040
And then from there we're gonna use
that knowledge to build a simple game.

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.902
And finally, the main part of the course,

26
00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:26.350
we're gonna build that
application that I mentioned.

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.255
It's a lot to get through,
but I think we can do it.

28
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:35.040
So who am I?

29
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.130
I'm the creator of Svelte.

30
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.800
I created it back in 2016, a lifetime ago.

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.070
My job is in the news business.

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.580
I've spent my adult life working
in news organizations using

33
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.810
JavaScript to help tell stories in ways
that are more interactive and data-driven.

34
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.290
Right now, I'm a member of
the New York Times graphics department.

35
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.710
That's the day job,

36
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.530
by night I prowl the streets of GitHub
committing acts of open source.

37
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.500
And I'm on Twitter @rich_harris.

38
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.622
You can find me at that link and
message me and learn more about Svelte.

39
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:13.430
I wanna take a quick
moment to thank everyone

40
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.966
involved in producing this course, Mark
and the whole team at Frontend Masters.

41
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.620
I wanna thank our friends at Codesmith who

42
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.440
are providing the space
that we're in right now.

43
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.516
The Svelte community of users and
contributors, or Svelte Society,

44
00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:32.089
as we call ourselves, or
if you're a fan of the Svelte loader.

45
00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.500
And I wanna thank you for being here.

46
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.450
A little bit of housekeeping.

47
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.360
I am gonna be using Visual Studio Code.

48
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.390
It's a very popular editor.

49
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.120
If you're not using it,
I highly recommend it.

50
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.320
There's a download link on the website.

51
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.190
And we're gonna need to install
the Svelte Beta extension.

52
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.560
That provides you with syntax
highlighting and also completion and

53
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.780
all the rest of it.

54
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.110
There are two Svelte extensions
in the VSCode extension store.

55
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.010
One of them is just called Svelte.

56
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.280
That's the one that's been deprecated,
the current one is called Svelte Beta, and

57
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.580
that is gonna take over from
the current Svelte extension.

58
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.950
A little bit confusing, and that will
probably change in a few months, but for

59
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.291
now install Svelte Beta.

60
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.300
And for the final part of this workshop,
we're gonna be using some

61
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.780
free online services that you
will need to sign up for.

62
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.650
The first of these is Fauna,
which is a cloud database.

63
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.442
We're gonna be using Auth0 for
authentication.

64
00:03:23.442 --> 00:03:25.319
We're gonna be using
an API called Weatherbit,

65
00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.530
which is gonna give us weather data.

66
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.530
And that one, it will take a little
bit to provision the API key.

67
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.800
So I recommend that you do
that now while I'm talking.

68
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.660
And finally,

69
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.070
if you wanna deploy the app as we build
it, then we'll need to use Vercel.

70
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.694
So you sign up for
a free account with Vercel and

71
00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:45.140
download the Vercel command
line interface for deploying.
