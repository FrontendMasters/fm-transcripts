00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.110
Another type of binding that might not be
obvious because it's not a form element

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.350
is the media element binding.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.760
And there's a bunch of different
media element bindings,

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.270
there's the current time, there's
the volume, there's the post state.

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.900
All of these things can be
added to a media element.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.210
And there's quite a lot of markup in this
tutorial, so if you wanna dive into it,

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.890
then have a look at this in your own time.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.290
But for now, I'm just gonna go down
here and click on the Show me button so

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.490
that we can see what this actually
looks like once we've added

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
all of the bindings to this video element.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.395
And we bind it to the current time,
we bind it to the duration, and

12
00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:49.590
we bind it to the post date, and we're
using those to build the video player UI.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
Click anywhere on here,
and the video will start.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.939
I can drag, rewind, and click to pause.

15
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.900
Now, a nice thing about the media
element bindings is that they're not

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.490
just using native DOM events.

17
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.380
They're actually using
requestAnimationFrame,

18
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.310
where applicable, so that the current time
is updated 60 times a second as opposed

19
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.810
to four times a second or thereabouts,

20
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.130
which is what you get if you're using
progress events on the media elements.

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.316
I keep talking about media elements
instead of video elements,

22
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.865
because the same thing also
works with audio elements.

23
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.870
Something else that is
occasionally quite useful,

24
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.060
is to be able to get a binding
to an element's dimensions.

25
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.918
Every block-level element, which is to
say things like divs, and paragraphs,

26
00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:47.658
and anything else that has
the display code and block style, and

27
00:01:47.658 --> 00:01:52.648
can have a client with clientHeight offset
with offsetHeight bindings collectively

28
00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:55.030
turned by mentioned bindings.

29
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.400
Now, these are read-only.

30
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.680
You can't set the value, and
change the width and height of an element.

31
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.580
But if the element's width and
height changes naturally as

32
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.828
a result of the CSS change or
the user interacting with it somehow,

33
00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:09.159
then the value will go
back up to the component.

34
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.109
So here are our values
inside our script block.

35
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.929
Here's our marker, and

36
00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:25.278
what we want is to add some
bindings to the div down

37
00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:30.893
here that will get printed
inside this paragraph.

38
00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:37.319
So we're gonna add bind:clientWidth= (w),
and bind:clientHeight = (h).

39
00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.147
And now if you edit this text,
[SOUND] You'll see

40
00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:47.339
that the size here is
changing automatically, and

41
00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:52.425
if we change the font size
the same thing happens.

42
00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:03.920
The way that this works is, it actually
adds an iframe inside the element.

43
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.540
And then, it binds to that
iframes window EventListener,

44
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.840
which is a pretty clever technique,

45
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.530
although you don't wanna have a huge
number of iframes on your page to do this.

46
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.090
So this is a binding that
you should use sparingly.
