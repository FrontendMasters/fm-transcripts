>> Speaker 1: So just kinda going forward, I wanted to leave you all with a few links to some things that I find particularly useful, so I've got links here, I put the slides link in chat, but we'll publish it as well. This is the link to the official WCAG spec, similarly, this WebAIM website, one of my favorite resources on the Internet, Microsoft, has this great inclusive design website.

[00:00:19]
There's a really cool event called Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is like all these talks from people around the world on all sorts of great stuff. And then there's this great front end master's class that we had talked about earlier, so Marcy Sutton does this web app accessibility featuring React.

[00:00:34]
I think she goes a lot more into the JavaScript side of accessibility, so making dynamic React applications accessible, all right, cool, yeah, thanks so much, everybody. I'm available online for any more chats or in person, and yeah, thanks for attending, appreciate it.
