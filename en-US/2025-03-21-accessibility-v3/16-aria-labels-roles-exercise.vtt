00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.065
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: For this next
exercise we go back to our site and

2
00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:06.088
we've got exercise for
ARIA labels and roles.

3
00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:09.408
And I have made a very silly and
contrived and

4
00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:13.336
loosely UK football
related maybe application.

5
00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:17.875
The basic idea here, you don't need to
get too much into the source code for

6
00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.760
it, but
it's got all these different games and

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.800
on a timer they update with
some random things come in.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.115
It shows you when the last update came
through, if you run out of updates

9
00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:31.264
because they're hard coded,
feel free to just refresh the page and

10
00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.664
it'll start back over
again at the beginning.

11
00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:38.600
But yeah, so basically you've got this
app here visually it works pretty well.

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.792
As events come in, the scores update and
the event gets written here.

13
00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:46.909
And what we want to do for the exercise
is start with the screen reader on,

14
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.128
give it a refresh,
a score updates every 15 seconds.

15
00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:51.389
Give it 15 seconds and

16
00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.880
notice that you don't get any kind of
auditory notification that it's updated.

17
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.218
And from there we'll go into the HTML and
play with live regions on

18
00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:02.496
different elements and
with different politeness settings and

19
00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:06.210
see if you can come up with what feels
the best kind of workflow for you.

20
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.074
What you wrap, what you don't wrap,
what you give polite to,

21
00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:12.962
what you give assertive to when you turn
things off, all sorts of things like that.

22
00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:19.450
So the pages here under ARIA, the code
again is like 100% contained in this HTML.

23
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.359
You can largely ignore all of this
JavaScript, I mean, feel free to read

24
00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.356
through it, but the JavaScript isn't
necessarily the important part.

25
00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:28.459
The important part is playing
around with this HTML here and

26
00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.680
kind of figuring out how it affects the
experience when you wrap different things

27
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.800
in different ARIA live regions, which
ones kind of make the best experience.

28
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.748
All right, cool, so

29
00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:46.236
yeah, let's go through this one, how did
people find it kind of working on it.

30
00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:48.877
Was it interesting listening to
the kind of readouts come through and

31
00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:50.148
different things like that?

32
00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:54.640
Does anybody want to go and answer what
you wrapped in ARIA live regions and

33
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.094
which politeness setting you gave it?

34
00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:59.046
Otherwise I can just go but
if anybody has.

35
00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I did M on the header.

36
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.350
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay.

37
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.516
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because I
noticed they were changing and

38
00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:08.118
then the one that was changing,
I did assertive there, right.

39
00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:09.600
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Was it this up here.

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.694
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The one there?

41
00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.390
Yep.

42
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.022
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool, and
you did assertive for it, okay, awesome.

43
00:02:15.022 --> 00:02:16.966
Any other areas that we added, anything?

44
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:20.489
It's kind of, I mean, I don't know
there's a necessarily right and

45
00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.592
wrong way of doing it, but yeah,
I think I had gone through and

46
00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:27.060
I had added like a polite update on here,
which I'm not sure about.

47
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.741
I mean, maybe it doesn't matter
when the last update came through,

48
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:35.052
I wrapped the spans that have the score
in them in polites too, with the labels.

49
00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:38.115
And then I wrapped these little
announcement things in assertive as well,

50
00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:40.202
so like when a goal or
something like that comes in,

51
00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:42.524
that's like the most important
thing to read out loud.

52
00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:46.423
And then between wrapping these
with like a live and a label,

53
00:02:46.423 --> 00:02:51.720
it could just say like the team's new
score is 2 or something like that.

54
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.672
Cool, yeah, I wonder if, like,
are there any other areas?

55
00:02:55.672 --> 00:02:57.480
I guess this is, yeah,
I think this is pretty good.

56
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.874
Pretty good stuff here, again,
I don't know that there's necessarily like

57
00:03:01.874 --> 00:03:06.419
a linting way you could do this and prove
that you have the best things activated.

58
00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.171
But I do think it's nice whenever you have
DOM that is being dynamically updated

59
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:10.675
to stop and

60
00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:14.524
consider is this something that would be
worth kind of announcing to the users?

61
00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:15.084
Yeah.

62
00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:18.237
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So at one point I put
assertive on both the last update and

63
00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:22.798
also like the head, like the scores below
and it seemed like the last update would

64
00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:27.348
always like talk over or nothing else
would update except the last update.

65
00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:28.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Wait,
can you say that again?

66
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.388
Sorry, so you put assertive over the,
was it this thing here?

67
00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:35.189
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And
then I also put it on the match container,

68
00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.984
the div with the match container class.

69
00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:41.010
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Interesting, so I think
maybe what you can have with assertive is

70
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.636
you can have collisions, right.

71
00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:46.854
Where they both try to go, I guess that is
something to be very mindful of is that if

72
00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:50.564
you do have two things that try to go and
collide, they don't queue.

73
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.554
You'll just get the one
that goes in there, yeah,

74
00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:54.000
I think that's a really good point.

75
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.300
I guess, thinking more on that, I think
that I would wrap everything in polite

76
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.344
except for I guess probably just these
spans here with the actual announcement

77
00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:05.092
update or something like that.

78
00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:09.057
I think it's a good call because you can
queue polite things because they will sort

79
00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:11.010
of add themselves to the idle queue.

80
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.344
So you can have like 100 polite ARIA
live regions, but maybe you should limit

81
00:04:14.344 --> 00:04:17.730
yourself on the assertive ARIA regions
because if they collide with each other,

82
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.590
they won't queue up and read,
yeah, that's a really good point.

83
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.390
Cool, yeah, and I think this one's a bit
fun kind of makes me always want to go

84
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.950
through a lot of the apps that
I work on in my day to day and

85
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.170
consider areas where we could add
just a cool little announcement.
