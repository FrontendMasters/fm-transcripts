00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.682
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: With that,
we'll move into the next section,

2
00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:07.524
which is assistive technologies, or what I
call the amazing ways people use the web.

3
00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:10.400
So one of the great things about
doing accessibility work is,

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.235
how many real users I've gotten
to work with over the years.

5
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:17.134
This started when I was at Twitter, and I
did a lot of web accessibility at Twitter.

6
00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:19.895
And we would get all of these,
really excited users that

7
00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:23.853
would live in San Francisco, and they
would come in and we would get them lunch.

8
00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:27.028
And in exchange, we'd do like
a design kind of, what is it called,

9
00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.441
like a UX study with them
trying to use the website.

10
00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.222
And we found just these incredible
gaps that even us as like,

11
00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:35.396
accessibility experts hadn't really
thought of all the use cases.

12
00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.362
So, I got to know all
these great people and

13
00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.763
got to see all these amazing bits of
assistive technology that they used.

14
00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:44.551
And I found like, it really opened my
mind to all the different ways people

15
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.518
browse the web and the implications.

16
00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:50.132
Like strong one that we'll cover is,
maybe I'll wait for it.

17
00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:54.600
But things that can be very, very easy,
very fast with a mouse in a single click,

18
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.441
you could think could be really,

19
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:59.728
really time consuming if you had
to tab all the way through or

20
00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:03.781
similarly if you're using some kind
of single switch or single button.

21
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:08.005
Just being conscious of how many actions
it might take for a user to get to the add

22
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.344
to cart button, or the signup flow,
or something like that.

23
00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:15.000
So here's this cool picture I found of
all these different bits of assistive

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.694
technology.

25
00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:19.091
We're gonna dive into a few of them,
mostly over on the left side,

26
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:20.554
that are very web specific.

27
00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:24.253
One of the most common ways that people
browse the web with assistive technology,

28
00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:25.117
is keyboard only.

29
00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:29.341
This can be for a variety of reasons,
ranging from inability to physically use

30
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.675
a mouse all the way over to preference,
there's quite a few.

31
00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.604
I don't know if we have any like,
VIM fans in the audience that are like,

32
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:38.968
adding their keyboard shortcuts to their
browser, and their operating system and

33
00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:39.849
everything they do.

34
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.237
But keyboard only is a very popular
way that people browse the web.

35
00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:48.101
And again, the most obvious takeaway
here would be an inability to navigate

36
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:51.065
with the mouse means
that you're often tab and

37
00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:56.309
shift tabbing through an entire website
trying to get to that thing that you want.

38
00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.904
In a similar vein, people who are unable
to use a keyboard often use some kind of

39
00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:01.061
assistive technology.

40
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:03.750
There's head wands,
mouth sticks, and more and

41
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.297
more recently which I think we'll cover
soon is like eye directed keyboards, where

42
00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:12.478
instead of using your hands to direct
the keyboard, you can use your vision.

43
00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:16.480
One of the more limiting ones that really
opened my mind is these single switches,

44
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.870
they're literally just
a binary on off button.

45
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.331
And they come with digital keyboards,
and so

46
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:25.734
what you kind of do is you hit the single
switch and it'll start a digital keyboard

47
00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.994
going top down until you find
the row that has your key on it.

48
00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:33.020
So you can imagine going down your escape,
tab, caps, lock, shift, whatever, and

49
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.438
you hit the switch again and then it
starts going column by column until you

50
00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:38.452
get to the actual key
that you want to type.

51
00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:43.494
Screen readers, again probably one of the
most popular forms of assistive technology

52
00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:47.914
for those unfamiliar screen readers
are software that parse the website and

53
00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:49.031
read it out to you.

54
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.676
And they come with a bunch of back and
forth interaction tools.

55
00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:55.153
So you've got all these shortcut
keys where you can do things like,

56
00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:58.203
well show me all the headers for
this website, or show me all

57
00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:02.535
the interactive elements, or read to me
just the first section, things like that.

58
00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.755
So you end up getting this
kind of like powerful back and

59
00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:09.194
forth where the input is keyboard and
the output is audio.

60
00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:11.168
And we'll do quite a bit
with screen reader today.

61
00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:15.149
We'll get them installed locally for
free, and kinda have a play with them and

62
00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:16.125
experience them.

63
00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:19.800
And then like I mentioned before, more and
more popular lately are these eye tracker

64
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.245
keyboards, these are really
incredible technology.

65
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:27.131
But the effect on the website is largely
the same which imagining somebody is

66
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.591
a keyboard only user.

67
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:31.493
Okay, so this is like one of my favorite
takeaways of all this stuff, and

68
00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:33.646
one of the reasons that I
love accessibility so much.

69
00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.430
So there's this concept
called the curb cut effect.

70
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.576
And I think it's really well illustrated
in this picture where there is this

71
00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:44.655
assistive ramp that is clearly, or
you can assume put there for some kind of

72
00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:49.479
accessibility standard to allow wheelchair
users to get up onto the sidewalk, right.

73
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.280
But the reality is that we find more and
more when we study that whenever we

74
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.003
invest in a certain group of people,
it often has this largely positive

75
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:03.670
cascading effect into the broader
well being of the country, right?

76
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.161
And so that we put these
things down specifically for

77
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.491
people in wheelchairs to
get up on the sidewalk.

78
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:12.911
And then we find all of these amazing use
cases of here's this woman with her child

79
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:15.707
in a stroller pushing her
child up onto this thing.

80
00:04:15.707 --> 00:04:19.735
And I find this so true with web
accessibility where we get the HTML to be

81
00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.263
semantic and
we add all of these features and

82
00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:26.449
then we start noticing that the power
users love these features as well.

83
00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.814
Or that we have slightly
faster loading website,

84
00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:32.266
because we've reduced JavaScript and
replaced it with semantic HTML.

85
00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:36.467
Or we have better UX design and
we actually see our conversions going up.

86
00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:38.022
And I really like this curb cut effect.

87
00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:40.237
It's something I always
try to keep in mind that,

88
00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:42.930
you're not only helping make
the website more accessible,

89
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.600
but you're also probably
improving the website at large.
