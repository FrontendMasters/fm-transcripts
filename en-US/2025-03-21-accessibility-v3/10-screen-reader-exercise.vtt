00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.509
With that, if nobody else has anything,
we'll go into exercise one,

2
00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:04.856
which is screen readers.

3
00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:09.840
So I will open up and
leave this repo on Learn ally here.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.216
And if you go ahead and pull that down,
there's instructions to run it.

5
00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:16.000
And when you run it,
you will get to this page here.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.512
And from here we can go into exercise one,
Screen Reader Accessibility.

7
00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:23.061
So there's instructions on here,
essentially there's this little mini

8
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:26.136
website that visually looks quite nice,
if I say so myself.

9
00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:30.175
And yet at the other hand,
if you turn on your screen reader and

10
00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:33.368
try navigating is very
difficult to work with.

11
00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:37.912
And so kind of the idea here would
be to turn on your screen reader and

12
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:41.992
try to move around the website and
see how difficult it is.

13
00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:45.893
You can see it's just like I can't
even get to these buttons here and

14
00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:48.288
all these inputs are edittext blank.

15
00:00:48.288 --> 00:00:50.920
And it is very unclear
how to submit the form.

16
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.035
And so kind of go through on the other
side of the source code itself,

17
00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:54.909
which is all HTML,

18
00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.270
and try to figure out some things that
you could do to make this better.

19
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.571
Again, this isn't like a binary fixed or

20
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:05.310
broken as much as it is like how much can
we gradually improve this experience?

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.259
So, yeah, let's take a little
break here and work on that and

22
00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.810
then we'll meet back up after.

23
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.766
Welcome back from the exercise,
how did everybody find working on it?

24
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.210
It was reasonable,
got some good experiences.

25
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.456
I think it's kind of interesting
how difficult it is to navigate.

26
00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:27.888
This thing looks really great.

27
00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:31.040
And then it's very easy with a mouse
to figure out all these things.

28
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200
It's very difficult to navigate.

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.520
Maybe what we could do as opposed to just
going through everything is maybe talk

30
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.903
about things that you all found and fixed
and I could go through them together and

31
00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:45.716
anything that was interesting or
notable that you all found, yeah.

32
00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:48.934
&gt;&gt; The menu, home,
about and contact, yeah.

33
00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:49.970
&gt;&gt; You can't navigate.

34
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You can't
navigate it at all.

35
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:55.930
Right, so if we go over into the menu
here, home, about and contact.

36
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.002
There's quite a few different
reasons that you can't navigate it.

37
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:02.794
One of them is that these
aren't anchors and so

38
00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:07.670
you could kind of,
you could wrap these all in anchor tags.

39
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.050
I don't know,
it could go to nowhere for now.

40
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.620
But then you could have anchor your home,
about and contact.

41
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.268
And at the very least this would
give you something to interact with.

42
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:21.300
You could also help the screen reader out.

43
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.150
Instead of a div class nav, you could
actually use a nav element which would

44
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.572
help the screen reader
out quite a bit there.

45
00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:30.732
And then I think one other thing,
again, this is very granular.

46
00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:32.340
I didn't have necessarily
something in mind.

47
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.660
But another thing that you
could do is you could.

48
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.186
Instead of making these all divs,
you can make these all list items or

49
00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:40.680
something like that.

50
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.530
I've been using a different editor and
now my VS code skills are not up to par.

51
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.321
But yeah, so you could kind of wrap all
of these in some kind of list item or

52
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:54.110
something like that and
they would respond a lot better.

53
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.498
Cool, and so now if we kind of go.

54
00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:00.986
We'd have to change our CSS as well.

55
00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:03.770
But at the very least,
these are all you can kind of tab through.

56
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.892
And similarly,
when we turn our screen reader on,

57
00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:10.362
I'm going to hide this message and
we refresh the page.

58
00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:14.802
We can now tab immediately there and it
says link home three items about contact.

59
00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:16.338
So, yeah, that's a great one.

60
00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:20.138
What else, anybody think of anything
else that was nice to fix, yeah.

61
00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:23.498
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is using unordered
lists like that for navigation bars.

62
00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:27.010
Is that kind of like the standard?

63
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.426
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I think so, I mean, you
could do it in quite a few different ways.

64
00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:33.559
I think that for
the accessibility section,

65
00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:38.260
it's nice to have some type of list so
that I find it nice when it reads

66
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.914
navigation list,
3 items just as an audio clue.

67
00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:43.826
It being ordered or
unordered doesn't matter.

68
00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:46.997
You could hide it with CSS or whatever,
but I think that it provides a little bit

69
00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.810
of a better experience, but
yeah, you could just do it with.

70
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.130
Yeah, exactly, that's a great question.

71
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.380
Cool, yeah, I think I had pointed out
also at some point the span of title.

72
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.649
So I think that if we have
the screen reader turned on and

73
00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.201
we refresh the page and
then we go to our little rotor here and

74
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:09.140
we go to headings that
we don't get the actual.

75
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.364
What is it?
The My Website as a heading.

76
00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:16.452
And so we could kind of turn this off,
go back into here, change

77
00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:22.972
the span into an H1, probably change
this div into a header, refresh again.

78
00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.820
Again, we'll have to go through and
update the CSS, but that's not a big deal.

79
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.926
Just instead of div class class,
it would be header class.

80
00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:29.599
But yeah, so

81
00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.894
now if we open the rotor, we'll have my
website as a selection, which is nice.

82
00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:35.422
And we could do similar things.

83
00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:38.054
We could go through and
we could add labels to all the forms.

84
00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:42.350
I think the submit button
at the end is like a div.

85
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.198
So we can again make that a button,
different things like that.

86
00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:47.190
But yeah, I guess,
how is everybody feeling?

87
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.031
Was it kind of interesting to try
using it with a screen reader and

88
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:53.502
see how difficult it was and then kind of
a lot of gain for a little bit of work?

89
00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:56.591
I think the risk reward is like
the work reward is very high for

90
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:59.770
just switching a few tags and
a little bit of styling, yeah.

91
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.577
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Another thing
I noticed on the ROTOR menu,

92
00:05:03.577 --> 00:05:07.710
the numbers are like
the type of heading nest.

93
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.098
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Sorry,
can you say that again?

94
00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:13.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Notice like
the number before the heading.

95
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.554
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah,
it's a heading type, yeah.

96
00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:16.778
H1, H2, things like that,
yeah, it's really nice.

97
00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:20.249
So you can do so on the rotor, I don't
wanna make this like too much voiceover

98
00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.976
specific, but all the screen readers do
have really similar things they can do.

99
00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:27.069
But, yeah, so for the headings you
could see which ones are the H1s,

100
00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.952
which are the ones preceded with the 1.

101
00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:31.035
You can also use your left and
right arrows so

102
00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:33.808
you could see what form controls
are there on this page.

103
00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:36.624
These, as you can see, are blank and
an unchecked checkbox.

104
00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:40.992
But as we were to add the labels, we would
see those come up landmarks on the page.

105
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:42.412
So you've got your main and

106
00:05:42.412 --> 00:05:45.312
your nav and all sorts of
other stuff links on the page.

107
00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:47.392
You can kind of see these show
up now that they're anchors.

108
00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:48.800
They didn't show up before.

109
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.150
Yeah, lots of control, again,
one hope I have for the course is to.

110
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.360
Because on my journey with accessibility,
I went from thinking about making

111
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.701
the minimum useful case into realizing
how amazing these screen readers are and

112
00:06:02.701 --> 00:06:05.742
how with a little bit of markup or
a little bit of labels,

113
00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:09.038
you can actually make it
preferable to use a screen reader.

114
00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:12.198
Moving around, let me check out all
the forms, let me hop to the third form.

115
00:06:12.198 --> 00:06:14.598
It's really cool,
you can go really fast with it.

116
00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:15.950
I'm a big fan of this stuff.
