1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.608
Yeah, there's all these
great color pickers.

2
00:00:01.608 --> 00:00:06.015
You can see like an example here,
where we have a blue on white, and

3
00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.736
the contrast ratio is extremely high.

4
00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:13.512
Meaning that if we look into
the specifics, this passes both AA and

5
00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.064
AAA on every axis.

6
00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:19.352
And then we can see other ones that are a
lot closer, like this sort of fuzzy red,

7
00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.808
I'm not sure what to
call it against white.

8
00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:26.995
And we can see here that it passes on
some criteria, like it is AA compliant

9
00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:31.638
as normal text, but it fails to
be AAA compliant on normal text.

10
00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:34.529
Again, there's more to think about,
and I think about this a lot,

11
00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:37.166
like when I'm making slideshow
presentations is that.

12
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.373
Certain colors might not be great for
my body text, but they might be okay for

13
00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:46.042
the headers, because if the font size is
sufficiently large or sufficiently bold,

14
00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:48.670
then it'll likely be compliant as it is.

15
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.893
And one other thing that
I wanted to talk about,

16
00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:54.060
this sort of dovetails into my
other course, my DevTools course.

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.348
But there's some really
nice tools out there.

18
00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.637
So if we go ahead and
we open up the dev tools and

19
00:00:58.637 --> 00:01:02.484
there's lots of different tools we'll
cover that do this kind of stuff.

20
00:01:02.484 --> 00:01:05.691
But if we go ahead and we find any
element that's got some text in it,

21
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.332
so here we've got like this
span with some text in it.

22
00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:11.212
And we click on the color
of the element itself,

23
00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:13.876
we will see down here this contrast ratio.

24
00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:19.000
And so, we can see the kind of contrast
ratio that would be acceptable for

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.548
this amount of text.

26
00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:22.972
And we can see that we
are AA compliant here.

27
00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:25.292
A cool thing that you can
kind of mess with is if,

28
00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:27.440
let's say the background color was black.

29
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.843
And we go back into here, and
we look at the contrast ratio,

30
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:34.172
we can see that it has gone up to 60%.

31
00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:36.076
And we can also see on the color picker,

32
00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:38.876
this will be our kind of next
exercise that we work on.

33
00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:42.120
These tools will give you a range
on the color spectrum and

34
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.508
anything up here in that range
is going to be AAA compliant.

35
00:01:45.508 --> 00:01:49.033
Basically like this white line
that they've drawn across, and

36
00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:52.968
as we get lower and you can kind of
see the 68 in the background there.

37
00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:54.792
As we get into the non-compliant terms,

38
00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.688
we can actually see that it's
quite a lot more difficult to see.

39
00:01:57.688 --> 00:02:01.164
So, there's a lot of great tools out
there, while you're prototyping,

40
00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:03.203
you can do this in Figma or
Chrome dev tools or

41
00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:05.680
whatever it is you use to
kind of do your designing.

42
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.594
You can get a really nice visual indicator
of the text you have, and again,

43
00:02:09.594 --> 00:02:10.904
this takes the size in.

44
00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:16.792
So if we were to do something like change
the font size to 100 pixels and then

45
00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:22.908
go back to it, we can see that the white
line that goes across is now much larger.

46
00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:27.556
We have a much larger scheme of
kind of colors to play with here.

47
00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:28.700
Does this make sense?

48
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.490
Feeling good to people?

49
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.988
Okay, cool, yeah,
some great tooling, yeah.

50
00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:33.884
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I also noticed
that the contrast setting,

51
00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:35.900
it was under experimental.

52
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.922
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I think like,

53
00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.476
not reliable or something.

54
00:02:38.476 --> 00:02:43.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It is, the only thing
that's experimental is that, they've been

55
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.102
moving from this WCAG AA AAA into this
advanced perceptual contrast algorithm.

56
00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:52.870
So they're experimenting with
switching up the algorithm.

57
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.527
Let me try it here, I was having some
trouble with the default one earlier this

58
00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:58.830
week, which is the only
reason I didn't show.

59
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.142
Okay, it is working.

60
00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:03.144
So this is the one, this is the normal
one that is in production and

61
00:03:03.144 --> 00:03:06.070
it is the one that we are kind of
used to seeing in this course.

62
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.208
Is it AA compliant?

63
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:08.376
Is it AAA compliant?

64
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:10.606
I was having difficulty with
it working on Tuesday, but

65
00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:12.560
it looks like it's doing really well.

66
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.837
And here is nice because it shows two
lines, one to be AA compliant and

67
00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:17.096
one to be AAA compliant.

68
00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:19.720
So anything that's up here
will be AAA compliant.

69
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.313
In this little in between area
will be AA compliant, and

70
00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:24.376
then out here will fall out of compliance.

71
00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.280
So, yeah, sorry about the experiment,
but yeah, this is the default one.

72
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.816
Both will accomplish the same thing.

73
00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:31.320
If they're in the good range,
then they will be good contrast.

74
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.018
Yeah, I'll do another quick exercise here.

75
00:03:33.018 --> 00:03:36.454
This one is all about color contrast and
I just wanted to give everybody a couple

76
00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:39.370
of minutes so
they can play with it themselves.

77
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.178
So let's see,
we've got exercise five color contrast.

78
00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:45.935
We've got a little contrast picker for
you all to play with,

79
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.834
where you can kind of see,
is it AA compliant?

80
00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:49.858
Is it AA compliant?

81
00:03:49.858 --> 00:03:51.218
What's the contrast ratio?

82
00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:54.004
And if we take a couple of
minutes to do and play with this,

83
00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.604
I'd also love to just give you an
opportunity to Maybe open the DevTools or

84
00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.346
whatever designing tool you use.

85
00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:02.625
And play with the accessibility features
on there and just kind of see your current

86
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.540
websites and things like that,
how they are doing color contrast wise.
