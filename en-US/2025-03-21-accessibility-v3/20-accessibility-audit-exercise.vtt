WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.349
Cool, yeah, so let's head into the final
exercise here, back to our same workshop

2
00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.265
page as normal and we have this
beautiful random image huge thing.

3
00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:14.488
So the kind of thing that I was hoping we
would do here is just spend a few minutes.

4
00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:18.003
Probably the easiest thing to
do out of the box would just be

5
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.664
if you're in whatever major
browser to open your DevTools,

6
00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:24.407
all the Chromium ones
will have Lighthouse.

7
00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:26.884
If you're not using a Chromium browser,

8
00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:29.770
then we can talk about
some of the other things.

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.630
But if you're using a Chromium browser,
to use Lighthouse to

10
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.706
pick accessibility only and
then to analyze the page load here.

11
00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:38.176
If you are not using a Chromium browser,

12
00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:42.900
then I would recommend getting the free
Dequeue Axe plugin which will work for

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.914
any browser and then that'll add a new tab
here Axe and then run that audit there.

14
00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:51.570
So if Chromium just use the built in
Lighthouse, I would say if not Chromium,

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.819
grab the free Axe plugin.

16
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.976
We'll get that installed, we'll run it and

17
00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:58.392
then feel free to solve as many of
the things as you would like to solve.

18
00:00:58.392 --> 00:00:59.813
When we come back after the break,

19
00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:03.360
we'll kinda talk about why the violations
occurred and solve them together.

20
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.166
But yeah, I think the idea here is
basically just doing your first

21
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.836
accessibility audit,
seeing what kind of stuff comes back.

22
00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.674
What kind of stuff affects the score
according to Lighthouse and why, and

23
00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.665
then we'll work through
all that stuff together.

24
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.762
So go to the page and
I'll do an analyze page load.

25
00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:27.818
It's gonna go and do a full refresh and
it's gonna run a bunch of rules against

26
00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:30.738
all the markup and
test some things and all that stuff.

27
00:01:30.738 --> 00:01:32.997
And it gives us this
beautiful score of 38,

28
00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:37.930
which was as low as I could get it without
really, really mangling the website.

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.516
So cool, for
those that haven't used Lighthouse yet

30
00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:42.954
another pitch to check
out my DevTools course.

31
00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:45.034
But yeah, it's really great,

32
00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:49.349
it provides you with a score out of 100,
a list of things to fix,

33
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.838
a list of things that you did well,
a list of items to manually check.

34
00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:58.162
Things that it's having a hard
time proving one way or another.

35
00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:02.852
And you'll also notice that under each
item, when you select it and expand it,

36
00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:05.898
it will link to some really
well written articles.

37
00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:10.338
And those articles may be on Deque site,
they may be on Google's site,

38
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.594
they may be on Chrome's site,
wherever they feel,

39
00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:17.588
the best kind of explanation of
why these rules exist is there.

40
00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:20.458
So I find this a really great
starting place because it'll not

41
00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:23.176
only help you identify what
might be wrong with your site.

42
00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.652
But if you're confused by it, which I
often am, it gives you a great link to

43
00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:29.668
kinda go read more and
hopefully better understand what it is.

44
00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.988
So we'll just go through and
fix a couple of these, in this other tab,

45
00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:38.850
I've got the code open and I will close
all the tabs except for the audit tab.

46
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.538
And we'll just kinda start going through.

47
00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:45.456
So it says one thing is Aria hidden is
present on the document body, which means

48
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:50.346
that screen readers will be inconsistent,
they might not work very well.

49
00:02:50.346 --> 00:02:54.666
So we can find this kind of Aria hidden
and we can remove that, Aria hidden equals

50
00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:59.210
true, that was a bit of a cheeky one,
just there to kind of test things out.

51
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.546
It looks like we also have Aria hidden,
maybe we don't have it somewhere else.

52
00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:05.980
Cool, so moving down further,

53
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.248
we've got this user scalable
no used in the viewport.

54
00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:13.508
So I think up at the top we
should have this meta viewport.

55
00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:17.687
And it's saying that user scalable no
disable zooming and disabling zooming

56
00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:22.136
is very problematic for users with low
vision who rely on screen magnification.

57
00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:25.200
So kind of like we talked about at
the very beginning of this workshop, so

58
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.890
we can go ahead for now and
just remove this, allow users to zoom.

59
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.225
I think one thing I'm always careful of,

60
00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:34.963
I think getting really good at
accessibility will be excellent for

61
00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:39.618
your career, but it also brings you into
a bit of conflict with design sometimes.

62
00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:44.452
I do think one important thing about
becoming an accessibility expert is

63
00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:46.838
learning how to lead with empathy.

64
00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:51.826
And explain that while the visual design
dream of the website may be one way

65
00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:55.274
why it's really important
to not disable this.

66
00:03:55.274 --> 00:03:58.724
A lot of times you'll be asked to
hijack scroll to provide a cool,

67
00:03:58.724 --> 00:04:02.692
smooth scroll or disable zooming
because everything's pixel perfect.

68
00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:07.007
Or get those focus rings off the buttons
because they don't match the design

69
00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:11.252
system or rewrite checkboxes cuz we
want them to be a star instead of a box.

70
00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:12.796
Or all these different things come up.

71
00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:16.531
And I think an important part of being an
accessibility specialist is leading those

72
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:20.282
conversations with empathy and being like,
yeah, your design looks fantastic.

73
00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:22.945
But here's what we can do while
staying kind of compliant,

74
00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.452
while staying an excellent experience for
people.

75
00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:28.145
It's just a constant theme
that keeps coming up is like,

76
00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:30.669
I can totally see people
wanting to disable zoom, but

77
00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.120
it does have these bad
unintended consequences.

78
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.692
So we'll go ahead and remove that,
keep going, background and

79
00:04:36.692 --> 00:04:40.160
foreground colors do not have
appropriate color contrast.

80
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.658
So these are really nice where it not
only just tells you there's an issue, but

81
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.280
it actually tells you which
elements are failing here.

82
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.878
So we can see the HERO and
the menu button, so

83
00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:54.766
if we go to menu button,
this blue on white is not working.

84
00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:59.918
So we can just contrive to
make it blue on black for now.

85
00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:04.622
There's also a DIV description,
so this is also maybe too light,

86
00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:10.278
I'm sort of just kind of guessing at
some of these things, we've got a card.

87
00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:12.270
Where is the card?

88
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.054
Div class card, and again, maybe,
so let's fix a few of these things.

89
00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:20.382
We'll reload the site,
things are a little bit sharper looking.

90
00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:23.774
And then we can kind of take an audit
of how we're doing so far and

91
00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:28.382
see how much we've improved, so it was
that camera 36 or 38 out of 100 before,

92
00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:30.830
fix a couple of things on here.

93
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.218
And cool, we've jumped up to like 59 and
we can keep going with this,

94
00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:36.022
images don't have alt attributes.

95
00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:40.990
So it finds a bunch of images,
so we can kind of see those,

96
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.600
they are pictures of something.

97
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.256
These don't look necessary at all for
the document, so

98
00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:49.300
what do we do when they're not necessary?

99
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Empty strings?

100
00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:56.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, That's not
my normal style of teaching, but

101
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.040
it felt right, I'm glad we went for it.

102
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.272
Cool anyway, yeah, I mean, you can kind
of see here let me know if there were any

103
00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:04.680
that are specific to go through.

104
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.666
But kind of as we go through these and
keep running these audits,

105
00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:09.480
they should get higher and higher.

106
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.328
The other kind of important thing
to mention is that with all of your

107
00:06:13.328 --> 00:06:14.565
lighthouse audits or

108
00:06:14.565 --> 00:06:18.632
whatever tool you're using,
why didn't these get alt attributes?

109
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.436
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There's one more image.

110
00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:31.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Did I miss one?

111
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

112
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.432
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Aha, this is the one up
here, it's just also kind of just a HERO

113
00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:43.536
image, it doesn't actually provide
any value to the website anyway.

114
00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:46.970
The other thing that I wanted to mention
with all of these performance audits

115
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.405
is not only do the things that are kind
of like in red and alerting you, cool,

116
00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:52.136
we're kind of heading on up there.

117
00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:55.713
But also make sure that you always check
out this additional items to manual check,

118
00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:58.488
this is like one of my favorite
things about Lighthouse, yeah.

119
00:06:58.488 --> 00:07:00.376
&gt;&gt; I noticed you have your alt empty,
right?

120
00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:00.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

121
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You don't
want it to be accessible.

122
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.636
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Then do we have to put tab

123
00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:07.320
index is equals to minus 1.

124
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.945
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So the images
are not tabable by themselves, so

125
00:07:09.945 --> 00:07:11.424
they won't be tabable.

126
00:07:11.424 --> 00:07:15.749
But there was a question in the chat
earlier which was kind of an advanced

127
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:19.947
case, which was saying we have a list
of links, and instead of text.

128
00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:24.147
We have images for the link,
like arrow forward, arrow backward, and

129
00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:28.520
then we want the arrow image not to read,
but the link is still tabable.

130
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.602
We can get into complicated cases, right?

131
00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:35.266
So in that case, we could leave the link
tabable, but make the image alt empty.

132
00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:39.362
So sometimes you'll get into a little
bit of a more complex situation.

133
00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:41.735
But in this case, if you have a H1,

134
00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:46.406
then an image tag with some abstract
piece of art and then a paragraph,

135
00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:51.490
the image making that image empty,
all, it will never have been tabable.

136
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.942
So as you're tabbing through,

137
00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:57.190
you'll go from the H1 into whatever form
controls and you'll skip over the image.

138
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.467
Yeah, great question, and then, yeah,

139
00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:03.726
the other thing is it will tell you things
that it could not necessarily prove.

140
00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:07.902
So are the interactive controls,
are they all keyboard focusable?

141
00:08:07.902 --> 00:08:10.598
Do they clearly indicate their purpose and
state?

142
00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:13.270
Look at the tab order, is it logical?

143
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.827
Things like this, so I really love these
tools because they give you stuff to

144
00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:19.848
fix and they also give you a list
of things that they don't know.

145
00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:23.397
And you can kinda take it from here and
start adding your automatic tests and

146
00:08:23.397 --> 00:08:24.310
things like that.
