00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.715
So just kinda going forward, I wanted
to leave you all with a few links to

2
00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:07.110
some things that I find particularly
useful, so I've got links here,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.112
I put the slides link in chat,
but we'll publish it as well.

4
00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:14.336
This is the link to the official WCAG
spec, similarly, this WebAIM website,

5
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:17.536
one of my favorite resources
on the Internet, Microsoft,

6
00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:19.984
has this great inclusive design website.

7
00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:23.920
There's a really cool event called Global
Accessibility Awareness Day, which is like

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.590
all these talks from people around
the world on all sorts of great stuff.

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.973
And then there's this great front end
master's class that we had talked about

10
00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:34.414
earlier, so Marcy Sutton does this web
app accessibility featuring React.

11
00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:37.621
I think she goes a lot more into
the JavaScript side of accessibility, so

12
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.987
making dynamic React applications
accessible, all right, cool, yeah,

13
00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:42.414
thanks so much, everybody.

14
00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:46.969
I'm available online for any more chats or
in person, and yeah, thanks for attending,

15
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.830
appreciate it.
