00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:01.669
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool, so screen readers,

2
00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.158
they're one of the most pivotal
pieces of assistive technology,

3
00:00:05.158 --> 00:00:08.760
one of the most well-associated
concepts with accessibility.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.423
And in our previous exercise,
we all got them installed and

5
00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:14.202
running on our computers,
which I think is an amazing start.

6
00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.438
I honestly find even just using them for

7
00:00:16.438 --> 00:00:20.720
a little bit really helped build
up my kind of understanding.

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.786
I remember specifically doing
an accessibility talk years ago in

9
00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:24.573
San Francisco.

10
00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:28.295
And there was somebody went before me and
he was giving his presentation,

11
00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:31.009
he was doing all these slides,
all this live coding.

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.206
And then at a certain point,
he accidentally knocked his headphone,

13
00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:37.035
this is gonna date me a little bit,
out of the headphone jack.

14
00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.336
This is pre-Bluetooth headphones,
anyway, and

15
00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:42.602
throughout the whole auditorium you
heard his screen reader reading.

16
00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.296
Nobody knew that he was blind and

17
00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:48.618
he was doing the entire thing based off of
screen reader back out to the keyboard.

18
00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:51.656
And so
the kind of two amazing things were, one,

19
00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:55.672
he was able to do this incredibly
robust live programming demo.

20
00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.367
And two, the thing I think that surprises
everybody is how fast the screen reader

21
00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.463
reading gets for people who use it
every day, as we're starting and

22
00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:04.224
it's however many words per minute.

23
00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:07.504
And then you hang out with somebody
who uses it all day, every day, and

24
00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:11.120
it is inconceivably fast sometimes,
how fast the content is being read in.

25
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.672
How do screen readers work?

26
00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.800
They convert your digital
text into synthesized speech.

27
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.178
So they basically allow
users to hear content and

28
00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.912
then navigate with the keyboard.

29
00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:23.296
So the user's input remains
the keyboard and the kind of

30
00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:28.416
output remains this speech through their
headphones or through their speakers.

31
00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:32.309
So this technology helps people
who are blind or have low vision.

32
00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:37.116
And ideally, when the website is designed
correctly, it gives them the same level of

33
00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:41.720
independence and privacy as anyone else
using the website in any other way.

34
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.895
One thing that I just wanted to kind of
hit home again when we start looking into

35
00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:50.202
semantic HTML is the screen readers don't
just top to bottom read the website,

36
00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.667
they also offer a lot
of navigation tooling.

37
00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:56.716
So you can kind of jump to next section,
view all the headers, view all the links,

38
00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.018
find the next input field,
things like that.

39
00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:02.037
So thinking about your website
in this kind of structure can be

40
00:02:02.037 --> 00:02:05.522
really important because screen reader
users are often going to be sort

41
00:02:05.522 --> 00:02:08.484
of power users who are really
jumping around your website and

42
00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:12.008
not necessarily just sitting there
taking it all in one item at a time.

43
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.120
Screen readers display read all
of the content aloud to the user.

44
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.791
They also have the opportunity
to display a list of links,

45
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.401
display a list of headings, or navigate
back and forth between these things.

46
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.661
Popular screen readers,
just in case you have heard of some and

47
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.102
maybe not others, JAWS is by far the most
popular, it's premium Windows software.

48
00:02:29.102 --> 00:02:31.432
Coming up closely behind it is NVDA,

49
00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:35.053
which hopefully the Windows
users got installed today.

50
00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:36.851
And then below that is VoiceOver,

51
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.762
which is the one that comes default
installed on Mac operating systems.

52
00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:45.376
A lot of these too, just to make
a side note, have equivalencies in,

53
00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:48.016
let's say, the mobile world as well.

54
00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:52.613
So VoiceOver exists on iOS, and
then Android has its own screen

55
00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:57.288
reader built-in, so
these experience is largely the same.

56
00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:00.756
Mobile provides some really cool
additional things where you can have

57
00:03:00.756 --> 00:03:04.280
accessibility features tied to
different types of presses and taps and

58
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.336
things like that.

59
00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:09.158
But for the sake of this course, and
it's going to be quite web specific,

60
00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:13.369
we're just going to be talking about
desktop and laptop screen readers for web.

61
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.623
So some important things as we
think about taking our website and

62
00:03:16.623 --> 00:03:19.592
making sure it will work very
well with a screen reader.

63
00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:21.075
One of the most important, and

64
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:24.968
probably the one that people have heard
of the most often, is alternative text.

65
00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:27.548
So who's heard/worked
with alt text before?

66
00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:28.740
Okay, yeah, great.

67
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.337
So the idea being that when a screen
reader encounters an image,

68
00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:34.760
if we don't add alt text,

69
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.176
it'll do its best to help the user by
reading the file name itself to the user.

70
00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:41.504
And so,this can be okay.

71
00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.649
I mean, I think we can all start
thinking about the screenshots and

72
00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:48.524
images we take and how often we name them
something that we would like users to see,

73
00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:52.428
and it's not 100%, but it can be
particularly tricky for generated images.

74
00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:56.393
So if you have any kind of website that
allows users to upload or automatically

75
00:03:56.393 --> 00:03:59.992
generate images, we know that we
don't just name them what they are,

76
00:03:59.992 --> 00:04:02.810
we often hash the name so
that there's no collisions.

77
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.672
And you end up with these really,
really long, and complicated file names.

78
00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:09.215
So some examples that I
kind of like to put up are,

79
00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:13.436
if you go to various popular websites and
you inspect element with the dev tools,

80
00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:16.306
and you kind of take a look
at what the images are named.

81
00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:19.834
And then start trying to imagine what it
would be like as a screen reader user

82
00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:21.540
running into one of these images.

83
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.009
So Flickr has just this
kind of normal hash name,

84
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.612
172428, is very complicated.

85
00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:33.468
Twitter does the same thing,
they have this file hash.JPEG.

86
00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:36.529
Facebook doesn't even use images,
they're PHP files,

87
00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.853
so as you can imagine,
you're trying to see what the image is.

88
00:04:39.853 --> 00:04:44.268
The image is a cat, or a graph, or
something like that, and it just starts

89
00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:49.598
reading out this 150 character PHP file
extension, so this can be very difficult.

90
00:04:49.598 --> 00:04:51.145
So it's quite easy to fix, and

91
00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:54.904
there's lots of different cool things
we can do within alternative text.

92
00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:58.869
So the traditional case, let's say,
is that it's your image,

93
00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:04.214
you're uploading it, and you're using HTML
with an image tag to image source to it.

94
00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:06.798
You can go ahead and
add this alt attribute here, and

95
00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:08.990
you can put anything
that you want in there.

96
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.934
So screen readers will read that
text instead of the file name.

97
00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:17.814
So instead of image KSJ,
it'll say image, A puppy in the park.

98
00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:21.518
Some quick tips for alt text is,
I see these kind of mistakes a lot,

99
00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:24.625
you don't need to say that it
is an image of or a photo of,

100
00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.826
because the screen reader will
read the image tag first.

101
00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:31.386
And it should just describe what is
actually pertinent in the image.

102
00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:35.607
But really take a second to think about
what's pertinent because I also see a lot

103
00:05:35.607 --> 00:05:40.092
of people who do alt text graph, or chart,
or something like that, and it's okay.

104
00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:41.829
But if this is a technical post and

105
00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:46.302
the important thing you're describing
kubernetes cluster or something like that,

106
00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:50.290
just saying graph or chart is not going
to get people enough information.

107
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.043
So really think about why
you added that image and

108
00:05:53.043 --> 00:05:55.900
what it needs to convey to the user.

109
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.012
We also have lots of cases where
images are just presentational, right?

110
00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:03.606
So you can imagine a blog post and just to
make your post look better, you put some

111
00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:07.732
abstract piece of art or something
like that at the top of each image.

112
00:06:07.732 --> 00:06:11.706
So it's very easy to instruct screen
readers to just skip an image too,

113
00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:15.697
which is just by adding the alt
attribute but putting in a blank string.

114
00:06:15.697 --> 00:06:18.705
So these are really great for
anything that's presentational,

115
00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:22.468
where it's unimportant for users to
actually understand what's in the image.

116
00:06:22.468 --> 00:06:26.480
It's just there to kind of make
the website look nicer, designed better.

117
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.980
It's also largely, this starts getting
a little bit subtle where if you

118
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.890
have user generated images and
you're not sure what they are,

119
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.054
skipping over them is one option.

120
00:06:37.054 --> 00:06:40.262
But it would probably be a better
option to put user generated image or

121
00:06:40.262 --> 00:06:41.714
something like that in there.

122
00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:45.557
But anyway, we have a lot of leeway here,
so we can put anything we want in or

123
00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:49.099
we can put an empty string and
force the screen reader to skip over it.

124
00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.081
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because we are talking about
the image tag, how about the picture tag

125
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:56.734
because you can have an image
embedded within the picture tag?

126
00:06:56.734 --> 00:06:59.753
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yes, so with the picture
tag, that's a great question.

127
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.572
So the picture tag you can't
add an alt attribute, but

128
00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.810
you can add either ARIA labelled by or
aria described by to it.

129
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.515
So when we get into the ARIA section,

130
00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:10.712
there's essentially equivalent
ways that do the exact same thing.

131
00:07:10.712 --> 00:07:12.162
So when the screen reader hits it,

132
00:07:12.162 --> 00:07:14.738
it will tell it what the description
of that picture tag is.

133
00:07:14.738 --> 00:07:17.026
Yeah, really, really similar,
that's a great question.

134
00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:20.794
One note here, this is an area
where we sort of clash with

135
00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:24.570
another subindustry of development,
which is SEO.

136
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.124
So search engines for a long time have
made use of alternative text, and for

137
00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:34.042
many, many years SEO shops have suggested
that you stuff keywords that you wanna

138
00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:35.724
rank for into the alt text.

139
00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:39.353
So I don't know if anybody has done
any of this kind of web marketing or

140
00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:43.609
things like that where they recommend that
you just take your Google keywords and

141
00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:46.854
stuff them into every picture,
this is really difficult.

142
00:07:46.854 --> 00:07:51.256
I think Google has largely turned down
this signal, but it does still exist and

143
00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:54.655
I do still see it all the time
where it'll be an image of a dog,

144
00:07:54.655 --> 00:07:58.991
and the alt text will be, best free
headphones, Samsung deal on headphone,

145
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:00.990
whatever it is, stuff like that.

146
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.898
So do keep in mind that I understand the
temptation to boost your search results,

147
00:08:05.898 --> 00:08:10.227
but it's a very bad accessibility
experience and it is the lowest level

148
00:08:10.227 --> 00:08:14.716
level A compliance that you need to
have appropriate alternative text.

149
00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:19.069
So you could get into some legal gray area
for having inappropriate alt text here.

150
00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:23.873
This, for the future of this course,
will be the kind of WebAIM screenshots

151
00:08:23.873 --> 00:08:28.829
that I use whenever we're tackling
a standards compliance specific issue and

152
00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:31.246
webaim's kind of explanation of it.

153
00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:35.496
So instead of me just saying alt text
is important, we can take WebAIM and

154
00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:39.259
WebAIM says here, in order to be
level A compliant on the left and

155
00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:41.144
then here's a list of things.

156
00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:44.724
So images need to have equivalent and
appropriate alternative text.

157
00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:48.368
If they don't display content, they
need to be the empty string like we saw.

158
00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:54.780
Alternatives to complex images can be
provided in content or separately linked.

159
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.280
Buttons need to have descriptive values
like submit form as opposed to go.

160
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.486
Form inputs also need to have labels,
these kind of things.

161
00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:07.031
So just kind of not necessarily
needing to memorize this now, but

162
00:09:07.031 --> 00:09:11.285
this is the form that the course will take
as we cover a compliance issue where we

163
00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:14.393
will have the equivalent
WebAIM recommendation for it.

164
00:09:14.393 --> 00:09:17.750
Similarly, remembering not all
content on the web is visual.

165
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.847
So while images need these alt text, audio
needs some kind of captioning service.

166
00:09:22.847 --> 00:09:25.591
And again, coming back to
the WebAIM requirements here,

167
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.287
to be level A compliant transcripts of
relevant content need to be provided for

168
00:09:29.287 --> 00:09:32.428
any non-live audio only files,
like an audio podcast or an MP3.

169
00:09:32.428 --> 00:09:36.642
And a transcript or audio description
needs to be provided for non-live video.

170
00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:40.542
And then to be captions and other things
for prerecorded videos, we have some

171
00:09:40.542 --> 00:09:44.802
other level A compliance issues, like
synchronized captions need to be provided,

172
00:09:44.802 --> 00:09:47.871
and we have a link here to what
synchronized captions means.

173
00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:48.754
And then transcript or
audio descriptions needs to be

174
00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:49.370
provided also for non-live video.

175
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.813
So basically just kind of the things that
we see a lot where if you have anything

176
00:09:54.813 --> 00:10:00.761
recorded, there's all sorts of like,
you can get a human transcription service,

177
00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:05.411
you can use some automated tool
with varying degrees of success.

178
00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:10.303
But you need to have some way of
presenting this content in a visual form.

179
00:10:10.303 --> 00:10:10.928
Does that make sense?

180
00:10:10.928 --> 00:10:12.723
So we've got the images needing,
the alt text and

181
00:10:12.723 --> 00:10:14.448
the audio needing some
kind of transcription.
