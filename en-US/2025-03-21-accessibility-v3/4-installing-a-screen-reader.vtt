00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So we'll jump into
what I have dubbed exercise 0,

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.982
in that it's not necessarily
a full exercise.

3
00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.300
But I think it would be a good opportunity
for everyone to get a little bit of time

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.714
to get a screen reader installed,
kind of set up and running.

5
00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:16.193
We will dive into some specific
exercises for it later, but

6
00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:18.568
I just wanted to kind of cover this here.

7
00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:24.088
So we've got this app, it's on my GitHub,
github.com/jkup/learn-ally.

8
00:00:24.088 --> 00:00:28.240
And also, the app is deployed
at learn-ally.netlify.app.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.560
I'll leave this up, but just to kind
of show you what we'll be doing for

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.856
this first section.

11
00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.737
We've got the website here and then we've
got this screen reader setup guide.

12
00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:41.007
And so hopefully,
this will cover all of your use cases.

13
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.176
Please reach out and
let me know if it doesn't.

14
00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:45.971
But this provides free screen readers for
every operating system.

15
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:49.113
So for Mac,
VoiceOver comes shipped automatically,

16
00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:52.265
and so all you'll need to do
is enable it and turn it on.

17
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.189
For Windows,
there's lots of great options, but

18
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.181
NVDA is the free one that
should be easy to use today.

19
00:00:58.181 --> 00:00:59.490
For Linux, we've got Orca.

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.921
Again, tons of great options,
but this one is great.

21
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:07.564
And then for anyone who either can't or
doesn't want to install something on their

22
00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:10.682
full application,
you can also install ChromeVox, so

23
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:14.288
you can use a screen reader built
into your browser right there.

24
00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:17.972
So ideally, what we'll do is
just take a little bit of time,

25
00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:21.805
make sure that everyone can get
a screen reader installed, and

26
00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.362
maybe just take it for
a spin on this page.

27
00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:27.439
And then I have also provided
a few helpful shortcuts for

28
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.499
each one of the screen readers, just
to make sure that you can kind of start

29
00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.006
navigating the website
really well with it.

30
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.247
So let's take a little bit of time,
get those installed,

31
00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:38.993
make sure everybody is okay with that,
because we'll be using them for

32
00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:40.491
a lot of the exercises going forward.

33
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.484
All right, cool, so yeah,
hopefully everybody was able to get

34
00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:51.181
something installed and
running on their computer.

35
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:55.493
My sound is off, but
just to give kind of a quick walkthrough.

36
00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:59.295
So for me, I'm on a Mac, so
I can kinda come here and

37
00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.402
I can do my CMD + F5 to turn VoiceOver on.

38
00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:05.859
And you can hide this, but I will just
kinda use VoiceOver and we'll at least get

39
00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.129
this visual indicator, which will show
us what the VoiceOver is reading.

40
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.520
You can kind of tab around through
the website and see that it changes,

41
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.180
link all the different things
that it's going to say.

42
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.342
And then I added some of these hotkeys so
I can see something,

43
00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:21.507
what I use the most on VoiceOver
is the rotor, the web rotor.

44
00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:25.623
So I'll do Ctrl + Option + U and
it'll open up.

45
00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:26.481
Let me move this.

46
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.046
Control + Option + U and
it'll open up this thing,

47
00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.622
where I can kind of browse
through all the headings.

48
00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:32.456
So you can kind of see that
within the screen reader.

49
00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:35.599
It's not just that it has
the ability to read everything, but

50
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.145
it also provides some really good back and
forth.

51
00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:40.163
Yeah, really quick ways
to kind of move around so

52
00:02:40.163 --> 00:02:41.501
I could find the one that I want.

53
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.485
Let's say I wanted Windows NVDA, I can hit
Enter on it and now it'll kind of get me

54
00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:49.012
there and start reading through
the different things, this section.

55
00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:51.217
So yeah, hopefully everybody
was able to get that set up.

56
00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:55.742
We will, in the first exercise, be doing
kinda quite a bit of comparison between

57
00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.483
an inaccessible website and
an accessible one.

58
00:02:58.483 --> 00:03:02.256
So it's very good to just kinda
have this set up and ready to go.
