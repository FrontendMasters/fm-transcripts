WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.629
So I find accessibility often a bit murky
or difficult to describe, and a lot of

2
00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.936
people will use it in ways that are
partially true, but not all the way true.

3
00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:16.127
So I liked that this W3C web accessibility
initiative has this kind of definition,

4
00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:19.709
which is if we make our sites
properly designed and coded,

5
00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:22.368
people with disabilities can use them.

6
00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.702
But the problem statement is many sites
and tools are developed with barriers that

7
00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:28.048
make them difficult to use,
sometimes impossible.

8
00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:32.250
So I think that this high-level idea
to focus on is accessibility is about

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.034
disability, that's a very
core tenant of it.

10
00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:38.202
And it's about making sure that
our websites are easy to use, but

11
00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:42.410
especially that they're not impossible
to use for people with disabilities.

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.631
I really liked this follow-up too because
I think one of my favorite things about

13
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.362
the web in general as a platform,
is its openness.

14
00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:52.462
This idea that all of
the browsers are open source and

15
00:00:52.462 --> 00:00:57.113
the standards themselves are open, and
most of the libraries we use are open,

16
00:00:57.113 --> 00:01:01.038
and we all are kind of contributing
to this giant open ecosystem.

17
00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:04.341
And one thing that struck me,
that I really have liked throughout

18
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:07.824
the years is that while it is true
that web accessibility means people

19
00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:11.727
with disabilities can use the web, the
real goal that we should have in mind is

20
00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:15.966
that people with disabilities can fully
appreciate, and contribute to the web.

21
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.144
So perceive, understand, navigate,
interact with the web and

22
00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:20.134
contribute to it.

23
00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:24.173
So again, the barrier isn't providing
a nice or a minimal experience for

24
00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:25.898
people to use your website.

25
00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.489
The goal should be that all
of these things that we do,

26
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.946
whether it's using the web,
contributing back to different things,

27
00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:35.658
accessibility is important everywhere,
at every kind of level in there.

28
00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:38.895
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's just a question
about how accessibility might have changed

29
00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:39.731
in recent years,

30
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:43.402
specifically the person might have
taken a previous version of the course.

31
00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:47.318
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, I think a lot
of the roots of accessibility.

32
00:01:47.318 --> 00:01:50.530
The core structure has not
changed all that much,

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.653
in the sense that we still have the same
standards bodies, we still have the same

34
00:01:55.653 --> 00:02:00.664
high-level concepts of focus management,
and colors and semantic HTML.

35
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:04.104
There have been some really big
changes around the legal landscape.

36
00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:08.388
So what used to be kind of a nice to
have has quickly become a requirement,

37
00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:12.720
especially in the European Union and
the United States.

38
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.324
There have been quite a few cool
advancements within those standards

39
00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:16.828
bodies.

40
00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:20.431
So we'll talk about some new ways
of measuring color contrast and

41
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:24.361
some new rules for focus management
that have kind of been ironed out and

42
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.970
finalized over the last couple of years.

43
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.600
So yeah, I guess the double answer is
the kind of core foundational tenets have

44
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.498
stayed the same.

45
00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:34.376
There's been a lot of great movement
in both the requirements and

46
00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:36.688
having fleshed out some of
the specific standards.

47
00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:37.270
&gt;&gt; That's great.

48
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.333
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, so
yeah, similar fields,

49
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:45.404
web performance is quite
similar in a lot of ways.

50
00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:49.484
Making your website fast or
easier to use kind of has some overlaps.

51
00:02:49.484 --> 00:02:53.540
And also uses that same word of
accessibility, a lot when we talk about

52
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.644
uptime, stability, services, things like
that, like how accessible your API is.

53
00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:01.028
So there can be a little
bit of overlap there.

54
00:03:01.028 --> 00:03:03.375
Internationalization also very similar.

55
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:07.437
Having a, for example English-only website
can be a barrier to a lot of people,

56
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.052
a lot of potential customers.

57
00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:12.810
But for the sake of this class,
it's not the same thing as accessibility.

58
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.001
Today we're talking about strictly
disability focused things, but

59
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.882
it's another great field.

60
00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:22.478
And UI design also has a lot of overlap
but we'll talk a lot about cognitive

61
00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:26.596
disabilities, information architecture
just like the way that you structure your

62
00:03:26.596 --> 00:03:30.370
website, making sure that it's easy
to be understood and easy to be used.

63
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.631
There is quite a bit of overlap there, but

64
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:35.738
we aren't going to dive very
far at all into UI design.

65
00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:38.913
I think the furthest that we'll go is
playing around with colors and font sizes,

66
00:03:38.913 --> 00:03:39.836
and things like that.

67
00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:43.420
But we're not gonna get into
proper information architecture or

68
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.492
UX design today.

69
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:48.852
So there's quite a few disability
statistics that are very powerful.

70
00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:54.060
I think like 26% of adults in the US
have some type of disability.

71
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.707
And disability is also like a moving
target in the sense that there

72
00:03:57.707 --> 00:04:01.883
may be a population that doesn't have
a disability now, but as we all age,

73
00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:05.628
it is more and more likely that
we'll develop some disability.

74
00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:09.944
I think the statistics around people with
some type of eyesight or hearing loss,

75
00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:12.962
as you get older are really staggering and
important.

76
00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:17.775
And so I guess the thing to drive
home here is that this really affects

77
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:21.474
all of us, and
it affects a large number of people.

78
00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:24.683
So I guess if you come at it from
the humanitarian standpoint, there's so

79
00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:26.755
many people who need accessible websites,
and

80
00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:29.757
if you come at it from the money
making for your business standpoint,

81
00:04:29.757 --> 00:04:32.778
there's a lot of customers out
there who would benefit from this.

82
00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:35.818
I've heard all these sort of
more negative anecdotes about,

83
00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:40.356
well that's not super important, we're an
internal tool, that's not important to us.

84
00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:45.727
And it's like that always
kind of gets me a little

85
00:04:45.727 --> 00:04:53.852
bit cause it's like you don't know I
mean you've got this diverse team.

86
00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:54.687
There's a really good chance that a lot
of this stuff, if you hit control or

87
00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:55.219
command plus and
the font doesn't get bigger,

88
00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.900
which a lot of websites are still
not working well that way.

89
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.500
That really stinks even if
it is an internal team.

90
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.136
There are so many things, it's unknown
what people are struggling with.

91
00:05:01.136 --> 00:05:03.336
And I think a lot of this
stuff just helps everybody.

92
00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.504
So yeah, I think that's great anecdote and
a lot of this stuff.

93
00:05:06.504 --> 00:05:08.822
I think another thing I
like to drive home is,

94
00:05:08.822 --> 00:05:13.092
for those that have taken my performance
or DevTools courses on a technical level,

95
00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:15.294
this stuff is quite easy compared to that.

96
00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:18.556
You can spend a small amount of time
making a really large impact on

97
00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:19.408
these things.

98
00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:23.304
So ideally we can all kind of get
excited and really improve our sites.

99
00:05:23.304 --> 00:05:26.777
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: People that
are otherwise super productive and

100
00:05:26.777 --> 00:05:31.588
great at their jobs, but yeah,
might have a small impairment.

101
00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:33.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, and
it can just be hard to know, and

102
00:05:33.672 --> 00:05:36.292
it can be hard to discuss those things or
whatever.

103
00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:39.727
Yeah, I mean I think that we'll get
into this concept that I really like

104
00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:42.172
about kind of accessibility
helping everyone.

105
00:05:42.172 --> 00:05:44.812
But yeah, I think it's really
important and I think it's great.

106
00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:48.314
There was a story I heard once,
there's somebody, his name's Jennison,

107
00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.464
he's the lead of
accessibility at LinkedIn.

108
00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:54.314
And he had this great story that I loved
about doing an accessibility audit for

109
00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:55.322
a car dealership.

110
00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:58.203
And they had all these things that
made it basically impossible for

111
00:05:58.203 --> 00:06:01.730
non-sighted users to use their website
to compare cars and things like that.

112
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.400
And he's working with the CEO and the
CEO's like, well, we just figured it's not

113
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.561
important because you need to be able
to see in order to be able to drive.

114
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:10.226
So why do we need this kind of thing?

115
00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:13.927
And Jennison brings in all these customers
and there's all of these non-sighted

116
00:06:13.927 --> 00:06:17.198
customers trying to buy cars for
their children who are unable to use this

117
00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:20.330
dealership website and moving on,
and it really spoke to me in this.

118
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.057
You can't just say that, you can't just
say our product doesn't need this or

119
00:06:24.057 --> 00:06:28.123
there's so much that you don't know about
all the people on your team, internally or

120
00:06:28.123 --> 00:06:31.112
externally as customers who
are trying to use your website.

121
00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:32.536
So yeah, I think those are great points.

122
00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:35.766
When we think about disabilities and
especially when we start implementing

123
00:06:35.766 --> 00:06:39.104
technical solutions, kind of break
them down into these four categories.

124
00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:42.502
So there's mobility and
physical impairments or disabilities, so

125
00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.784
that could be somebody
who can't use a mouse or

126
00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:49.026
who struggles to type on a keyboard, and
uses some kind of assistive technology.

127
00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:51.674
There's cognitive and
neurological disabilities.

128
00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:53.500
So again information overload or

129
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.031
difficult navigation structure
can be really difficult here.

130
00:06:57.031 --> 00:07:01.455
There's visual impairments, when I started
doing accessibility over a decade ago,

131
00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:05.338
I was really thinking about this kind
of binary, sighted or not sighted.

132
00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:07.450
And I went to all these workshops, and

133
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.146
learned about all of these different
conditions where people have

134
00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:14.853
color blindness or they have some
amount of vision in certain eye.

135
00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:18.564
Or they have conditions that make
things get a little bit rounded or

136
00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:22.540
there's all of these different ways
that people perceive the web, and

137
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.564
that comes with a bunch of
interesting challenges.

138
00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:26.572
And the same thing with hearing.

139
00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:30.015
I think the kind of obvious one here
is like having captions for videos for

140
00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.540
an example.

141
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.451
Yeah, so these are kind of the main
categories that we'll be thinking of

142
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:35.940
as we go along.

143
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.238
Another important point, I have all these
reasons why I think accessibility is

144
00:07:40.238 --> 00:07:44.860
great, but one is that the web is already
accessible, even if your website is not.

145
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.743
And so the example that I always give is
what is largely thought to be the first

146
00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:49.420
website.

147
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.524
Has anybody seen this before?

148
00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:53.552
This website from CERN, and
it was supposed to be the introduction

149
00:07:53.552 --> 00:07:56.804
of the World Wide Web, this novel
idea that you can share documents.

150
00:07:56.804 --> 00:08:01.396
If you load this website, which I have
linked here, it's very accessible.

151
00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:05.300
It's just using anchors and paragraph
tags and I think an H1 or whatever.

152
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.322
It's really easy to move
around with just the keyboard.

153
00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:10.090
The screen reader works really well.

154
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.034
And so I always think the first
website ever can do it.

155
00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.451
Surely we can all do it with ours.

156
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:18.357
This website is a lot more accessible than
modern websites with massive teams of

157
00:08:18.357 --> 00:08:20.350
engineers behind them that I see today.

158
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.889
So cool, so kind of to sum that up,

159
00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:26.458
the reasons I think it's great to learn
accessibility, I do think it's very fun.

160
00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:29.564
We'll get into some APIs later that
I think are just excellent, and

161
00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:31.210
really great to work with.

162
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.135
As developers or designers, we're often
the ones making websites inaccessible in

163
00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:37.780
the first place through
our features that we add.

164
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.924
It is largely a human rights issue.

165
00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:42.420
It is also more and more a legal issue.

166
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.460
It helps us reach a larger audience.

167
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.876
It can be really impactful, both for
your audience and for your team.

168
00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:50.617
And I also think it's a really cool
way to kind of distinguish yourself

169
00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:51.780
as a specialist on the team.

170
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.197
I think that having a strong accessibility
background has really helped me in my

171
00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:57.447
career, where we'll get
a report from a customer.

172
00:08:57.447 --> 00:08:59.896
And I can always kind of jump in and
say, actually,

173
00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:02.940
I know how to do a lot of this stuff,
so I think it's very, very cool.
