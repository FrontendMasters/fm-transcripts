WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.661
Let's talk a little bit about
the standards and guidelines, and

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.800
we'll use these web specific standards.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.363
To kind of guide and shape all of the
features that we build and all the stuff

4
00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:15.472
that we talk about going forward, so
there's kind of three main things to know.

5
00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:17.426
These all fall under the W3C,

6
00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:22.560
which is the standards body that's
responsible for HTML and CSS as well.

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.314
So there is the actual specification,
the web content, and

8
00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:30.024
accessibility guidelines,
we'll dive into this WCAG.

9
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.083
So this is a good access acronym to know,

10
00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:36.328
there's the W3C's Web Accessibility
Initiative, so this is the group itself,

11
00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.370
the group is way.

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.739
And then while the WCAG kind of
specifies what is necessary,

13
00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.452
there's also this WAI-ARIA spec,
which kind of helps make rich

14
00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:51.874
Internet applications, or,
robust applications, more accessible.

15
00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:54.988
So maybe a quick show of hands,
has anybody ever seen or

16
00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.354
added an ARIA tag to their HTML already?

17
00:00:57.354 --> 00:00:58.008
Like an aria?

18
00:00:58.008 --> 00:00:59.890
Okay, cool, so a lot of people,
that's great, yeah.

19
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.707
So it's like even people who haven't done
specialized accessibility work often

20
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:07.620
have at least seen them
existing in HTML before.

21
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.661
Whether it's like ARIA labeled by or
described by or maybe a role or something

22
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:15.940
like that, is a really nice way to get
your feet wet with accessibility, great.

23
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.292
So yeah, these are the three
main groups to know, so there's

24
00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:23.685
the kind of core group under W3C, they
put out this standard of the guidelines.

25
00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:27.715
And then they also work on a specification
for making HTML more rich and

26
00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:31.510
giving it new APIs so
you can do new things with it.

27
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.282
So the W3C, for those not familiar,
is the World Wide Web Consortium,

28
00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.606
and they're an international
standards body.

29
00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:44.023
So again, their main kind of standards
that they work on are HTML, CSS, and

30
00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:45.230
accessibility.

31
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.071
I mentioned earlier that I sit on TC 39,
which is under a different standards body,

32
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.054
which is ECMA.

33
00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:55.964
And so there's kind of this distinction
where things that go into the JavaScript

34
00:01:55.964 --> 00:02:00.457
language, like your arrow functions and
constant let things like that.

35
00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:04.730
Those fall under the purview of ECMA,
whereas browser specific APIs,

36
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.420
like maybe the Performance API,
those fall under the umbrella of the W3C.

37
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.649
This is really just for publishing and
legal reasons, in truth,

38
00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.056
the groups often work
pretty well together, and

39
00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:18.836
things kind of get slated into the
appropriate group based on the feature.

40
00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:22.837
But the W3C is great, they're like a big
open consortium, they publish all of their

41
00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:26.640
notes, all of their standards documents,
everything like that.

42
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.475
And they are very easy to contribute to,
so yeah,

43
00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:33.793
you can kind of get started by checking
out w3.org so way, as I mentioned,

44
00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:36.152
is this web accessibility initiative.

45
00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:40.616
So they are a group or an initiative
underneath the umbrella of the W3C, and

46
00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:44.873
their job is to basically have this
focus on accessibility and create and

47
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.840
publish accessibility specifications.

48
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.542
So the WAI are the authors of WCAG,
which is the specification itself, and

49
00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:56.980
you can check out more on them
on the w3.org/ WAI website.

50
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.186
And then WCAG itself is
the standard published by WAI,

51
00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:02.708
these acronyms are a little bit similar.

52
00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:05.870
So I kind of just wanted to go through
this to make sure we understand,

53
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.812
what is a group, what is a document, and
what is the overarching standards body.

54
00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:10.466
So, yeah, so

55
00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:13.764
they always have their standards up
to date posted on their website.

56
00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:17.933
And this is great, as we go into these
accessibility tools like Lighthouse and

57
00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:19.891
these linters and things like that,

58
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:22.732
they are creating their
rules off of this document.

59
00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:27.540
So the document is the standard, and then
everybody else makes tools that enforce or

60
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.660
detect rule violations in the document.

61
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.936
And then the last thing is WAI-ARIA,
so this is a crossover,

62
00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:40.380
it is a standard as well as this kind of
robust set of APIs implemented by HTML.

63
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.367
So WAI will decide that we need some
way of doing some new cool thing, and

64
00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:48.303
they'll make a standard for it, and
the standard will get approved.

65
00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:51.978
And then HTML will pick that up and
implement it in the form of ARIA tags or

66
00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:55.742
roles or something like that,
that belong to HTML buttons or elements.

67
00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:58.239
Cool, one other group that I really like,
so

68
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.462
we're kind of done with
the official standard stuff now,

69
00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:06.438
is there's this independent advocacy group
called WebAIM that I'm a very big fan of.

70
00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:09.237
They sort of parse through the spec and
the standard, and

71
00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:12.049
they come up with these very
easy to digest sets of rules.

72
00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.049
That are like, hey, I read the standard,

73
00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.382
and this is what it says about focus
elements, like you need a ring, and

74
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.294
it needs this contrast, and
it needs a visual indicator.

75
00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:24.596
And so they have a website, webaim.org,
and as we go through the course,

76
00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:28.833
I often will use WebAIM because they
have these really well constructed,

77
00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.268
easy to digest rules.

78
00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:33.907
But WebAIM is really just basing those
rules off of the standard itself, so

79
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:37.605
I think WebAIM is just this independent
group that provides some very nice,

80
00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:39.964
easy to digest ways of
interpreting the specs.

81
00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:43.296
So we're not all sitting and reading
through this like 10,000 page spec,

82
00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.580
basically.

83
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.173
Cool, so within accessibility
there are conformance levels,

84
00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:50.666
and so we'll see this quite a bit,
I think.

85
00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:54.286
I already had a few slides
that mentioned AA before,

86
00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:57.170
but there's basically A, AA and AAA.

87
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.650
And A is the lowest level of conformance,
AA is mid range, AAA is highest.

88
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.900
And so basically the tldr,
if we wanted to get away from it,

89
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.130
is we should try to stick AA compliant.

90
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.648
That's usually where the legal
ramifications come in,

91
00:05:10.648 --> 00:05:12.498
is failing to adhere to AA compliance.

92
00:05:12.498 --> 00:05:16.805
However, I think that AAA compliance is
just excellent to read if you wanna know

93
00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:19.455
how to take your application
to that next level.

94
00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:22.367
From being technically usable
to being really robust and

95
00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:25.240
enjoyable to people with disabilities.

96
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.246
So for the legal side,
we'll focus on AA, but

97
00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:30.489
we'll often throughout this course talk
about what is mentioned in the AAA

98
00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:34.058
compliance because I think doing a little
bit of extra work can make a huge impact.

99
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.553
Cool, and then the last thing to cover
over here is this concept that WCAG puts

100
00:05:40.553 --> 00:05:43.347
out called the POUR principles,
I really like them,

101
00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:47.306
they're just kind of a high level
way of thinking about accessibility.

102
00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:52.256
So POUR stands for perceivable, operable,
understandable, and robust, and

103
00:05:52.256 --> 00:05:55.354
then each section has
this little perceivable.

104
00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:59.562
Users can recognize either via sight,
hearing, or touch the information,

105
00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:03.962
operable means they can navigate and
operate the website using input methods.

106
00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:07.729
So kind of distilling these things down,
like the information that you receive,

107
00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.308
should be receivable either
in one of these three ways.

108
00:06:10.308 --> 00:06:13.103
And then using the website,
like your buttons, your forms,

109
00:06:13.103 --> 00:06:15.616
things like that,
users should be able to do that.

110
00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:18.875
Understandable, the content
needs to make sense, and

111
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:23.532
then robust would be basically like if
you have these assistive technologies.

112
00:06:23.532 --> 00:06:25.491
There's basically support for

113
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:29.680
all of them in order to kind of
interact with the website and use it.

114
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.341
So I kind of like thinking about these
things as the overarching concepts when

115
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:35.313
we're making our websites accessible,

116
00:06:35.313 --> 00:06:39.000
like making sure that they theoretically
meet all four of these categories.
