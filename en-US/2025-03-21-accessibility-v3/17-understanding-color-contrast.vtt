00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:05.099
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And this is a very kind
of foundational concept here, color and

2
00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:06.021
contrast.

3
00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:08.342
There are quite a lot of cool tools.

4
00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.196
We have one that we'll build
in our next exercise, but

5
00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:14.186
WebAIM has a really nice color
contrast checker as well.

6
00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.528
But there's quite a few
things to think about here.

7
00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:20.558
So I guess the things that we wanna think
about are the most obvious that come to

8
00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:23.536
mind are the foreground color and
the background color.

9
00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:26.928
And they mathematically have these
contrast ratios with each other.

10
00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:31.969
And WebAIM and WCAG specify how
much contrast you'll need in order

11
00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.843
to be compliant on both AA and AAA,
which I think we can see here.

12
00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:38.481
But before we go into that,

13
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:42.981
there's actually quite a few other axes
that we just need to be mindful of.

14
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:47.268
Because it's not just foreground color and
background color, but font size and

15
00:00:47.268 --> 00:00:49.452
font width also play a large part here.

16
00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.868
So the math gets a little bit more
complicated, but if you use one of

17
00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:56.711
these professional color checkers,
it will tell you whether you're AA or

18
00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:00.630
AAA compliant, remember the WCAG
standards that we've been looking for.

19
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.924
And whether you're compliant for
normal text, large text, or

20
00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:05.450
user interface components.

21
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.749
And then some of them even take in font
weight to account where you might be

22
00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:10.886
non-compliant.

23
00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:15.167
But if the font weight is bold enough,
then it makes it stand out enough there.

24
00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:20.746
So this is one kind of big world here,
just generic kind of color contrast.

25
00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:25.062
And it has a lot of important implications
because you can start thinking about a lot

26
00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:26.429
of the websites we build.

27
00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.701
And a lot of them will use color only
to indicate things going on, a success

28
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:37.384
green or a failure red or maybe a loading
yellow or different things like that.

29
00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:42.158
And making sure that the contrast is
good enough to be indicated is a really

30
00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:43.144
good start.

31
00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:47.316
But it also leads us into kind of
a whole other world, which is that there

32
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:51.918
are a whole lot of different visual
impairments that can make certain colors.

33
00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:55.033
Think about being colorblind,
that can make certain colors really,

34
00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:55.939
really difficult.

35
00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.379
So at my work, we have an accessibility
team and they do some really cool work on.

36
00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.916
Because as you can imagine,
a financial product,

37
00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:06.640
if we scroll down a little bit, is going
to make heavy use of color, right?

38
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.017
What is up, what is down,
what is neutral, basically.

39
00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:13.058
And so obviously, or
maybe not obviously, but at the base,

40
00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:16.340
we wanna make sure that our color
contrast is always good enough,

41
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.098
that the green against the black and
the red against the black stand out.

42
00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.276
But as we get into different
vision impairments,

43
00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:27.145
we actually get introduced to
a whole lot of new challenges.

44
00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:30.475
So, there's all these great
simulators out there, and so

45
00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:32.812
this one simulates a vision impairment.

46
00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:37.321
And you can quickly see how our green and
our red, which a moment ago probably to

47
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:42.034
many of us looked extremely unique and
differentiated from each other, actually

48
00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:46.696
kind of meld into almost an identical
yellow with certain visual impairments.

49
00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:49.200
And so we've got a few
things to think about here,

50
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.528
we've got general color contrast,
which is very important.

51
00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:57.615
We've got the idea of if color is ever the
only thing that indicates maybe success,

52
00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:00.971
failure, progress, state,
that can be dangerous.

53
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.772
And then we've also got a lot of
different visual impairment conditions to

54
00:03:04.772 --> 00:03:05.506
think about.

55
00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:08.388
And so
we've got a few different solutions here,

56
00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.344
I think that the color
contrast gets us very far.

57
00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:15.601
I think that looking at any of these nice
simulators and we can go over a couple of

58
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:20.053
them in the tools section that help you
simulate different vision conditions, go

59
00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:24.594
a long way in helping you pick colors that
will work with a wide variety of people.

60
00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:27.988
I also think that this is a nice
area where if you use any kind

61
00:03:27.988 --> 00:03:32.838
of pre-made color palette, like Google
Material Design or something like that,

62
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:35.979
you get a lot of this kind
of well thought out benefit.

63
00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.904
That they've already spent a lot of time
making sure that their colors sufficiently

64
00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:42.746
contrast and also look good
with a variety of impairments.

65
00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:49.516
So a thing that we do at our work is that
we've introduced a different color scheme.

66
00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:54.322
So we have two optional color schemes and
you can see if we kind of scroll down

67
00:03:54.322 --> 00:03:58.932
here that we move the traditional
green and red into this blue and red.

68
00:03:58.932 --> 00:04:02.236
And so
you can opt into the CVD color scheme.

69
00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:06.065
And here we can see that even with
a wide range of visual impairments,

70
00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:10.224
you're still very easily able to
differentiate between the blue and red or

71
00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:13.260
even if it looks like blue and
yellow to you.

72
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.612
So, yeah, I think in general
these are quite cool ideas.

73
00:04:16.612 --> 00:04:20.659
They get a little bit complex because
there can be difficulty that you might not

74
00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.752
think of when you're building things.

75
00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:25.634
I think contrast is a great
first place to start.

76
00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:30.541
And I think a great second place to start
is where allowed adding some other kind of

77
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.972
indicator for things like success,
failure, price up, price down.

78
00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:38.367
If you can add a check mark or a red X,
even if they can't tell that it's red,

79
00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:39.656
they can see that it's an X.

80
00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.838
And that can be tried
tremendously helpful too.

81
00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:45.845
Another thing to consider for a large
application would be maybe having two

82
00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:48.970
different color schemes that
can be opted into and out of.
