00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.073
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So,
touching on this legal landscape and

2
00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:05.570
this is something I had mentioned earlier,
that's changing a lot and

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.654
has changed a lot over the past few years.

4
00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:09.332
So for today I went back and

5
00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:14.685
forth on this a lot because every country
has their own kind of situation right now.

6
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.598
But since we're in the US giving
this talk right now live,

7
00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.002
this will be a little bit US focused
as we go through the legal stuff.

8
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:25.447
But there are strong parallels between
all of the United States laws on

9
00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:29.211
accessibility and the EU and
the UK and things like that, so

10
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.093
this largely applies
anywhere that you are.

11
00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:36.496
So we have the [COUGH] ADA,
the Americans with Disabilities Act and

12
00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:41.235
web accessibility has been but
is a legal requirement under that act.

13
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:45.096
Lawsuits and regulations are increasing,
we'll get into some of the numbers next.

14
00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:50.024
But the idea being that an inaccessible
website can be subject to these

15
00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:55.368
regulations and non compliance can
result in a lot of negatives like fines,

16
00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:57.892
lawsuits, reputational damage.

17
00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:02.181
So the key laws and standards to be aware
of, we have the ADA Title I and II, so

18
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.952
government and business websites
need to adhere to these things.

19
00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:09.949
We've got section 508, so all federal
agencies must comply with these things,

20
00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:11.141
that's even stricter.

21
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:15.578
And then the way that we do compliance
is through the standards body,

22
00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:20.645
which we'll talk about later, but
the W3C has WCAG and level AA compliance.

23
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:23.644
Again, we'll get into
the nitty-gritty of all this stuff,

24
00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:26.414
but it's the current standard for
web accessibility and

25
00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:30.178
often what these government legislations
use for determining compliance.

26
00:01:30.178 --> 00:01:33.912
And last year the department of Justice
in the US made the compliance a lot more

27
00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:34.494
explicit.

28
00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.535
What you have to adhere to, what
the punishments are if you don't, and so

29
00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.510
we've seen a huge increase
in these lawsuits.

30
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.329
And I think it's another area where
being an accessibility expert can really

31
00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.453
help you in your career,
at your company, at your team, etc.

32
00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:50.373
So I saw this statistic that I
thought was really interesting, so

33
00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:54.580
in 2023 lawsuits related to
inaccessible websites rose 62%,

34
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.591
I couldn't find 2024 statistics, but
I would imagine it is still on the rise.

35
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:04.255
Some big websites like Whirlpool were sued
for barriers on their website as well as

36
00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:08.939
the famous Katz's Deli in New York
which was fined 20,000 for violations.

37
00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.292
And these can reach up to
$150,000 per violation, so

38
00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:15.001
this is nowhere near about
like fear mongering for

39
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.531
accessibility, but I think hope that it
helps drive through the importance of it.

40
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.694
As the legal requirement becomes more and
more prevalent,

41
00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:26.817
the industries that the ADA marks as
high risk for these legal requirements.

42
00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.631
Are E-commerce, finance and banking,
hospitality and restaurants,

43
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.558
and healthcare.

44
00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:34.131
Which sounds like a list of like four or
five things,

45
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:37.298
but I do find it largely covers
most of the things that we work on.

46
00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:41.414
And another note that I have is there's
quite a few SAS startups out there that

47
00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:45.847
offer like, make your website accessible
with just our overlay that says it's not

48
00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:47.012
accessible move on.

49
00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:51.170
Those largely are not working to protect
from a legal standard, a lot of websites

50
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.853
with those overlays that they pay for
are not preventing the lawsuits.

51
00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:59.985
Cool, so how to stay compliant do these
audits that we'll cover in this course,

52
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:04.598
making sure that your website is
WCAG2 at least AA standard compliant.

53
00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:08.287
Test with real users wherever possible or
as a developer using assistive technology,

54
00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:09.659
which we'll do in this course.

55
00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.858
Use automated tools where you can so
there's like lighthouse, axe, wave.

56
00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:17.365
These all provide audits you can
run through your dev tools or

57
00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:20.185
through your CICD pipeline or
through your ID and

58
00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:23.237
they can help you just make
sure you stay compliant.

59
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:26.619
The last thing is especially for
kind of like leadership or if you're

60
00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:30.431
engineering that works closely with
design, or if you're on a design team.

61
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.350
Making sure that you train
teams on inclusive design,

62
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.749
which we will talk about.

63
00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.974
This is a little cheeky, AKA take this
course, hopefully I cover the most

64
00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:41.580
important things that you need to know
to stay compliant during today's course.
