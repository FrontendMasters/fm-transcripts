00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.812
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right, so

2
00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:04.675
maybe a little mini lesson on how
to read standard specifications,

3
00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:08.756
which I think is a very difficult thing,
but a really important skill.

4
00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:14.589
So, this look will be familiar to you
if you read any W3C specifications so,

5
00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.469
for example,
this is the WCAG accessibility one.

6
00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:22.821
But you could just as easily
imagine like the W3C HTML spec, and

7
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:27.753
you could click on the HTML5 spec,
and it looks surprisingly similar.

8
00:00:27.753 --> 00:00:31.735
And you can do the same thing
with TC39 specification, and

9
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:36.668
find the 2025 and it looks more orange,
but basically the exact same.

10
00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:41.202
So, these are the sort of outputs that
we as standards bodies create, and

11
00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:45.825
we usually create them quarterly or
annually, new features as they come.

12
00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.716
So you can imagine with accessibility
like these ARIA roles or attributes,

13
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.138
it might actually be good just to
kind of visualize how this works.

14
00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:54.977
So let's say that you
come up with an idea for

15
00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:57.232
a new ARIA role that's like
sorely missing, right?

16
00:00:57.232 --> 00:01:02.208
And what you do is you join W3C, either as
a paying member or as an invited expert,

17
00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:06.679
and you attend the WCAG working group,
the way group, working on this and

18
00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:07.567
you present.

19
00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.954
I have this idea for
this role that I think is missing.

20
00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:14.644
And it has to go through this consensus
process and if there's consensus that it's

21
00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:19.267
important, it starts this kind of multi
stage process where you as the champion is

22
00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:23.287
often how we refer to an ecma,
have to come up with a problem statement,

23
00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:27.175
a solution, then you have to write
a lot of this specification text.

24
00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:29.435
And the point of this specification text,

25
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:33.578
is that it should be thorough enough that
every implementer, in like this case

26
00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:37.819
every browser should be able to implement
the exact same bit of functionality.

27
00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.292
So it sort of becomes this thought
exercise and like edge cases and rules and

28
00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:47.121
you really want to come up with this thing
that for all HTML, CSS, JavaScript and

29
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:51.808
accessibility, you should be able to
take this document, give it to Google,

30
00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:54.103
give it to Apple, give it to Mozilla.

31
00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:57.389
And they should come back with
websites that render websites,

32
00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.434
with browsers that render
websites in the exact same way.

33
00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:03.747
So the challenge becomes one
of being extremely thorough.

34
00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:06.758
That sort of makes sense at a high level
that you basically wanna think of.

35
00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:11.052
Here's the new rule, here's what it's for,
here's how it acts, here's how you would

36
00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:14.974
implement it, here's how it works with
other things, here's how a collision.

37
00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:18.489
We had all these good questions today
like, what about two assertive ARIA live

38
00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.909
regions colliding with each other,
that should be documented somewhere.

39
00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.099
Or we had one on chat, which was like,

40
00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.137
what if your button's focus state is
the same color as the button, but

41
00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:31.637
it is in contrast with the background,
is that good enough?

42
00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:34.939
So all these great questions, these
are things that ought to be in the spec so

43
00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.585
that all the browsers can implement
it in the exact same way.

44
00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:40.499
And when it's not good enough in the spec,
we end up with divergent behavior,

45
00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.988
which can end up with a bunch of bugs and
they're hard to fix later.

46
00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:47.111
So, when you're looking at the
specification, I think the important thing

47
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:50.855
to know is that it's not authored
to you as an application developer,

48
00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:53.025
it really is authored to implementers.

49
00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:55.985
However that doesn't mean it can't
be a tremendous resource to you.

50
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:59.770
So I'll give an example here with
the example I just gave of the button and

51
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.400
the focus.

52
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.188
We had a question in chat and I wasn't
sure if the rules stated that the focus

53
00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:09.672
ring needed to be in contrast to both
the background and the button, or

54
00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:11.271
just one I wasn't sure.

55
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.837
And so what I did was I ended up
searching through the WCAG specs, so

56
00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:16.505
2.2 is the latest version.

57
00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:21.700
It was released in December 2024, and
I ended up finding this section on focus.

58
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.017
And so I found the section on focus,
and it gets overwhelming but

59
00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:27.973
truly it has a lot of the stuff
that we would expect to see.

60
00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:32.658
So, it says what it's talking about,
then for each section it'll say,

61
00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:37.133
is this AA or AAA, so you can see that
we've got a AA rule and a AAA rule.

62
00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:41.211
It's got some notes, these are like
editorial comments that are like helpful

63
00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:43.573
things for implementers as they're going.

64
00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:47.555
And so what I ended up finding here was,
I was kinda reading through, and it says,

65
00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:50.518
it's more vague than I'd like
it to be that's what I found.

66
00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:54.581
So to be AAA compliant,
the focus indicator when visible,

67
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.030
needs to meet all of the following.

68
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.251
One, it has to be at least as
large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel

69
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:05.743
thick perimeter of the unfocused
component or subcomponent.

70
00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:07.170
That's pretty straightforward, right?

71
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.953
It doesn't have to be 2 pixels, but

72
00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:11.667
it has to be at least as big
as 2 pixels would be, right?

73
00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:16.599
So it could be larger than 2 pixels, it
could be like an as long as it never gets

74
00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.182
smaller than 2 pixels,
this is a pretty reasonable idea.

75
00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:24.577
And then two, it has a contrast ratio of
at least 3 to 1 between the same pixels

76
00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:26.722
in the focused and unfocused states.

77
00:04:26.722 --> 00:04:28.976
This is more vague than I'd like it to be,
right.

78
00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:33.188
So contrast ratio of 3 to 1 is like
very clear between the same pixels in

79
00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:35.308
the focused and unfocused states.

80
00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:39.017
So there has to be some contrast
between when it's not focused and

81
00:04:39.017 --> 00:04:40.171
when it is focused.

82
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.746
But does the contrast have to apply
into the button as well as out

83
00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:45.707
to the background or just one way.

84
00:04:45.707 --> 00:04:50.776
My loose reading of it would be that
you technically only needed to have,

85
00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:55.279
you could have a black button that
has a black 2 pixel ring on it.

86
00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.843
I think that's a bad idea,
I don't think we should do that.

87
00:04:57.843 --> 00:05:02.660
So if I had the time or energy, I would
submit a proposal to this spec saying

88
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.554
that, to be [APPLAUSE] compliant,
the 3 to 1 ratio needs to be both between

89
00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:10.997
the background and
the inner focused state itself.

90
00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:15.501
But, the kind of idea here being put
yourself in the mindset of an implementer

91
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:19.935
of a browser, not an application
developer, and kind of understand that,

92
00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:24.468
every single thing ought to be written
in depth in the specification itself.

93
00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:28.556
So you really should be able to dive in
here, and see if I'm building a browser,

94
00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:31.438
what do I add as a focus state,
what does that need to be?

95
00:05:31.438 --> 00:05:34.835
And you'll notice different browsers
will have different focus rings or

96
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.449
different date pickers, or different
color pickers, things like that, but

97
00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.439
all of them adhere to this specification.

98
00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:44.253
So those deviances are maybe areas that
we could have improved the spec, but

99
00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:46.696
they all meet the exact
same when you hit escape,

100
00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:49.334
what does it do all when you hit tab,
what does it do?

101
00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:51.304
If you have two at the same time,
how do they behave?

102
00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:52.746
Those kind of things.

103
00:05:52.746 --> 00:05:54.169
Any specific questions?

104
00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.239
I love talking about spec stuff, but
hopefully that at least gives you like,

105
00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:59.695
this is what they look like,
this is how to navigate them, and

106
00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:02.650
this is the tone that they're in and
the reason why they're in that tone.
