00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.465
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: We'll jump into what
I promise will be the shortest lesson

2
00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.472
followed by an exercise but
it was something that I thought was really

3
00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:10.944
important because I think it
gets skipped all too often.

4
00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.089
It's often contentious with design teams.

5
00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.480
And I think it's important as
accessibility experts that we kind of push

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.771
back a little bit and
that's focus management.

7
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.165
And so basically,
no matter your application,

8
00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:26.819
you do need to be compliant,
some type of visual focus indicator.

9
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.391
This is absolutely crucial for keyboard
users, right as they're tabbing around,

10
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.064
they need some way of knowing
where they are in the document.

11
00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:35.611
And I know this often conflicts
with the design vision for

12
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.915
certain applications, but there
are some really cool things you can do.

13
00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:42.187
For example,
you don't need to have a hover indicator,

14
00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:44.632
but you do need to have a focus indicator.

15
00:00:44.632 --> 00:00:47.750
So it doesn't need to have a big blue
ring when you mouse over it, but

16
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.143
it does need to have a big ring when
people are tabbing through in some way to

17
00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:53.656
make sure that it meets
the standard requirements.

18
00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.896
So I find this to be the best compromise
where working with design teams.

19
00:00:56.896 --> 00:01:02.432
And I'll say, cool, we can have no hover
item, but we are gonna have a focus style.

20
00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:04.668
Alternatively, I think if
you sneak in a focus style,

21
00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.464
most people don't notice because
they're not tabbing through.

22
00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:08.592
So cool.

23
00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.728
The focus requirements,
in order to be standards compliant,

24
00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:14.760
indicators must have a minimum
contrast ratio of 3:1.

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.785
And we will later in an exercise
explore a cool color contrast picker so

26
00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:20.536
we can get a good idea there.

27
00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:23.928
The focus area needs to be
at least 2 pixels thick.

28
00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:27.930
They need to be visible to both light and
dark modes.

29
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.479
Users need to have an idea of where they
are on the page no matter which light or

30
00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.707
dark mode you're using.

31
00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:35.293
Multiple indicators are always beneficial.

32
00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:38.031
So thinking about something like
a background change plus an outline, but

33
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:38.947
they're not required.

34
00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:41.780
Just the 2 px thick outline
is what's required.

35
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.651
And any kind of animations
could enhance visibility, but

36
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.154
they shouldn't be distracting from
navigating around on the page.

37
00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:50.746
So with that,
we'll hop into a real quick exercise.

38
00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:54.320
Focus styles, same repo, same website.

39
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.880
Just go over here and
there's not much to code here.

40
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.211
I just came up with a bunch of examples
that I've seen around the Internet and

41
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:02.294
was hoping everyone would
take a few minutes and

42
00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:05.488
just kind of tab through them and
see kind of the difference it makes.

43
00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:09.696
No focus outline, too thin of an outline,
all sorts of cool things like that.

44
00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.881
So, yeah, if we can just take a quick
break here, kind of tab through and just

45
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:16.167
try to gain a little bit of empathy for
why these focus rings would be important.

46
00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:23.232
So, yeah,
hopefully this one was just small, but

47
00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:26.087
I just wanted to kind of give
this kind of experience.

48
00:02:26.087 --> 00:02:29.594
With no focus outline,
it's impossible to know where you are.

49
00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:32.394
Thin outlines can be okay,
but they're not great.

50
00:02:32.394 --> 00:02:36.704
And as we kinda talked about earlier,
building empathy for people who have some

51
00:02:36.704 --> 00:02:40.907
kind of vision loss and some inability
to maybe see such a subtle difference.

52
00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:44.370
The low contrast one can be okay,
but it won't look good on dark mode.

53
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.127
And then when we get into some
other examples, like a big,

54
00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:48.910
thick blue outline is nice.

55
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.750
Outline and background is great.

56
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.806
A little bit of an animation can be cool.

57
00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:54.750
Again, for
this kind of compromise with design,

58
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.986
you'll notice that these
don't have any hover styles.

59
00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:59.969
So you can still have full control
over your design system for

60
00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.951
mouse hover effects while providing
a really good accessibility experience for

61
00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.422
people tapping through.

62
00:03:05.422 --> 00:03:09.552
Similarly, a little bit of an animation
background and border here, and

63
00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:12.086
then a good visual indicator for
the cards.

64
00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:15.090
So I actually find this a cool thing
to do as I go back to websites that

65
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.526
I use all the time,
like news websites or whatever.

66
00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:20.849
Try tabbing through and seeing what
they've done for their focus experience,

67
00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.846
cuz they often people
do really cool things.

68
00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:23.913
Yeah, Mark.

69
00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:28.945
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there any WCAG
rule that the focus indicator

70
00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:37.086
has to be in a separate color than
the rest of the page, like not just black?

71
00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:41.541
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: If I think I understand
the question, then I think it's this one

72
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:46.328
that whatever the indicator is,
whether it's a background color,

73
00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:52.134
a border needs to have a 3:1 contrast
ratio against whatever it's touching.

74
00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:54.098
So you could have a black page,

75
00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:58.990
a white section, and then elements in
that white section could have black.

76
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.234
You can reuse colors, but whatever the
indicator is against needs to have that

77
00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:05.430
3:1 contrast ratio to be compliant.
