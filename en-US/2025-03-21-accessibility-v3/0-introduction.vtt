00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:01.104
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right,

2
00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:04.864
welcome everybody to this
Intro to Accessibility course.

3
00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:05.755
I'm very excited to be here.

4
00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:09.721
This is one of my favorite passion
topics and I love sharing it and

5
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.520
talking about it.

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.776
So yeah, just a little quick bit about me.

7
00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:15.096
My name is Jon Kuperman.

8
00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:18.251
I work at Bloomberg,
working on their financial browser,

9
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.640
building a bunch of dev tools and
internal infrastructure.

10
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.303
I also sit on TC39, which is the standards
body behind the JavaScript language.

11
00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:30.925
I'm a co convener of
the Source Maps specification and

12
00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.347
been working more and
more lately on the TC39 signals proposal.

13
00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.669
So, yeah, this is an introduction
to accessibility course for

14
00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:40.707
those who have taken my other courses.

15
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.840
This one follows largely
the same structure, but

16
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.314
it differs a little bit in that we will
focus more on putting ourselves in

17
00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.390
the shoes of the consumer
of web applications.

18
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.896
So we'll still be writing some code and
doing exercises together.

19
00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:58.641
But we'll largely be focusing on
understanding what the accessibility wins

20
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:03.532
do for us as we try using inaccessible
websites and then accessible websites and

21
00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:06.307
kind of comparing that
experience as users.

22
00:01:06.307 --> 00:01:09.127
So yeah, so a little overview
of this course just so you know,

23
00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:11.370
kind of what you're in store for today.

24
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.986
We'll start with kind of more definition.

25
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.554
So what is accessibility?

26
00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:16.396
What is it not?

27
00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:19.823
There's quite a few similar or
related fields with a lot of overlap, but

28
00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:22.984
we'll kind of focus in on what
we're going to be working on today.

29
00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:25.651
We'll talk about the legal requirements,
especially for websites.

30
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.801
This is like an ever changing landscape,
but

31
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:31.039
it is, I think accessibility is
becoming more and more important.

32
00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.005
As it becomes more obvious that a lot
of countries are starting to enforce

33
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.071
laws around making sure that
websites are accessible.

34
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:42.242
We'll talk about all sorts of assistive
technologies, so all the different cool

35
00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:46.200
ways people browse the web and
what that means for us as developers.

36
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.739
We will dive into screen readers,

37
00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.241
which are kind of a fundamental
assistive technology.

38
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:53.441
So we'll kind of install them and
we'll start using them on

39
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.089
these demo websites and kind of
comparing what the experience is for

40
00:01:57.089 --> 00:02:00.044
an inaccessible website
versus an accessible one.

41
00:02:00.044 --> 00:02:02.724
We'll talk about the actual
standards behind accessibility.

42
00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:06.455
So there's various groups under
the W3C working on this stuff and

43
00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:09.584
sort of what they say and
what it means to be compliant and

44
00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:13.900
what it means to have levels of
conformance, things like that.

45
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.587
We'll do a pretty good
focus on semantic HTML.

46
00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:19.913
It's one of my favorites because it's
quite easy on a technical level to just

47
00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:23.237
change the markup that you have for an
existing website, but it can make a very

48
00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:26.377
profound difference for people using
the website with assistive tech.

49
00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:30.041
We'll dive into probably the most
technical bit which will be focus

50
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:30.820
management.

51
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.806
So thinking about people using your
website, maybe keyboard only and

52
00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:39.259
all the different cool tricks you can do
to make it easier to use as well as things

53
00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.505
that can make it more difficult to use.

54
00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:45.622
Yeah, we'll cover a bunch of great
accessibility tricks like skip links and

55
00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:46.509
tab trapping and

56
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.711
things that a lot of these big websites
do to make their websites easier to use.

57
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:52.995
We'll kind of round up with color and
contrast,

58
00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:56.405
talking about the kind of design of
your website and the colors you pick.

59
00:02:56.405 --> 00:03:00.657
And then we'll end with a bunch of kind
of future looking things, tools and

60
00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:05.333
testing like ways you can analyze your
website right now, tools that you can add.

61
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:09.614
Whether they're like authoring tools to
your framework or whether they're linting

62
00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:13.428
tools or whether they're audits in CI/CD,
all sorts of things like that.

63
00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:14.784
And then we'll kind of wrap up from there.

64
00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:18.896
So yeah, that's a kind of
high level outline of today.

65
00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.581
So yes, accessibility,

66
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:25.031
I guess one note is that it is
interchangeably called Ally or A11Y.

67
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.119
That's one of these things like if you've
seen internationalization becomes I18N

68
00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.191
because there's 18 letters in between.

69
00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:33.880
Accessibility has a similar thing
where there's the A and the Y and

70
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.574
then there's 11 letters in between.

71
00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:39.064
So throughout this course we'll kind of
refer to it as any of those three things.

72
00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:41.614
They're all the same thing,
just kind of an abbreviated way.
