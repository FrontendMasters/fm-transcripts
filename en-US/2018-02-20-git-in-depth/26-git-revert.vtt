&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Now,
Git Revert is the safe reset.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.620
What if you need to undo changes that
are shared, they're public, you push them?

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.410
Git Revert is going to create
a new commit that introduces

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.700
the opposite changes from
the specified commit.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.650
The original commit is going
to stay in the repository.

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.620
And revert does not change history.

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.550
So here, I'm picking a commit to undo.

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.720
And when I Git Revert it,
Git is going to create a new commit that

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.893
is the mirror opposite of
the one that you specified.
