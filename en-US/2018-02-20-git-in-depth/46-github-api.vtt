&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: One last section here,

2
00:00:02.075 --> 00:00:05.997
I wanted to do a quick demo
of using the GitHub API.

3
00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:11.330
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: The API is a restful
API, it's currently on Version 3,

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.920
it allows you to do a lot.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.260
It also comes in lots of flavors, so

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.330
if you wanted to use it in Ruby,
JavaScript, Python,

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.340
there are lots of different developer
libraries that are available at this URL.

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.480
I recommend checking it out.

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.630
When we make requests to this API,
if we do so unauthenticated,

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.030
they're rate limited, so
at about 60 requests per hour.

11
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.430
If you use a personal token, those are
useful for testing and personal projects.

12
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.470
Those requests are going to be
authenticated as the user who

13
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.230
owns the token or
you have the option of setting up OAuth.

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.960
When your application acts on behalf
of another user, for example,

15
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.780
then that user can login via OAuth,
the OAuth flow in your project.

16
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.270
You're able to create and
update via the API.

17
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.321
GitHub allows you to create issues,
pull requests,

18
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:11.753
new repositories, gists, all via the API.
