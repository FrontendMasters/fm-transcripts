00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:01.821
&gt;&gt; Nina: Before I introduce myself,

2
00:00:01.821 --> 00:00:05.549
I just want to go over the class
requirements really quickly.

3
00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.910
All right, you're gonna need a command
line that supports UNIX style commands.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.380
So Bash shell if you're on OSX,
on a Mac, or on Linux.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.624
You should be fine if you're on Windows.

6
00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.372
I haven't had a Windows
machine in about six years, so

7
00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:25.537
you might have to troubleshoot yourself.

8
00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:27.830
I might not be able to help you out.

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.970
You need Git version greater than 2.0.

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.230
So to check that, go to your terminal and
type git--version,

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.460
as long as you have a version greater
than 2.0, you should be good to go.

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.660
You need to sign up for a GitHub account.

13
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.870
So I hope that all of you
have already done that.

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.820
Next, you should clone
the class repository that has

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.114
these slides and
the exercise descriptions.

16
00:00:57.114 --> 00:01:04.914
So to do that, go to
git.io/advanced-git and pull that down.

17
00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:08.898
If you open the PDF locally
instead of browsing it in GitHub,

18
00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:13.054
you'll get a lot more features
like being able to select text.

19
00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:16.724
So I highly recommend you do that,
it will be very helpful.

20
00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:20.372
And then if you are on a Mac,
if you had the opportunity,

21
00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:24.880
I recommend installing Homebrew,
it's a package manager.

22
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.830
That we'll use to download some of
the tools that I show later in class.

23
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.090
You guys are all good on the requirements?

24
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
Everyone thumbs up?

25
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.609
Awesome.

26
00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.108
So for advanced Git,

27
00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:45.032
I'm going to assume that you have
some familiarity with git already.

28
00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:50.381
Meaning you know how to clone a project,
you know how to get a nit to

29
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:55.733
create a new project, you can check
out branches, you can add and

30
00:01:55.733 --> 00:02:00.740
remove files from a staging area,
and you can make a commit.

31
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.003
Those are only the prerequisites,
everything else will be explained today.

32
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:12.357
So Advanced Git, I'm Nina.

33
00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:15.805
I traveled here from Portland, Oregon and

34
00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:20.820
if you wanna find me on
the Internet I'm on Twitter at @nnja.

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.370
Or if you wanna email me at any point
after the class, if you have questions,

36
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.360
if you wanna get in touch you
can either DM me on twitter or

37
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.530
send me a personal email, and
I'll be happy to help you out.

38
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.630
So I have a bit of a confession to make.

39
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.370
I'm not a Frontend Master, gasp.

40
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.160
I'm a Full Staff Master.

41
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.000
I probably can't help with
the intricacies of CSS,

42
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.520
but I've been a developer for
ten years now.

43
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.510
I started my career working in C++ and
Java.

44
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.720
I did a little bit of JavaScript.

45
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.620
Lately for the past few years,
I've mostly been working in Python and

46
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.180
I've been using git for 6 plus years now.

47
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.180
I'm one of those people who has
suffered through SVN and CVS.

48
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.240
Does anyone else used
version control before Git?

49
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.885
Just Mark?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: CVS and SVN.

50
00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.517
[SOUND] Yeah,
what an awful experience, right?

51
00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:25.535
&gt;&gt; Nina: The best was Open Source with

52
00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:27.582
SVN.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes, SourceForge,

53
00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.070
right?
&gt;&gt; Nina: Well, no people would send you,

54
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.580
they would email you their diffs.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

55
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.890
&gt;&gt; Nina: Their SVN diffs

56
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.394
to try to contribute to your open
source project was terrible.
