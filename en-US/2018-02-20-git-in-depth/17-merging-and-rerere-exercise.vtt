&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's do an excercise
and check out Merging and Git ReReRe.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.313
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: David's asking is
there any dangers of using ReReRe?

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Git does a pretty good
job of matching conflict resolutions.

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.040
I personally perfer to turn
it on on a per project basis.

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.580
One of those things I don't
like having on globally,

6
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.040
I like knowing that it's on,
and it's not on by default.

7
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.230
If necessary, if something goes wrong,
if you mess up the resolution,

8
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.870
GIT allows you to delete those
saved resolutions, and try again.
