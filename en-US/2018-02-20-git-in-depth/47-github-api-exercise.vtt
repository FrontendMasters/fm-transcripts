&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: There's a take home
exercise here that shows you how to

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.790
make requests to
the GitHub API using curl,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.680
which is a UNIX command line tool for
making requests to a server.

4
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.241
And there is lots of bonuses.

5
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.831
So please check out
the take home exercise.

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:22.541
Build a cool little project
with the GitHub API.

7
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:26.101
And I'm sure you'll have
a lot of fun doing it.
