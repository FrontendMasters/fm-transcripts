00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.390
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: A little bit
more about GitHub social coding.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.365
How many of you, show of hands,
use GitHub day to day?

3
00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.530
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, about half.

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.630
For the rest of you, are your
repositories hosted on Enterprise,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.650
like GitHub Enterprise,
stored somewhere privately?

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.889
Cool.

7
00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:25.685
If you use GitHub everyday,
or even enterprise GitHub,

8
00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:33.170
you should really check out
the github.com list of shortcuts.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.050
And I'm gonna show you
a quick demo of this.

10
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.170
If i go to my advanced Git repository.

11
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.140
If I'm here and I hit the Shift+/ or
the question mark key on this page,

12
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.890
it's gonna show me this pop-up,
a.k.a the keyboard shortcuts.

13
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.040
There's site wide shortcuts
like go to your notifications,

14
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.550
move selections,
navigate within a repository.

15
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.280
But if you show all, itâ€™ll also show you
some shortcuts for source code browsing.

16
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820
One that I use all the time and

17
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.250
it seems like not a lot of people
know about this feature, is T.

18
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.070
What T does is it
activates the File Finder.

19
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.290
So, if I hit T here,
it's gonna open this new interface.

20
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.442
And I can just start typing and
it will narrow down

21
00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:38.644
filter
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And

22
00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:41.500
then you can hit Enter to select.

23
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.581
Very cool, will save you a lot of time.
