00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Here we set
up a very simple Travis demo.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.320
You created a fork, and set up Travis,

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.665
and ran those tests in your fork.

4
00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.600
And you should all have a green build on

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.865
Travis.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I highly encourage you

6
00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:29.130
to check out Travis further,
it's free for open source projects.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.860
It's free for your personal use,

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.090
your GitHub projects that are public,
so, check it out.

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.040
It'll make development a lot easier.

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.360
You can quickly know if your tests
are failing, I find it very useful.
