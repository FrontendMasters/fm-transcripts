00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.960
&gt;&gt; Nina: Finally,
the slide you've all been waiting for.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.500
It's the end.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.390
We're done.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.620
We have done a massive
whirlwind tour of git,

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.300
we've talked about how to
make your repository neat and

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.540
clean with rebase,
we've talked about best practices,

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.650
like not pushing change history
to shared repositories.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.320
We have learned how do you fix
our mistakes when we mess up.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.860
And I think at this point, after today,

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.350
you can truly consider
yourself a GIT master.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.230
So I am going to congratulate you on that,
but also feel slightly sorry for

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.650
you because now you are the person in the
office that everyone is going to come to

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.130
when they have GIT questions, so
thank you so much for your time.

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.400
This was Advanced GIT for
Frontend Masters.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.140
If you need to get in touch,
my Twitter handle is @nnja.

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.500
If you have questions,
you can email me personally.

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.660
I'll get back to you.

18
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.259
My email address is nina@nnja.io.

19
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.180
And a note for those of you in class
who participated today and online.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.050
There is some extra material in
the slides and a few extra exercises.

21
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.070
So if you'd like to,
you can go ahead and check those out.

22
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.230
I am going to end up posting a shorter
version of the slides after today.

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.458
Thank you all so much.
