00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.305
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Hopefully you all were
able to grab a fork of my repository,

2
00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:08.700
and update your remotes to point to it.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.581
We're gonna use this a little bit
later for a different exercise.

4
00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:18.779
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Before
our final wrap up,

5
00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.080
where we're gonna talk about
GitHub a little bit more.

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.020
I wanna reiterate the dangerous zone.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.680
So these are all the local destructive
operations that you might be able to take.

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.480
git checkout -- file, git reset -- hard.

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.970
In this case, if you do one of these
operations on files that have changes,

10
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.920
there's no path to recovery unless
you had a copy somewhere else.

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.590
I highly recommend stashing them.

12
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.740
If you're lucky and
you stash the changes, that's great.

13
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.070
But really for this reason,
remember to commit early and often.

14
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.902
It's a great.

15
00:00:56.902 --> 00:01:00.126
You can always clean up your local
history at any point in time.

16
00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:07.425
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Destructive operations
for a remote, rewriting history, rebase,

17
00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:09.230
amend, reset.

18
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.750
If you do any of these things,

19
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.210
don't ever run git push -f if
your code is hosted or shared.

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.130
Super important.
