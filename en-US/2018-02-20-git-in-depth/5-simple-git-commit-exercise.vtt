00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.500
&gt;&gt; Nina: Now we're gonna
work on an exercise.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.821
And before we get started
on this exercise,

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.616
i want you to follow that first link.

4
00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:11.381
In the case that you have
not set up your editor for

5
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:16.982
working with Git on the command line.
&gt;&gt; Nina: One of the biggest

6
00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:22.262
frustrations that I see for developers
when they're first working with Git,

7
00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:26.502
and why they sometimes hesitate
to use Git on the command line,

8
00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:30.040
is kind of the default configuration.

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.864
So git, you try to commit without -m,
and it opens a text editor.

10
00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:41.430
And by default, it might be vim or
something, you don't know how to close it.

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.437
Yeah, so the first thing we need to do,
go to that link, git.io/config-editor.

12
00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:54.095
And I'll give you guys a few minutes
to set up your Git editor to point

13
00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.160
to one that you actually use.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.145
It can be Sublime Text,
it can be VS Code, whatever tool you use,

15
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:09.394
it's important that you set that up.
&gt;&gt; Nina: Once you're

16
00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:14.457
done with that setup, go to the next link,
it's a markdown file with the exercise.

17
00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:18.942
And after you're done with that,
another frustration, for example,

18
00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:22.630
you type git log on the command line,
it opens a new window.

19
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.340
You might not know how to quit,
how to navigate it.

20
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.300
So that's called a pager, and
by default, it's set up to less.

21
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.136
It's a Unix command line tool
that helps you kind of quickly

22
00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:40.335
scroll through pages of information.

23
00:01:40.335 --> 00:01:43.958
When you're done with the exercise,
check out,

24
00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:49.497
I wrote a little cheat sheet for
using less, it's at git.io/use-less.

25
00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:53.306
Most importantly,
it tells you how to quit,

26
00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:58.428
spoiler alert, it's the Q key, yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a clarification,

27
00:01:58.428 --> 00:02:01.710
so head is just where you currently are.

28
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.977
So it's a pointer to the current
branch that you're on, right?

29
00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:07.197
&gt;&gt; Nina: The current branch,

30
00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:10.320
in some cases,
that could also be the current commit.

31
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.170
But we'll go through
that a little bit later.

32
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.783
Just wanna make sure my answer's complete.

33
00:02:18.783 --> 00:02:23.613
But if you're on a branch,
it points to the last commit in

34
00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:27.786
that branch.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

35
00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:33.244
when you clone,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Remote repository or

36
00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:35.574
whatever, git repo.

37
00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:41.014
The head, by default, points to where?
&gt;&gt; Nina: When

38
00:02:41.014 --> 00:02:47.235
you clone a remote repository,
it checks out the default branch,

39
00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:52.292
which in 99% of the cases is master, so.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like in GitHub,

40
00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:57.010
you can change it to something else,
like to development or something, right?

41
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.721
&gt;&gt; Nina: Right, yeah,

42
00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.153
you can kind of browse around.

43
00:02:59.153 --> 00:03:02.843
But that doesn't change any
of the values of the .git

44
00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:07.171
directory.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it git that stores that

45
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:13.373
default branch, or is it GitHub?
&gt;&gt; Nina: That I'm

46
00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:16.352
not sure about.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'd assume it's git, I'd

47
00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:19.803
assume it would be in the git repository.
&gt;&gt; Nina: Yeah, it's git,

48
00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:22.945
I wanna say it's possible to
change the default branch.

49
00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:28.740
For example, you can delete
the master branch, it's just a name.

50
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.440
But I'm not sure of the exact mechanism of
how git checks which one is the default.

51
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.500
But I can look into
that over the exercise.
