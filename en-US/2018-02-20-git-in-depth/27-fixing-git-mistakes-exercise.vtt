&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So summaries,
some common ways of undoing changes,

2
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:06.789
we can check out, reset, revert.

3
00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:12.342
Always revert for a shared repository,
don't change history.

4
00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:17.941
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If you
need to revert the revert, for

5
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.600
example, if you need to push that original
commit again, it's not gonna do anything.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200
That commit exists already in history.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.950
A good strategy is to
cherry peck your changes.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.200
And I'm gonna talk a little bit more
about how to do that in the next section.

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:40.568
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Now, time for
exercise six, how do we fix mistakes?
