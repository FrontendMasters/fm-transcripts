>> Mark Avensky: Hi, I'm Mark Avensky from FundaMasters.
>> Jen Kramer: Hi, I'm Jen Kramer from Harvard University Extension School.

And I have seen a lot of different places where they get tripped up along the way. So in this course, we're gonna be talking about a whole bunch of different things. We'll talk about the Internet and how the Internet works. We'll talk about domain names and web hosting, and clients, and servers.

[00:00:36]
We'll go on to talk about files and folders, and how to connect these things in web pages. How do we connect our HTML and our CSS, all kinds of things like that. We'll also talk about CodePen. And by the end of this course, you will have a really solid grounding of all of the technologies that are used to make a website.

[00:00:55]
How they all fit together, and you'll be ready to dive into learning how to program using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sound good, Mark?
>> Mark Avensky: Yeah, I hope you enjoy the course.
>> Jen Kramer: Thanks.
