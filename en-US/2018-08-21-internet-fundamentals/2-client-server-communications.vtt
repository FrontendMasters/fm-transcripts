00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.874
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer So let's dive a little
bit deeper into how the client and

2
00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:05.563
the server are going to
communicate with each other.

3
00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:10.718
This is actually a small slice of what the
Internet is, and how the Internet works.

4
00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:15.001
I'm going to leave out a ton of detail,
because you don't need to know

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.647
a whole lot of detail about
how these communications work.

6
00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:19.188
In fact,

7
00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:23.593
there are whole degree programs that
are based on communications like this.

8
00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:25.961
We're just gonna focus on just enough so

9
00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:30.632
that you have a fundamental understanding
of how this communciation happens so

10
00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:33.851
that you can work very
competently as a web developer.

11
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:36.163
So I showed you this image before,

12
00:00:36.163 --> 00:00:41.037
where we have a client over on
the left-hand side running a web browser.

13
00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:44.684
We have a server on the right-hand side,
that's the computer name.

14
00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:47.116
Along with the server software
that it's running and

15
00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:50.208
we have some kind of communications
that are happening in between.

16
00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:55.861
And so if we think about how we would talk
about the way that communication happens,

17
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.383
one of the famous discussion is
the Internet is a series of tubes and

18
00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:02.352
that there are full of cats.

19
00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:05.817
And this is somewhat accurate,
there definitely a lot of cats out

20
00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:09.353
there on the Internet, but
we can say a little bit more about this.

21
00:01:09.353 --> 00:01:14.724
If we think about water for example, water
is gonna come from somewhere, some lakes,

22
00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:19.653
some river, some stream, it's going to
go through a water refinement plan and

23
00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:21.583
it's gonna come to your home.

24
00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:25.879
We don't have specific molecules
that are targeted towards our home.

25
00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:30.221
We just turn on the water and
we manage to get some.

26
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:33.750
This model is actually not quite right for
the Internet.

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.265
Because if I'm asking for
a certain web page for my client,

28
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:41.992
I'm looking for a server that is going
to give me that particular information.

29
00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:47.613
This is actually more like
an envelope at the post office.

30
00:01:47.613 --> 00:01:50.585
Where there is a return address and
there's an address for

31
00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:52.535
some place that I'm trying to get to.

32
00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:57.468
In this case the address would be, let's
say the Google home page is where I'm

33
00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:02.117
trying to go, and the return address
would be the address of my computer.

34
00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:04.345
So where did those addresses come from?

35
00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:07.759
Well, they are called the IP address.

36
00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.167
And you probably have seen
something like this before,

37
00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:15.633
if you take a look here
we have a website URL,

38
00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:19.683
this is the website address for
Frontend Masters.

39
00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:24.468
And I was able to figure
out that the IP address for

40
00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:28.451
this is 52.39.142.164.

41
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:32.789
So that IP address actually very
accurately describes the Frontend Masters'

42
00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.667
website, but we humans have a very
hard time remembering a whole bunch

43
00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:37.933
of numbers like that.

44
00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:39.739
So the domain name helps us,

45
00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.493
something that's far more memborable
that we can type into our computer.

46
00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:49.035
And then our computers are smart enough
to match that domain name with our IP

47
00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:49.694
address.

48
00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:52.133
And I'll say more about
that in another video.

49
00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:56.137
If you're wondering how
to get the IP address,

50
00:02:56.137 --> 00:03:01.240
this second link here for
site 24 X7.com will allow you to

51
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.769
go look up the IP address of pretty
much any website that you want.

52
00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.056
And if you are wondering your IP address
is, you can go to whatismyip.com,

53
00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:16.032
and it will very happily tell
you what your IP address is.

54
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.603
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer Something else is gonna help
get on the Internet from your computer

55
00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:26.781
sitting in your home, you're going to
need an Internet Service Provider.

56
00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:31.691
The Internet Service Provider is designed
to have something that is going to

57
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.223
take the Internet from your computer,

58
00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:37.922
out of your house, and
out into the rest of the Internet.

59
00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:41.489
And so there's lots of different kinds
of Internet Service Providers out there.

60
00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.917
You've probably heard of Comcast or Cox,

61
00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:47.096
they are cable companies
that often provide Internet.

62
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:51.800
Or you may have Verizon or AT&amp;T,
maybe they're doing FIOS for you.

63
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.817
Or Verizon or AT&amp;T,
maybe they're your cellphone company.

64
00:03:55.817 --> 00:03:59.741
Your cellphone company obviously can
provide data, that's part of the Internet.

65
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.504
And maybe you have something else, like
satellite Internet, or dial-up Internet,

66
00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:04.803
or something else like that.

67
00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:09.682
All of these are all Internet access,
they all get to exactly the same Internet,

68
00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.291
they're just different
technologies that get you there.

69
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.520
Let me just clarify one
point on this though, so

70
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.870
the ISP is gonna provide the IP address
to the modem or the router in your house.

71
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.667
And so if you look at this picture here,

72
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.996
you probably have something similar
which look like this at your house.

73
00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:31.676
And so, your Internet Service Provider
will give you an IP address for that.

74
00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:35.875
Now, inside your house, you may have
a whole bunch of devices running.

75
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:39.448
You may have phones, and tablets,
and computers, and who knows,

76
00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:41.529
an Internet connected refrigerator.

77
00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.454
And what will happen here is that this
router will control more IP addresses for

78
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.997
within your house.

79
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:53.486
To the outside world, this may look
like all like one single IP address that

80
00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:58.202
we are sending request out into the world
and that they're coming back again.

81
00:04:58.202 --> 00:05:02.626
But then it's the router's job to say yes,
here's that Google home page,

82
00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:04.648
that's going to Jen's computer.

83
00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:07.248
Here's the Frontend Masters' page,
that's going to Mark's computer.

84
00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:11.568
And so that is what the router is
going to do there in your house.

85
00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:17.375
Okay, you may have also heard
of something called the cloud.

86
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:21.941
Well It sounds really cutting-edge and
amazing and fabulous, but

87
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:27.156
I have to tell you, it's really been
around and with us for quite a long time.

88
00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:31.878
If you happen to use Internet-based
email like Gmail or Yahoo or

89
00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:35.726
even some of the new like
Microsoft Outlook 365,

90
00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:38.795
you are actually doing cloud computing.

91
00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:41.616
The cloud is just a fancy
way of saying the Internet.

92
00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:45.967
And that's pretty much all you
need to know about the cloud,

93
00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:47.856
it's just the Internet.

94
00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:53.218
I also wanna say something
about HTTP versus HTTPS.

95
00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:55.781
As you go to your websites you may see,

96
00:05:55.781 --> 00:06:00.193
you start off your website address
that starts with http:// or

97
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:05.585
https://, and you may be wondering,
what's the difference is for those?

98
00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:11.024
So HTTP stands for the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol, which is a fancy way of saying,

99
00:06:11.024 --> 00:06:15.859
this is how we're going to communicate
between the client and the server.

100
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:19.755
This is the way we are going to
communicate with a certain protocol and

101
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.724
we are going to be changing
web pages back and forth.

102
00:06:22.724 --> 00:06:25.202
The S indicates that it is secure, but

103
00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:29.080
it is very important to be clear
about what the security is.

104
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.463
We often tell people to make sure that if
you are doing an e-commerce transaction

105
00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:36.567
to make sure that you see
the little padlock and the icon.

106
00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:39.145
This is related to HTTPS.

107
00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:42.885
But what HTTPS is actually doing
in this context is it's incrypting

108
00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:46.494
the transmission from the computer
that's here in front of you,

109
00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:50.387
out to the computer where you're
actually running the transaction.

110
00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:51.687
That's it.

111
00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:54.966
So in other words,
it's secure from your front door,

112
00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.042
to their front door essentially.

113
00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.792
When you actually get on the computer,
where the transaction is happening.

114
00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:03.521
That's a whole different
side of securities.

115
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:08.340
And so its possible that you could
send your credit card encrypted across

116
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.166
the Internet, via HTTPS.

117
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:12.003
And it could be received by a computer,

118
00:07:12.003 --> 00:07:15.753
which will display your credit card number
in plane text, for hackers to take.

119
00:07:15.753 --> 00:07:20.343
So HTTPS is secure but
only from the distance from your

120
00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:24.331
computer to the server
that it is contacting.

121
00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:28.138
It has nothing to do with the security
that is happening on the server itself.

122
00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:32.947
So here's some examples of that HTTP and
HTTPS.

123
00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:38.227
So if you went to HTTP,
you could get to my website.

124
00:07:38.227 --> 00:07:42.761
My website has got absolutely no ecommerce
on it, it's got no social security

125
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:46.624
numbers or health information,
there is nothing there to steal.

126
00:07:46.624 --> 00:07:50.892
And so I don't have any security
in terms of that communication

127
00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:52.512
associated with that.

128
00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:55.784
If you went to the Frontend Masters'
website, that's a very different story.

129
00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:59.924
You can buy a subscription
to the service there, and so

130
00:07:59.924 --> 00:08:04.157
therefore, it is protected
under the HTTPS protocol.

131
00:08:04.157 --> 00:08:08.547
And just as a sidenote, as you type
these addresses into your web browser,

132
00:08:08.547 --> 00:08:12.182
you can have other protocols
that you might be interested in.

133
00:08:12.182 --> 00:08:17.007
Almost all the time we're going to do
HTTP or HTTPS but you could, in fact,

134
00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:21.833
use FTP, which is the file transfer
protocol and the older protocol that is

135
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:25.611
just designed to send a file
from one computer to another.

136
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:29.462
And if you used a pattern that sort of
looks like this where you have a username

137
00:08:29.462 --> 00:08:32.182
and a password, and an at sign,
and a host and a port.

138
00:08:32.182 --> 00:08:34.209
Looks pretty complicated, but

139
00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:38.497
that would allow you to tranfer
files from one computer to another.

140
00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:44.318
So that's a very quicker reveiw
of cloud's server communcation,

141
00:08:44.318 --> 00:08:48.502
a little bit about IP addresses,
HTTP, HTTPS,

142
00:08:48.502 --> 00:08:55.358
just enough to get you started and have
appreciation for how the web is working.
