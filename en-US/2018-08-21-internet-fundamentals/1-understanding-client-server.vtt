00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.922
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So as a web developer,
you'll be building

2
00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:07.724
websites on the computer that's
sitting right there in front of you.

3
00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:08.982
When your website is done,

4
00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:12.222
you'll need to move it somewhere
where the world can actually see it.

5
00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:15.070
World can't see a website on the computer
that's there in front of you.

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.230
And so the first thing that we're going
to discuss is the concept of client and

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.691
server, because it plays right
into these particular issues.

8
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:25.450
So, first of all the term, the client.

9
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.870
We in technology love to
take the same word and

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.085
have it mean several different things
that have nothing to do with each other.

11
00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.283
You maybe thinking of a client
as your customer or someone for

12
00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:38.856
whom you're building a website,
but in fact, in this situation,

13
00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:42.328
the client is the computer that's
sitting there in front of you.

14
00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:45.173
It's gonna be running a web browser.

15
00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:48.021
You're probably familiar
with web browsers.

16
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.685
There are all kinds of them
that are out there and

17
00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:55.161
they are software that run on the client
that are designed to display web pages.

18
00:00:55.161 --> 00:01:01.316
If you are a PC person a pretty common
one is Edge or Internet Explorer.

19
00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:04.797
If you are Mac person you're
probably more familiar with Safari.

20
00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:09.270
But the ones that we like to use in web
development are Firefox and Chrome.

21
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.950
I'll talk more about them later.

22
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.128
There's many, many other choices for
browsers that are out there.

23
00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.645
Some run on phones,
some run on tablets, but

24
00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.441
that is what you need to
know at the moment, okay?

25
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:24.733
Client is the computer that sits in front
of you, it's running web browser software.

26
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.308
Now on the other end of things,
we have a server.

27
00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:32.039
And the server is where your
public website is going to live.

28
00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.684
Just like before, server is a word that
means two entirely different things.

29
00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:39.461
One thing that it means
is the hardware server.

30
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:43.789
That's the actual physical
computer that is going to run

31
00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.494
programs that are going
to make your website go.

32
00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.953
The other side is the software server.

33
00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:54.836
This is the actual software
that executes the commands to

34
00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:59.121
send files on out so
that your website can be seen.

35
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:03.565
One of the commonly used packages
used as website software for

36
00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:05.961
the server it's called Apache.

37
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:09.540
There are many other types
of software servers, but

38
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.210
Apache is one that you'll
very commonly encounter.

39
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.635
All right, so this is pretty much the way
that the Internet's gonna work for

40
00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:21.037
where we are right now,
just starting to build web pages.

41
00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:26.816
We have a computer, the one over here on
the left hand side that looks kind of like

42
00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:32.709
maybe a Mac LE or SE, and it's a machine
that is running some kind of web browser.

43
00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.009
It could be any of the web
browsers that are out there.

44
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.388
You're gonna open up that web browser and
you're gonna type in an address.

45
00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:42.333
That address is gonna go over
the Internet to the server.

46
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.788
The server receives that request and

47
00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:48.601
it's going to send that page
right on back to the client.

48
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.407
And that leads into a whole
another area to talk about,

49
00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:55.979
which is how that
communication process happens.
