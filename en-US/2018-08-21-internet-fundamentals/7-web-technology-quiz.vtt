00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:03.369
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so here we
are in question one, and it has to do with

2
00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:07.456
this diagram up here, on the top, which
I showed you a few times in the slides.

3
00:00:07.456 --> 00:00:09.711
We've just sorta labeled them A, B and C.

4
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:12.515
And so, A is what, and
it's running what software?

5
00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:16.227
Well the answer here, of course,
is going to be it's a client, and

6
00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:18.129
it's running browser software.

7
00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:21.700
You might have thought that it
was a client running Chrome.

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.000
That is correct also.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.019
But it's actually more correct to just
say it's a browser, because we don't for

10
00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.529
sure if they're running Chrome,
or Firefox, or Edge, or whatever.

11
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.657
It is indeed a computer, but
we were actually looking for

12
00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:39.571
the more specific name of the client
in this particular situation.

13
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:44.170
In this next question, letter C, the one
over there on the right, what is it and

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.346
what is it running?

15
00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:49.590
Well, the answer for
that is actually the one that looks wrong.

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.824
Letter C, it is a server and
it is running server software.

17
00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:56.863
It could be a web host potentially,
but we don't know that.

18
00:00:56.863 --> 00:01:00.510
Remember, web hosts
are commercial in nature.

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.368
And we don't really know anything
about this particular computer,

20
00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:08.104
it could be running server software or
it could be running Apache.

21
00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:12.330
And remember Apache is a very specific
kind of server software, we don't know for

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.933
sure if it's running Apache.

23
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:18.932
Just regular generic server software
is probably the better answer

24
00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:20.428
in that situation.

25
00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:22.144
And what is letter B here, in the diagram?

26
00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:25.330
Well, letter B is the Internet.

27
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.022
In all likelihood,
your ISP is involved in their somewhere.

28
00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.072
There are definitely some IP
addresses that are flying around.

29
00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:36.048
I wouldn't be surprised if there
were a few wires in there as well.

30
00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:40.805
But the Internet comprises all
of those particular things.

31
00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:44.837
Okay, the best browsers to use for
web development are, and

32
00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.744
that is Chrome and Firefox.

33
00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:50.716
Remember that Internet Explorer has been

34
00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:54.922
completely phased out
as of five years ago.

35
00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:58.470
That's really something we don't like
using in frontend web development.

36
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.445
And Edge and Safari are specific to
either the PC or to the Mac, and

37
00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:06.084
so we tend not to use those either.

38
00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.949
Chrome and
Firefox run on both PCs and Macs, and

39
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.325
they're very up to date with
the latest web standards.

40
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.394
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
we have a long list of stuff here.

41
00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:20.910
Which of these technologies
will run in a web browser?

42
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.091
Remember there is only three of them.

43
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:24.570
And which three am I looking for?

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.833
I'm looking for JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

45
00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:33.752
A lot of these things also will
execute just fine in a web browser.

46
00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:38.143
jQuery will, XML will,
Bootstrap will, Sass will.

47
00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:40.854
Well, Sass will run on the server anyway.

48
00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:45.885
GitHub is a service that's
over on a webserver somewhere.

49
00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:50.620
Java is a programming language, but
the three I'm really looking for

50
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.794
are JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

51
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.696
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So in a web browser,
what is CSS going to control?

52
00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:03.159
Well it controls color, it controls fonts,
and it controls layout, so

53
00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.588
the answer would be, D, all of these.

54
00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.625
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In a web browser,
what is JavaScript going to control?

55
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.196
Well, it's definitely going to control
changing the color of an element.

56
00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:18.946
It can change the position of an element,
but it's not going to label or

57
00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:21.520
identify all of the paragraphs
in the document.

58
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.560
So the answer here will be only A and B.

59
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.033
Remember, JavaScript is
the thing that's gonna change

60
00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.743
things inside of the web browser.

61
00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:37.033
The labeling and identifying all
paragraphs, that's actually HTML.

62
00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.924
And in the web browser,
what is HTML control?

63
00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:44.956
Well, obviously, labeling and
identifying all the paragraphs.

64
00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.479
Conveying the structure of
the document through tags.

65
00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.970
Yes, that is absolutely true as well.

66
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.349
Making text big and bold.

67
00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.559
No, that would be CSS.

68
00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:58.598
So the answer is e, only a and b.

69
00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:02.941
What's the difference between HTTP and
HTTPS?

70
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.096
Well, HTTP is certainly
not the secure one.

71
00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:10.604
HTTP is not necessarily faster than HTTPS.

72
00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:14.825
HTTPS is not gonna secure
the information on the server.

73
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:20.714
So the answer is b, HTTPS is gonna secure
the communications between the client and

74
00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:25.439
the server, has nothing to do with
security on the server itself.

75
00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.830
You can host your website
on your own computer.

76
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.719
Yes, you can.

77
00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:31.738
But should you?

78
00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:38.007
So true, but it's not advised,
use the web host.

79
00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:42.281
You can in fact run Apache on the computer
that's there in front of you.

80
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.179
A client can also be a webserver,
crazy but true,

81
00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:48.767
you usually think of these things
as two separate computers.

82
00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.727
But, in fact, it's really two
separate pieces of software.

83
00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:55.137
So you can run a browser and
Apache on the same computer.

84
00:04:55.137 --> 00:04:57.847
False, you don't have enough bandwidth.

85
00:04:57.847 --> 00:04:59.289
Well, that may be true also,

86
00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.531
you might be getting a lot of
traffic to your particular computer.

87
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:04.382
Your ISP may not be happy with you.

88
00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:07.665
But that's not really the answer
that we are looking for, here.

89
00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:08.869
I hope you did great on the quiz.

90
00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:13.581
If you didn't, feel free to go back and
review the earlier videos

91
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:17.880
before you move on to the next
part about files and folders.
