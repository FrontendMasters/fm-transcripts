00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There are a ton of useful
tools that you'll discover here at

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.941
Frontend Masters for building websites.

3
00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:09.770
But one of the most common tools that
are used all the time is this tool

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.389
here called CodePen.

5
00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.563
And this is at codepen.io.

6
00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:19.340
CodePen is a way of writing little
snips of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.194
seeing them demonstrate right here,
all in one Web browser screen, without

8
00:00:24.194 --> 00:00:29.271
having to worry about all the different
files, and folders, and structures and

9
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:33.408
so forth, that you otherwise would
have to do with Sublime Text.

10
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:38.098
It's really great for
demonstrating a little piece of code or

11
00:00:38.098 --> 00:00:39.820
testing out a theory.

12
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.483
That's what a lot of people
are using CodePen for.

13
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:46.988
So what I'd like for you to do is, I'd
like you to go on ahead and sign up for

14
00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:48.247
a CodePen account.

15
00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:52.322
Over here in the upper right hand corner,
just click on the Sign Up button.

16
00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:56.729
You can sign in with any of your social
media, or you can sign up with email.

17
00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.758
Go on ahead and sign up for an account.

18
00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:03.451
If you already have an account,
go on ahead and sign in.

19
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:05.391
So I'm gonna go ahead and log in to mine.

20
00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:18.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And in here,
this is going to give you some examples

21
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.985
of bits of code that
people have written here.

22
00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:28.038
And these are called pens,
that's what this pen thing is.

23
00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:30.747
These are all things you
are more than welcome to explore.

24
00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:33.259
But you can also create your own code pen.

25
00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.885
All you have to here is hit the Create
button, and then click New Pen.

26
00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:41.460
And this will give you a blank document,

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.640
where you can start to write you own HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

28
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.082
Now obviously, we're not there yet.

29
00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:49.328
We're not ready to start
writing our own code.

30
00:01:49.328 --> 00:01:55.793
But a lot of people will start in this
world by copying somebody else's code.

31
00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:58.314
This is a process called forking.

32
00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:02.237
And so we're gonna take somebody else's
code, and we're gonna make a fork.

33
00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:05.015
In other words, if we think
about it going along on a path,

34
00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:08.702
we're gonna take a copy of it over here,
fork it off that development path and

35
00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:10.198
do something different to it.

36
00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.780
So the forking is a good term to know.

37
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.475
So I'd like you to get some
practice with that also.

38
00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.819
What we're gonna do is open up
a new tab in your Web browser.

39
00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.431
And we're going to go to bit, bit.ly/fem,

40
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:27.989
as in Frontend Masters, example.

41
00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.525
All one word, femexample, and hit Return.

42
00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:37.646
And here is those particles again,
right here inside of CodePen.

43
00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:40.644
So I've gone ahead and
created this for you.

44
00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:44.653
If you wanted to take a copy of
what I did here with the particles,

45
00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:46.518
it would be pretty easy to do.

46
00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:49.724
All you need to do is up here on the top,
look for

47
00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:53.846
the button where it says Fork,
and go ahead and click that.

48
00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:58.291
And that will make a new copy of
this particular file just for you.

49
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.952
So now you can start
to make changes to it.

50
00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:03.565
So for example,
over here in the JavaScript,

51
00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:07.460
we could just start changing some
of these numbers that you see here.

52
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.404
If you scroll down here to,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Scroll

53
00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:16.875
down here to where it says size,
we're around line 40.

54
00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:20.962
And you'll see here that I have
a value of the size of 30.

55
00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:23.397
Just go ahead and change that number.

56
00:03:23.397 --> 00:03:28.849
If we changed it, say to 20, you'll
see that my little dots get smaller.

57
00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.331
If I changed it to 200,
they get to be a ridiculous size.

58
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:37.763
So this is a fun way to take a look at
code and make some changes to it, and

59
00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:38.976
see what happens.

60
00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:43.214
You can then save those changes
just by clicking the Save button.

61
00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:45.043
You can give this a new name if you wish.

62
00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:50.720
Over here on the side, click on the Edit
button and give this a new name.

63
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.190
My first fork, and then go on ahead and
click the Save button.

64
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.426
And now you'll have a copy of this all for
yourself.

65
00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:02.807
You can go ahead and
continue to make changes to it.

66
00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:04.670
Or you can make another fork off of it,
and

67
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.705
do something completely different with it.

68
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:11.689
So that's the whole purpose of CodePen,
to share little bits of HTML, CSS, and

69
00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.345
JavaScript, share it with other people.

70
00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:19.578
Take a fork from what other people
have done, where you can make

71
00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:25.426
your own changes to it, and then share
that with the rest of the world.
