00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.345
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now that we have a sense of
how the Internet is working, how clients

2
00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:10.921
and servers are communicating, how we get
things up and on to the Internet, and

3
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.910
domain names and all that wonderful stuff,
let's start looking at a little bit closer

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.700
detail about the computer that's
sitting there in front of you.

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.286
Every computing device out there
consists of files and folders.

6
00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:26.588
Every single one of them.

7
00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:29.104
It doesn't matter what they are.

8
00:00:29.104 --> 00:00:33.109
Whether it is a computer,
a game console, a tablet, a phone,

9
00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.828
there is always a structure of files and
folders in place.

10
00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:41.298
Now, sometimes you need to download an app
in order to see those files and folders.

11
00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:45.522
That's particularly true if you happen
to work some kinds of phones or

12
00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:46.888
some kind of tablets.

13
00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:51.404
Pretty much for your computers, there's
always an interface that's available for

14
00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:53.294
you to see those files and folders.

15
00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:55.952
So let's take a closer look at files and
folders,

16
00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.813
because they actually come
from the physical world.

17
00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:04.142
They've been around for hundreds of years,
and so let's make sure we understand what

18
00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:09.041
they are in the physical world before we
go on to looking at them on our computer.

19
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:12.482
So we have lots of stuff.

20
00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:14.506
This is a file.

21
00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:18.545
It happens to be a list of
pieces of music, I think.

22
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.773
This is also a file.

23
00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:24.028
It is in fact, a piece of music.

24
00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:25.007
Here is another file.

25
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:26.124
It's a brochure.

26
00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:28.829
This is for direct term life insurance.

27
00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.328
Okay, has several pages to it,
but it's also a file.

28
00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:33.733
Here's a catalog.

29
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.366
Catalog's got tons of stuff in it.

30
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.033
This is, of course, women's' clothing.

31
00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.241
It came straight out of my recycle bin.

32
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.484
That is also a file.

33
00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:46.864
So files are all just pieces of
information that we can, in the physical

34
00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:51.463
world, that we can take them, we can
read them, we can page through them,

35
00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:55.632
we can recycle them, we can burn them,
we can mail them to a friend.

36
00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.062
We can do all kids of things with files.

37
00:01:58.062 --> 00:02:00.506
We also have folders.

38
00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:03.997
Folders have always been
a way of organizing files.

39
00:02:03.997 --> 00:02:07.791
And so, I can take my folder and
I can put stuff inside of it.

40
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:11.511
So here's a thing in my folder,
here's another thing in my folder.

41
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:16.469
So that's the whole purpose of a folder,
just to group things together, and

42
00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.695
that's all that it's there for.

43
00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:23.504
My file system may make no sense to you
whatsoever, and that's totally okay, too.

44
00:02:23.504 --> 00:02:26.094
Because I'm the one
using my file system and

45
00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:29.319
it needs to be organized in
a way that I can find things.

46
00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.812
I don't have to have a file system.

47
00:02:30.812 --> 00:02:33.513
I could have piles of
papers all over my house.

48
00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:37.298
I could have cabinets and
drawers full of junk.

49
00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:39.807
But I probably have a very
hard time finding anything.

50
00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:43.945
So having folders are a very useful for
that purpose.

51
00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:49.958
We can also have folders inside of folders
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

52
00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.269
we can take one folder.

53
00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.420
We can put another folder inside of it.

54
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.110
We can also add a few files.

55
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.256
So not everything has to be
together inside of that folder.

56
00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:06.597
We can have a few files in
a folder all inside of a folder,

57
00:03:06.597 --> 00:03:08.954
and maybe that goes in my hanging file.

58
00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.343
And now, I can find things there.

59
00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:13.450
Maybe I've organized them by year or
something like that.

60
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.280
So this is files and
folders in the real world.

61
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.988
You probably already knew
exactly how all of this worked.

62
00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:24.899
The point is, your computer files and
folders really aren't any different.

63
00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:29.093
So let's talk a little bit more about
files that live on your computer.

64
00:03:29.093 --> 00:03:32.590
So there's tons and
types of files that re out there.

65
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.597
Music files, video files, databases,
images, documents, programs.

66
00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:39.665
There's all kinds of wonderful
stuff that's out there.

67
00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:42.607
Very importantly,
files have lots of characteristics.

68
00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:43.593
They can be created.

69
00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:47.740
They can be opened, saved,
renamed, printed, e-mailed, and

70
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.154
modified in some way.

71
00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:52.204
So you can do all kinds
of things with files.

72
00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:57.249
They typically have an extension of
three to four characters after a dot.

73
00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.222
You may not necessarily have your
computer configured that way yet.

74
00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:02.818
I'll show you how to do
that in a separate video.

75
00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:07.351
And most importantly, files are going
to take up room on your hard drive.

76
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:12.115
So every time you add more music to your
hard drive or add more pictures from your

77
00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:16.025
camera or wherever else,
that takes up room on your hard drive.

78
00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:19.589
And eventually, you run out of room and
have to move things somewhere else.

79
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.497
Folders, there's only one kind,
it's just a folder.

80
00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.718
We have folders inside of folders.

81
00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:32.108
And folders only do one thing, they hold
more files or they hold more folders.

82
00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:34.435
That is it, that is all folders do.

83
00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:37.460
They can be created, they can be moved,
they can be renamed, and

84
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.454
they can be deleted.

85
00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:40.887
So in other words,
we're never editing a folder.

86
00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:43.424
We're never programming
it to do something.

87
00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:45.416
All folders do is hold stuff.

88
00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.841
That's it.

89
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.798
You have to open them
within the file system.

90
00:04:48.798 --> 00:04:51.145
You never open them like a program or
a document.

91
00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:54.892
If you think about opening a Word
document, you double-click on something,

92
00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:56.834
it opens up, you can make changes to it.

93
00:04:56.834 --> 00:05:01.119
But if you open a file,
you're in your open dialog box, or

94
00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:03.572
you're in your save dialog box.

95
00:05:03.572 --> 00:05:07.409
So folders are really just there for
your convenience, and

96
00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.103
they should be organized in
a way that makes sense to you.

97
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:14.286
In other words, you don't have to have
any folders anywhere on your computer,

98
00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:15.198
if you don't want to.

99
00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:17.285
And I've seen computers
organized that way.

100
00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.041
It's terrible, you can't find anything.

101
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:23.526
But typically these days,
your phone, your tablet,

102
00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:26.948
your computer,
actually have a file system for you.

103
00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:29.124
You may not even be aware of it.

104
00:05:29.124 --> 00:05:33.755
You're gonna take those pictures right off
your phone, you're gonna download them,

105
00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:35.332
they go to quote, my photos.

106
00:05:35.332 --> 00:05:38.917
That happens to be a folder that's
somewhere in your computer that contains

107
00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:39.765
all your photos.

108
00:05:39.765 --> 00:05:44.581
And you may already make folders inside
of it for a certain vacation trip or

109
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:46.220
certain period of time.

110
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.574
So that's a little bit about files and
folders.

111
00:05:49.574 --> 00:05:53.052
Those are the same whether you
are talking about a Mac or a PC.

112
00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:57.341
And so, for the next videos, you should
take a look at the ones that are relevant

113
00:05:57.341 --> 00:06:00.236
to the computer that you
are going to be working with.

114
00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:02.635
If you're gonna be using a PC,
look at those videos.

115
00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:05.257
If you're gonna be using a Mac,
look at those videos.

116
00:06:05.257 --> 00:06:08.114
And you can skip the other
operating systems videos.
