WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.739
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
you got that last website done.

2
00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.498
And in that particular website we
had a relatively simple structure.

3
00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.664
We had a folder for CSS, a folder for
images, a folder for JavaScript,

4
00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.872
and some HTML files that were
located outside of that.

5
00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:19.504
But what happens if we have another
folder in our file structure that

6
00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:21.386
contains more HTML files?

7
00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:25.957
We have to go back and link to some of
those other resources once again, and

8
00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:30.930
the coding changes just a little bit, so
I wanted to walk through that with you.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.797
Still in the demo folder, if you go into
the folder inside of the demo folder

10
00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:41.300
called advanced, you'll see here that we
have a web page called challenge.html.

11
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.318
And if we take a quick peak and
look at that in our

12
00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:51.833
web browser,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You'll see it looks

13
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:57.223
very similar to the other
pages that we just built.

14
00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:01.916
There, you'll see here that
this is an extra credit

15
00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:06.831
page because this is just
a little bit more difficult.

16
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:11.579
So we're gonna do exactly the same
kinda things that we did before in

17
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.495
the last video with our pie web pages, but

18
00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:18.936
in this case, we have to think
extra hard about our file paths.

19
00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:21.250
All right, so here's what's gonna happen.

20
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.985
We'll start up here at the top
with our link to our stylesheet.

21
00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:32.966
Now in the last video all we had
to do was say css/style.css,

22
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:36.877
but in this case from challenge.html,

23
00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:41.362
we now have to leave
the advanced folder go into

24
00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:46.441
the CSS folder to get to
our file called style.css.

25
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.486
So how do we go about coding that?

26
00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:56.303
Well, previously,
we'd simply done css/style.css,

27
00:01:56.303 --> 00:02:01.067
but now, what we need to
do to indicate to go up and

28
00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:05.862
out of a folder,
we need to do ../ in front it.

29
00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:10.728
So this ../ indicates we're
gonna leave the advanced folder.

30
00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:15.260
So that's gonna put us at the same
level as about contact and index.

31
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.608
Then we'll go into the CSS folder, and

32
00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:22.877
then we'll go get
the style.css file all right.

33
00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:28.728
So if you have coded that correctly, two
dots and a slash in front of the CSS and

34
00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:34.958
you saved that and you refreshed the web
page it should start look familiar again.

35
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.355
You should see that change in
the navigation bar and change in the font.

36
00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:40.843
Okay, moving on here.

37
00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:48.441
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Once again, down here for
About, Home, and Contact, we need to link

38
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:53.898
back to the files that are, once again,
outside of the advanced folder.

39
00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:57.917
So we're gonna get rid of that #, and

40
00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:01.820
it's gonna be ../index.html.

41
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.376
In other words, once again,
leave the advanced folder and

42
00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:10.485
then we're at the right
level to get to index.html.

43
00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:12.728
So we don't need to put it in
any other folders in there.

44
00:03:15.268 --> 00:03:19.056
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Same for
the about page, ../about.html.

45
00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:24.137
Notice too that VS code is helping me,
when I put in that ../

46
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:28.942
it helps me find possible files
that I might wanna link to.

47
00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:33.420
So that VS code is helping you
make sure these paths are correct.

48
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.994
So I wanna go to contact.html.

49
00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:39.943
I'm gonna put out my word wrap again and

50
00:03:39.943 --> 00:03:45.458
I'm gonna go to View &gt;Toggle Wordwrap,
there we go.

51
00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:52.371
Then we've got another image down here, so
we'll go ahead and get rid of our comment.

52
00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:56.544
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so once again,

53
00:03:56.544 --> 00:04:01.290
we're gonna have to go ../
into our images folder.

54
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.175
And then we'll get the gone-pie.peg,
the pie is all gone.

55
00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:09.802
And then finally down
here at the bottom for

56
00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:14.542
our JavaScript ../javascriptparticles.js,
and

57
00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:17.678
go on ahead and save that once again.

58
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:21.705
So now if you refresh your web page,
make sure you save first,

59
00:04:21.705 --> 00:04:25.888
you should wind up seeing a page
that looks somewhat familiar and

60
00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:28.770
somewhat similar to all
of the other pages.

61
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.920
Notice that your navigation links
are back to being purple again,

62
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.126
because we've visited all of those
pages before, and by default,

63
00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:38.632
links are blue when they're unvisited,
purple when they're visited.

64
00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:42.271
That's just the way
the browsers do things, and so

65
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:46.331
we can go back in those About,
Home, and Contact links,

66
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:51.979
those are all still working,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which is great.

67
00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:59.144
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we have to sort of go
back, keep clicking back to the challenge

68
00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:02.617
page here because if we
just go say to Contact,

69
00:05:02.617 --> 00:05:05.749
and then we test the About link from here.

70
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:10.430
We're testing the about link on
the contact page not the about link on

71
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.891
the challenge page.

72
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.651
All right, so hopefully your web
page looks something like that.

73
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:19.745
Just for future reference these dots and

74
00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:23.385
slashes can go on forever if we had two or
three or

75
00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:29.039
four levels of navigation we had to go
back to find the file that we wanted.

76
00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.124
You can just stack these
things on top of each other.

77
00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:37.581
So dot dot slash, dot dot slash,
dot dot dot dot slash, dot dot slash.

78
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:41.859
It could go on forever, and you can
see here I'm going through the various

79
00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:45.390
files and folders that make up
my computer now at this point.

80
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.729
But you can have a long series of those
dot dot slashes that will indicate you

81
00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.836
go up many many levels in your
navigation in order to access something.

82
00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:58.593
Not necessary in this particular case, but

83
00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:03.372
that is something that you might encounter
in your world as a web developer.
