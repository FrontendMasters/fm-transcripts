00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:05.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
this video is just for PC people.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.050
There's another version of this video for
just Mac people.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.907
At this point,
we have downloaded Sublime Text, and

4
00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:16.260
we've configured it with
a bunch of plugins.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.858
We know about files and folders.

6
00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:22.848
We are finally ready to actually start
working with a few files and folders and

7
00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:25.857
starting to see a little
bit of code in action.

8
00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:28.842
So that's what I'd like
to do in this video.

9
00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:33.557
First thing I'd like to do is talk
about the standard folder structure for

10
00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:34.936
a given web project.

11
00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:38.680
So typically, when you start a web
project, you're going to make a folder.

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.140
Inside of that folder is gonna
be your entire web project.

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.457
And likely, there's a bunch of files and
folders inside of there.

14
00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:47.386
There could be all kinds
of different structures.

15
00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:49.336
As I said before, folders,

16
00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:54.313
the whole purpose of them is to organize
things to make them easy to find.

17
00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.203
However, we do develop
conventions in certain fields.

18
00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:01.034
And this is a convention that
you'll find in web development.

19
00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:04.691
So very typically, the way that
our folders are configured for

20
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:09.038
a basic web project, like the ones
we'll be building, is just like this.

21
00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:12.564
We start with one main folder for
the website.

22
00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:16.037
Inside of that, we're going to
put a folder called CSS, and

23
00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:18.091
we're gonna put CSS files in that.

24
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:23.020
We'll make another folder called img,
or images, for image files.

25
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.458
And we'll make another folder called js,
or JavaScript, for JavaScript files.

26
00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:32.500
Any HTML files that we generate are just
gonna go inside the main folder.

27
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.964
So I'd like to show this for
you in action.

28
00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:39.429
We’re gonna go back to our desktop,
and we’re gonna go ahead and

29
00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.329
start the folder structure for
a typical web project.

30
00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.893
So what I am going to do here on
my desktop is simply right-click,

31
00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:54.443
and I’m going to choose New &gt; Folder.

32
00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:56.180
And so that'll give me a new folder.

33
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.506
I can call it whatever I want.

34
00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:02.425
And I'm just gonna to call
this one demonstration.

35
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:12.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And in fact,
I'm gonna call this demo-finish.

36
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.069
I'm gonna to call this folder demo-finish
because we actually have a starting

37
00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.774
state for this demo as well.

38
00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:25.144
So that’s my folder there on my
desktop for my website, demo-finish.

39
00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:28.509
I’m now going to double-click
on demo-finish to open this up,

40
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.698
it'll show me what’s inside the folder,
which is nothing.

41
00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:33.884
That's as expected,
because I just created it.

42
00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:38.521
Inside of this folder, we’ll go ahead and
add some additional folders.

43
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:45.649
So, once again, we can right-click in
here and say, once again, New &gt; Folder.

44
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.278
And I'm going to make
my folder called css.

45
00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:51.914
Make sure it's all lower case.

46
00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:53.281
The upper case and

47
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:58.393
lower case letters do matter in
terms of file naming conventions.

48
00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:01.084
And it's just easier to remember if
everything is done in lower case.

49
00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:03.443
So lower case css.

50
00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:09.023
Then we'll ahead and right-click again,
we'll make another folder,

51
00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:15.761
and we're gonna call this one,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: img, for images.

52
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:21.983
And then finally, one more time,
we'll right-click again, new folder.

53
00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:26.219
And this one is gonna be called JS,
for JavaScript, okay?

54
00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.232
So we now have the folder structure for
a new web project.

55
00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:34.270
Let's see what happens if we
actually put some files into these.

56
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.014
So to get started with that,
in your Start menu here, look for

57
00:03:38.014 --> 00:03:40.759
a web browser that you
might have installed.

58
00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:46.073
Hopefully, you've installed by
this point Chrome or Firefox.

59
00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:50.537
I can walk you through how to do that, but
if you just do a Google search for Chrome,

60
00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:55.072
Firefox, you will find links where you
can download and install the application,

61
00:03:55.072 --> 00:03:59.263
just the same way we did with Sublime
Text, a very simple sort of procedure.

62
00:03:59.263 --> 00:04:01.324
So we're gonna go ahead and

63
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:05.451
click on Chrome here because
I have Chrome installed.

64
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:09.722
So we're gonna enter URL here,
it's where all the files and

65
00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:14.007
folders are gonna be located for
materials for this course.

66
00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:21.661
And that address is,
bit.ly/internetfundamentals, all one word.

67
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.130
Go ahead and go there.

68
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.010
And that will go ahead and download for

69
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.612
you right here at the bottom
of your browser window.

70
00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:33.400
Now just going ahead and
in the little arrow next to the file name,

71
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.723
go ahead and choose Open.

72
00:04:35.723 --> 00:04:41.910
And you'll see that there is a file in
here called Web Tools and Infrastructure.

73
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.850
Just go ahead and
drag that to your Desktop,

74
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.275
it'll take just a second to go ahead and
download.

75
00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.788
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then inside of
the folder called Web Tools and

76
00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:57.015
Infrastructure, you're going to look for
the starting website folder.

77
00:04:57.015 --> 00:05:00.303
Go ahead and drag that to the desktop.

78
00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:04.037
Now, if we go ahead and
open up the starting website folder,

79
00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:07.345
you'll see that I have in
here a whole bunch of files.

80
00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:12.128
There are some javascript files,
some jpeg files, some pngs,

81
00:05:12.128 --> 00:05:14.976
those are images, HTML and so forth.

82
00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:19.415
And what we're going to do with these
is we're gonna put these in the right

83
00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:22.502
places inside of the folders
that we just created.

84
00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:27.666
So let's go over the types of files that
we would be typically put in the img,

85
00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:29.695
the css, and the js folders.

86
00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.752
So I've described those here.

87
00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:37.380
Anything that ends in .htm or .html,
that's going to go into the main folder.

88
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.583
In this case,
our folder called demo-finish.

89
00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:45.993
Any CSS files end in .css,
those go in the CSS folder.

90
00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:49.150
Any JavaScript files end in .js.

91
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.381
And they go into the JavaScript folder.

92
00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:54.603
Any of the images are going
to the img folder.

93
00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:58.683
Now it's important to note that there
are certain image types that are supported

94
00:05:58.683 --> 00:05:59.286
by the web.

95
00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:02.795
And in this case, they have to be JPG,

96
00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:08.512
which is a great format for
photography, GIFs and PNG files.

97
00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:12.153
And GIFs and PNG files are typically
more used for illustrations.

98
00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:16.675
File types like TIFs, BIT MAPs,
EPS, Adobe Illustrator or

99
00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:22.617
Photoshop native files, anything like
that is not supported by a web browser,

100
00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:25.381
so you can't use those on a website.

101
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:29.935
The only choices that you have for
your images are GIF, JPEG and PNG.

102
00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:35.782
So, now that you know that,
let's go ahead and try out this exercise.

103
00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:40.902
So I've opened a window here of my
files for the starting website.

104
00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:47.519
And next to it, I'm going to go ahead and
open up my demo-finish folder.

105
00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:52.217
Now what I'd like for you to do is to
look at the names of these files and

106
00:06:52.217 --> 00:06:54.735
drag them into the correct folders.

107
00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:57.099
Go on ahead and pause the video.

108
00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.739
And give this a try, and I'm gonna
tell you the answers in just a second.

109
00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:04.485
Okay, so now that you've given that a try,
let's start with css,

110
00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:07.260
since it's the first
thing that's listed here.

111
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.269
If you double-click on the css folder
to open it up, you'll see over

112
00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:15.920
here in our starting-website folders
we have a file here called styles.css.

113
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.868
All we need to do is just click and
drag that on over into our css file.

114
00:07:20.868 --> 00:07:23.711
To go back to demo-finish,
just up here in the top bar,

115
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.776
you can click on the name demo-finish.

116
00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:29.399
That will put us back to the screen.

117
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.529
Next, let's go ahead and work on our
images, so double-click on the img folder.

118
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:37.601
Over here on the left-hand side,
in the starting-website folder,

119
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:39.056
we have a bunch of stuff.

120
00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:43.802
So we've got the cherryalamode.jpeg,
click and drag that on over.

121
00:07:43.802 --> 00:07:45.752
And we've got clouds.png.

122
00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:49.197
Click and drag that on over.

123
00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:51.266
We have something called logo.png.

124
00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:54.568
Go ahead and
drag that over as well, great!

125
00:07:54.568 --> 00:07:57.218
So now we have our images
in the img folder.

126
00:07:57.218 --> 00:07:59.563
Go back to demo-finish, again.

127
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:03.116
And then we have a folder here called js.

128
00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.602
And that will be our JavaScript.

129
00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:08.851
So go ahead and open that up,
click on accordion.js.

130
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:10.238
Click and drag that over.

131
00:08:10.238 --> 00:08:12.451
And that is in place.

132
00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:16.873
So going back to the demo-finish folder,
what's missing?

133
00:08:16.873 --> 00:08:18.558
We don't have HTML.

134
00:08:18.558 --> 00:08:22.640
So, typically,
there is not an html folder in place.

135
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.406
The HTML files are gonna go right
directly in the same place as the CSS,

136
00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:31.655
the image and the JavaScript folders.

137
00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:38.682
So just going ahead and choose index.html.

138
00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:43.093
And simply drag that on over
to the demo-finish folder.

139
00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:45.594
You'll have one file remaining.

140
00:08:45.594 --> 00:08:48.812
It's this one here, this .DS_Store folder.

141
00:08:48.812 --> 00:08:52.717
As a PC person, this is something you're
gonna run into fairly frequently.

142
00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:57.617
If you are getting files from someone who
created them on a Macintosh, which is what

143
00:08:57.617 --> 00:09:02.810
I did, you will typically find these files
called .DS_Store that are here on your PC.

144
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.142
You can safely ignore these.

145
00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:07.666
These are of no benefit
to a PC whatsoever.

146
00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:09.310
And Mac people never see this file.

147
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:13.965
So as a PC person, just get used to
occasionally you run into a .DS_store,

148
00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:18.871
you can just ignore that and it doesn't
make any difference to you whatsoever.

149
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.032
So we're done with
the starting-website folder.

150
00:09:21.032 --> 00:09:24.685
We've now loaded up the demo-finish
folder with a bunch of stuff.

151
00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:27.154
Let's see what it looks
like in the next video.
