00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:06.847
&gt;&gt; Mark Avensky: Hi,
I'm Mark Avensky from FundaMasters.

2
00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:10.122
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hi, I'm Jen Kramer from
Harvard University Extension School.

3
00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.574
&gt;&gt; Mark Avensky: And
we created this fundamentals course so

4
00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:16.262
that you have the tools you need
to start learning programming.

5
00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:19.248
And Jen has a ton of
experience doing this.

6
00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.141
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I have been
teaching beginners for 18 years.

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.893
And I have seen a lot of different places
where they get tripped up along the way.

8
00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.229
So in this course, we're gonna be talking
about a whole bunch of different things.

9
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.308
We'll talk about the Internet and
how the Internet works.

10
00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:36.216
We'll talk about domain names and
web hosting, and clients, and servers.

11
00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:38.972
We'll go on to talk about files and
folders, and

12
00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.334
how to connect these things in web pages.

13
00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:45.793
How do we connect our HTML and our CSS,
all kinds of things like that.

14
00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:47.590
We'll also talk about CodePen.

15
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.334
And by the end of this course,
you will have a really solid

16
00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:55.870
grounding of all of the technologies
that are used to make a website.

17
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.696
How they all fit together, and you'll
be ready to dive into learning how to

18
00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:03.619
program using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

19
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:04.590
Sound good, Mark?

20
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.927
&gt;&gt; Mark Avensky: Yeah,
I hope you enjoy the course.

21
00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:07.427
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Thanks.
