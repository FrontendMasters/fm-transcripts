00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.332
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing we're gonna
take a look at is this product called

2
00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:08.185
CodePen, which you can find
at codepen.io on the web.

3
00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:12.880
And as it says here, this is
an environment where we can post our work,

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.224
we can post our HTML,
our CSS and our JavaScript,

5
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.550
we can share it with other people.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.552
We can get new ideas of how to code
things or show people our own work.

7
00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:25.352
It's a really great tool and

8
00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:30.529
you'll find it you'll be using it a lot
as you work as a front-end web developer.

9
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.039
So I wanted to show you how
we can move code in and

10
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.279
out of CodePen over these next two videos.

11
00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:42.121
So you have a sense of how easy
it is to work with CodePen.

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.911
If you want you can create an account for
CodePen,

13
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.241
just go over to the Signup button and
create an account as you normally would.

14
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.882
If you already have one you can go
ahead and log in, but you can complete

15
00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:58.775
this exercise without having any of
that login if you don't wanna use it.

16
00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:02.480
So I'm going to start
here from codepen.io,

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.371
I'm going to click on the create button
and I'm going to click on New Pen.

18
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:13.469
And this is going to give me a screen and
you'll see that I have three boxes.

19
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.514
I have an HTML box, I have a CSS,
and I have a JavaScript box.

20
00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:22.651
And I can put code in all of
three of these boxes, and

21
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:28.442
down here on the bottom it will show
me what the web page is looking like.

22
00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:31.685
So let's go ahead and give this a try.

23
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:36.080
If you hop back in to VS code
here we're going to go in to

24
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.520
the folder called codepen-challenge.

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.696
And we'll start by going into index.html.

26
00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:48.512
And you'll see here that we have
a whole bunch of code here for

27
00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:50.689
this particular webpage.

28
00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.687
So what we're going to do is
we're gonna copy, not all, but

29
00:01:55.687 --> 00:01:59.905
some of this HTML into
the CodePen documentation.

30
00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:02.747
So we don't need to copy the whole thing,

31
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.839
we'll actually right
here after the body tags.

32
00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:09.358
So right here where it starts
with a header on line nine.

33
00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:14.862
And we're gonna go all
the way down here to line 34.

34
00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:16.455
So what have I left out?

35
00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:21.374
I've left out all of the stuff at the top
that defines this as an HTML document, and

36
00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.098
links us to the style sheet.

37
00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:26.424
You don't need any of that,
those first eight lines of code.

38
00:02:26.424 --> 00:02:31.459
And then down here at the bottom,
these last three lines of code

39
00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.552
are basically linking us to JavaScript and
finishing up the HTML document.

40
00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:41.298
You don't need those lines either, so

41
00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:46.527
just lines 9 to 34 and
we'll go ahead and copy that.

42
00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:49.694
And then copy.

43
00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:53.320
And then we'll go to our
HTML window over here.

44
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.761
Just go ahead and
click inside of it and hit Paste.

45
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:01.223
So just Ctrl+V or Cmd+V.

46
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:05.507
And that will show you,
you can move these windows around,

47
00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:08.684
you can see that this
the start of a web page.

48
00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:12.391
And you'll probably notice that
there's a lot of stuff missing.

49
00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:15.450
We have some buttons here,
we have some pictures but

50
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.474
our text doesn't look very good.

51
00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:20.176
What was the problem here again?

52
00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.202
Right, no CSS.

53
00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:26.604
So let's go ahead and
add some CSS to that.

54
00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:30.719
We go back to our vs code.

55
00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:35.921
We're gonna go into our css folder and
look at styles.css.

56
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:38.849
You can go ahead and
copy this whole entire thing.

57
00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.053
So Ctrl or Cmd+A to select it all,
Ctrl or Cmd+C to copy it.

58
00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:53.039
And then simply just paste all of that
styling right here into your CSS window.

59
00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.370
And you can see instantly, our webpage
is looking a zillion times better.

60
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.358
Look at that.

61
00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:03.826
But unfortunately, these are accordion
panels and when I click on them,

62
00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:04.988
nothing happens.

63
00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:08.016
And so what's the problem when
we have a situation like that?

64
00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:10.771
I'm clicking on something and
nothing happens,

65
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.205
it's often a problem with the JavaScript.

66
00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:16.548
So now we can go ahead and
copy in our JavaScript.

67
00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:23.618
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Once again,
here in our codepen-challenge folder,

68
00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:26.849
go into the folder Look at accordion.js.

69
00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:33.221
We'll go ahead and copy all of that stuff,
just highlight it all and copy it.

70
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:38.764
And then here in our JavaScript window,
we can go ahead and paste that in place.

71
00:04:38.764 --> 00:04:43.647
So you'll see the little web page
down there in the bottom refreshes,

72
00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:47.252
and then you should be
able to click on those.

73
00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:53.110
accordion panels and
see the text that's hiding inside of them.

74
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.177
Pretty cool.

75
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:58.884
So its very simple to take a website
that you've already put together on

76
00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:02.962
your own local computer and
you can put it up here on CodePen and

77
00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:05.725
share it with the world if you'd like to.

78
00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:09.631
Now you can now give that code
pen a name up here on the top.

79
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:12.818
If you're logged in you
can save this CodePen.

80
00:05:12.818 --> 00:05:17.821
If you click the Save button,
it's probably

81
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:22.832
gonna prompt me to log in or
not, there we go.

82
00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:26.722
So it'll ask if you haven't signed up
already, you can go ahead and sign up.

83
00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:29.829
If you are signed up as I am
you can go ahead and log in.

84
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.835
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then you'll have
an option up here at the top of the page

85
00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:43.809
where you can change
the name of your CodePen.

86
00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.583
My First CodePen.

87
00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:50.673
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can go ahead and
save things.

88
00:05:50.673 --> 00:05:55.467
And it's pretty easy to go ahead and
post those files up here on CodePen.

89
00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:58.385
And now everybody can see
the work that I have been doing.
