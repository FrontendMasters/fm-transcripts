00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.643
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer Next, let's talk about
the various types of technologies that

2
00:00:03.643 --> 00:00:05.400
actually run in a web browser.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.311
There are only three.

4
00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.909
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer Wherever your web browser
is located, whether that's on a phone,

5
00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.728
a tablet, a desktop, a laptop,
your Internet powered refrigerator,

6
00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:17.937
your game console, it doesn't matter.

7
00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:22.325
There are only three technologies that
will run inside of a web browser and

8
00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:26.503
those three technologies are HTML,
the HyperText Markup Language,

9
00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:29.476
CSS, Cascading Style Sheets,
and JavaScript,

10
00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:33.612
a scripting language that does all
kinds of cool things to a webpage.

11
00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:35.967
That is it, that is all there is.

12
00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.307
Everything else is a variation
on one of those things.

13
00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:42.572
Let me tell you about each of those
technologies in just a little bit

14
00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:43.283
more detail.

15
00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:48.543
So the first technology to know about
is HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language.

16
00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:53.526
All this particular technology does
is identify the parts of a webpage.

17
00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:54.646
Where's the header?

18
00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:55.906
Where's the footer?

19
00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:58.399
Where are the paragraphs,
the lists, the headings?

20
00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.623
What's emphasized?

21
00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:03.167
All of that kind of stuff
is all baked into the HTML.

22
00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:09.328
Notice, I did not say that it's green or
it's bold or anything like that.

23
00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:12.211
All of that stuff has to
do with how the page looks.

24
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.528
HTML has nothing to do
with the page looks.

25
00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:19.581
This is one of the very common
mistakes that are made by beginners.

26
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:24.801
They tend to think the HTML is responsible
for the way that a webpage looks.

27
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:30.696
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets,
and it does dictate how the page looks.

28
00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:34.277
If it has to do with anything that
has to do with being pretty or

29
00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:38.156
the way the page looks,
it's probably something to do with CSS.

30
00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:41.996
So things like colors and
fonts and layouts and spacing,

31
00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:44.883
all of that kind of stuff
has to do with CSS.

32
00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:47.344
And then finally, there is JavaScript.

33
00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:47.907
And so,

34
00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:53.151
JavaScript is a programming language
that is completely unrelated to Java.

35
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:55.153
I'll tell you more about that in a second.

36
00:01:55.153 --> 00:01:59.998
But what JavaScript is going to do is it
will dictate how this page is interactive.

37
00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:04.676
So if it's quote, interactive, there's
something that's happening on the webpage,

38
00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:07.517
chances are it's JavaScript
that's powering that.

39
00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:11.149
So whether things are moving, or
changing color or changing size or

40
00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.657
appearing and disappearing,
something's being calculated,

41
00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:16.709
that's almost all from JavaScript.

42
00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.740
So, how did this name come about?

43
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.677
Well, it was sort of the mid 90s,
Java was actually a programming language.

44
00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:29.865
It was very, very hot at the time and
in parallel, a guy named Mark Andrison who

45
00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:33.756
worked for NetScape was interested
in adding some more interactivity.

46
00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:36.745
He wrote a little scripting language.

47
00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:40.646
He was looking for a name that would catch
on with the public and be kinda cool, so

48
00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:44.373
he took Java, he stuck Script after it,
since this was a scripting language

49
00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:46.670
instead of a compiled
programming language.

50
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.881
And thus, JavaScript is born.

51
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:54.733
So there is literally no connection
between Java and JavaScript.

52
00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:59.216
That is one of the very most common
mistakes that beginners make as well,

53
00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:02.898
they talk about Java,
it's not Java, it's JavaScript.

54
00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:06.362
Now you might be wondering about some
other technologies that you heard about.

55
00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:09.918
And that you're wondering,
what about these things like Bootstrap,

56
00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:11.643
Responsive Design or WordPress?

57
00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:14.916
These can all still be boiled
back to the same technologies.

58
00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:18.748
Bootstrap is just HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

59
00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:21.861
Responsive Design is HTML and CSS.

60
00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:24.494
You can add some JavaScript if you want,

61
00:03:24.494 --> 00:03:27.907
Responsive Design will work
with just HTML and CSS.

62
00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:31.385
WordPress is a whole program
that is made up of HTML,

63
00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:34.230
CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, and

64
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.909
there's also a database that's
running on the server end of things.

65
00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.970
jQuery, React, Angular, Vue,

66
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.078
these are all very popular frameworks and

67
00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:56.547
libraries that have to do with JavaScript.
