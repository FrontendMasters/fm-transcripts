00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.682
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now, I know you're wondering
what this great website that we just put

2
00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:03.554
together looks like.

3
00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:06.061
And so you're probably wondering,
now what do I do?

4
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.259
How do I go about getting
this website open?

5
00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.772
And it's actually really simple,

6
00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:16.134
all we have to do is go to index.html and
double-click on it.

7
00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:20.061
That will go ahead and open this up for
you inside of a web browser, and

8
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.471
this happens to be a website
about the Pie in the Sky Bakery.

9
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.864
And as you can see here,

10
00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:28.714
we have have a working accordion
that's powered by JavaScript.

11
00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:32.469
And of course, we have all kinds
of styling here, looks pretty,

12
00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.506
that's the CSS.

13
00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:37.194
And of course, we have this marked
up correctly as well in terms

14
00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:41.312
of identifying headings, and
paragraphs, and images and so forth.

15
00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:46.289
So the only problem with what's going
on here is what browser are we actually

16
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.465
in at the moment?

17
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.621
And you can tell that by looking
down at the bottom of your bar here.

18
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:54.826
We are actually in Edge,
and Edge is great, but

19
00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:57.881
it's not really a web development browser.

20
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:01.105
We'd rather have Chrome
as our default browser.

21
00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:03.022
Chrome or Firefox are your choices.

22
00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:07.454
And so let's go through how we can set
this so that Chrome, in this case,

23
00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:09.499
is gonna be our default browser.

24
00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.275
If you wanna have Firefox
as your default browser,

25
00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.932
you're gonna go through
the same methodology.

26
00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:18.857
So on your computer, go ahead and
click on the Start menu.

27
00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:23.032
And over here on the side, look for
the little gear icon, that's the settings.

28
00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:25.697
Go on ahead and choose that.

29
00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:31.768
And we are going to go to
your default applications.

30
00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:35.375
Now, if you just type default
here in the search window,

31
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.945
you can just go to Default app settings.

32
00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:44.531
And this is gonna show all of your
various default applications.

33
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:47.501
And you can scroll on down
here to Web browser, and

34
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.628
you'll see here that that
is set to Microsoft Edge.

35
00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:53.634
If you click on that,
it'll give you some other options.

36
00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:57.117
And it happens to be on this
particular computer, we have Edge,

37
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.061
which is recommended for Windows 10,
cuz it comes with Windows 10.

38
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:03.043
We have Chrome, which I've installed.

39
00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:04.374
Or I have Internet Explorer.

40
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.922
Remember, Internet Explorer is
the worst choice of the bunch.

41
00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:08.452
It's the one that's
completely out of date.

42
00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:10.608
Do not use that one.

43
00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:13.826
If you have Firefox in here,
you might see that in the list as well.

44
00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:16.051
I donâ€™t at this point, but I have Chrome.

45
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:19.829
So I am going to go ahead and choose that,

46
00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.065
and it's going to ask
me to please keep Edge.

47
00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:25.329
Please just give it a try.

48
00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.734
And I'm gonna say no, switch it anyway.

49
00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:30.398
And so
now my default browser is Google Chrome.

50
00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.631
We can close out of our Settings.

51
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:37.142
We can close on out of Edge here.

52
00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:41.614
And now you'll notice that in my demo
finished folder, my index.html file has

53
00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:46.638
the default icon, that's the Chrome icon,
indicating that that switch has been made.

54
00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:51.658
If we double-click on index.html that
will in fact now open inside of Chrome.
