00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great, so now that
we've got our own code into Codepen,

2
00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.498
sometimes we'd like to get
our own code out of Codepen.

3
00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.231
Or somebody else's code, we'd like
to download it to our computer and

4
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.607
actually that is pretty straightforward
and easy to do as well.

5
00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:20.106
What I'd like for
you to do to start with is go to bit.ly/

6
00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:25.272
FEM example, as in Frontend Masters,
FEM example.

7
00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:30.646
And if you go ahead and type in that
address, you'll come to my Codepen here,

8
00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:35.380
we took a look at this earlier,
this was about learning how to fork.

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.041
Now I wanna go ahead and I love this
thing, I wanna download it to my computer,

10
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.199
I wanna do more stuff with it,
I wanna make changes to it and so forth,

11
00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.091
I can do that.

12
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:49.864
Down here at the very bottom at the
Codepen there is a button here that says

13
00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:50.496
export.

14
00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:55.248
Go ahead and click that button,
it gives us three options here.

15
00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:57.000
One is to put it in to GitHub,

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.682
GitHub is something we will be talking or
will be covering in other courses.

17
00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:06.626
You can export it as a zip file,
or you can embed this pen.

18
00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:09.096
For example, you wanna take some code and

19
00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.857
make it show up in another
web page somewhere.

20
00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:17.417
We're gonna go to export a zip file,
and so all you have to do is save that,

21
00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:21.482
it's going to give you
the option of downloading it.

22
00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:24.013
We'll go ahead and say save file.

23
00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:27.533
And then if I look in my Downloads folder,

24
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:32.772
here's the zip file that I just
downloaded from the website.

25
00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:38.644
If I double click on that,
it'll give me a folder.

26
00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:42.857
Inside of that folder is the CSS,
the index.html and

27
00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:49.136
all of the JavaScript that I need in order
to work with this particular Codepen.

28
00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:53.250
So that's pretty cool but
that is all available to me.

29
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.183
That is as simple as it is to go ahead and

30
00:01:56.183 --> 00:02:00.510
download those files from
Codepen onto your computer.
