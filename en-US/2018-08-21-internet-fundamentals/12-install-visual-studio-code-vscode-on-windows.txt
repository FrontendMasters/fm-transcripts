[00:00:00]
>> Speaker 1: This video is just for Windows people. Mac people, you have a same version of this video, but it's a different segment that'll cover how to install this program for Macintosh. So if you are going to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, you need to have a piece of software called an editor in order to do that.

[00:00:21]
And there are approximately 5 bajillion kinds of code editors that are out there. Some are Mac specific, PC specific, free, paid, all kinds of different things. We're gonna work with one that is very popular at the moment. This is called Visual Studio Code, and it's put out by Microsoft.

[00:00:39]
You can visit their website at code.visualstudio.com, and this is how you go about installing Visual Studio for your Windows computer. So we're gonna go ahead and go to the home page just like this, look at the great big huge green button over here. And it says Download for Windows, Stable Build.

[00:01:00]
Don't worry about the dropdown over here and the other options, we just want the stable build. Go in ahead and click that, and this should go ahead and start downloading our piece of software. So once that's in place, we can just go on ahead and open it up.

[00:01:23]

>> Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask if we'd like it to make changes to our device, we're gonna say yes.
>> Speaker 1: And then we're going to have our installation wizard. So yes, we'd go Next. Read through the agreement and then accept it.
>> Speaker 1: This is gonna go ahead and ask you where you'd like to install it.

[00:01:46]
I'm gonna leave it at the default location. It's gonna ask me what I should call it. Visual Studio Code is a great name.
>> Speaker 1: If you wanna add any of these additional options to this, like creating an icon on your desktop, or some of these other things, feel free to check them off.

[00:02:03]
I'm going to ignore all of them. Go ahead and say Next, and then go ahead and hit the Install button. So then this will go ahead and install on your computer.
>> Speaker 1: So once you get to this point and it's finished installing, you can just make sure that box here is checked off that says Launch Visual Studio Code, and then go ahead and click the Finish button.

[00:02:24]
And then that will go ahead and open up the program for us.
>> Speaker 1: So if you see something like this, then you're in the right place. This happens to have some release notes that have opened with it. You may just see the welcome screen that looks like this.

[00:02:47]
And if you get to that point, you've done great. That's exactly what you should see. You may or may not see this note down here at the bottom, you can just go ahead and close that. So the only other thing you might wanna change at this point is the color scheme.

[00:03:02]
And the color scheme is pretty easy to change. If you go to File > Preferences, then you'll notice that we have the option here for a color theme. Go ahead and choose that. And there are a bunch of different color themes that you can choose from. Personally as I work on my own computer, I like to have a lighter theme with dark text.

[00:03:25]
I find that easier to look at and work with. So typically, I would choose one of these color schemes up here. Solarized Light is kind of a nice one to start with. But for filming purposes and some other people's preferences, they prefer a dark theme. And so there are several of those options that are here that you could choose.

[00:03:44]
I'm gonna stay with the default dark theme, but feel free to experiment with the other ones if you like. And then finally, I'd like to point out that down here at the bottom, there is a high contrast theme. This may be helpful to some people with certain types of visual disabilities, so that high contrast theme may be helpful for you also.

[00:04:02]
And of course, there's an option to install many other color themes or customize your own as well. But you can waste a lot of time trying to choose the right color scheme for your editor. I recommend just picking either Solarized Light, if you like light ones, or stick with the default if you prefer a dark.

[00:04:19]
Go with the high contrast if you need it for visual disabilities.
