00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.949
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now let's talk a little
bit further about domain names,

2
00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.834
because there's a lot to know about
domain names, choosing the right one for

3
00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.022
your website and getting these
connected to your web hosting.

4
00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:13.994
So as I mentioned before,
a domain name looks something like this,

5
00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:15.887
www.frontendmasters.com.

6
00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:19.214
Sometimes you'll see an http:// or

7
00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:23.560
an https:// put in front
of these domain names.

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.539
Remember that designates the protocol.

9
00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.753
The actual domain name is this whole
thing here www.frontendmasters.com.

10
00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:34.579
So lets focus on that last
part of the domain name first.

11
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.397
That is called the top level domain,
in this case it's .com but

12
00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:41.520
there's a whole lot of
choices out there for these.

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.812
For example, the ones we started
the internet with are pretty much .com,

14
00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:50.940
.net, .org, .gov, and
.edu, and probably .mil.

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.133
So .com originally meant a commercial or

16
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.607
a website that had
a commercial nature to it.

17
00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:02.798
.net was for networks in other
words internet service providers,

18
00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:05.174
and .org was for nonprofits.

19
00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:09.234
Those guidelines have pretty much gone out
the window, anybody uses whatever they

20
00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:12.430
want, wherever they want,
at whatever point in time they want.

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.442
But historically,
that's where the roots of this were.

22
00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.423
There are two that are still
very strictly regulated.

23
00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:22.152
This is .gov, that stands for
the US federal government only,

24
00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:24.442
not the state government or anything.

25
00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:27.470
Just the federal government in
the United States uses .gov.

26
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.118
.edu is very strictly for
higher education in the United States.

27
00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:36.737
There are very strict guidelines
about getting a .edu address as well.

28
00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:40.257
.mil is used by the US military,
and that is it.

29
00:01:40.257 --> 00:01:43.767
Now after those three,
the .gov, .edu and .mil,

30
00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:47.280
it's pretty much anything goes for
everybody else.

31
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.201
There are a whole bunch of country codes
that are associated with some of this.

32
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:55.870
And I just listed a few here France,
Spain, the United Kingdom,

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.818
Australia, Germany,
Japan or the United States.

34
00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:04.563
These country codes were available but
even these have been somewhat of used for

35
00:02:04.563 --> 00:02:08.949
example.tv is a country code for
the tiny island of Tuvalu.

36
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.787
Out in the Pacific Ocean about 10,000
people at risk of climate change,

37
00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:15.998
actually, and rising sea levels.

38
00:02:15.998 --> 00:02:20.852
They went and sold their .tv domain name
to a company that sells it to TV shows,

39
00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:24.399
so you can do whatever you
want with these country codes.

40
00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.817
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In general as you start
to think about a domain name for

41
00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.665
a website that you might like to build.

42
00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:34.548
Here are some things that are really
pretty important to keep in mind.

43
00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:36.892
So first of all,
make sure it's easy to spell.

44
00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:38.821
People are terrible spellers.

45
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:42.560
If you're gonna have some weird
combination of letters in there that

46
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.890
people could get confused by, that may
not be the best choice for a domain name.

47
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.859
It shouldn't be too long,
it should be easy to say over the phone.

48
00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.446
That's one I really strongly recommend.

49
00:02:53.446 --> 00:03:00.064
My first business was Focused Consulting
F-O-C-U-S-E-D Consulting.com.

50
00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:02.114
That's gets really old
saying that all the time.

51
00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.902
So think very carefully about
a good domain name that you can

52
00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:08.572
simply say like FrontendMasters.com.

53
00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:11.399
People should have a pretty
easy time spelling that.

54
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.384
It's easy to remember.

55
00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:17.404
If you want people to be able to remember
your domain name and visit you regularly,

56
00:03:17.404 --> 00:03:21.652
I would recommend avoiding hyphens and
numbers in your domain name.

57
00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:24.068
It's because if you go with another
great one that I had 4 Web Inc.

58
00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:27.328
That's the number 4webinc.com.

59
00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:32.272
You have to make sure that you're
specifying the actual number

60
00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:35.357
as opposed to spelling out the number.

61
00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:39.389
And then make sure that you avoid
copyright and trademark issues.

62
00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.239
So this was something that
happened a whole lot more towards

63
00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.633
the beginning of
the commercialization of the web.

64
00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:50.884
For example we had somebody who had
bought a Julia Roberts domain name who

65
00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:55.500
was building a fan site on it and Julia
Roberts sued to get the domain name back.

66
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.029
We had somebody with the last name
of McDonalds who happened to buy

67
00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.236
McDonalds.com and
of course the big burger people went and

68
00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:04.307
sued them to get the domain name back.

69
00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:07.643
So if you infringe on someone's
copyright or trademark,

70
00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:09.830
then you may wind up facing a lawsuit.

71
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.366
So make sure whatever domain name
you pick is really truly your own.

72
00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:18.938
So you might be wondering now well
what on Earth should I be registering?

73
00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:21.563
Well I recommend you
start with your own name.

74
00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:23.452
Having your own name is a great thing,

75
00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:26.238
you can do anything with it
because it's all about you.

76
00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:29.982
You can always register those
domain names and not use them.

77
00:04:29.982 --> 00:04:32.643
Many of us who have been
in web development for

78
00:04:32.643 --> 00:04:37.194
a long time have a huge pile of domain
names that we never use and may never use,

79
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.175
but we have great plans for them.

80
00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:41.185
I think all of us are in that boat.

81
00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:43.748
You can also have more than one
name point to the same website.

82
00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:50.709
So for example, I own JenKramer.com,
.net, .org, .biz, and that rocks.

83
00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:53.227
And so my website is the .org website but

84
00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:56.865
I do have the .com point to it
also because you never know.

85
00:04:56.865 --> 00:04:58.944
And it was nice to buy all of those names.

86
00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:03.811
I bought them years and years ago, now I
don't get confused with Jane Cramer or

87
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:08.859
the magician or Jane Cramer who ran for
a position in city government in Chicago.

88
00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:10.993
If you're wondering how to
pick a good domain name,

89
00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:13.233
there are lot of services out
there that will help you.

90
00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:16.357
Name Boy has been around for
a really long time.

91
00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:20.457
On this particular website, you can enter
a primary word and a secondary word,

92
00:05:20.457 --> 00:05:23.961
whatever the words are that you'd
like to have in your domain name.

93
00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:27.335
And then click the Go Name Boy Go button,
it'll go ahead and

94
00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:29.981
do a search for
a whole bunch of combinations.

95
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.571
And very nicely, it'll also do a quick
check to see if those names are available

96
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:35.817
for you to purchase.

97
00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:39.414
You can actually purchase them
through Name Boy, if you want.

98
00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:44.822
[COUGH] You're gonna purchase your domain
names through a domain name registrar.

99
00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:49.023
There are a ton of places to purchase
domain names out there on the Internet.

100
00:05:49.023 --> 00:05:53.771
And one of the simplest ways to purchase
a domain name is to go to your web host as

101
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.047
you're signing up for web hosting.

102
00:05:56.047 --> 00:05:59.104
You can usually just register
a domain name right there.

103
00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:03.167
And all of the magic to connect domain
names with web hosting will happen for

104
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.763
you automatically, it's a beautiful thing.

105
00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:09.490
If you don't wanna register a domain
name with your web hosting,

106
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.353
if you'd rather keep those as
separate entities as many people do,

107
00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:17.796
you can go to a different domain name
registrar and register your name there.

108
00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:22.420
Personally for ease of keeping track of
all of your names I strongly recommend you

109
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.673
pick one registrar and stick with him.

110
00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:30.001
I use namecheap, there are a lot of other
places out there Namecheap as their

111
00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:35.348
name implies kind of cheap kind of
cheerful no frills just gets the job done.

112
00:06:35.348 --> 00:06:37.219
And, it's not terribly expensive to do so.

113
00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.102
Connecting your name to the hosting.

114
00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:45.685
Now if you wind up purchasing your
domain name someplace like Namecheap and

115
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:49.191
you have your web hosting,
some place like SiteGround.

116
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:51.724
You're gonna have to make these
two things talk to each other.

117
00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:56.195
So that the domain name when we type in
say frontendmasters.com, we know that

118
00:06:56.195 --> 00:07:00.888
we're going to the web hosting where
they're located with the right IP address.

119
00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:05.396
The way that connection is made is through
something called DNS which stands for

120
00:07:05.396 --> 00:07:06.815
the domain name system.

121
00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:10.258
So it's the way we just translate
a name to an IP address.

122
00:07:10.258 --> 00:07:13.605
These DNS settings are provided
by the hosting company.

123
00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:17.361
The hosting company will give them to
you that will say here's a couple of DNS

124
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:17.896
entries.

125
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:21.185
You'll go over to wherever you
registered your domain name and

126
00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:23.551
there will be a spot to
put in the DNS entries.

127
00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:25.249
You just copy and paste them over.

128
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:29.443
And then you're gonna need to wait,
typically 24-48 hours,

129
00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:31.439
sometimes a little bit longer.

130
00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:36.334
And then, when you type in your domain
name, you'll get your web hosting.

131
00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:37.879
Why does it take so long?

132
00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.187
Well, we have to update
the whole internet.

133
00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:43.876
The internet is a very
diffused sort of place.

134
00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:49.205
There are a lot of places that are storing
where names and IP addresses go together.

135
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:52.136
We basically have to update
the entire internet.

136
00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:56.151
So that they all know when you
wanna go to frontendmasters.com,

137
00:07:56.151 --> 00:08:00.169
you go to this particular IP
address at this particular webhost.

138
00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:03.394
If you're curious about
how this DNS stuff works,

139
00:08:03.394 --> 00:08:06.694
there's a great article
at howstuffworks.com and

140
00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:11.048
there's the URL for that if you wanna
read a little bit more about it.
