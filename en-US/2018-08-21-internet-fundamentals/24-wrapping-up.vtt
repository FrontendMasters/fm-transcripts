&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hey everybody,
it's Jen Kramer.

2
00:00:02.088 --> 00:00:04.923
I hope you've enjoyed
this fundamentals course.

3
00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:08.176
There was a ton of material
that we covered here in a very

4
00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:09.530
short period of time.

5
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.502
We talked about how the Internet works,

6
00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:14.698
we talked about all kinds of crazy
connectivity kinds of things.

7
00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:17.564
We dove deep into files and folders, and

8
00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:20.863
we also took a look at
CodePen towards the end.

9
00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:25.696
I hope you're feeling relatively confident
that you're ready to go on to learn more

10
00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:27.816
about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

11
00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.989
If you're feeling a little bit
freaked out at the moment,

12
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.219
especially by that CodePen stuff that
we did there at the end, don't panic.

13
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.117
I showed you a whole bunch of code that
you actually don't know anything about at

14
00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:40.118
this point in time.

15
00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:43.643
So if you found it a little bit confusing,
you're worried about being

16
00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:47.783
able to read code, that is a completely
normal reaction to what I just showed you.

17
00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:52.647
The important part of this is that you
really understand the file path issues

18
00:00:52.647 --> 00:00:53.866
that I discussed.

19
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.969
All that dot dot slash stuff and
going from one directory or

20
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.019
one folder to another,
into files and everything else.

21
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.384
That is really the most important stuff
that you can take away from this course,

22
00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:10.109
because that is gonna be really
critical in writing good HTML and CSS,

23
00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.215
as you saw in my examples here.

24
00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:15.697
If you feel a little uncomfortable
with looking at all code,

25
00:01:15.697 --> 00:01:20.355
don't panic because we will be covering
that in great detail in future courses.

26
00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:23.618
So keep your chin up,
you're doing great work.

27
00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:28.136
You can Google around for other resources
if you feel like you need more help, and

28
00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.270
I'll see you in a future course here.
