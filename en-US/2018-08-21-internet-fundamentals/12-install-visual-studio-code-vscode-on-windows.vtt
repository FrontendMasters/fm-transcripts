00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:03.005
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer This video is just for
Windows people.

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.271
Mac people,
you have a same version of this video, but

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:11.383
it's a different segment that'll cover how
to install this program for Macintosh.

4
00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:16.255
So if you are going to edit HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript files,

5
00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:21.894
you need to have a piece of software
called an editor in order to do that.

6
00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:26.923
And there are approximately 5 bajillion
kinds of code editors that are out there.

7
00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:32.100
Some are Mac specific, PC specific, free,
paid, all kinds of different things.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.514
We're gonna work with one that
is very popular at the moment.

9
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.888
This is called Visual Studio Code,
and it's put out by Microsoft.

10
00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:44.890
You can visit their website
at code.visualstudio.com,

11
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.703
and this is how you go about installing
Visual Studio for your Windows computer.

12
00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:54.756
So we're gonna go ahead and
go to the home page just like this,

13
00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:57.240
look at the great big huge
green button over here.

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.574
And it says Download for
Windows, Stable Build.

15
00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:03.765
Don't worry about the dropdown
over here and the other options,

16
00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:05.283
we just want the stable build.

17
00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:10.738
Go in ahead and click that,
and this should go ahead and

18
00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:15.019
start downloading our piece of software.

19
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:19.501
So once that's in place,
we can just go on ahead and open it up.

20
00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:26.589
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer I'm gonna ask if we'd
like it to make changes to our device,

21
00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:27.672
we're gonna say yes.

22
00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:32.555
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer And then we're going
to have our installation wizard.

23
00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:37.234
So yes, we'd go Next.

24
00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:40.018
Read through the agreement and
then accept it.

25
00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:46.161
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer This is gonna go ahead and
ask you where you'd like to install it.

26
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:49.081
I'm gonna leave it at
the default location.

27
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:50.884
It's gonna ask me what I should call it.

28
00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:52.613
Visual Studio Code is a great name.

29
00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:58.446
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer If you wanna add any
of these additional options to this,

30
00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:01.966
like creating an icon on your desktop,
or some of these other things,

31
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.416
feel free to check them off.

32
00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:05.104
I'm going to ignore all of them.

33
00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:09.747
Go ahead and say Next, and
then go ahead and hit the Install button.

34
00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:12.439
So then this will go ahead and
install on your computer.

35
00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:17.694
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer So once you get to this
point and it's finished installing,

36
00:02:17.694 --> 00:02:20.817
you can just make sure that box
here is checked off that says

37
00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:24.872
Launch Visual Studio Code, and
then go ahead and click the Finish button.

38
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:27.837
And then that will go ahead and
open up the program for us.

39
00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:41.091
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer So if you see something like
this, then you're in the right place.

40
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:44.238
This happens to have some release
notes that have opened with it.

41
00:02:44.238 --> 00:02:47.419
You may just see the welcome
screen that looks like this.

42
00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.791
And if you get to that point,
you've done great.

43
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.115
That's exactly what you should see.

44
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:56.884
You may or may not see this note down here
at the bottom, you can just go ahead and

45
00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:57.685
close that.

46
00:02:57.685 --> 00:03:02.133
So the only other thing you might wanna
change at this point is the color scheme.

47
00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:06.999
And the color scheme is
pretty easy to change.

48
00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.184
If you go to File &gt; Preferences,

49
00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:13.562
then you'll notice that we have
the option here for a color theme.

50
00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:16.539
Go ahead and choose that.

51
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.313
And there are a bunch of different
color themes that you can choose from.

52
00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:22.717
Personally as I work on my own computer,

53
00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:25.416
I like to have a lighter
theme with dark text.

54
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:28.293
I find that easier to look at and
work with.

55
00:03:28.293 --> 00:03:31.361
So typically, I would choose one
of these color schemes up here.

56
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.561
Solarized Light is kind of
a nice one to start with.

57
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:38.786
But for filming purposes and
some other people's preferences,

58
00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.485
they prefer a dark theme.

59
00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:44.598
And so there are several of those options
that are here that you could choose.

60
00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.416
I'm gonna stay with
the default dark theme, but

61
00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:50.656
feel free to experiment with
the other ones if you like.

62
00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:53.994
And then finally, I'd like to point
out that down here at the bottom,

63
00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:55.536
there is a high contrast theme.

64
00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:59.920
This may be helpful to some people with
certain types of visual disabilities, so

65
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.831
that high contrast theme may
be helpful for you also.

66
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.151
And of course, there's an option to
install many other color themes or

67
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.883
customize your own as well.

68
00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:12.281
But you can waste a lot of time trying
to choose the right color scheme for

69
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:12.972
your editor.

70
00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:15.575
I recommend just picking
either Solarized Light,

71
00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:19.155
if you like light ones, or stick with
the default if you prefer a dark.

72
00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.135
Go with the high contrast if you
need it for visual disabilities.
