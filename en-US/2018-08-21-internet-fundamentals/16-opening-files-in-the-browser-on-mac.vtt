00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:03.671
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I know you've been
wondering what this website looks like.

2
00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:06.112
So let's go ahead and
take a quick peek at it.

3
00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:08.977
How do we open up this website and
take a look at it?

4
00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:12.856
Well, remember, it just needs to
run inside of your browser, and

5
00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.038
your browser is automatically
associated with some kind of HTML file.

6
00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:20.936
So if you simply double-click
on the file called index.html,

7
00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.328
this is going to open up in
your default web browser, and

8
00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:27.523
my default web browser right
now is set to be Safari.

9
00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:29.847
So here is my web page
opened up in Safari.

10
00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:33.683
You can see it's all about
the Pie in the Sky bakery.

11
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:36.419
You'll see here that we
have a lovely accordion.

12
00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:42.012
That works, we can click on all the little
bars and see the extra text inside of it.

13
00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:46.143
We have images, we have text and
so forth, and it looks beautiful.

14
00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:51.612
So if it doesn't look pretty, you've
probably put your CSS in the wrong place.

15
00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:56.200
If it's the bars aren't working, there's
something wrong with your JavaScript, so

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.129
you might wanna check those things.

17
00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.044
But this is not the web browser
that we really wanna use.

18
00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.014
Remeber I said Safari
is specific to the Mac.

19
00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:05.091
Edge and
Internet Explorer are specific to the PC,

20
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.228
we'd like to use something like Chrome or
Firefox.

21
00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:11.998
Well, I have Chrome installed here,
and so let's go ahead and

22
00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:14.882
make Chrome our default web browser.

23
00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:18.829
So if you'll go ahead and open up Chrome,
inside of your Chrome browser,

24
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.987
go on up into the right hand corner to
the little three dots you see on the side.

25
00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:25.497
Go over here and go down to Settings.

26
00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:32.369
And this will open up your settings for
this particular window here,

27
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.888
and this is going to show you
a whole bunch of different settings.

28
00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:41.654
We're gonna look for
the Default browser section.

29
00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:45.411
So if you just type in default
up here in the search bar,

30
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.528
you'll see here that we
have a match come up.

31
00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:53.153
It says, Default browser,
make Google Chrome the default browser.

32
00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:55.232
And if you do not have this option,

33
00:01:55.232 --> 00:02:00.040
Google Chrome already is your default
browser, but if you do have this option,

34
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.154
it is not your default browser,
go ahead and click on Make default.

35
00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:08.729
It'll ask you, are you totally sure,
do you really want to make it Chrome?

36
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.960
Yes, we want to make it Chrome.

37
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.939
Go ahead and click on Use Chrome.

38
00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.703
And that should be all set.

39
00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:19.134
That should be all that you need to
do in order to set Chrome as your

40
00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:20.459
default browser.

41
00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.532
So now if I go back to my demo finish
folder, go back to index.html,

42
00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:30.427
and double-click on it,
we should now have it open up in Chrome.

43
00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:35.531
So look up in the upper left-hand corner
and make sure that it says Chrome

44
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:40.312
instead of Safari and you should
see exactly the same web page here.
