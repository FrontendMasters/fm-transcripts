00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer Now that you have your code
editor installed and you know a little bit

2
00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:07.049
about file paths let's go ahead and
start putting that to work.

3
00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.396
I am back here working on
my Macintosh computer.

4
00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:13.117
Windows people,
you're following along with me.

5
00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:17.762
You should be able to do exactly the same
things that I'm doing here with my Mac

6
00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:18.623
with your PC.

7
00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:23.526
So what you need to do is make sure
you have the VS Code Editor open and

8
00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:27.906
then we're going to go to your
desktop where you should have

9
00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:31.957
downloaded the web tools and
infrastructure folder.

10
00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:37.930
Go ahead and click and
drag that on to VS Code.

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.992
And that will go ahead and
open up all of the folders and

12
00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:47.332
files associated with that folder
over there on the left-hand side.

13
00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:48.949
So what we're gonna do for

14
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.928
this exercise is we're gonna go
to the folder here called demo.

15
00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:56.500
Go on ahead and
open up the folder called demo,

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.005
just click on it once to drop it down and
then click once on index.html.

17
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.987
And that's gonna show up over
here on the right-hand side.

18
00:01:04.987 --> 00:01:10.876
This is all of the HTML that is
making up this particular webpage.

19
00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:14.291
What's missing from this webpage
right now are all of the paths,

20
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:17.967
all of the things that we've been
talking about to this point in time.

21
00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:20.289
So how do we link to our CSS?

22
00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.511
How do we link to other pages?

23
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.064
How do we link to our images?

24
00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:25.920
How do we link to our JavaScript?

25
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.867
So that's all missing from this webpage.

26
00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:33.216
So even though you don't know HTML,
CSS or JavaScript yet,

27
00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:38.246
this is a good exercise to gain some
understanding as to what each one of

28
00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:43.392
these elements do, the HTML,
the CSS, the JavaScript, the Images.

29
00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:45.290
And then how we link
them all together here.

30
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.129
So we're gonna start with just
taking a quick pick at index.html.

31
00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:53.952
The easiest way to do that is simply,

32
00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:59.335
open your folder on the desktop
called Web Tools and Infrastructure.

33
00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:05.559
Go into the folder called Demo and
then double click on index.html.

34
00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.830
And that's going to open up
the webpage right here by default.

35
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.151
And you just see,
it doesn't look like much at all.

36
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:18.102
And the reason why is because
this is plain old basic HTML.

37
00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:22.616
We haven't linked this to the style sheets
to the images or to the JavaScript.

38
00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:27.432
So what you're seeing here
is just playing raw HTML.

39
00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:31.921
It's very usable,
it's very simple, it's very ugly.

40
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:36.896
And so if you have a page that looks like
this, this is typically an indicator

41
00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:41.433
to you that there's something missing and
it's probably your CSS.

42
00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.593
So that's a good place to look.

43
00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:49.109
Okay, so let's go ahead and
start by linking to our CSS,

44
00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.413
that's gonna be here on line number six.

45
00:02:52.413 --> 00:02:55.171
Click in between the two
quotes that are there and

46
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.129
we need to link to our stylesheet.

47
00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.107
Our stylesheet is in the CSS folder,

48
00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:04.342
in that demo folder, and
it's called style.css.

49
00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:08.515
So right here in between the quotes,

50
00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:12.291
we can type in css/style.css.

51
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:17.387
Go in ahead and save that webpage,
and if you go ahead and

52
00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:20.866
refresh you should see a change here.

53
00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:24.456
Now, if you don't see the change
that I just showed here,

54
00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:29.150
in other words the navigation bar went
horizontal instead of vertical, and

55
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.620
we have a new font in place here as
opposed to the old Times Roman that we saw

56
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.555
before down looking at Arial.

57
00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:39.586
If you don't see those changes
then something wrong happened.

58
00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.870
And it's typically one of two things.

59
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.608
One thing is right here,
either your path is wrong.

60
00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:52.128
So make sure that path is correct or
two, you've made some typo in there,

61
00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:57.667
you inverted two characters by mistake or
you forgot to put something in.

62
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:02.075
So double check to make sure it
says css/style.css or three,

63
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.911
you put in some capital letters in here.

64
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:09.553
Sometimes those capital letters
will make things blow up and

65
00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:14.480
not work correctly, or four,
you didn't save the file first.

66
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.020
If you don't save the file when you
take a look at it in your web browser,

67
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.380
your changes will not be reflected.

68
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.206
So it's really important to save that file
first before you look in your web browser.

69
00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:28.538
By the way,
that's a mistake that everybody makes and

70
00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:29.561
we make it all the time.

71
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.869
So you'll get used to making that mistake
and you won't see your changes and

72
00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:35.255
that will be one of the first
things that you check for.

73
00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:39.911
Make sure that you saved your file before
you look at it in your web browser.

74
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:41.931
Okay, moving on here.

75
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.904
Let's go on down to lines 13, 14, and 15.

76
00:04:44.904 --> 00:04:50.049
These are links, and what we are trying
to do is link to the homepage,

77
00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:52.993
the about page, and the contact page.

78
00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:56.155
And those are linking to other HTML files.

79
00:04:56.155 --> 00:05:01.166
So we'll start with this first one here,
and once again after the h ref,

80
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:05.454
in between the quotes,
you'll see a pound or a hashtag sign.

81
00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:10.210
Go on ahead and delete that and
we're going to substitute that

82
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.880
with index.html,
because that is actually our home page.

83
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.212
We don't need to put a folder name
in front of that that's because we

84
00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:20.960
are on this page right now.

85
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.615
So we actually just made a link to our
self which it's kind of recursive, but

86
00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:26.501
there you go.

87
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:31.538
Let's go ahead down to the next one here,
which is about.

88
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:36.852
We're gonna link to about.html,
okay, for the same reason.

89
00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:42.116
We have a page over here called about.html
it's in the same location as index.html.

90
00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:45.777
No folders involved, so
we can just type out that much.

91
00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:48.898
And then finally, for the last one,

92
00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:53.943
we're gonna link to our Contact page,
so contact.html.

93
00:05:53.943 --> 00:05:59.503
And if you go in ahead and save that,
now we can go back to our web browser and

94
00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:05.086
refresh the page, and up here on the top,
you can click on the About link.

95
00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:11.221
We'll go to the About page, click your
Back button, click on the Contact link.

96
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:14.781
And we'll go back to the Home
page by clicking the Back button.

97
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:18.288
Notice that for example,
if I'm on the About page,

98
00:06:18.288 --> 00:06:23.073
it looks like we're back to that
unstyled format again that's because

99
00:06:23.073 --> 00:06:26.517
remember our About page is
not linked up to our CSS.

100
00:06:26.517 --> 00:06:30.073
And those links that you see
there are not coded at all.

101
00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:34.771
So we're going to have to go back
to our homepage to click the next

102
00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:36.429
link to test it again.

103
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.612
We'll have to actually
code the about.html and

104
00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:45.823
the contact at html pages with
these same kinds of features.

105
00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:49.724
All right, so now that that's done,
let's go down to these images.

106
00:06:49.724 --> 00:06:54.683
You'll notice that my code is scrolling
off the side of the page here.

107
00:06:54.683 --> 00:06:59.285
And so now I have to side-scroll
in order to see the whole thing.

108
00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:04.100
It is possible to turn on a word wrap,
and that would be

109
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.134
under View Make sure I'm in
my VS code by clicking on it.

110
00:07:09.134 --> 00:07:13.694
And then if we go to View we're going
to go to Toggle Word Wrap which is

111
00:07:13.694 --> 00:07:16.257
most the way down the view list there.

112
00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:19.714
If you go ahead and
click that it will go ahead and

113
00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:24.814
wrap those lines around so that you
can see things a little bit better,

114
00:07:24.814 --> 00:07:29.328
all right, so these images
are inside right now of a comment.

115
00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:33.593
Comments are those green lines.

116
00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:42.093
You see the &lt;!-- and then it ends with the
--&gt; on the other end, that is a comment.

117
00:07:42.093 --> 00:07:46.293
And it's a way of hiding little bits
of code or notes to yourself for

118
00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:50.279
other kinds of documentation you
may want to have in a webpage.

119
00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.173
In this particular case,

120
00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:57.089
if I put up those image tags just
like that I would see broken images.

121
00:07:57.089 --> 00:07:59.533
And you've seen those on webpages before,

122
00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:04.102
they're the funny little icon with sort
of jagged looking pictures inside of it.

123
00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:09.036
So we are gonna first of all start
by getting rid of those comments.

124
00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:14.154
Just go and had delete those
characters on the front of that

125
00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:18.967
paragraph and
then extra characters here on the back.

126
00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:20.623
Here we go.

127
00:08:20.623 --> 00:08:24.041
And now we are ready to
code path to these images.

128
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:28.324
So images are not inside the HTML,
they're their own set of files.

129
00:08:28.324 --> 00:08:33.283
And we link to them here through
the image tag, that's the img, and

130
00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:36.770
the path to them is through
that src the source.

131
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.766
Click in between the double quotes and

132
00:08:39.766 --> 00:08:43.516
this time we're gonna go
to our images folder.

133
00:08:43.516 --> 00:08:48.941
Inside of our images folder you'll
see that we have a boston-creme.jpg.

134
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:54.221
One picture, and we have
coconut-creme,jpg, a second picture.

135
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:57.206
So we'll go ahead and
put those paths here.

136
00:08:57.206 --> 00:09:02.801
So, images/boston-creme.jpg and

137
00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:08.054
then in the second one, we'll put in

138
00:09:08.054 --> 00:09:13.149
images/coconut-creme.jpeg.

139
00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:19.361
And if we go ahead and save that, we'll
go into our webpage and refresh again.

140
00:09:19.361 --> 00:09:24.154
And you should have two lovely
pieces of pie there on your webpage

141
00:09:24.154 --> 00:09:26.209
cuz who doesn't like pie?

142
00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:31.091
All right the last thing we're gonna
add is our JavaScript our bit of extra

143
00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:34.018
interactivity and functionality and fun.

144
00:09:34.018 --> 00:09:37.681
And that's done exactly the same
way you've done so far.

145
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:42.706
So after line 22 which is linking
out to some javascript that lives on

146
00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:47.999
the internet, we have a little bit of
code that we need to add on line 23.

147
00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:52.360
Once again, right in between
the double quotes next to source,

148
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.962
that's where we're gonna put this.

149
00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:58.664
And we're going to go to
our JavaScript folder, and

150
00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:01.454
we're going to put in particles.js.

151
00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:06.341
So we're gonna put in
javascript/ particles.js, and

152
00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:11.528
if you go ahead and save that,
and you refresh your web page,

153
00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:18.245
you should have some lovely, happy
bubbles floating around on your web page,

154
00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:22.350
cuz who doesn't love lovely,
happy bubbles?

155
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.505
If these do not come up,
there's two possible problems.

156
00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:29.832
Once again,
you could have spelled something wrong.

157
00:10:29.832 --> 00:10:34.568
You could have capitals, where capital
letters were not wanted, and so forth, so

158
00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:37.289
make sure you've spelled
exactly correctly.

159
00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:41.573
The other thing that might be going on is,
because this particular JavaScript,

160
00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:44.538
is relying on some code,
that comes from the Internet.

161
00:10:44.538 --> 00:10:49.233
Make sure you are connected to the
internet and that the Internet is working.

162
00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:53.831
If the Internet isn't working on your
computer at this moment, then you're not

163
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:58.375
going to see that JavaScript effect,
even if you've coded things correctly.

164
00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:03.167
All right, so that is how to put
together this first web page.

165
00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:07.175
I've given you two others,
an About page and a Contact page.

166
00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:12.307
Go ahead and post the videos and see if
you can work through the about page and

167
00:11:12.307 --> 00:11:17.461
the contact page pretty much exactly
as I've gone through this page here.

168
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:21.818
You're gonna do that same exact type
of thing with the about page and

169
00:11:21.818 --> 00:11:23.048
the contact page.

170
00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:28.654
So you'll go ahead and look at,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer Once again,

171
00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:33.069
linking to your stylesheet,
linking to your Home, About, and

172
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:38.244
Contact pages and taking out the comment,
putting in a path to the images.

173
00:11:38.244 --> 00:11:43.041
And making sure you have the right path
to your JavaScript file at the end.

174
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.024
Good luck.

175
00:11:45.024 --> 00:11:48.315
Okay, so if you've gone ahead and
done it correctly.

176
00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:50.773
This is the home page
that we did together.

177
00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:53.352
If you go ahead and
click on the link for the about page,

178
00:11:53.352 --> 00:11:56.060
it should look pretty much
like the homepage except now.

179
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.951
We have a cherry pie and
it says it's the about page and

180
00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:01.786
then you should be able to
click on the contact link.

181
00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:07.485
And go to the Contact page now with a nice
key lime pie with strawberry slices,

182
00:12:07.485 --> 00:12:11.614
and all of those links should
work on all of those pages.

183
00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:16.224
The links are probably purple in color
which indicates that you've visited those

184
00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:17.102
pages before.

185
00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:20.916
If anywhere along the way,
as you're clicking through these and

186
00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:23.549
looking at other pages,
you see a blue link,

187
00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:26.968
that's an indication that
that link is probably broken.

188
00:12:26.968 --> 00:12:31.289
You probably didn't quite spell something
right, or you left off a character, or

189
00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:34.314
something else funny happened
in your syntax so go back and

190
00:12:34.314 --> 00:12:36.061
take a look at those lines again.

191
00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:39.565
If you click on them,
you might get some kind of page error.

192
00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:44.367
And likewise, if you don't see all
the images, if you don't see the particles

193
00:12:44.367 --> 00:12:48.599
in the background, those are all
indications that the path is wrong,

194
00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:53.283
you have a capitalization or spelling
problem or some other syntax problem.

195
00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:56.957
Otherwise these pages should
hook together just fine and

196
00:12:56.957 --> 00:13:02.098
you should be able to navigate through
your very first website with no problem.
