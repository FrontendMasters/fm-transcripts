&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now that you've had
the little taste of how the file and

2
00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:08.327
folder structures might work on a typical
website, there are actually a few rules

3
00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.124
that you need to be aware of when
naming your files and folders.

4
00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:16.310
So I'm gonna take this opportunity to
tell you about some naming conventions.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.208
So first of all,
the biggest rules for file and

6
00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:24.259
folder names is that you have to remember
whatever it is that you call your file and

7
00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.146
folders, because you'll refer
to them inside of your code.

8
00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:32.515
And, so there's some rules here that I've
suggested that will make these things

9
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.210
easier for you to remember, and
it will lead fewer bugs in your code.

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.508
One of the very most common mistakes
that beginners make when writing code,

11
00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:46.303
is they call a file by a wrong name or
they call a folder by a wrong name,

12
00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:51.305
and the code quote doesn't work, so
this is a really important point.

13
00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:56.448
So first of all, I strongly recommend that
you use lowercase letters for consistency.

14
00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:59.975
It's actually true that if you have
capital letters in some places and

15
00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:03.920
lowercase letters in others you actually
have to remember what those all are,

16
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.765
because your web server will think
that they're called different things.

17
00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:10.797
And I'll tell you more about
that in just a second.

18
00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:15.952
Don't put any spaces in your file names,
no funny characters like

19
00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:21.766
tik-tak-toe signs, or percentage signs,
or anything else like that.

20
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:26.616
None of those funny characters, you can
use hyphens or underscores in your file or

21
00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:30.693
folder names, but if you do pick
one don't sometimes use hyphens and

22
00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:32.682
sometimes you use underscores.

23
00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:36.430
Cuz you'll confuse yourself and you won't
remember what it is that your doing.

24
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.633
So you wanna make sure that you
use at the same way every time.

25
00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.647
In other words, there are no really wrong
answers here just whatever you decide to

26
00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:45.390
do, do it the same way every time and

27
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.670
you reduce the amount of confusion
that you have as you write code.

28
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.525
Because this is true,
here is files named Image.JPEG, and

29
00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.533
I spelled it a whole bunch
of different ways here.

30
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.731
This is actually as far as
your web server is concern,

31
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:03.303
that is seven different image file names.

32
00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:08.332
And so, you can see here very quickly
that you can get out of control in

33
00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:13.733
terms of naming your files with a mix
of uppercase and lowercase letters.

34
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:18.800
So the unfortunate part of this is that
sometimes, like especially on Windows

35
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.423
computers, this type of naming convention
might quote, work in your code just fine.

36
00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:28.872
But once you transfer your files to the
web server, all over sudden things quote,

37
00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:29.786
no longer work.

38
00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:35.469
And it's almost inevitably one of these
issues with capitalization and so forth.

39
00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.922
So, personally what I do is I use
the first one is my image name in

40
00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:44.627
this case situation, image.jpeg,
all lowercase letters, for

41
00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:49.515
jpeg in particular, where sometimes
it's jpg and sometimes jpeg.

42
00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:53.260
I just stick with jpg,
it's always that for all of my images.

43
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.153
And that gets me out of a whole lot of
bugs that could take forever to track

44
00:02:58.153 --> 00:03:00.368
down just by being consistent.

45
00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:03.636
So the big takeaway from
naming conventions,

46
00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:07.843
use lowercase letters,
no spaces, no funny characters.

47
00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:10.807
If you're gonna use hyphens or
underscores, pick one, and

48
00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.736
do everything the same way every time.

49
00:03:12.736 --> 00:03:17.335
And that will reduce the numbers of bugs
that you have as referring to files and

50
00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:17.985
folders.
