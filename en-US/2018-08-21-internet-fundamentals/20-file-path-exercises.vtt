&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now that you've had
a little bit of practice with files and

2
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.546
folders, if you'd like
a little bit more practice,

3
00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:07.441
I have a couple of worksheets for you.

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:13.105
If you take a look inside of the Web Tools
and Infrastructures folder, take a look

5
00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:18.788
at the file called sitemap.pdf, this is
a series of questions that you can ask.

6
00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:20.773
You are on one page of the website,

7
00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:25.036
you want a link to another page on
the website, what is the relative path?

8
00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:28.498
So if you are on the Contact
page on this website,

9
00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:32.307
you can take a look at
the diagram here of the web page.

10
00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:37.042
Here's the Contact page of the website
inside of this folder called About.

11
00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.695
And you wanna link to board.html.

12
00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.382
So you're at Contact,
you wanna link to board.html,

13
00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:48.332
what you're gonna write in here for
that relative path is going to be what?

14
00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:51.644
Simply board.html.

15
00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:55.944
You may wind up having to put in some
dot dot slashes and jump up some levels,

16
00:00:55.944 --> 00:00:59.834
you may need to put in some folder
paths to jump down some levels, but

17
00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.057
basically you're gonna link
from one file to another.

18
00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:04.250
Just write in the relevant path.

19
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.953
Don't worry about the hrefs or
the src's or any of that stuff,

20
00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:12.259
just write the path
right there in the spot.

21
00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.260
And we have an answer sheet here for
you as well.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.581
That is the sitemap answers.pdf.

23
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:22.969
So you can check your answers and make
sure that you've got everything right.
