WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:02.713
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So we've done a ton
of stuff in this course so far.

2
00:00:02.713 --> 00:00:06.705
We know all about files and folders,
we've downloaded sublime text.

3
00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:10.874
I know you're just itching to go ahead and
start creating a website.

4
00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:15.343
So this video is for Mac people, and
we're gonna start talking about file and

5
00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:16.658
folder conventions.

6
00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:20.577
For a typical website,
there's a seperate video for

7
00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:25.115
UPC people where you can follow
on with the same information.

8
00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:30.609
And so for Mac people, as you know, you
can have all your files in one location,

9
00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.460
you don't have to organize anything
by folders if you don't want to.

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.981
But it's always a good idea to do that so
you can actually find things later.

11
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.040
And as time has evolved in
the web development industry,

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.176
we've come up with some standards for
this type of thing.

13
00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:50.155
And so it's pretty typical to have
the following folder structure for

14
00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.674
a simple web design project like
the ones we'll be building.

15
00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:56.433
And so
that folder structure is just like this.

16
00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:59.051
We're gonna have one main folder for

17
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:03.534
the website which is gonna contain
three folders inside of it.

18
00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:08.337
So the three folders inside will be
called css for CSS files, img for

19
00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:11.294
image files and js for JavaScript files.

20
00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:15.848
And then all of the html that is
associated with the website will go into

21
00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:17.634
that main website folder.

22
00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:23.928
That main website been foldered
can be called whatever you want.

23
00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:25.507
Let's go in ahead and

24
00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:30.348
give that structure they are trying
right now, and so to do that.

25
00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:35.262
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Just go in
ahead to your desktop, and

26
00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:38.759
what you can do here is make
sure you're in your finder.

27
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.491
Just click somewhere on the desktop
where there isn't anything, and

28
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:44.969
then you're gonna go ahead and
make a folder.

29
00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.595
There's two ways of doing that,
one way is to simply go File, New Folder.

30
00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:52.502
That works, or you can right-click or

31
00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:57.437
Ctrl-click if you don't happen
to have a two-button mouse, and

32
00:01:57.437 --> 00:02:02.651
that will also give you a menu which
will allow you to make a new folder.

33
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:06.112
Okay, so for my folder,
I'm going to give this a name,

34
00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.407
I'm gonna call this demo-finish.

35
00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:13.747
Inside of demo-finished, go ahead and
double click on it to open it and

36
00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:17.396
this is where we can add
our individual folders.

37
00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:23.600
So I'm going to just go ahead and
right click or Control click here inside.

38
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.432
Go ahead and choose new folder and
I'm gonna call this one css

39
00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:32.612
It's best of you call these
all lowercase letters.

40
00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:39.106
Don't capitalize things, I'll explain why
later, just keep it all lowercase for now.

41
00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:42.716
We're gonna make another
one here called img.

42
00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:49.805
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And we'll make a final
folder here Called JS for Javascript.

43
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:56.778
Now, Mac has a lot, displays these
folders in a lot of differennt ways.

44
00:02:56.778 --> 00:03:00.856
The way this one is displayed may not
look like your particular folder.

45
00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:06.056
This buttons on top will change that
configurations so we can change it to look

46
00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:11.422
however you want In whatever way you want,
I'm gonna make mine look like this.

47
00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:15.976
This is the second button over, the one
with the whole bunch of lines on it.

48
00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:20.784
As it says here, show the items as icons,
and the list in columns, just like that,

49
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.653
that's what I'm looking for.

50
00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:26.804
So, that is where we're going
to be putting our various files.

51
00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:31.807
And I had some files that we can work
with to drag into these folders.

52
00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:35.472
What we're gonna need to
do is download those, so

53
00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:38.455
go on ahead and open up your web browser.

54
00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:44.181
And where we would like to go
is bit.ly/internetfundamentals.

55
00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:49.711
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All one word,
go on ahead and do that.

56
00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:53.399
And you'll see that a file
will download here.

57
00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.333
There's no web page that loads,
it just happens to be that.

58
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.115
We found this to be an easy
way to set this up so

59
00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:02.219
as you have the files that you need for
the class.

60
00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:07.660
Go on ahead and click on the little arrow
next to this and say show and find her,

61
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.937
and that will show you your downloads
folder and we can just simply drag this

62
00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:18.086
zipped file right on off to your
desktop and close the downloads folder.

63
00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:21.931
So from right here on the desktop you'll
see it says webtoolsandinfastructure.zip.

64
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:27.064
Go ahead and double click on it,
that will unzipp it.

65
00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:30.043
And we'll have a folder here called
web tools and infastructure.

66
00:04:30.043 --> 00:04:35.602
I'm gonna take the zip file and just put
it on the trash to clear my desktop.

67
00:04:35.602 --> 00:04:37.896
Open up web tools and infrastructure.

68
00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:42.778
Inside of here, the folder that we want
is the one called starting website,

69
00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:47.662
go ahead and drag that to the desktop,
and then you can close the web tools and

70
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.363
infrastructure window.

71
00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:53.235
So, I've got,
demo finish over here on the side and

72
00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:58.780
next to that I'm going to put another
window which is my starting website.

73
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.962
So here you'll see I have
a bunch of files here.

74
00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:08.290
My extensions are all turned on so you
can see that these are JavaScript files,

75
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.128
JPEGs, PNGs, HTMLs, CSS and so forth.

76
00:05:11.128 --> 00:05:15.863
And so these need to be put into the
correct folders in the demo finish folder.

77
00:05:15.863 --> 00:05:17.457
How do we know what goes where?

78
00:05:17.457 --> 00:05:19.930
Well, I'll show you.

79
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.817
So what we're going to do is there
are specific file types that go in

80
00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:25.875
each folder.

81
00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.506
If the file ends in HTM or HTML,

82
00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:33.687
then you're going to put that
into the main website folder.

83
00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:38.215
If it ends in .css, those are css
files that go in the css folder.

84
00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:42.691
If it ends in .js, those are JavaScript
files that go in the js folder.

85
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:48.797
For the images, there are only three kinds
of images that are supported on the web.

86
00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:52.920
This is all the web, it's not a browser
thing, it's just the way things are.

87
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.003
Those three image types are JPGs,
GIFs, and PNG files.

88
00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:03.348
That means images like TIFFs and BMPs or
EPS files, or Adobe Illustrator native

89
00:06:03.348 --> 00:06:08.242
files, or Photoshop native files,
those are not supported by the web.

90
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:11.345
You cannot open them up on the web or
put them in a web browser.

91
00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:16.315
So all of the images have to be JPG,
GIF or PNG.

92
00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:22.903
So once you got that clear,
now we go back.

93
00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:27.420
Weâ€™ll just go through our various files
here and drag them into our folders.

94
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.444
So if we start with css If you click the
little down arrow next to the css folder,

95
00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:35.045
that'll show you what's inside of it.

96
00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:38.289
Right now there's nothing, because of
course, we just created the folder.

97
00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.779
But over here on the right side,
in our starting-website folder,

98
00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.529
we can grab styles.css.

99
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:50.340
Go on ahead and grab that, click and drag
on over to the css folder, and let it go.

100
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.343
And we now have our
styles.CSS in our CSS folder.

101
00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:58.061
Let's do our images next.

102
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:02.340
We have cherry almond.jpg,
that's an image file.

103
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.512
We're gonna click and
drag that on over to the image folder.

104
00:07:06.512 --> 00:07:10.411
It's sort of disappeared there,
if you hit the down arrow,

105
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:13.019
you'll see that the image made it over.

106
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:19.413
Let's do the same thing for
clouds.png that's another image file.

107
00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:23.163
And logo.png another image file.

108
00:07:23.163 --> 00:07:24.333
Great.

109
00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.151
So we've got all of those in place.

110
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:29.459
And then finally we have accordion.js,

111
00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:33.717
that's gonna go over here
to the JavaScript folder.

112
00:07:33.717 --> 00:07:37.551
Let me just go ahead and
click and drag that on over.

113
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.611
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
what do we do with this index.html?

114
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:45.426
That goes inside of the main folder.

115
00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:50.217
Not in css, images, or js,
we don't make a folder called HTML,

116
00:07:50.217 --> 00:07:53.790
we're simply going to take
the index dot html and

117
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.645
drag it right here into
the main demo finish folder.

118
00:07:57.645 --> 00:08:02.547
If you tighten up all those other folders,
you'll see here's index.html

119
00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:06.388
at the same level as your css image and
JavaScript folders.

120
00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:11.921
Finally, we have one file leftovers,
this is a thing called DS_Store,

121
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:16.126
this is a max specific file,
it occasionally shows up.

122
00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:19.413
If these files have been going from a Mac,
they went through a PC and

123
00:08:19.413 --> 00:08:23.009
maybe they came back to a Mac,
sometimes you'll see this file in place.

124
00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:26.916
This is actually a Mac file that
is present on Macintoshes but

125
00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:30.134
normally we don't see it
as Macintosh users and so

126
00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:33.368
this actually has nothing
to do with the website.

127
00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:38.135
You may see .DS_Store show up in a whole
bunch of places, just ignore it.

128
00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:40.016
It's not anything that's critical or

129
00:08:40.016 --> 00:08:43.322
anything that you're going to need
in order to get your work done, so

130
00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.231
you can just go ahead and
close the starting website folder.

131
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:50.534
So you've essentially built your first
website, you have all your files,

132
00:08:50.534 --> 00:08:55.039
all in their collect folders, I'm sure
you're wondering what it looks like,

133
00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.208
I will show you that in the next video.
