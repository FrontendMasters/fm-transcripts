00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.369
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Hello Mac people.

2
00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.379
This video is for you.

3
00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.284
If you're a PC person,
skip right on over this video and

4
00:00:07.284 --> 00:00:12.366
go watch a video of the same name but
is for PC people and for Windows 10.

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.897
This is just for you Mac people.

6
00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:19.726
So as you take a look at your Macintosh,
I assume you have basic computer skills,

7
00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:22.720
you're pretty familiar
with how your Mac looks.

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.682
This is the desktop of my computer.

9
00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:27.767
It's super clean cuz I
cleaned it all off for you.

10
00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.450
Nothing there to confuse you.

11
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.039
So as you see here, the only thing
that's available to me is my hard drive.

12
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.840
If you click somewhere here on the desktop
where there's nothing located, so

13
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.718
if you have a bunch of files and
stuff all over your desktop,

14
00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:43.035
just click somewhere
where there's nothing.

15
00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.665
You'll see this menu come up
across the top of your Macintosh,

16
00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:50.647
this is called the finder, and
the finder is your files and folders.

17
00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:55.516
And so, we can get into this
by simply going into File

18
00:00:55.516 --> 00:01:00.505
under the Finder and
then going to New Finder Window.

19
00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:02.116
This is gonna go ahead and

20
00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:06.183
open up a window here that's gonna
show you all of your files and

21
00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:11.510
folders that were created, in my case,
created recently here on this computer.

22
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.741
So over here on the side,
we have a bunch of stuff.

23
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.213
We have a desktop that is a folder.

24
00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:20.509
We have downloads, that's a folder.

25
00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.633
We have documents, that's a folder.

26
00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.508
The Cloud drive, that's a folder.

27
00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:26.039
Dropbox, that's a folder.

28
00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.380
Recent, that's a folder.

29
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.948
Everything is a folder, okay?

30
00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:34.685
And so you can get on in here and
you can move around and

31
00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:39.110
click on things and
get inside of these folders.

32
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.892
That's the way that you
would go about doing that.

33
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:48.197
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now let's talk very
specifically about extensions for

34
00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:50.262
your various files and so forth.

35
00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:53.091
So you might have noticed here

36
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.964
in my recent files that I
have a bunch of files here.

37
00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:02.624
For example, I have this file here and
it's called index.HTML.

38
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:05.243
So it's got a dot after it and
some more letters.

39
00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:09.108
Now if you take a look at your recent
files, over there on the side,

40
00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.713
you may see a bunch of files here
that have nothing after that.

41
00:02:12.713 --> 00:02:15.941
So it might just say index or
accordion or styles.

42
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:20.162
And of course, you should know too
that these are my recent files.

43
00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:22.129
Your recent files
are going to be different,

44
00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.996
you're gonna have different
things in this particular folder.

45
00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:29.048
So you might be wondering
how you can turn that on so

46
00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.631
that you can see .html or .css, or .png.

47
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.560
I've got a bunch of
stuff going on in there.

48
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.949
And so the way you would go about
doing that is you're going to go,

49
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.057
make sure you're still in your finder.

50
00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:42.730
It says finder up here in
the upper right-hand corner.

51
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.025
And you're going to go
to Finder &gt; Preferences.

52
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
then you wanna click on the Advanced tab.

53
00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:58.739
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And in here, we want to
make sure that the item that says,

54
00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.921
show all filename extensions,
make sure that is checked.

55
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.881
Make sure that is checked off and
probably,

56
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.046
the best place to be as you do
that is probably on your desktop.

57
00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:18.374
Just make sure that those extensions
are turned on pretty much everywhere.

58
00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:22.953
But go ahead and check that box that says,
show all file name extensions and

59
00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.433
then you can go ahead and close that box.

60
00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.855
And then when you go back to your recents
folder, you may need to go out of it and

61
00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.093
then go back into it.

62
00:03:31.093 --> 00:03:33.910
You should wind up seeing
some sort of extensions,

63
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.343
some kind of dot followed
by those letters.

64
00:03:36.343 --> 00:03:40.357
And it's usually three to four
letters after the name of the file and

65
00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:42.196
those are called extensions.

66
00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:48.574
So this is telling me that I have, these
are HTML files, that's a JavaScript file.

67
00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:52.102
This is a CSS file, this is a PDF file.

68
00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:55.100
So I have all kinds of different
files that are going on here in my

69
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.958
recents folder.

70
00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:01.432
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right, and so that is
the way that you're gonna go ahead and

71
00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:04.879
get access to your files and folders here
on your Mac and make sure that you have

72
00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.301
your extensions turned on, super
important as you start web development.
