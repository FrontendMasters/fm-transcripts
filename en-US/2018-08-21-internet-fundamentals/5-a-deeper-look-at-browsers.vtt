00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now that you know a little
bit about domain names and web host,

2
00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:07.046
let's take a little bit of a closer
look at the web browser itself.

3
00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:11.253
So remember I mentioned where a web
browser was it's that piece of software

4
00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:15.390
that runs on the client, that's going
to the display a web page for you and

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.827
there are tons of choices of web
browsers that are out there.

6
00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:21.457
But generally speaking is
we work in web development,

7
00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:25.073
we're typically gonna do that on
the computer that's here in front of us.

8
00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:27.845
It's usually a laptop or
a desktop computer and

9
00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:32.628
it's going to be running two specific
browsers that are highly recommended, and

10
00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:36.025
are pretty much used by all web
professionals out there for

11
00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:39.857
development purposes, and
that would be Chrome, and Firefox.

12
00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:43.604
So these are the standard commercial
browsers that you can just go and

13
00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:45.096
download or what you want.

14
00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:47.213
You'll want to install
these on your computer.

15
00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.317
You may also hear about something
called Chrome Canary and

16
00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.416
something called Firefox Developer.

17
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:57.026
These are the latest, hottest, most
cutting-edge browsers that are out there.

18
00:00:57.026 --> 00:00:59.398
They still haven't gone
through full testing.

19
00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:00.501
They may be full of bugs.

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.501
They may have all kinds of other issues.

21
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.415
Sometimes, these are helpful for

22
00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:08.709
developers who are doing some really
cutting edge programming techniques.

23
00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:12.035
But generally speaking, for
where you are right now and

24
00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:16.282
your learning process, you don't
need to worry about Chrome Canary or

25
00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:20.477
the Firefox Developer browser just
go ahead and stay away from those.

26
00:01:20.477 --> 00:01:23.467
Just use the standard issue Chrome and

27
00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:27.682
Firefox that you'll find
out there on the internet.

28
00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:33.583
Now one of the things about front-end web
development is centered all around this

29
00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:39.158
browser and I got to tell you, this is
the hard part of working on the browser.

30
00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:42.212
Every browser does things
slightly differently.

31
00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:47.199
We've become so much better at this now,
20 years after the fact.

32
00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:50.176
When I was getting into the field,
we were really fragmented.

33
00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.511
We had one way of doing
things in Netscape and

34
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.429
a different way of doing
things in Internet Explorer.

35
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.204
And we really had to code two websites,
one for each kind of browser.

36
00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:02.204
We've become more standards
compliant through the years,

37
00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:04.572
bu there are still issues
with these browsers.

38
00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:08.989
One of the notable things is that
the front-end web development in terms of

39
00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.967
the programming that we have available to
us is rapidly advancing and changing, and

40
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.353
people are not updating their
computers as frequently.

41
00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:21.199
So we have browsers that understand
one level of programming from 10 or

42
00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.351
15 years ago and
we have programming techniques that have

43
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:28.401
evolved since then that these older
browsers they just don't understand.

44
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:32.946
Because when they were invented and
the browser was programmed,

45
00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:35.929
these web programs simply didn't exist.

46
00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.958
So one of the biggest defenders in
this category is Internet Explorer.

47
00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.878
And currently, it's last released.

48
00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:46.114
The very last time Internet Explorer
was released was in 2013.

49
00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:51.761
It's Internet Explorer version 11 and it's
still out there in the news 5 years later.

50
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:53.938
Some people had started the move to Edge.

51
00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.414
Edge is gonna have automatic updates.

52
00:02:55.414 --> 00:02:59.418
So this will be less of a problem in
the future, but this is something that is

53
00:02:59.418 --> 00:03:03.248
going to haunt you throughout your
front-end web developing career.

54
00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:07.772
What browsers exactly are my
target audience using and

55
00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:12.587
what level of programming am I
able to do in order to satisfy

56
00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:16.341
those browsers that they
happen to be using?

57
00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:21.432
So as I said, the web pages can look
different in different browsers.

58
00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.934
This is something that commonly happens.

59
00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:27.052
The browser may not support
those latest technology choices.

60
00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:28.842
That's often at the root of this.

61
00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.920
The browser may render some of
that programming incorrectly and

62
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.948
that is just something that
you're gonna wind up testing for.

63
00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:39.133
So you're gonna need to just test your
work in many different browsers and

64
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.571
devices to ensure consistent rendering.

65
00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:44.633
So what's gonna happen eventually
as you evolve in your career?

66
00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:49.153
You're gonna be doing a project,
the client in terms of the person who owns

67
00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:53.602
the website will tell you most of
the people that visit my website are using

68
00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:58.593
the following web browsers and you'll need
to make sure that you test with those.

69
00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:02.614
So I went ahead and I took a look
at the front-end master's website.

70
00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:07.461
And on the left side here, we have
Chrome 10 which was released in 2011.

71
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:13.002
And on the right side here, we have
Chrome 51 which was released in 2016 and

72
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:17.322
I went on to a website called
Browsershots that will go ahead and

73
00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:21.724
run your website through a whole
bunch of different browsers and

74
00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:23.863
show you what this looks like.

75
00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:28.797
So I can guarantee that guys who built
the front-end master's website had no care

76
00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:32.388
as to what Chrome 10 looked like for
the current website.

77
00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:34.098
Their target audience isn't using it.

78
00:04:34.098 --> 00:04:37.767
Really, nobody is using it anymore
from this automatic updates.

79
00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:41.202
But as you can see here on
the left-hand side that, that web

80
00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:46.084
page look somewhat different than it does
over here at the right side in Chrome 51,

81
00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:50.624
a later version of the browser and
that's because programming has evolved and

82
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:54.440
the techniques that was used
here were not existing in 2011.

83
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.882
So it doesn't say anything about
the front-end master's programmers,

84
00:04:57.882 --> 00:04:59.637
they're doing a perfectly good job.

85
00:04:59.637 --> 00:05:05.285
This is just to show you that the website
browsers themselves are technology from

86
00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:11.113
a certain period of time and they may not
necessarily render your page faithfully.

87
00:05:11.113 --> 00:05:14.084
Here is what does work very well, though.

88
00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:18.424
That page there on the left-hand side even
though it's not all the latest bells and

89
00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:21.648
whistles, it's still very readable,
very navigatable and

90
00:05:21.648 --> 00:05:25.442
it's very easy to get the information
that you need out of that website.

91
00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:29.937
Ultimately, that's the best
test of whether you're website

92
00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:32.747
is compatible with certain browsers.

93
00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:36.516
So now you are all panicked,
what browser should I support?

94
00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:39.122
Well, the answer is always, it depends.

95
00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:44.024
As you are beginner, what I do in my
classes at Harvard University is I

96
00:05:44.024 --> 00:05:48.180
tell the students just focus
on either Chrome or Firefox.

97
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.159
Pick one just focus on that.

98
00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.667
It's either gonna work right
on your Mac or your PC.

99
00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:56.907
And when I actually do grading, I have my
students tell me, is it a Mac on Firefox?

100
00:05:56.907 --> 00:05:59.275
Is it a Chrome on a PC?

101
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:02.317
To make sure that I'm grading
them under those conditions.

102
00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:07.557
You can always backfill your technology
later and worry about that stuff later.

103
00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:13.006
So right now, it's really important
just to concentrate on the standards

104
00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:18.194
compliant way of doing things and
the latest best ways of doing things,

105
00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:21.758
and then we can backfill for
the old technology.
