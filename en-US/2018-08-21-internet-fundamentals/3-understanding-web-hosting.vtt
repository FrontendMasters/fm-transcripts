00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.921
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
I told you all about Web servers.

2
00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:06.533
You might be interested in how you would
go about getting a particular web server.

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.028
Well, the way you go about doing
that is through web hosting.

4
00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:12.979
So your website is going to have a home.

5
00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.841
You can run it on the computer that's
sitting right there in front of you, but

6
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.037
I can't recommend it.

7
00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:20.271
Just cuz you can doesn't mean you should.

8
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:23.565
And if you were to run your website on
the computer in front of you, you'd have

9
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.930
people from all over the world getting
into your computer to see your website.

10
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.954
And possibly hacking into other things.

11
00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:32.013
It's just not really a good idea.

12
00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:36.186
So it's far better to go and
rent some space on a server somewhere.

13
00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.089
And the way you would do
that is through web hosting.

14
00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.581
And there are lots and lots and
lots of web hosts out there.

15
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:45.322
At this point,
as you're just starting out,

16
00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:48.639
pretty much any of them
are perfectly okay to work with.

17
00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.107
Some characteristics of a good web host.

18
00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:54.641
So first of all, they're going to make
sure that they update that web server and

19
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:55.396
keep it secure.

20
00:00:55.396 --> 00:01:00.436
It's generally the web host's problem to
update things like the operating system,

21
00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.612
to operate the web server software.

22
00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:06.233
To operate any other software that
happens to be running on the web server.

23
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:11.536
As you'll see later on, they are maybe
languages like PHP, or Python or something

24
00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:16.490
like that that's running on the server or
databases that need to be updated.

25
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.029
The web host is going
to provide high uptime.

26
00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:24.024
Uptime is a term that means that
the website is active and available.

27
00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.014
That's pretty much all it means.

28
00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:28.962
Every once in a while,
a server is going to, quote,

29
00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:32.117
go down, meaning that nobody
can access your website.

30
00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:36.198
Generally speaking, it happens to
everybody at some point during the year,

31
00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:40.150
unless you pay lots of money to have
a very redundant sort of web host where,

32
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.194
if one computer goes down,
some other one can take over.

33
00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:46.892
But for the cheap and cheerful route
at the beginning where we are,

34
00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:50.674
chances are your website may go down for
just a few hours every year.

35
00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:54.594
That's considered to be very high uptime.

36
00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:58.642
You'll also wanna make sure that your web
host is providing you with, so-called,

37
00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:00.990
bandwidth, a reasonable
amount of bandwidth.

38
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.518
Bandwidth is just, in this context,

39
00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:08.101
it's actually a misuse of the better term,
which is data transfer.

40
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:13.007
Every file, and video and picture
that you put up on your website has

41
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.722
a certain amount of disk
space associated with it.

42
00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:19.419
It's gonna cost money to transfer out.

43
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.561
This is very similar to the data plan
that you have on your mobile phone.

44
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:26.486
And so what you wanna be sure is that your
web host is giving you enough bandwidth

45
00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:30.007
that it can accommodate whatever
traffic that you're going to have.

46
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.385
Again, at the very beginning as
you're building a portfolio site and

47
00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:37.232
you're only having a few dozen visitors
a month, it's probably not an issue.

48
00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:41.011
But it might be something you wanna
be aware of as you get bigger and

49
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:42.536
you get more successful.

50
00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:46.116
And then finally, web hosts should
provide technical support as needed.

51
00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:49.792
Typically speaking,
a web host will provide technical

52
00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:53.467
support through an online chat,
or through the phone,

53
00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:57.940
or through email or some type of
ticket system that they might have.

54
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.980
Some good web hosts that my students have
worked with, that they're very happy

55
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.252
with include SiteGround,
InMotion Hosting or DigitalOcean.

56
00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:09.463
This is just a place to start, there are
lots of really good web hosts out there.

57
00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:12.393
However, I recommend you
stay away from a few.

58
00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:15.153
Personally, I would not
do business with GoDaddy.

59
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.829
I really don't like the marketing
that they've done for years.

60
00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.626
But besides that, they're really
just not a very good web host.

61
00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:22.550
Bluehost and

62
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.761
HostGator are also two that very commonly
come up in this sort of context.

63
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.942
But again, I've had a lot of people
who have had very bad experiences with

64
00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:33.439
Bluehost and HostGator.

65
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.974
So personally,
I would stay away from them,

66
00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:39.322
you might wanna take a look at
one of these for your hosting.

67
00:03:39.322 --> 00:03:42.929
Now, how are we gonna go about
transferring the files that

68
00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:47.720
we create here on the computer that's
in front of you, over to your web host?

69
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.730
That's typically done through something
called FTP, the file transfer protocol.

70
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.965
[COUGH] So basically you're going to
create those web files right there on your

71
00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:57.623
computer.

72
00:03:57.623 --> 00:04:00.390
You're gonna organize them in folders and
so forth.

73
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.509
And then you're gonna transfer all of
that through FTP up to the web host.

74
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:09.564
FileZilla is the software that's
typically used for doing this.

75
00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:12.043
It's free, it's available on Mac and PC.

76
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.747
And it's pretty straightforward to use.

77
00:04:14.747 --> 00:04:18.384
So the web host should tell you
everything you need to know in

78
00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:20.580
order to create an FTP connection.

79
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.574
And to send your information from your
computer up to your web host safely and

80
00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:26.364
securely.

81
00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:31.500
So FileZilla might be a piece of
software that you'll need for that.

82
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.880
Another thing you're gonna
need is a domain name.

83
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.364
And the domain name, of course, is what do
we type in on the computer to actually get

84
00:04:38.364 --> 00:04:41.007
to your website,
that's the website address.

85
00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:46.324
There are a ton of different endings for
these, but the best known one is .com.

86
00:04:46.324 --> 00:04:50.416
And so a lot of people like
to try to get a .com name.

87
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:55.027
Your host will provide you with
a temporary web address to get started.

88
00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:58.743
It'll be something kinda long and
kinda weird looking.

89
00:04:58.743 --> 00:05:04.588
It may have a tilde in it, that's that
funny character that goes in a curve.

90
00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:07.986
It's not very memorable,
because it is very temporary.

91
00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:10.810
It is expected that you're
gonna buy a domain name.

92
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.509
And there's so much more to say
about those particular domain names.

93
00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.397
So I'll address those in the next video.
