00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.136
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer This next video is for
you Mac people only.

2
00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.280
Windows people,
you can skip on to the next video,

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.171
which we'll talk about the same
information but for Windows.

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.211
In order to edit HTML, CSS, and

5
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.760
JavaScript you're going to need
a piece of software called an editor.

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.946
There are approximately 5 bajillion
kinds of editors that are out there.

7
00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:26.441
Paid, free, Windows, Macintosh,
all kinds of different types of editors.

8
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:31.901
But one of the most popular ones right
now is called Visual Studio code,

9
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:33.903
and it's for Microsoft.

10
00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:39.080
You can get to the website by
going to code.visualstudio.com.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.194
And this is where you can download and

12
00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:46.526
install this particular
editor on your computer.

13
00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:50.465
So it should say automatically as
you arrive here on the web page,

14
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:51.619
Download for Mac.

15
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:55.847
Go on ahead and just click on that button,
and it should go ahead and

16
00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.972
download that software for you.

17
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:07.444
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer Okay, so
when it's done downloading,

18
00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:09.513
mine went to my downloads folder.

19
00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:13.629
I'm gonna drag it here on to the desktop
just so you can see what's happening but

20
00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:16.650
you can leave the ZIP in your
downloads folder if you want.

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.611
I'm gonna go ahead and
double click on this to to unzip it,

22
00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:25.852
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer And once you've unzipped it,

23
00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:30.135
you'll find this icon here it says,
Visual Studio Code.app.

24
00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:32.788
So this is the application itself.

25
00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:36.490
What you'll wanna do now, is drag that
into your applications folder, so

26
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.486
from here on the finder, click anywhere
on the desktop where there's no icons,

27
00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:41.630
to get to your finder.

28
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.428
Go to Go and go ahead and
choose Applications.

29
00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:49.981
This is all of the applications
that are on your Mac,

30
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.906
your list will be different than mine.

31
00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:53.766
And then just go ahead and

32
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:58.735
drag Visual Studio Code.app right
here into your Applications.

33
00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:02.799
And it'll show up down there under
V in your applications listing.

34
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.563
Double-click on it to open it.

35
00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:12.428
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer And once you have unpacked
that particular application you'll get

36
00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:15.266
a message that looks something like this,
and

37
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:20.090
you're gonna wanna click the Open button
in order to open up the application.

38
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.054
If you have different buttons
on here with different options,

39
00:02:24.054 --> 00:02:28.468
your permissions are set somewhat
differently on your computer, and

40
00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:31.038
you may need to do something different.

41
00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:33.792
But for most people,
this is what they'll see.

42
00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:39.762
Go ahead and click Open, and
this is what you should see now.

43
00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:43.680
So this is the Visual Studio Code
in the default dark theme.

44
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.386
And I'll show other things that
you can do with Visual Studio.

45
00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:52.962
Right now, if you wanna change those
color schemes, something different

46
00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:57.624
than what you see here, go to Code and
then go to Preferences, Color theme.

47
00:02:57.624 --> 00:03:02.028
And this will give you an option
of many different kinds of

48
00:03:02.028 --> 00:03:06.547
color schemes that you can use
to work with Visual Studio.

49
00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:10.926
As you can see, up here on the top, there
are various light themes, in other words,

50
00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:12.728
light background with dark text.

51
00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:17.133
We're in the dark themes here, these
are the dark backgrounds with light text.

52
00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.518
And then there's also some high contrast
themes that are down here towards

53
00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:22.182
the bottom, that are very useful for

54
00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:24.560
people with various sorts
of visual disabilities.

55
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.665
So pick a color scheme that works great
for you and feel free to change it.

56
00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:32.085
I'm just gonna stick with
the default dark theme.

57
00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.379
So if you've gotten this part,
you're doing great.

58
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.116
I'll show you what else to
do in the coming videos.
