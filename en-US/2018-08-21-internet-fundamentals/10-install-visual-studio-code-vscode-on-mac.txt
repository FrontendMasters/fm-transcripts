>> Jen Kramer This next video is for you Mac people only. Windows people, you can skip on to the next video, which we'll talk about the same information but for Windows. In order to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you're going to need a piece of software called an editor. There are approximately 5 bajillion kinds of editors that are out there.

[00:00:20]
Paid, free, Windows, Macintosh, all kinds of different types of editors. But one of the most popular ones right now is called Visual Studio code, and it's for Microsoft. You can get to the website by going to code.visualstudio.com. And this is where you can download and install this particular editor on your computer.

[00:00:46]
So it should say automatically as you arrive here on the web page, Download for Mac. Go on ahead and just click on that button, and it should go ahead and download that software for you.
>> Jen Kramer Okay, so when it's done downloading, mine went to my downloads folder. I'm gonna drag it here on to the desktop just so you can see what's happening but you can leave the ZIP in your downloads folder if you want.

[00:01:16]
I'm gonna go ahead and double click on this to to unzip it,
>> Jen Kramer And once you've unzipped it, you'll find this icon here it says, Visual Studio Code.app. So this is the application itself. What you'll wanna do now, is drag that into your applications folder, so from here on the finder, click anywhere on the desktop where there's no icons, to get to your finder.

[00:01:41]
Go to Go and go ahead and choose Applications. This is all of the applications that are on your Mac, your list will be different than mine. And then just go ahead and drag Visual Studio Code.app right here into your Applications. And it'll show up down there under V in your applications listing.

[00:02:02]
Double-click on it to open it.
>> Jen Kramer And once you have unpacked that particular application you'll get a message that looks something like this, and you're gonna wanna click the Open button in order to open up the application. If you have different buttons on here with different options, your permissions are set somewhat differently on your computer, and you may need to do something different.

[00:02:31]
But for most people, this is what they'll see. Go ahead and click Open, and this is what you should see now. So this is the Visual Studio Code in the default dark theme. And I'll show other things that you can do with Visual Studio. Right now, if you wanna change those color schemes, something different than what you see here, go to Code and then go to Preferences, Color theme.

[00:02:57]
And this will give you an option of many different kinds of color schemes that you can use to work with Visual Studio. As you can see, up here on the top, there are various light themes, in other words, light background with dark text. We're in the dark themes here, these are the dark backgrounds with light text.

[00:03:17]
And then there's also some high contrast themes that are down here towards the bottom, that are very useful for people with various sorts of visual disabilities. So pick a color scheme that works great for you and feel free to change it. I'm just gonna stick with the default dark theme.

[00:03:32]
So if you've gotten this part, you're doing great. I'll show you what else to do in the coming videos.
