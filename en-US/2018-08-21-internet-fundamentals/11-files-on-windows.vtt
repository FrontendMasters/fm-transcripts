00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.027
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This next video is for
PC people only.

2
00:00:03.027 --> 00:00:05.936
Mac people,
there's a different video for you.

3
00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:09.398
And this video is
pertaining to Windows 10.

4
00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:13.856
There may be some differences
with older versions of Windows,

5
00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:18.829
slightly different locations and
things, and menus, and so forth.

6
00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.738
But overall, you should be able
to follow along with this video

7
00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:25.265
if you have an older version of Windows.

8
00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:29.553
And if you have Windows 10, then you are
all set, everything should be just geat.

9
00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:34.180
So what I want to show you first
here is how to locate your file

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.319
structure here on your PC.

11
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:41.539
And there's a couple of ways doing this,
as always, but first of all,

12
00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.207
very consistently on all the computers,
you can go to the Start menu, here.

13
00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:53.919
And what you're going to do is scroll
down your list of applications here.

14
00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:58.795
And you wanna go down all
the way down to W, for Windows.

15
00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:03.593
And there is an item here for
the Windows System.

16
00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:06.846
And if you open that up, then you'll
find a link here for the File Explorer.

17
00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:12.320
In the couple of PCs that I've used,
there's also been a File Explorer

18
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.539
shortcut pinned down here to the bottom
taskbar, that's the same exact thing.

19
00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:19.996
If you have that available,

20
00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.285
that's certainly the easiest way
to get to your File Explorer.

21
00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:26.725
But if for whatever reason you've
unpinned that or something,

22
00:01:26.725 --> 00:01:30.239
you can find it here under
Windows System and then File Explorer.

23
00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.640
Go ahead and click on that.

24
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
And this is gonna open up your whole
file and folder structure for your PC.

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.997
And as I said, sometimes they don't
look like folders, but they are.

26
00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:44.085
So we have here a folder for
the Desktop, Downloads, Documents,

27
00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:45.698
Pictures, and so forth.

28
00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:50.718
And if you take a look inside of these,
for example, if we take a look inside

29
00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:55.440
the Downloads folder, we'll see
things that have been downloaded.

30
00:01:58.253 --> 00:01:58.753
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: In just a moment.

31
00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:08.008
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So here is a series of
things that have been downloaded on this

32
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:09.003
particular PC.

33
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:14.001
We can make the Name column little
bit wider by pulling over, the column

34
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:19.082
up there on the very top of the page and
you'll see that in this particular

35
00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:24.777
situation we have a bunch of files here
that have extensions associated with it.

36
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:29.228
Remember, the extension is a dot and a
three to four letter code that comes after

37
00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:32.225
it, which tell us what kinds
of documents these are.

38
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:37.016
Now the icons can somewhat give that away,
but it's always good if you can

39
00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:42.363
actually see that extension, particularly
when we're doing web development.

40
00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:43.404
So turning on those extensions

41
00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:45.171
is relatively straightforward
inside of Windows.

42
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:49.371
If you go up to the top of the screen,
go to View and

43
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:54.810
click on that, look for
the box here for File name extensions.

44
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.159
And if you go ahead and check that,

45
00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.427
that is gonna turn on those file name
extensions for this particular folder.

46
00:03:02.427 --> 00:03:07.112
So you see here in the Downloads folder,
we now have things that are labeled as

47
00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:10.646
msi's or exes's and pdf's and
all kinds of other various

48
00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:15.430
file extensions that are here, but this
may not turn it on for all the folders.

49
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.944
If I go into, let's say, My documents
folder and I go to my GitHub folder here,

50
00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:27.214
well, okay, good,
those extensions are also turned on here.

51
00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:30.675
So it could be that this is turned on for
all places on your computer.

52
00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:36.025
If at any point you discover a folder
where those extensions are not turned on,

53
00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:37.901
you just do the same thing.

54
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.876
Go up here to View and look for file name
extensions right on up here under Show

55
00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:47.178
hide, over on the right side,
there is a check box here for that.

56
00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:53.823
Just make sure that's checked off and
then you'll be able to see the extensions.
