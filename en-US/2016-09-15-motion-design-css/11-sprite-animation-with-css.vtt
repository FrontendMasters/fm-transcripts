[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:05.608
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So
let's do something neat with that block.

3
00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:10.870
Let's do something that we can't
do with transitions alone.

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.400
But first, let's take a little segue
into the land of traditional animation.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.640
This is a walk cycle I'm using with
the permission of a friend of mine,

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.680
Steven Gordon.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.865
He was the key frame animator and
character designer for

8
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:29.336
X-Men Evolution way back in the 90s,
if anyone remembers it.

9
00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:32.830
Anybody remember X-Men Evolution?

10
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.330
My people.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.240
When I was in the Philippines, the entire
class was like, X-men Evolution!

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.450
Apparently it was a pretty
big deal in Manila.

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.260
But some people in America
still remember it.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.530
So this is my favorite character,
it's Rogue.

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.800
She's the kind of,
goth teen of the X kids and

16
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.910
this is the sort of walk
cycle that animation students

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.900
spend their first couple of semesters
working on, to add to their portfolio.

18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.610
And by the time they're done with it,

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.040
they realize why people send so
much animation work overseas.

20
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.200
Because this is kind of the busy work
of animation in-betweening all of these

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.890
these these key frames
to create this cycle.

22
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
But what Steven Gordon did when he
made this particular walk cycle is,

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.600
when he designed these characters and

24
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.610
they were shipping them off to overseas
animation houses, he needed to communicate

25
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.960
with animators what each of the characters
would look like when they walked.

26
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.760
So those animators could make informed
decisions about how they should walk

27
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.500
across the screen to go get a glass of
water, how their movement would be.

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.630
And he had one for each of the characters,
this is the one he had for

29
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.789
Rogue, pretty cool,
nice little visual communication trick.

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.570
It's kind of the hello world of animation.

31
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.620
So I wanted to give you all the chance
to make your own walk cycle.

32
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.960
I've already done the painful part,
which is making all of the sprites and

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.100
frames that you're going to need.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.880
I already did that, thank you.

35
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.520
It took a long time,
I did not outsource it to another country.

36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.270
It's all American animation.

37
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.550
My goodness, this is what one
of those looks like on paper.

38
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.060
Let me tell you a little bit
about these different columns.

39
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.130
This isn't the entire cycle.

40
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.680
This is a big sprite sheet
containing several different tunas.

41
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.680
The one all the way there on
the left is the first four or

42
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.960
five frames of the walk cycle that he has.

43
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.100
The second column is a,
from walk to sitting cycle.

44
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.090
You might run between having
him going from walking

45
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.620
to sitting down behind a computer.

46
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.280
The third one is a transition
from a walk to a run.

47
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.600
And the fourth one is a running
cycle of him running really fast.

48
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.930
So you would play that third one in
between the first and the fourth.

49
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.830
Showing him speed up.

50
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.780
I have used these before,
you'll probably see plenty of examples.

51
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.740
The sprite sheet took me forever to make,
so I reuse it wherever I possibly can.

52
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.840
You definitely gain an appreciation for

53
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.730
the way the animation
stylings of Hanna-Barbera and

54
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.990
other 60s and 70s animation favorites
because this is how they saved money.

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.388
They reused so many walk cycles.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So

56
00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:23.016
what we do with something, with a sprite
like that, is we make a zoetrope.

57
00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:29.330
I believe I recorded this at a museum
in Munich, and this is essentially

58
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.550
a sprite sheet being mechanically
animated to show us this horse running.

59
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.100
I think I'm actually running it backwards,
though.

60
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.520
It looks like the horse is prancing,
so I may have messed that up.

61
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.360
Maybe I should just reverse the film.

62
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.670
Anyway.

63
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.410
So essentially,
we're gonna do the same thing, but

64
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.890
we're gonna use a very
special timing function.

65
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.880
We're gonna use steps.

66
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.720
So, steps is a special
timing function in that,

67
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.020
you pass a value x, just like cubic
bezier curves, it occurs where

68
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.100
you give a cubic bezier parentheses and
you give it a bunch of numbers.

69
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.070
You give steps a number,
a number, one number.

70
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.180
And this number tells it how many
frames you want in that animation.

71
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.660
So, say you're going from black to red,
or pardon,

72
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.030
say you're going from white to red and
you want it to transition in a chunky way.

73
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.070
You want it to turn into several shades
of gray, or maybe just one shade of gray.

74
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.980
Go white, gray, black.

75
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.700
White, gray, black, right?

76
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.710
You want it to have steps.

77
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.880
You don't want it to gently fade
into gray and then fade into black.

78
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.130
You want it to be white,
then you want it to be gray,

79
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.110
and then you want it to be black.

80
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.430
You might pass it a steps timing function
and form of steps parentheses three.

81
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.800
The documentation, like how exactly
this works, is really confusing.

82
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.650
I've actually been working with the W3C on
coming up with a timing function that is

83
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.100
less confusing,
which I think we are renaming Frames.

84
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.770
There are a couple of gotchas,
I'll show you those gotchas.

85
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.560
I don't think many people
use steps in the wild,

86
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.350
but should you ever want to do something
really cool and chunky you will know how,

87
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.500
and you will be far ahead
of your your peers.

88
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.170
But if you really want
to see specific gotchas,

89
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.240
I have documented all
of my pain on CodePen.

90
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.256
If you ever want to see a horror story
before you go to bed on a Halloween

91
00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:34.341
evening or something like that,
check it out.
