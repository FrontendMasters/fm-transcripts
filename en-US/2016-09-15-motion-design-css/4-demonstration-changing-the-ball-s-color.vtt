[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:08.509
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So I want you to
try to transition the ball's color,

3
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.850
not using all.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.490
Okay, so as I was walking around the room.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.349
I noticed that somebody on
a computer very similar to my own,

6
00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.055
was having a little bit of shaky
movement in their ball as it

7
00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.328
was rolling across the screen and
changing color.

8
00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:28.847
And I was fascinated by this,
it's like this is a simple transition,

9
00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:30.370
why is it so janky?

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.100
And I looked closely and
he was using transition all.

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.500
And then when he showed me the same
animation with two different

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.200
statements for the transition,
the jank just disappeared completely,

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.490
and the ball moved
smoothly across the page.

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.560
Let me see if I can try
to recreate that for you.

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.233
So first off we are going to.

16
00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:56.570
Rachel, you didn't, you didn't even.

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.080
Hang an on a moment.

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.228
I'm gonna leave this page, here we go.

19
00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:07.130
I'll just work with this one, that link,
no good, this one is much better.

20
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.962
So what I'm gonna do here is,
I've got the background changing,

21
00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:16.118
and I've got set to transition all,
I'm gonna move it.

22
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.380
Let we change this view.

23
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.670
To this one, poo poo poo poop.

24
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.290
So we get to see it move
across a much larger field.

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.990
Let's see if we can slow it down a lot
by making it move a long distance

26
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.500
in a very short amount of time, and
transition all on like 0.25 seconds.

27
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.615
That's a little too fast.

28
00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:42.968
Let's see three and.

29
00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:46.400
Yeah, you might be able to
see this on the recording.

30
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.450
But there are points where you can
very clearly see that there is,

31
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.790
that they're balls that are overlapping.

32
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.600
So, how might we get rid of that?

33
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.604
We are going to do
a transition on background.

34
00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:13.390
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Now we've
just got that changing.

35
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.888
And we're also going to do transform.

36
00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:19.710
Almost put semi-colons in.

37
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.830
Now we've got them moving at
the same rate, or we should.

38
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.870
Up, you're right.

39
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.110
Syntax always bites you.

40
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.930
See, I told you it would
be fun to watch me.

41
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.880
I wasn't able to perfectly recreate it.

42
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.590
There must be something about, well might
be because he was using Chrome Canary.

43
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.326
I have no idea why that would be
a difference, but I'm using Chrome and

44
00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:52.030
sometimes which browser you're
using does make a difference.

45
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.515
So we can change
the different delays here.

46
00:02:54.515 --> 00:03:00.593
Say we want, for instance,
the animation to run on the ball.

47
00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:05.838
After it has, we want the color to
change after it has come to a rest.

48
00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:11.208
Now we're able to manipulate
these independently,

49
00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:14.674
and also they will have a, [COUGH].

50
00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:19.289
And also we should see slightly
better performance for it.
