2
00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.980
&gt;&gt; Rachel: Time for
some advanced animation properties.

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sorry,
just before we jump on.

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.168
You talked about the empty frame thing.

5
00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:13.730
&gt;&gt; Rachel: Yes.

6
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.499
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so I'm think I'm
seeing that, cuz I get a little flustered.

7
00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:17.990
&gt;&gt; Rachel: Yes.

8
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you just pop
back to the current frame,

9
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.969
cuz I wanna see how to rid of that.

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.096
&gt;&gt; Rachel: All right.

11
00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:26.149
Another option is you'll
notice in the curriculum under

12
00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.760
each one of the exercises,
there's a link to the solution.

13
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.950
So, if you ever want to revisit like whoa,
I saw how you did that,

14
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.730
that was really cool.

15
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.970
Wait, can we go back?

16
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.990
You can always go to the exercises
in the curriculum, and

17
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.000
go visit their solutions on your own.

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.969
If you get stuck somewhere, sometimes it's
fun to reverse engineer the solution.

19
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.480
We talked about $name, we talked about
$duration, we talked about delays, and

20
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.950
we talked about easings.

21
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.460
All things that, kind of have something
in common with our good friends over in

22
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.490
transition land, but CSS animation
has another friend in $fill-mode.

23
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.041
This is a very special
CSS animation property.

24
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:11.386
What it means, it's a little complicated,
animation-fill-mode, it can be

25
00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:16.190
set to backwards, can be set to forwards
and it can be set to both or none.

26
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.650
And what does this mean?

27
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.080
Well, you might have noticed that with
CSS animations, I'm gonna demo this,

28
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.080
because this is one of those things that I
think is better to demo, than to describe.

29
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.722
So, you might have noticed that
when an animation happens,

30
00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:39.013
like sit, the cat will start sit down,
and then he will not sit down.

31
00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:41.030
He will jump back to the beginning.

32
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.787
How animations work is, unlike
transitions, which describe a change,

33
00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:47.462
animations are more like
you're playing a change.

34
00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:51.624
You're saying, you, I want you to do this
and I want you to go there, and then,

35
00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:53.480
when it's over it disappears.

36
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.580
It's like you're playing a CD,
if anybody remember CDs,

37
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.325
it's like you're playing a CD.

38
00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:02.957
The CD just rests, it's not doing
anything, until you say, go to this track,

39
00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:06.620
play, and then when it gets to
the end of the CD, it just stops,

40
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.590
and it goes back to a default
state of not being playing.

41
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.660
It's the same with CSS animations.

42
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.491
CSS animations don't have any effect
on the element they're animating,

43
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:17.900
until they start playing.

44
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.760
And when they're done playing,

45
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.622
they don't have an effect on that
animation unless you use fill-modes.

46
00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:30.250
With fill-modes you can say, hey, CSS
animation, that element you're animating,

47
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.150
I want it to retain your 0%
properties before it's played.

48
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.615
So whatever that animation is, I want
that element to have that 0% property,

49
00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:44.756
even before it started playing you,
even if it has a delay of five minutes or

50
00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:48.287
it hasn't been clicked yet,
I want you to do that.

51
00:02:48.287 --> 00:02:52.000
You could use, well let's see,
that would be backwards.

52
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.190
You could use fowards, which means
it retains those 100% properties,

53
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.380
even after the animation has finished.

54
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.500
And you can use both, which means it will
retain its 0% properties before it started

55
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.570
playing, and it will retain its 100%
properties after it's finished playing.

56
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.110
And you can use none,
which is default, which is to say,

57
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.270
I don't want you to have any influence
on this element, unless you're playing.

58
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.510
Let me show you this.

59
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.080
So we've got some buttons,
you can make him run.

60
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.412
It goes ready, set, start, but you'll
notice how he just suddenly jumps into

61
00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:28.110
that running position,
he's not like even in a lined up position.

62
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.096
And we can make him sit, and then he just
jumps back into his original position.

63
00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:37.260
Let's use fill-modes to make it so,
yes, and

64
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.280
we are using some JavaScript
to add some classes to him.

65
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.380
We got sitting, we got running.

66
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.295
We were using JavaScript to add some
classes to which we have scoped

67
00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.150
some animations.

68
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.254
So you can see that .running
.tuna has a run cycle,

69
00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:58.061
which we've described down here.

70
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:00.688
And what we wanna do is we wanna say,

71
00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:05.514
that this animation should have
a fill-mode of back backwards.

72
00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:06.859
Is it backwards or forwards?

73
00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.620
Let me check, forwards and
backwards, yeah, it's got an s.

74
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.436
I sometimes forget if it should have
an s or not, it should have an s.

75
00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:15.940
should be backwards.

76
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.790
So this way, when we say run he starts
in that kind of leaping position, and

77
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.540
then he'll start running.

78
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.880
That's pretty cool.

79
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.632
Now, the sitting I think
is really obvious,

80
00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.530
cuz when you sit him down
he should stay sat down.

81
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.740
You told him the sit, you gave him
an order, and he's not following it.

82
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.482
So, let's set it forwards.

83
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:39.166
&gt;&gt; Rachel: And you'll notice this
will mean that this 100% value here,

84
00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:42.950
after he's done sitting,
he's gonna retain that value.

85
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.806
And if we inspect him with
the dev tools [SOUND]

86
00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:52.803
we will see that he has
actually retained it.

87
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.708
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Rachel: No we won't.

88
00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:01.994
Damn!

89
00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:06.500
Dev tools are still trying to
figure out how they display

90
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.030
things that have been animated,
and what their defaults are.

91
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.410
So, this is an interesting thing to keep
in mind, because you could have default

92
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.160
states for everything that are different
when animations are enabled or not.

93
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.720
For instance, say you have an animation
of this cat walking in, and

94
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.900
sitting down at a computer and typing,
and then walking off the screen.

95
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.660
Yes I have done this.

96
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.690
So, what happens if people
have animations turned off?

97
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.820
They're on IE or something.

98
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.220
The cat's not gonna move at all.

99
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.430
So, where's the cat?

100
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.310
What should its default state be?

101
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.640
Well, I would give that
cat's default properties

102
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.000
to be sitting in the middle of
page typing at the computer.

103
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.930
But then, I would use fill-modes to
make sure that if animations are allowed

104
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.060
that the cats retaining that
starting position of 0%.

105
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.999
And retaining the ending
position off screen of 100%.

106
00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.523
This way I've created
a bulletproof animation,

107
00:05:58.523 --> 00:06:02.606
where the cat will be on screen for people
who do not get to see that animation, but

108
00:06:02.606 --> 00:06:06.440
he'll behave appropriately
if animations are there.

109
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.427
That might be of concern, I know some
people in the audience work for big banks.

110
00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:11.770
You got a lot of different users.

111
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.210
And not all of them are using
the latest and greatest browsers,

112
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.670
even though it would probably
be in their best interest to.

113
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.533
We can't control or users,
we can only control what they see.

114
00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:28.210
&gt;&gt; Rachel: So, there's something
even more fun than $fill-modes,

115
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.160
and that's &amp;play-states.

116
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.791
I mean, we get $play-state and
we also get something called $direction.

117
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.114
I'm gonna talk a little
bit more about these,

118
00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:39.846
we're going to do some cool stuff
with $play-states and $direction.

119
00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:44.610
So, animation play-state, it defaults
to running that is to say you put

120
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.830
an animation on something, and
you've given an animation in the CSS, and

121
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.700
it will run immediately, or
it'll run after the delay you give it.

122
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.430
But, the point is that it's running,
that's its default.

123
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.480
You could set it to paused.

124
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.130
You could have it so

125
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.400
that that animation isn't running by
default, it's paused on the page.

126
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.320
Why might you do that?

127
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.652
Maybe you only want the animation
to run on hover, or

128
00:07:05.652 --> 00:07:08.303
maybe you want it to pause when
people are hovering over it.

129
00:07:10.587 --> 00:07:12.617
&gt;&gt; Rachel: You have a magical
fairy in the room, and

130
00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:16.200
then there's animation-direction,
which defaults to normal.

131
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.132
So, when you're playing animation like
those walk cycles, we noticed it went from

132
00:07:21.132 --> 00:07:25.795
0% to 100% and then it zip back to
0% around 100% again infinitely.

133
00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:32.131
Well it's the same with, you can change
that, you can set it to alternate,

134
00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:36.910
which will run from 0% to 100%,
then back to 0%.

135
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.442
So, that first iteration
will be 0% to 100%,

136
00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:46.142
that second iteration will be 100% to 0%,
and then back to 0% to 100% for

137
00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:50.509
the third, forever,
like a pendulum swinging back and forth.

138
00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.037
You have sent it to reverse,
which would run from 100% to 0%.

139
00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:54.969
Why would you do this?

140
00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:58.938
I don't know cool hover effects,
or alternate reverse,

141
00:07:58.938 --> 00:08:03.640
which is the same as alternate,
except you're doing it in reverse.

142
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.250
You're going from 100% to 0%,
from 0% to 100%.

143
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.464
Maybe you're doing that for
a cool hover effect,

144
00:08:10.464 --> 00:08:12.053
actually I want to play with it now.

145
00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:14.790
But we're not gonna do that today,
we're gonna do that some other day.

146
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.720
That's for another workshop.
