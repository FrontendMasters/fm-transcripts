2
00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.653
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: We're going to
have some fun using skrollr JS.

3
00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:11.225
I'm gonna show you how exactly it works
before I let you do this project.

4
00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:15.892
Because there's a really neat trick to it.

5
00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:19.108
What I want you to do in this one
is I want you to get the cat,

6
00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:21.335
cuz originally tuna was a part of this.

7
00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.584
Tuna is part of all my projects.

8
00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:26.331
Originally tuna was gonna play the
Cheshire cat and you can see tuna sitting

9
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:29.261
here but he was gonna be down
on the underneath the screen.

10
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.692
He was gonna be tucked out of way and
as you scrolled her down,

11
00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:34.251
he was gonna fall upwards.

12
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:38.788
And then he was gonna, kinda grind at her
and then keep moving up toward the top of

13
00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.673
the page and disappear same way
same way she disappear underneath.

14
00:00:42.673 --> 00:00:46.411
So, I've left the code that
gets her to change but

15
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:49.626
I'm gonna let you do
the same thing to him.

16
00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.444
This is all in JavaScript.

17
00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:58.108
So, what you'll notice is that we've got,
this is how skrollr works.

18
00:00:58.108 --> 00:00:59.997
It uses CSS properties.

19
00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.378
This is a more dynamic kind of animation.

20
00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:04.482
In that, it's not CSS animation.

21
00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:08.529
It's CSS properties being
changed with JavaScript.

22
00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:13.463
So what we do is we set these data
attributes with how far it is

23
00:01:13.463 --> 00:01:15.546
from the top of the page.

24
00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:18.214
I actually had to use waypoints
to make this more responsive,

25
00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:19.974
because the whole thing is responsive.

26
00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:23.893
So the distance from the top of the page,
the very top of the page,

27
00:01:23.893 --> 00:01:26.688
changes depending on how
big your browser is.

28
00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:31.701
So for the live version, I'm actually
using waypoints to change these data

29
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:36.811
attributes every time you resize the page
but, anyway that's a long story.

30
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:41.969
So, this one is fixed
distance from height of top.

31
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.960
We basically set top to -10%.

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.380
So Alice's value is to be at -10% from
the top of the page when we're at zero.

33
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.800
And then 6124 is the bottom of the page,
that's how tall this page is.

34
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.827
It's 6,124 pixels tall.

35
00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:07.540
By the time we get down there,
her top value should be equal to 80%.

36
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.375
So watch what happens when we scroll.

37
00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.288
You can see that we're
starting with top at 10%.

38
00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:18.030
And when we start scrolling, notice how
it's turning purple as it's updating?

39
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.780
Skrollr is interpolating between
these two different values

40
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.095
until we reach the bottom.

41
00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:27.920
Word's very close to 80%.

42
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.601
I'm not exactly sure why
it's not perfectly there but

43
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.884
you get the impression
that that's how it works.

44
00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:42.214
I'm gonna give you the chance to do
that with Tuna as a fun exercise.

45
00:02:42.214 --> 00:02:45.583
Special bonus points if you can
investigate the code a little bit and

46
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:50.080
do some sleuthing and see if you can
make tuna turn into the treasure cat.

47
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.870
Waypoints is also running on this
page to change her attitude.

48
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.490
You can see that notice the body
class up here is also changing.

49
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.433
It goes from curious to
bored to sleeping and she,

50
00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:08.722
if we inspect her element,
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Come on, there.

51
00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:09.876
We inspect her element.

52
00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:15.107
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: That's so many.

53
00:03:24.242 --> 00:03:25.140
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Here it is.

54
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.055
If we inspect her element, we can see
that, notice it's got weird here,

55
00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:32.673
body class of weird,
here's the selector weird alice-falling.

56
00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:35.485
Background-position, 0 0.

57
00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:39.224
But if we change it, it goes,
the background-position changes as well.

58
00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:44.498
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: You could technically,

59
00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:49.105
you could use this to trigger
these different moods to trigger

60
00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:54.079
something changing on tuna as he's
also scoped within that body.

61
00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.720
You could.

62
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.670
So, those are all the hints
I can give you right now.

63
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.860
This one's kind of a big deal.

64
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.100
So I'm gonna give you extra time.
