2
00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:05.770
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So
let's talk about that coverage.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.720
As of this recording, CSS transitions
are pretty darn well supported.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.344
Pretty much any thing but IE 9 and lower
and Opera Mini can have access to it.

5
00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:23.163
You can see that way off over there
Android browser 4.3 probably still

6
00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:28.930
requires a dash webkit prefix to it, but
across the board, transitions are awesome.

7
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.810
There is another really great reason for
using transitions,

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.650
which is that they are pretty bulletproof.

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.810
Let's talk about that in a moment.

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.217
Other reasons that transitions rock.

11
00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:44.770
With a single fire, they're great if
you only want something to happen once.

12
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.975
For instance, you just want it happen
from getting from point A to point B.

13
00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:52.079
You don't need it to repeat.

14
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.930
You don't need to run several times and
then stop.

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.550
Transitions are wonderful if you
just want one thing to change.

16
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.501
Granularity, if you only want to animate
one or two properties in a given state and

17
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:03.740
given conditions.

18
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.997
They're also bulletproof,
this is the nice thing.

19
00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:11.754
For all of those browsers that are read,
that is,

20
00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:18.290
to say IE8 and cohort and
Opera, Opera Mini, specifically.

21
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.900
If transitions aren't supported,
the change will happen anyway,

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.130
it's just a jump cut.

23
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.950
The browser is going to, let me
demonstrate how this looks on my site.

24
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.780
I use my site now because when
I use other people sites,

25
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.460
I used to actually do these
demos on other people sites.

26
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.010
If I said anything negative,
they'd get really sad.

27
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.180
So I use my own site,
cuz I can make fun of it all I want, and

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.370
nobody gets sad except me.

29
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.444
So watch what happens when I remove the
transition on my very own menu sidebar.

30
00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:50.650
Well, it just jump cuts.

31
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.180
It's still usable,
it's just not doing the fancy transition.

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.470
Of course, for an older user,
this might be a little confusing.

33
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.001
What happened?

34
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.632
Where did the sidebar go?

35
00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:03.190
I have to move my mouse.

36
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
That's so difficult, and I don't like it.

37
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.020
So, but this is how it could
look in a degraded example.

38
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.940
If you wanted to offer people the ability
to turn off animations on your site,

39
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.790
you could build using transitions to keep
in mind that when you click on something,

40
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.020
it will do the thing.

41
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.270
It will remove itself or change.

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.880
It just won't be animated
when it does that.

43
00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.831
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Do we have any questions

44
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:39.330
about transition?
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I see a question.

45
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What properties can

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.610
you not transition?
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: There are several, there

47
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.530
was a link earlier on that goes to the, it
should be in the workshop notes as well.

48
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.968
Back at getting started or
meeting transitions,

49
00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:57.540
the very first thing in the curriculum.

50
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.160
There is a list, there's not much
that you can animate or transition.

51
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.472
Many CSS properties are animatable or
transitional, but

52
00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:11.999
the ones that aren't
are things like display.

53
00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.690
And there's how do you animate between
display block and display inline?

54
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.650
I know you're thinking you could
animate between display none and

55
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.480
display block by fading.

56
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.400
But that would actually
be animating opacity.

57
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.380
So opacity is transitionable or
animateable, but display not so much.

58
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.080
It's kind of like a Zen riddle.

59
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.500
What is the sound of a tree falling in
the woods with no one there to hear?

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.650
What is the transition between
display block and display inline?

61
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.650
Ooh, I don't wanna think about it.

62
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.100
Other things like circular gradients
also not transitionable or

63
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.780
animatable probably because the W3C
hasn't gotten around to talking about

64
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.640
how exactly should that work.

65
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.310
Should it be like iris swiping?

66
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.435
Should it be like doing
a counterclockwise thing?

67
00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:02.940
It's just a little less
straightforward than linear gradients.

68
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.957
So there's not much you can't animate,
but they are things where you

69
00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:14.370
can't really imagine them animating.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Good question.

70
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.690
I implore you to look at that
link to be certain, yes?

71
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have a question

72
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.080
here from Kevin L.

73
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.820
He's wondering what transition pet peeve

74
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.170
do you have beyond
easing choices gone bad?

75
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.310
Or similarly, what is a non-obvious
mistake that you encourage us to avoid

76
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.900
with transitions?
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I

77
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.910
actually love transitions.

78
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.830
So it's hard for me to think of
anything negative to say about

79
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.690
them aside from what I've already
said about using transition all.

80
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.400
I see it in so many libraries.

81
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.930
I see it in so
many corporate style sheets.

82
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.910
It's just either uninformed development or
a lazy development.

83
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.775
And it does come back to bite people in
the butt when you have people editing code

84
00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:09.130
bases and going why is this animating
on this page all of the sudden?

85
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.865
I don't understand, what did I do?

86
00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:13.880
Because somebody put
transition all on something.

87
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.150
And if you're working in a big system,
you probably should be handling your

88
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.480
transitions and animations in very
specific ways using a custom mixin or

89
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.360
having a custom style sheet for it.

90
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.740
Where people make edits to say
I want this thing to change so

91
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.150
that we know everything
doesn't change by default.

92
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.600
So that's my main pet peeve,
otherwise transitions are my absolute

93
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.920
favorite friend in
the animation echo sphere.
