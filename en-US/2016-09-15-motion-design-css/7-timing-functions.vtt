[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:05.699
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Timing functions,

3
00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:09.078
now things are going to get
exceedingly fun for us.

4
00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:16.481
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So a falling ball
picks up speed due to gravity and

5
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.980
a rolling ball slows down from friction.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.740
These are natural physical

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.990
ways that things around us respond
to the laws of our universe.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.090
Now, easing is a way of showing those
sorts of changes in the rates of change.

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
It's also known as cushioning
back in studio animation,

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.470
they describe an animations
rate of change over time.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.110
Let me show you a little
bit about what this means.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.610
For instance deceleration is actually out.

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.610
Ease out can be thought of as accel,
ease in can be thought of as acceleration.

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.730
That's what those words mean.

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.580
I'll tell you a quick way to
remembering them in a moment.

16
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.350
Ease out,
ease in these are two default CSS values.

17
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.570
We also have one called linear.

18
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.490
Linear describes
a constant rate of change.

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.720
In the wild, it's very rare to
find anything with a constant rate

20
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.590
of change that is not manmade.

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.120
Pretty much everything is speeding up or
slowing down.

22
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.810
Even the universe is
speeding up as it's all

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
expanding from the center
where the big bang occurred.

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.390
So everything has the rate of change it's
nothing is constant not even change.

25
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.800
Man we're getting super zen today.

26
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.510
Yes, there easy is not only the law
of the universe but it is very zen.

27
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.705
So yes we get ease-in we got ease-out into
acceleration-acceleration we even get this

28
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.859
thing called ease-in-out which
basically goes starts and

29
00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.370
slowly speeds up in the middle.

30
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.580
They can be hard to remember,
but we also have steps,

31
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.280
we're going to talk more about
that when we cover CSS animations.

32
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.200
So how do you remember which
one of these is which?

33
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.410
Well you can replace the word
ease with the words slow.

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.510
In fact,
back in the early days of animation

35
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.080
it wasn't called even easier
cushioning it was called slowing.

36
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.440
So easy in become slowing as it comes
on stage slowly but it leaves quickly.

37
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.320
It's inferred easy now goes out slowly.

38
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.680
So it looks like it's decelerating
going from fast to slow ease in,

39
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.570
out, slow, going both in and out,
must be going quicker in the middle.

40
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.720
That's how I remember them.

41
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.620
These are all very normal.

42
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.200
Ease in, out, ease in, ease out,

43
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.050
everybody is using these what if you wanna
make something look unique like you.

44
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.490
That's when you're going
to use custom cubic bezier.

45
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.100
Cubic bezier is another timing function.

46
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.010
It lets you give the browser
a set of values to say

47
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.890
what you want that rate of change to be.

48
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.030
Where do you want to speed up?

49
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.540
Where you want to slow down?

50
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.228
You can tell it this and you can make
it yourself, that's the fun part.

51
00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:04.210
This is cubic-bezier.com and you can pull
this is what a cubit busy curve looks

52
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.460
like and as you can see as I mess with
the little the little toggles here

53
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.180
the little pools the number
is changing up top.

54
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.570
This is the value that we would be giving.

55
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.660
We will give to the browser to
tell it how we want change.

56
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.670
Let's compare this linear rate of
change down here in the blue box

57
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.150
to the curve that we just made.

58
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.400
The linear is going to be constant.

59
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.560
Notice how stick straight it is.

60
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.820
It's the same speed going across
the browser whereas mine's got a little

61
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.370
bit of a bounce.

62
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.800
So let's see what other
kinds of curves do.

63
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.460
Here we do this you'll notice
that it goes from very fast and

64
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.920
then it slows down a little
bit pretty awesome.

65
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.390
And then we do this like so and

66
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.700
this one should be slow and
then go very fast it's a hockey stick.

67
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.610
Yes it does work like what are they
called sparkling charts yeah.

68
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.260
Well there's another fun
thing that we can do,

69
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.830
we can make them using the tools as well.

70
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.810
I'm gonna start with Chrome because
Chrome's one everyone likes

71
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.520
but when it comes to animation, I tend to
prefer just a little bit more of the tools

72
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.890
that come with With Firefox and
I think you'll see why in a moment.

73
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.540
But let's start with everyone's fav.

74
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.500
So we've got my side that folds out.

75
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.947
It is my beautiful sidebar I love it
very much you can tell I spent a lot of

76
00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:37.540
time on it.

77
00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:41.911
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: We're
gonna bounce this up here so

78
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:43.700
that you can see it better on the screen.

79
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.740
And I'm going to make this one even
smaller so it still shows there we go.

80
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.840
I love being able to zoom.

81
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.290
So we've got this little icon here and
we open it up.

82
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.210
We have access to this beauty.

83
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.080
Which let's us change things and

84
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.150
we get to see a little example up top
of how quickly the ball is moving.

85
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.690
It's a very cute visual example,
let us get a little preview and

86
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.920
then we can try it out over here.

87
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.790
And as you can see when
we pool pullet around,

88
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.091
the cubic bezeir is
updating not just here but

89
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:21.860
also Here in our transition boom.

90
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.780
So what's this look like with Firefox?

91
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.160
Well, it looks a little bit different
let's just put you at your default.

92
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.090
Now we're gonna go over here
inspect that slide out and

93
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.760
it will be over in our CSS rules.

94
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.700
And the icon on the cubic-bezier
is just a little bit

95
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.630
more difficult to see; it's
a little smaller, it's not purple.

96
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.470
It probably should be a color so
that it's more readily visible.

97
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.620
But I am not a UI designer for them,
but look at this beauty that you get,

98
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.720
you get at your curves here you also get
these corridors presets that you can play

99
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.830
with like let's see what circular looks
like by the way these are all these

100
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.340
are all easing that people used to have
regular access to back in the flash days.

101
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.580
It would be lovely, if we had a set of
defaults like this to use in the browser,

102
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.910
kind of like we could
describe quartic/ease/in,

103
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.610
in addition to just ease/in.

104
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.120
Maybe one day that will happen, in the
mean time we are smart, we can go out, and

105
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.510
we can get these.

106
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.530
We can get these different
cubic vase values ourselves.

107
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.672
And you can see that they've
been updated for us, boom.

108
00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:45.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

109
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.664
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you show how to access

110
00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:51.790
Chrome's bezier curve stuff?

111
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.680
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Didn't I,
do you want me to show it again?

112
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The person is
just asking how to access it.

113
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you don't have turned
on the animations that is in the console

114
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.880
which people probably won't in
the beginning, you won't see them.

115
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.510
So here it says, next the animation.

116
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.880
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So if you don't see
the animations tab in the console,

117
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.050
what you do is you go to the dots and
then you'll see it says console,

118
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.479
it says animations,
you click animations and it shows.

119
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.120
But we won't be using that
animation tab just not there.

120
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.080
I mean well we did when I was
showing the different speeds.

121
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.730
My apologies I didn't realize
it wasn't on par to fall.

122
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.840
I must turned it on it some
day in the past maybe one day.

123
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.125
It will be open by default for
everyone but

124
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.075
until then we'll have to
remember to use three dots.

125
00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:45.909
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: It's interesting also

126
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.140
because in the future I'm never really
sure where these are going to turn up.

127
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.530
Animations used to be up here somewhere.

128
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.620
And now it's in it's own tab and
it changes all the time.

129
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.530
So my apologies to people in
the future if Chrome has decided to

130
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.610
put these in some other corner
somewhere where they're hidden.

131
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.480
But yes, keeping bezier curves they're
accessible regardless of that tab

132
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.400
because they are CSS properties.

133
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.684
But yeah, all right,
enough playing with bezier curves.

134
00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:26.442
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So you can use bezier
curves to give your site a very custom

135
00:08:26.442 --> 00:08:27.560
feeling.

136
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.322
This is croptheblock.com,

137
00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:33.120
you'll notice that they have
a very special drop-down menu.

138
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.050
It feels very special,
like someone is pushing against a spring

139
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.230
from behind you can almost feel like
the menus are made out of foam and

140
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.660
they're in the wind or something.

141
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.340
Let's take a closer look there.

142
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.450
So that is a custom easing.

143
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.920
It's not just using easing or
ease out that is custom and

144
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.590
it helps reinforce the brand of the site.

145
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.320
There's another site we can go to
if you want to get an overview of

146
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.460
these easing start net.

147
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.160
When you hover over each of the easing
you can get a little marker that will

148
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.190
indicate how quickly or
slowly something is moving.

149
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.340
And these are of course back from
the days of flash and there's the secret.

150
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.660
Say you find one that you really
like you're like I love easing quart

151
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.100
I got to have that when you click on it.

152
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.760
Look at this it even gives you the busy
curve for right there for you to use.

153
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.450
It's a nice tool if you want an overview
and you don't feel like poking around in

154
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.890
your dev tools or fooling around with
a bunch of pools and handles, and

155
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.850
you just want some solid
defaults to start with.

156
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.294
It's a good place to go.
