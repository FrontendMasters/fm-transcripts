[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.523
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Timing functions, now
things are going to get exceedingly fun

3
00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:13.967
for us.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So a falling

4
00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:19.980
ball picks up speed due to gravity and
a rolling ball slows down from friction.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.740
These are natural physical

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.990
ways that things around us respond
to the laws of our universe.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.090
Now, easing is a way of showing those
sorts of changes in the rates of change.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
It's also known as cushioning
back in studio animation,

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.470
they describe an animations
rate of change over time.

10
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.110
Let me show you a little
bit about what this means.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.610
For instance deceleration is actually out.

12
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.610
Ease out can be thought of as accel,
ease in can be thought of as acceleration.

13
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.730
That's what those words mean.

14
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.580
I'll tell you a quick way to
remembering them in a moment.

15
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.350
Ease out,
ease in these are two default CSS values.

16
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.570
We also have one called linear.

17
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.490
Linear describes
a constant rate of change.

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.720
In the wild, it's very rare to
find anything with a constant rate

19
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.590
of change that is not manmade.

20
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.120
Pretty much everything is speeding up or
slowing down.

21
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.810
Even the universe is
speeding up as it's all

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
expanding from the center
where the big bang occurred.

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.390
So everything has the rate of change it's
nothing is constant not even change.

24
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.800
Man we're getting super zen today.

25
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.510
Yes, there easy is not only the law
of the universe but it is very zen.

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.705
So yes we get ease-in we got ease-out into
acceleration-acceleration we even get this

27
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.859
thing called ease-in-out which
basically goes starts and

28
00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.370
slowly speeds up in the middle.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.580
They can be hard to remember,
but we also have steps,

30
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.280
we're going to talk more about
that when we cover CSS animations.

31
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.200
So how do you remember which
one of these is which?

32
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.410
Well you can replace the word
ease with the words slow.

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.510
In fact,
back in the early days of animation

34
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.080
it wasn't called even easier
cushioning it was called slowing.

35
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.440
So easy in become slowing as it comes
on stage slowly but it leaves quickly.

36
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.320
It's inferred easy now goes out slowly.

37
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.680
So it looks like it's decelerating
going from fast to slow ease in,

38
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.570
out, slow, going both in and out,
must be going quicker in the middle.

39
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.720
That's how I remember them.

40
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.620
These are all very normal.

41
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.200
Ease in, out, ease in, ease out,

42
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.050
everybody is using these what if you wanna
make something look unique like you.

43
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.490
That's when you're going
to use custom cubic bezier.

44
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.100
Cubic bezier is another timing function.

45
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.010
It lets you give the browser
a set of values to say

46
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.890
what you want that rate of change to be.

47
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.030
Where do you want to speed up?

48
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.540
Where you want to slow down?

49
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.228
You can tell it this and you can make
it yourself, that's the fun part.

50
00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:04.210
This is cubic-bezier.com and you can pull
this is what a cubit busy curve looks

51
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.460
like and as you can see as I mess with
the little the little toggles here

52
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.180
the little pools the number
is changing up top.

53
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.570
This is the value that we would be giving.

54
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.660
We will give to the browser to
tell it how we want change.

55
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.670
Let's compare this linear rate of
change down here in the blue box

56
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.150
to the curve that we just made.

57
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.400
The linear is going to be constant.

58
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.560
Notice how stick straight it is.

59
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.820
It's the same speed going across
the browser whereas mine's got a little

60
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.370
bit of a bounce.

61
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.800
So let's see what other
kinds of curves do.

62
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.460
Here we do this you'll notice
that it goes from very fast and

63
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.920
then it slows down a little
bit pretty awesome.

64
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.390
And then we do this like so and

65
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.700
this one should be slow and
then go very fast it's a hockey stick.

66
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.610
Yes it does work like what are they
called sparkling charts yeah.

67
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.260
Well there's another fun
thing that we can do,

68
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.830
we can make them using the tools as well.

69
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.810
I'm gonna start with Chrome because
Chrome's one everyone likes

70
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.520
but when it comes to animation, I tend to
prefer just a little bit more of the tools

71
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.890
that come with With Firefox and
I think you'll see why in a moment.

72
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.540
But let's start with everyone's fav.

73
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.500
So we've got my side that folds out.

74
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.298
It is my beautiful sidebar I love it very
much you can tell I spent a lot of time on

75
00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:41.526
it.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: We're gonna bounce this

76
00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.700
up here so
that you can see it better on the screen.

77
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.740
And I'm going to make this one even
smaller so it still shows there we go.

78
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.840
I love being able to zoom.

79
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.290
So we've got this little icon here and
we open it up.

80
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.210
We have access to this beauty.

81
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.080
Which let's us change things and

82
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.150
we get to see a little example up top
of how quickly the ball is moving.

83
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.690
It's a very cute visual example,
let us get a little preview and

84
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.920
then we can try it out over here.

85
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.790
And as you can see when
we pool pullet around,

86
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.091
the cubic bezeir is
updating not just here but

87
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:21.860
also Here in our transition boom.

88
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.780
So what's this look like with Firefox?

89
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.160
Well, it looks a little bit different
let's just put you at your default.

90
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.090
Now we're gonna go over here
inspect that slide out and

91
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.760
it will be over in our CSS rules.

92
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.700
And the icon on the cubic-bezier
is just a little bit

93
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.630
more difficult to see; it's
a little smaller, it's not purple.

94
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.470
It probably should be a color so
that it's more readily visible.

95
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.620
But I am not a UI designer for them,
but look at this beauty that you get,

96
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.720
you get at your curves here you also get
these corridors presets that you can play

97
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.830
with like let's see what circular looks
like by the way these are all these

98
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.340
are all easing that people used to have
regular access to back in the flash days.

99
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.580
It would be lovely, if we had a set of
defaults like this to use in the browser,

100
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.910
kind of like we could
describe quartic/ease/in,

101
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.610
in addition to just ease/in.

102
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.120
Maybe one day that will happen, in the
mean time we are smart, we can go out, and

103
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.510
we can get these.

104
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.530
We can get these different
cubic vase values ourselves.

105
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.597
And you can see that
they've been updated for

106
00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:44.922
us, boom.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick

107
00:06:44.922 --> 00:06:46.240
question.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Yes?

108
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.664
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you show how to access

109
00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:53.620
Chrome's bezier curve stuff?
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Didn't I,

110
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.020
do you want me to show it again?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The person is just asking

111
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.700
how to access it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you don't have turned on

112
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.990
the animations that is in the console
which people probably won't

113
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.880
in the beginning, you won't see them.

114
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.230
So here it says, next the animation.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So

115
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.880
if you don't see the animations
tab in the console,

116
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.050
what you do is you go to the dots and
then you'll see it says console,

117
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.479
it says animations,
you click animations and it shows.

118
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.120
But we won't be using that
animation tab just not there.

119
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.080
I mean well we did when I was
showing the different speeds.

120
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.730
My apologies I didn't realize
it wasn't on par to fall.

121
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.840
I must turned it on it some
day in the past maybe one day.

122
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.149
It will be open by default for everyone
but until then we'll have to remember to

123
00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:45.909
use three dots.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: It's interesting also

124
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.140
because in the future I'm never really
sure where these are going to turn up.

125
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.530
Animations used to be up here somewhere.

126
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.620
And now it's in it's own tab and
it changes all the time.

127
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.530
So my apologies to people in
the future if Chrome has decided to

128
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.610
put these in some other corner
somewhere where they're hidden.

129
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.480
But yes, keeping bezier curves they're
accessible regardless of that tab

130
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.400
because they are CSS properties.

131
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.378
But yeah, all right,

132
00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:22.289
enough playing with bezier curves.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So

133
00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:27.560
you can use bezier curves to give
your site a very custom feeling.

134
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.322
This is croptheblock.com,

135
00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:33.120
you'll notice that they have
a very special drop-down menu.

136
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.050
It feels very special,
like someone is pushing against a spring

137
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.230
from behind you can almost feel like
the menus are made out of foam and

138
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.660
they're in the wind or something.

139
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.340
Let's take a closer look there.

140
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.450
So that is a custom easing.

141
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.920
It's not just using easing or
ease out that is custom and

142
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.590
it helps reinforce the brand of the site.

143
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.320
There's another site we can go to
if you want to get an overview of

144
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.460
these easing start net.

145
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.160
When you hover over each of the easing
you can get a little marker that will

146
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.190
indicate how quickly or
slowly something is moving.

147
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.340
And these are of course back from
the days of flash and there's the secret.

148
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.660
Say you find one that you really
like you're like I love easing quart

149
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.100
I got to have that when you click on it.

150
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.760
Look at this it even gives you the busy
curve for right there for you to use.

151
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.450
It's a nice tool if you want an overview
and you don't feel like poking around in

152
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.890
your dev tools or fooling around with
a bunch of pools and handles, and

153
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.850
you just want some solid
defaults to start with.

154
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.294
It's a good place to go.
