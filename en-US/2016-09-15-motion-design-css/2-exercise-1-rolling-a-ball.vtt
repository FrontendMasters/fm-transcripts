[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Now it's time for
our very first exercise.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.320
I showed you how the paw is moving.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.680
Now it's time to see if you
can get the ball to move.

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.937
It's time to show the solutions key.

6
00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:23.300
I promised you I would
do these alongside you.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.680
The fun part is sometimes you
get to watch me struggle.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.310
Nobody writes code perfectly.

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.000
Anybody who does has rehearsed it and
probably used some editing magic.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.060
I know, I record my own screen casts,
I do a lot of takes.

11
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.229
A lot of takes to make it look magical and
fast.

12
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.120
All right, so we want the ball to move.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.292
We know that after the page loads,
the body gets a class of playing.

14
00:00:55.876 --> 00:01:00.430
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: And
that lets us scope transitions.

15
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.340
Here you can see that the paw has
a transition set to its transform.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.120
Basically what the transition is saying,
as a recap,

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.330
is anytime the transform property
changes on paw, it's gonna transition.

18
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.898
And it's gonna take 0.25 seconds.

19
00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:21.590
And then of course, what do we do as
soon as the body has a class of playing?

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.640
We change the transform,
we move the paw in another direction.

21
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.176
It could be pretty much any transform.

22
00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:29.806
It could be a translate,
it could be a scale.

23
00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:33.502
But specifically,
we're using translateX as it is

24
00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:38.140
a horizontal transform to
move it over by 30 pixels.

25
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.160
So now we want to do
the same with the ball.

26
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.213
Now here's, I have put so
much helper text in here for you.

27
00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:49.930
But here's a special secret from somebody
who's worked with a lot of transitions.

28
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.310
Sometimes it helps to start with how you
want the thing to look at the end of it's

29
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.730
transition, rather than trying to figure
out what you want that transition to do.

30
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.676
So here we want the ball
to move to the right.

31
00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:07.480
We want it to move toward the big code
block because it's being hit by the paw.

32
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.200
So where would we like it to be?

33
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.051
Let's give it a transform of translateX,

34
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:21.475
moving it across the x axis of 300 pixels,
see how that looks.

35
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.980
Well, as you can see,
it's jumped all the way over there.

36
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.610
I'm gonna make it a little bit closer,
maybe like 280.

37
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.990
This might just bump it right up
against the edge of the screen.

38
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.910
That would look cool, right.

39
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.900
250, let's try that.

40
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.765
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I just can't let it go.

41
00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:42.863
&gt;&gt; Students: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: There we go, yeah, 235.

42
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:43.850
It's gonna be perfect.

43
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.730
Okay, so now we've got the ball
exactly where we want it.

44
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.090
How do we get it there?

45
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.330
Well, we've changed it's translate,
we've changed its transform.

46
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.740
So we want to set a transition with
the property we wanna transition.

47
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.080
Well, here, I'll write it out long form,
transition-property is transform.

48
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.211
And we want it to take
transition-duration maybe

49
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:19.960
like one second
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: All right!

50
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.518
Aw, dang, it started at the same
time that the paw was moving.

51
00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:25.047
That didn't look good, look at that.

52
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.330
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: That's
some serious hijinx there.

53
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.910
Obviously, we need
a transition-delay on this.

54
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.544
And we want it to run
after the paw started.

55
00:03:36.544 --> 00:03:41.420
The paw takes 0.25 seconds, so
it'll be done 0.25 seconds later.

56
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.030
So we delay the ball from moving
until after the paw has run.

57
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.140
If we wanted to write this super, super,

58
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.130
super concisely,
we could just do transition.

59
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.010
Remember the first one is
gonna be its duration, and

60
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.830
the second one, by default,
is gonna be it's delay.

61
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.951
And we could write it like that.

62
00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:07.621
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: There we go, nice.

63
00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.640
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So
that is how you do a transition.

64
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.590
Don't close your transition exercises,
we get to play with those.
