[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:04.436
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: This will be fun.

3
00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:10.790
This is your chance to sit back, enjoy
coffee, and enjoy watching my foibles.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.030
I got the editor view.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.540
I'm gonna change the view
to make it over here.

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.750
There we go.

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.030
So, we don't need to see the HTML.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.070
We don't need to see the JavaScript,
but we do need this CSS.

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.310
Yes.
So, we've got this background image,

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.130
which is 12 tunas tall, 2400 pixels,
cuz he's 200 pixels tall.

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.772
And it's position 0, 0.

12
00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:40.260
We're going to animate
the background position.

13
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990
Yes, we can do that.

14
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.930
So, what would that look like?

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.274
Well, I guess I'll start
with the keyframes block.

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.989
So, interesting thing about
naming keyframes block.

17
00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.170
You can't give it a name like running, cuz
that's actually a CSS animations property.

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.270
And they don't want you to put
running as an animation name.

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.563
I learned this when a bunch of
my examples failed one day.

20
00:01:05.563 --> 00:01:10.001
They don't want you to use
running as a keyframes name, so

21
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.545
you couldn't give it like a name of 200ms.

22
00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.579
You couldn't do that.

23
00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.020
I don't think you can even
use numbers as names.

24
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.810
So, we're gonna give him,

25
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.939
I like to use a subject verb
type naming convention.

26
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.670
This would be tunaWalk, boom.

27
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.061
We got a 0% value, and
we got a 100% value.

28
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:44.166
And this will be background-position.

29
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:49.220
And we're gonna go from 0 0,
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: To

30
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.620
0 2400 pixels.

31
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.660
0 -2400 pixels that moves
it vertically upwards.

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.048
All right, that makes sense, right?

33
00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:04.855
But, let's go back here and take a look.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Some people get

34
00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:07.049
this right on the first try by accident.

35
00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.416
You just keep in mind that 2400 pixels is,
actually when you do this,

36
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:17.429
the sprite sheet is now
somewhere off screen.

37
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.025
To keep it on screen, you do 2200 pixels,

38
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:25.095
-2200 pixels, or you can move it to 100%.

39
00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:28.202
Which works slight different
from moving things from pixels,

40
00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:32.180
as it's now making sure that it's
still within that bottom frame.

41
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.070
This will change exactly how it
animates in a strange and unusual way.

42
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.708
So, why would we have
that empty frame there?

43
00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:39.175
Hm-mm.

44
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.500
Hm-mm.
Well, funny thing about steps, and

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.824
I'll show you.

46
00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:46.447
But first, let's make a zoetrope.

47
00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:51.361
Animation: catWalk 4s, and

48
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:56.090
we're gonna give it linear.

49
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.014
This is how we make a zoetrope.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's tunaWalk

50
00:02:59.014 --> 00:02:59.619
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: You're right,

51
00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.070
it is tunaWalk.

52
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.350
We're using first names already.

53
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.540
And we would wanna use 2200 pixels,
cuz we don't need that empty frame.

54
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.420
So, this is kind of what that would
look like if we speed it up, and

55
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.550
we want it to go infinitely.

56
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.150
I hope there's no one who gets seizures in
the classroom, don't look at the screen.

57
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.040
So, this is kind of what it would look
like if it were a zoetrope, not so great.

58
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.931
It doesn't look so good on screens.

59
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:26.760
Let's get a better timing function.

60
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.680
We'll use steps, and we have 12 frames.

61
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.300
We're gonna do steps (12), but
it's not quite lining up, why is that?

62
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.960
Well, funny thing about steps,
it always eats the last frame.

63
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.960
So, if you started with -2400
it worked perfectly for you.

64
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.290
Even though your math was
probably not quite right,

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.960
if you'd started by putting
2400 pixels in there.

66
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.889
In your original background position,

67
00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.997
you'd have seen that
it was an empty frame.

68
00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:57.054
And this is because steps actually always,

69
00:03:57.054 --> 00:04:00.450
because of the way it's written,
it's child.

70
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.930
Steps (12) is short first steps,
and what this little

71
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.010
bit means that ,end means,
which frame do you want to sacrifice?

72
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.360
The first one,
which we would do with it with step start.

73
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.840
Notice that now we've got that
blink as eats the first frame.

74
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.800
Or steps end,
you can sacrifice the last frame.

75
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.174
If we wanted to do step start, we probably
do our sacrifice up here with a -200 px.

76
00:04:27.174 --> 00:04:29.665
Not, 1200, 200.

77
00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:30.801
Let me see if I got it right.

78
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.226
No I didn't, that's okay.

79
00:04:33.226 --> 00:04:36.586
Maybe it would be 200 px,
yeah, there we go.

80
00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:41.982
But, what we're doing here is we're
actually sacrificing the first frame,

81
00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.090
steps.

82
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.849
It gets even more fun when we do 100%.

83
00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:50.843
Because now, let me see,
if we go to steps end,

84
00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:56.726
which is two by default steps end,
as you can see it's not quite working.

85
00:04:56.726 --> 00:05:00.630
We would have to do,

86
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.408
I think it steps like 112.5% or
something like that to get it perfect.

87
00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:09.208
Maybe it's 110.5%, there's a specific
set of maths that you can do for this.

88
00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.463
It's in the course.

89
00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:16.468
Or, you could do steps (11).

90
00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:24.681
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: It's a little confusing.

91
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:25.895
There's a trick to it.

92
00:05:25.895 --> 00:05:30.244
I encourage you to play around with it
to study the spec to see exactly what

93
00:05:30.244 --> 00:05:31.611
the math is involved.

94
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:33.670
You're probably not gonna
use steps a whole lot.

95
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.316
But it is a fun trick to show your
coworkers and get them an and

96
00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:42.283
to at the office at the Christmas party.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: When

97
00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:44.860
would you possibly use steps in the wild?

98
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.460
Well, this is the CSS equivalent

99
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.158
of Twitter's back when we
had stars instead of hearts.

100
00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:57.147
[LAUGH] Let me do that again.

101
00:05:57.147 --> 00:06:00.244
So, here, this is a little demo
of how CSS animation rocks.

102
00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:06.350
You can use a sprite animation to recreate
some of these things without using SVG.

103
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.380
Little complicated kind of
traditional animations.

104
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.954
Over here on my site,
you'll notice that the more and

105
00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:16.930
nix this, those are actual handwritings.

106
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.389
I wrote those in art program.

107
00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.528
You also notice that the hands swirling
around, those are also sprites.

108
00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:29.449
If I had made a GIF, I don't remember.

109
00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.324
If I had made an aminated GIF out of
that animation it would have been huge,

110
00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:36.451
several megabytes,
because if you'll notice in my actual

111
00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:41.027
site.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: You'll

112
00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:44.670
notice that she goes on to
say many different things.

113
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.120
Her expression changes.

114
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.180
This is all sprites.

115
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.730
These are images overlaid over her face.

116
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.130
The hands are constantly going.

117
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.810
Her expression starts changing.

118
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.980
She starts laughing.

119
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.560
This all using CSS sprites and
CSS animation, and steps, a lot of steps.

120
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.410
And it's quite lightweight on the page,

121
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.950
compared to say an animated GIF doing the
same thing, which would be quite large.

122
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.070
So, yes, sometimes it's useful,
not all the times, but

123
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.960
sometimes you might want to use this for
some reason.

124
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.620
In which case, it'll be worth faffing
about with figuring out how that steps

125
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.640
end thing is going to work.
