[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:06.756
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: This is one of those
things where I will let you try to figure

3
00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:10.550
it out on your own and encourage
you to check the curriculum notes.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.560
However, steps is very tricky and

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.829
I don't expect everyone to
get it right from the get go.

6
00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.299
If you don't get it, don't worry,
I'll walk us through it.

7
00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:23.970
But you will become more familiar with how
steps works and some of its drawbacks.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.670
What I want you to do is to
make your own walk cycle.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.550
I've given you this sprite, this super
cool, handmade, all-American sprite.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.550
Boom, look at that.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.620
It's got 1, 2, 3,
I think it has 12 frames in total.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.030
Very important, Tuna is 200 pixels tall.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.127
And there are 12 of these,
giving it a total height of 2,400 pixels.

14
00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:52.656
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: And you are going to
move, you're going to transition its

15
00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:57.710
background position,
of this Tuna element to make him walk.

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.400
And you're gonna use
the steps timing function.

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.195
I'm gonna give you ten
minutes to work on this.

18
00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:07.938
And then,
you get to watch me suffer through it.

19
00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:17.511
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would telling us how to
move a background position be cheating?

20
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.609
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Well,
you move it the same way you would-

21
00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:21.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean,

22
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.316
just position it, how is it-
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Background-position is

23
00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:28.772
the property you're going
to want to transition.

24
00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.506
I mean not transition, you're gonna
wanna animate the background position.

25
00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.895
Yes, good question, thank you.

26
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:39.160
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: That is not cheating.

27
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Okay, thanks.

28
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.830
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: If at any time you
are lost, I do encourage you also to read

29
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.060
the comments in the CodePen as there
are various hints listed throughout it.
