[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:06.756
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: This is one of those
things where I will let you try to figure

3
00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:10.550
it out on your own and encourage
you to check the curriculum notes.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.560
However, steps is very tricky and

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.829
I don't expect everyone to
get it right from the get go.

6
00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.299
If you don't get it, don't worry,
I'll walk us through it.

7
00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:23.970
But you will become more familiar with how
steps works and some of its drawbacks.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.670
What I want you to do is to
make your own walk cycle.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.550
I've given you this sprite, this super
cool, handmade, all-American sprite.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.550
Boom, look at that.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.620
It's got 1, 2, 3,
I think it has 12 frames in total.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.030
Very important, Tuna is 200 pixels tall.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.566
And there are 12 of these,

14
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:48.974
giving it a total height of 2,400 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: And

15
00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:54.258
you are going to move, you're going to
transition its background position,

16
00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:57.710
of this Tuna element to make him walk.

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.400
And you're gonna use
the steps timing function.

18
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.195
I'm gonna give you ten
minutes to work on this.

19
00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:07.938
And then,
you get to watch me suffer through it.

20
00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:13.819
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would telling us how to move

21
00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.042
a background position be cheating?
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Well,

22
00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:22.718
you move it the same way you would-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean, just position it,

23
00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:25.316
how is it-
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Background-position is

24
00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:28.772
the property you're going
to want to transition.

25
00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.506
I mean not transition, you're gonna
wanna animate the background position.

26
00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.895
Yes, good question, thank you.

27
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:39.160
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: That is not cheating.

28
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.685
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Okay,

29
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.400
thanks.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: If at

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.680
any time you are lost, I do encourage
you also to read the comments in

31
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.060
the CodePen as there are various
hints listed throughout it.
