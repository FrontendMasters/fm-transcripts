[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, so
now you've seen frames per second meter.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.359
It's all right, but it's not conclusive.

4
00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.764
How do we actually use the browser
tools to sniff out some issues that we

5
00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:12.640
might be having?

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.140
Well, there's one thing
that I really like.

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.080
Chrome's DevTools have this
thing called Paint Flashing.

8
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.770
You know what, I'll just show it to you.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.100
So we talked a bit how there's layout,
there's painting,

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.600
and there's compositing, right?

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.700
Paint flashing,
what it does is it shows us where

12
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.830
things are being painted,
not composited, not laid out.

13
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.320
Look, the whole page is green.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.340
The whole page is being painted.

15
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.970
That's not good.

16
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.860
That's gotta cost money.

17
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.160
So let's see what happens
on my site when we do that.

18
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.090
We're gonna enable the paint flashing.

19
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.880
Notice on my site,

20
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.420
only the hands are being flashed because
they're using background position.

21
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.300
But notice what happens
when I use the sidebar.

22
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.440
The sidebar flashes green when it moves,
and

23
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.580
then flashes green again
when it stops moving,

24
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.290
showing that it's being painted only at
the beginning and end of its animation.

25
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.640
That helps clarify how Chrome
is handling those animations.

26
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.570
So, it goes paint and then repaint.

27
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.680
But notice, also, that more, this thing
here, being sprite animation that I use

28
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.520
background positioning on it,
it stays green throughout its animation.

29
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.922
What happens when we go
to one of my other pages?

30
00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:34.757
Oop, see,
it turned green once the page stopped.

31
00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:37.080
The page is animated using a transform.

32
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.028
Technically, we combine this using the
slowdown animations to really get a view.

33
00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:47.830
That's wrong one, back,
go back, abort, abort.

34
00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:51.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
we could use this to go back home.

35
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.808
And notice how, when we slow things down,

36
00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:57.230
we can really see when those
paints come into play.

37
00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:07.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
then there's the timeline tool.

38
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.104
And the timeline tool's
kinda heavy hitter here.

39
00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:16.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If you notice that something
is being really janky in certain places,

40
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.830
it's a good idea to use
this tool if you can.

41
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.120
I'm gonna go to Alice in Videoland and
use it.

42
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.450
And I'm gonna turn off the paint flashing
because if you are painting things,

43
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.990
that can also change your performance.

44
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.900
I have seen two very different recordings.

45
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.510
So what you're gonna do is you're
gonna go to your Timeline tab.

46
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.315
If it's not there,
use the little arrows, go there.

47
00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.450
Or actually hang on,
there's one thing I have to do.

48
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.112
I'm afraid I've left it at 25%.

49
00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:53.308
I want to be at 100%.

50
00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:56.823
We'll come back to that in a moment.

51
00:02:56.823 --> 00:03:00.015
So we're gonna go down to

52
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.084
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Profiles
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not in the dropdown.

53
00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:04.861
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Timeline.

54
00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:07.625
Did it move that?

55
00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.425
Stop trying to be,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you click on it,

56
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:10.055
it moves it up.

57
00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Stop trying to be helpful,
Chrome.

58
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.630
You're not helping anybody.

59
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.220
So let's do it like this.

60
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.460
And, I'm gonna hit record.

61
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.603
And it's got me this little
buffer usage down here,

62
00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:21.610
which lets me know how long I have for
recording.

63
00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:27.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Or how long I'm recording.

64
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:29.503
I'm gonna scroll.

65
00:03:29.503 --> 00:03:33.607
I'm gonna scroll this pretty fast cuz I
want us get to one area where it can be

66
00:03:33.607 --> 00:03:34.466
problematic.

67
00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:36.060
And I click the down button.

68
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.147
We're going down.

69
00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:39.682
And there she's kicking.

70
00:03:39.682 --> 00:03:43.421
We're gonna keep scrolling,
scroll all the way to the down.

71
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:46.590
And that should have fired something,
but it's not.

72
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.100
Might possibly be because
we're recording it.

73
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.450
Unfortunately, when we use tools like
this which are really, really invasive,

74
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.150
sometimes things don't behave
the way we expect them to.

75
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.099
Or it could be because my code is wrong.

76
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.757
Who knows?

77
00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:13.250
Now, you can't hear it, but my fans
are going, my computer is very hot.

78
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.230
And there we go.

79
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.560
Now we got something we can work with.

80
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.380
So, check it out.

81
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.465
We even get, man, but it,
we're gonna have to I

82
00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:28.410
think break this out into its
own window cuz it's that big.

83
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.650
My God, we've got to look
at the whole thing as huge.

84
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.700
This will check it out.

85
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.010
We can actually see a little screenshot
of what's happening at any given time.

86
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.130
I went to the Chrome Dev Summit.

87
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.200
And I asked for this feature.

88
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.010
I'm glad I did.

89
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.480
It's a lot easier to see where these
bottlenecks are if you can visually see

90
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.400
what's happening at that time.

91
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.140
Up here, you can see that we've got,
at the very top of the bar,

92
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.820
we can see that we've got these
different mountain features in green.

93
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.070
Those are measuring
the FPS at any given time.

94
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.040
And you can see, of course,
where the FPS dropped.

95
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.350
Here's a big dip.

96
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.970
Let's see what's happening here.

97
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.730
Well, it looks like that was just when
the teacup sat there for a little bit.

98
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.500
And I don't know why it was like that.

99
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.110
But perhaps it was because,
if we go down here, we can

100
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.752
have a look at all the mounds of listeners
that I am calling at the same time.

101
00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:22.937
Look, we can even, woh, this is Skrollr.

102
00:05:22.937 --> 00:05:26.563
Hi, Skrollr, good to see you.

103
00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:27.765
Yep.

104
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:31.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Does it not go past here?

105
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.790
Does it not?

106
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.030
Wow, you know what?

107
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.030
Wow, this happened.

108
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.090
So everybody, this should have
shown the teacup dropping here.

109
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.980
But Chrome actually trying to fell off
the side of the wall on this one and

110
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.930
stop taking screenshots,
this happens sometimes.

111
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.125
Chrome Canary might be
a little bit more reliable.

112
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:58.460
I'd recommend you try
this tool on that one.

113
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.260
But Chrome Canary also
tends to the change a lot.

114
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.940
So I like to use it in regular
old Chrome when I'm demoing it.

115
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.700
But anyway after around here where
you start seeing these changes,

116
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.610
we can't see it.

117
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.590
But this is where events are happening,
like where we're clicking on things.

118
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.660
And you can find the actual
triggers if you make your selection

119
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.480
small enough,
which I can't seem to get smaller.

120
00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:30.929
There we go, and we can actually see
what's triggering some of these things.

121
00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:34.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There we go.

122
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.840
So we've got jQuery
Waypoints fires right here.

123
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.090
We can see that there's a little dip.

124
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.570
Did this cause the issue?

125
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.160
Can't be 100% sure.

126
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.200
Might have also been caused
by the scroll event.

127
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.730
Got a lot happening at the same time.

128
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.325
But if you see these big dips,
you could come in here and

129
00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:55.200
see what's firing right before them.

130
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.672
And that might be a tell that that event,

131
00:06:57.672 --> 00:07:02.106
whether it's a big repaint cuz repaints
and such are listed in here too,

132
00:07:02.106 --> 00:07:05.758
whether or not that's the sorta
thing that's causing it.

133
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:10.701
And we can get rid of the screenshots and
get rid of the JavaScript profile,

134
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:11.970
or you can keep it.

135
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.748
You can get rid of the memory.

136
00:07:13.748 --> 00:07:17.416
I actually like the memory area.

137
00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:20.019
It's so big.

138
00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:27.159
And we have a lot of different things,
like timer, function call, to doScroll.

139
00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:28.280
You can get really deep.

140
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.780
And that is how we can actually
find not just the JavaScript but

141
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.850
also the CSS things that
might be slowing us down.

142
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.250
Timeline tool is pretty complex.

143
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.500
I do recommend you give it a look.

144
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.589
But the best performance tip I
can possibly, possibly give you

145
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.570
is to not animate things
that aren't visible.

146
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.470
You might think that your browser is
smart enough to not try to animate

147
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.900
things when they're not onscreen.

148
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.593
But the truth is, if you have something
spinning off the side of the screen,

149
00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:03.940
maybe it's a couple screens down or
something, you've got a spin or

150
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.634
they're gonna around in circles, or
maybe you have hundred of them there,

151
00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:11.735
the browser's actually paying attention to
where those spinners should be when you

152
00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:13.672
finally get those spinners into view.

153
00:08:13.672 --> 00:08:17.689
So, if they're not in view,
they shouldn't be animated.

154
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:22.280
You can use libraries like Waypoints.js
to keep an eye on what's in view.

155
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.574
And you can use this to help trigger
animations since they're only playing when

156
00:08:25.574 --> 00:08:26.370
they're in view.

157
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.430
And we can do that using states
which we were playing with earlier.

158
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:37.410
States in view, I use the in view class
quite a bit for triggering animations.

159
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.600
Maybe one day, we'll have an even more
above the board way to go about that.
