[MUSIC]

2
00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:39.813
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I'm Rachel Nabors.

3
00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:44.872
And I have built everything
from interactive

4
00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:50.065
demonstrations of
Firefox's really cool web

5
00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:57.750
animation tools to interactive
stories with Adobe Inspire.

6
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.330
We'll be taking a closer look at Alice
in Videoland a little bit later on in

7
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.040
this course.

8
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.530
And sometimes I even help clients bring
animation to their motion design systems

9
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.400
and style guides.

10
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.169
This is a more practical
application of animation.

11
00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:14.535
And it's becoming even
more popular these days.

12
00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:17.257
With things like
Google's Material Design And

13
00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:19.781
IBM's motion design language coming out.

14
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.612
And showing people how animation and

15
00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:28.553
motion are an important part of a healthy
balanced approach to UX and design.

16
00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:33.361
I also run WebAnimationWeekly, which is
an excellent newsletter on the comings and

17
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:35.260
goings of this bustling space.

18
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.600
Animation has taken off, and
it changes literally every week.

19
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.800
So if you wanna keep up,

20
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.540
this is a nice little curated list
to get in your inbox every week.

21
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.240
What are we gonna learn today?

22
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.210
We're going to learn all about
CSS transitions and animations.

23
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.760
How do you use animation
in product design.

24
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.190
How to create stateful
animations with JavaScript.

25
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.380
How do you use developer tools
to manipulate said animations.

26
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.860
How to design performant animations.

27
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.790
Now, a few things before we move forward.

28
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.580
For your convenience,
all of these exercises use jQuery.

29
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.160
I realize that a lot of
people who will be in this

30
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.000
course are already fully competent
at using JavaScript without jQuery.

31
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.350
If you want to do the exercises
without jQuery, you're welcome to it.

32
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.780
But I also realize a lot of people come
into frontend development jQuery first.

33
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.610
Which is why these are not all written
in plain, old, vanilla JavaScript.

34
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.140
Everyone knows the jQuery syntax.

35
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.120
Everyone feels more at ease with it,
we're fine.

36
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.140
I'd rather you be paying attention to
the CSS animations and transition syntax.

37
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.090
Than figuring out how to do something
new with JavaScript that you might not

38
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.680
have done before.

39
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.706
We also use -prefix-free.

40
00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:53.811
-prefix-free is a little library,
it's a little JavaScript library.

41
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:58.578
And what it does is it lets you write
your CSS without having to worry about

42
00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.561
putting on -webkit, blah blah.

43
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:04.576
All the different prefixes
that some browsers may or

44
00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:06.665
may not require to work correctly.

45
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:11.880
-prefix-free, what it does is you give
it a style sheet with no prefixes in it.

46
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.537
It compares it to whatever
the browser supports.

47
00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:17.293
And if it sees that prefixes are needed,

48
00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:21.480
it injects some of that
prefix CSS into the browser.

49
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.600
I do not recommend it for production work.

50
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.650
We are using it here simply because I want
you to focus on using this proper syntax.

51
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.070
Not on remembering what prefixes to use.

52
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.926
In a production environment you should
use something like autoprefix or

53
00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.980
Sass mixins to handle that for you.

54
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.230
So bear that in mind.

55
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.560
I will mention when certain prefixes
are needed and with what browsers.

56
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.350
But I do expect you to have some
sort of a solution set up to

57
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.850
handle that regularly for you.

58
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.080
And lastly and most fun,
we are going to be using CodePen for

59
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.460
our experiments today.

60
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.455
I prefer to use CodePen over just
handing you a big GitHub repo.

61
00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:08.022
Then spending an hour in the morning
getting everyone's dev environment set up.

62
00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:10.979
Or telling where the files should
be stored on your hard drive.

63
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.760
CodePen is a lot of fun.

64
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.080
It is a site that lets you, well,

65
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.020
it's kind of like Dribbble for code,
if you're a frontend developer.

66
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.894
It lets you write CSS, JavaScript,
and HTML on one hand of your screen.

67
00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:27.450
And then watch it live update in
the other hand of your screen.

68
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.940
Sounds a lot like DevTools.

69
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.490
Well, the nice thing is you can save
those examples and then share them.

70
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.676
Also, you can fork the examples I'm giving
you, and save them to your own account.

71
00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:40.783
If you would like to do this, I highly
recommend you go to codepen.io now.

72
00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:42.870
And sign up for
an account before we get started.
