2
00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:07.584
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: We've talked about the
how, now it's time to talk about the why.

3
00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:09.290
Why would you want to
use these animations?

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.320
And not too many years ago,
when we talked about animation,

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.060
the idea was that it was cute and
colorful, but it was mostly decorative.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.880
But now,
as the space has matured a bit, and

7
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.610
we're looking at ways in which we can
use animation to be more effective for

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.170
users and
to use it discriminately in our designs.

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.983
First, let's get this down.

10
00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:37.170
At its core, animation is merely the
visual representation of change over time.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.000
We have audio representations of
to change over time for instance,

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.420
The Doppler Effect,
when the sound is moving closer to you.

13
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.360
It sounds higher than when it's
moving farther away from you.

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.430
This lets you understand rate of
change in position using sound.

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.240
Animation is a visual
representation similar way.

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.510
And we can animate things like
position and size and opacity.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030
Pretty much anything, even shape.

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.912
Just about any visual
property is ours to command.

19
00:01:09.912 --> 00:01:13.890
And we can use these animations
to indicate changes in Direction,

20
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.730
Solidity, and Momentum,
among other things.

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.190
Now, we can take these different changes
and we can combine them to create the four

22
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.700
most common kinds of animation I have
found in in design to the state.

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.080
There are other kinds you may go find your
own vocabulary in your own use cases,

24
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.750
but these are the four that
I see cropping up most.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.749
First off, there is Stateful Transitions.

26
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.880
And Stateful Transitions can guide users
between states in the task flow or

27
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.880
between pages and an information space,
page to page, field to field on a form.

28
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.890
On my site, of course my site,
we have page transitions.

29
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.804
So when you go from main page,
to the page on writing,or other page,

30
00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:02.526
notice that the background image, well,
the background page slides up in a way and

31
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:04.630
the new one slides down.

32
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.430
This is actually not a site written
in Reactor or anything like that.

33
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.870
I'm using a library like smoothState.js
to dynamically load each page

34
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.050
using Ajax and
combine that with CSS animations and well,

35
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.550
transitions on classes that are added
before and after the content is loaded.

36
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.400
So you don't have to use a whole new
library to get these kinds of state for

37
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.350
transitions.

38
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.700
This is a chuckle site is
generated into flat HTML files.

39
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.970
There's nothing fancy,
there are no routers, no controllers,

40
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.130
nothing like that.

41
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.939
It's just pages and a little bit of
JavaScript and a lot of CSS love.

42
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.300
Let's take a look at some
state changes in the wild.

43
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.900
This is a site I like to go to a lot.

44
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.340
Notice when you start searching,
suddenly the whole page changes and

45
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.620
it's got this blue backdrop to let
you know that you are searching now.

46
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.690
You're in a new context,
you're doing a new thing,

47
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.629
you don't need to look at the rest
of the stuff on the page.

48
00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.230
You just need to see search results.

49
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.720
That's all you came there for.

50
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.134
Now, there should have been
a transition after the search was over.

51
00:03:09.134 --> 00:03:13.950
There should have been a transition with
it sliding back up show you what it found.

52
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.010
Down here,

53
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.650
when we click on one of these we see
a very familiar transition, a modal.

54
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.490
Notice how the modal faded in,
it didn't just jump cut onto the screen.

55
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.450
But notice it also jump
cut off the screen.

56
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.540
Transitioning things off is a lot
harder than transitioning things in for

57
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.960
technical reasons.

58
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.070
For instance, when you remove a class.

59
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.620
Let's see, how do I put this?

60
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.330
If you get playing with CSS animations,

61
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.690
you'll realize that removing
classes requires you to listen for

62
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.130
the transition end after you've
added a like a remove class to it.

63
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.480
You have to listen for

64
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.090
the transition to end and
then actually hide the information.

65
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.570
So that's why when you're visiting
sites that haven't put a lot of thought

66
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.680
into their animations, you'll notice
that they might have transitions in done

67
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.130
perfectly but then jump cuts off.

68
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.420
So there will be this beautiful drop
down that will like foo fade down but

69
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.473
then when you click off
the site just disappears.

70
00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:15.479
It won't [SOUND] back up
where to it came from.

71
00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.104
These are tricky things.

72
00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:18.680
We're not QA testing for them.

73
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.790
We're not thinking about them at this
time very much, but we need to be.

74
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.800
We need to be thinking about moving things
off the page as well as onto the page.

75
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.480
So yes, transitions, everybody.

76
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.690
So Stateful Transitions,
they are useful for

77
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.990
indicating change in task flow location
showing users where they've been.

78
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.410
And showing users where they are now.

79
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.160
So it's very good for helping them orient
spatially as they move through a system.

80
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.200
Up next, Supplemental Animations.

81
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.640
Now, supplemental animation accentuates
secondary information to the main state.

82
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.350
Things like alerts, notifications,
updates, those are examples of

83
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.820
Supplemental Animations, or things that
could be animated into appearance.

84
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.410
It's also very easy to abuse.

85
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.610
Let's have a look at some
supplemental animations on my site.

86
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.920
So the sidebar,
I've been using the sidebar so much.

87
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.260
But this is a supplemental animation
cuz the main task on this page

88
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.540
is to check out the writing.

89
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.850
But if you don't want the the sidebar
there, you can get rid of it.

90
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.260
It's not important to
where the user is and

91
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.420
their whole life goals or
anything like that, so nice to have.

92
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.260
It take some secondary information and
it does something with it.

93
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.686
It is a supplemental effect.

94
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.050
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Here's another example.

95
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.360
As we scroll down, notice when we hover
over each one of these headlines,

96
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.340
a subtitle comes in and

97
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.870
gives us some more information about it,
some supplemental information.

98
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.490
The idea being,

99
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.430
if you're hovering over headline
you might wanna be clicking on it.

100
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.780
If I give you some more information,
maybe it will help you make up your mind.

101
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.200
It's a pretty fair assumption to make,
so they click it.

102
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.870
There wasn't a transition, a stateful
transition to this page, but bear with us.

103
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.040
What happened down here?

104
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.980
Look, at the bottom of the page
there's this blue bar.

105
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.762
Right around the bottom, they're
assuming if you've gotten this far,

106
00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:13.776
you probably liked this this article.

107
00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:18.596
Rather than putting some share this now
links at the bottom of the article,

108
00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:23.263
we're just gonna quietly put this
little navigation bar at the bottom,

109
00:06:23.263 --> 00:06:24.760
this share bar.

110
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.530
Just kind of move it up and be like,
hello if you like it might wanna share it.

111
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.090
It's supplemental information.

112
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.470
It's not necessary to the main state,
but it's nice to have.

113
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.870
Not nice to have like nice pictures or
nice to have,

114
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.020
but nice to have for your user,
information they might find useful.

115
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.750
So Supplemental Animations,
what are they useful for?

116
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.960
They are great for
indicating changes in information, showing

117
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.920
people what is possible like if you click
on this thing something will change.

118
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.800
And showing people important details
that shouldn't be overlooked.

119
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.920
For instance, your house is on fire.

120
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.910
You should check that out.

121
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.660
But I realize that you're just on
this website shopping for things.

122
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.193
So if you don't care, that's okay but
we thought you might like to know.
