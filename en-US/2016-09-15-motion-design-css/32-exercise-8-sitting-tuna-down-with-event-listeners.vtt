00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:06.770
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: This is the crowning
achievement of this class.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.190
We are going to use those animation
event listeners to listen for

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.400
Tuna's animation end and then give
him a .sit class after that's fired.

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.010
So remember how earlier.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.850
Before we launch into this, I do wanna
make one note that is pretty interesting.

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.365
Earlier we were doing some fun things and
someone in the front here had used a set

8
00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:35.860
timeout to change the animations
class after the three

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.080
second animation had run by setting
a three second long set timeout on it.

10
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.460
That kind of works but
it's a very brittle thing.

11
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.990
Most of us know that set
timeout is a code smell.

12
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.730
Truth is, imagine a future where people do

13
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.560
have control over the playback
rate of their browser and

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.650
they can universally set it to be faster
or slower for their own appreciation.

15
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.810
Then that set timeout would fire too early
or too late and it would be really tough.

16
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.170
You would have messed up
animations all over your site.

17
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.690
These fire when the animation is finished.

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.150
No matter how long it
takes no matter whether or

19
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.370
not some universal change
has occurred on the page.

20
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.490
So I just wanted to
point out that using CSS

21
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.200
animation event listeners,
they're actually pretty bulletproof.

22
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.720
So if you're going to listen for
animations ending,

23
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.340
these are the future forward way to do it.

24
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.850
All right, now get up there,
use animation end to listen for

25
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.200
when the animation is finished, and
then slap that .sit class on Tuna.
