2
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:08.431
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: In this one, we're not
gonna look at this aside from to make

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.890
knowledge of the fact
that it is an id of tuna.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.176
We're gonna probably attach
JavaScript to that id.

5
00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:17.959
We have a class.

6
00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:21.800
When tuna gets a class of sit he
will run his sit down animation.

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.870
So we wanna listen for

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.390
his walk cycle animation to finish
before we give him a class of sit.

9
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.120
Right now he's got that
walk cycle running once.

10
00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:34.996
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So let's do this,

11
00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:38.125
I've added a bunch of
placeholder stuff right here.

12
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.220
Ta-da, animated thing.

13
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.300
What is the animated
thing we're animating?

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.560
Why, it is none other than "#tuna".

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.077
Some people use single quotes,
some people use double quotes.

16
00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:53.640
I'm a double quotes kind of person.

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.230
I also use tabs, it's cool.

18
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.915
Haters gonna hate.

19
00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.234
&gt;&gt; Students: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: [COUGH] And

20
00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:03.371
now over here on animationlistener,
what are we listening for?

21
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:06.202
We are listening for animationend.

22
00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:11.391
And if it doesn't run,
keep an eye on those event listeners.

23
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.369
Now, here I have done a terrible
disservice to people who are just copying

24
00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.080
and pasting into here.

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.683
We actually need some curly brackets
before we put in a function,

26
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:23.450
an anonymous function.

27
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.442
The idea is that you could
have gone out here and

28
00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:32.669
been like var on, whoa, wow, great.

29
00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:34.123
Nice tabs there.

30
00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.858
onTunaWalkEnd = function.

31
00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:43.054
And then we would be like,
we're gonna do this,

32
00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:48.447
and then we're gonna put
all of this in there.

33
00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:53.661
And then we would do
onTunaWalkEnd in here.

34
00:01:58.086 --> 00:01:59.531
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: But
I thought it would be so

35
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:02.040
much more fun to write
with an anonymous one.

36
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.570
And so we're just gonna finish
this up here, finish our thought.

37
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.913
("#tuna").addClass("sit").

38
00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:14.879
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: And
it totally didn't work,

39
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.685
probably due to some syntactical
error of mine, that's okay.

40
00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:18.409
I'm just gonna grab this.

41
00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:18.914
Boop boop.

42
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.806
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So here,
we're gonna pass an anonymous function.

43
00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:29.384
Parentheses, curly brackets.

44
00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:34.320
And inside we are going to say
("#tuna").addClass("sit").

45
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.740
And there,
when he's finished walking he sits down.

46
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.170
We could also have used the this.

47
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.137
This way the Dom doesn't
have to go out there and

48
00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:46.017
refine tuna every time this fires.

49
00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:46.530
Ta da!
