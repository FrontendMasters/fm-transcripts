[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.771 --> 00:00:08.414
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: The nice thing about
skrollr is that it doesn't require you to

3
00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.950
write any JavaScript or any CSS.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.680
Once you have it on the page,

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.770
you set up the values that
change using data attributes.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
So the same that data attributes that
work for Alice should also work for Tuna.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.530
But there is one trick.

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.290
Those values that you were interpolating,

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.290
remember that the zero has
a percent sign next to it.

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.190
This is just a little quirk of skrollr.

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.900
The properties need to have
the same kind of values.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.289
So it's not trying to interpolate
between picks and M so top should

13
00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.540
be 0%, bottom should be 0%,
not 0, like you can write in CSS.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.410
Remember to put that
percentage sign next to the 0.

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.240
So I noticed a lot of people
got the skrollr to work.

16
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.060
This is a fun project because you get
to work with both stateful animations,

17
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.990
her change in her attitude but

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.610
you also get to work with this dynamic
animation tied to the scroll position.

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
I say dynamic because it is interpolating
actively where it should be.

20
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.035
So the first part of this challenge and
the most important part was that we need

21
00:01:25.035 --> 00:01:27.713
to get Tuna to flow from
the bottom to the top.

22
00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:38.000
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Guys, all right.

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.520
So the first step is we're gonna take this
data attribute that we have on Alice,

24
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.430
data 0 and data 6124, and
we're gonna put them on Tuna, right?

25
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.670
So now, Tuna has, he's gonna move
in the same way Alice does, but

26
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.080
this is not what I described.

27
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.860
I described Tuna moving from the bottom to
the top in opposite direction of Alice.

28
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.320
So let's try changing those top to bottom.

29
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120
Now we've got him moving
in the same direction.

30
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.420
But he doesn't move fully off the page.

31
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.940
And I want him to be fully off the page.

32
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.446
So let's try negative 200%.

33
00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:21.681
And we're gonna go bottom 100%,
this will get him fully off, here we go.

34
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.926
So now he's there.

35
00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.480
Make it 120.

36
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.480
And now that's working, and tunas
values are now automatically updating

37
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.970
via JavaScript, writing inline styles
as he moves up and down to confirm.

38
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.730
Let's inspect his element, and we can see,
if this thing gets out of the way,

39
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.030
Squish, so much tabbing and
indenting Chrome.

40
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.866
So you can see that the purple parts
are updating both for Alice and for Tuna.

41
00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.950
But there's also something interesting
you may have noticed about Tuna.

42
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.720
I gave you a challenge to turn
him into the Cheshire cat.

43
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.710
If you inspected his element so

44
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.846
you looked at his HTML, you'd see that
there are some images inside him.

45
00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:14.840
Some very damning images.

46
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.690
If you didn't know better, it almost
looks if you took one of them and

47
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.820
got rid of it,
he would be a completely different cat.

48
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.580
That would be this one.

49
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.757
If I said display none on that one, and

50
00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:36.644
then I did opacity,
say this one has an opacity of 0.

51
00:03:36.644 --> 00:03:41.498
If I did opacity 0 and a 1 on the red one,
suddenly Tuna has an expression so

52
00:03:41.498 --> 00:03:44.990
there's actually three
images sandwiched there.

53
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.550
Some of them are hidden and
some of them aren't.

54
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.760
So we're going to want to change Tuna's
appearance based on those things.

55
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.300
Now we have an option here,
here's where the road splits.

56
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.097
You could use the dynamic animation,

57
00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:10.110
you could take the same data
attributes that we used on Tuna.

58
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.800
Let's see.

59
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.900
Grab these and we could say well,
we wanna show Tuna.

60
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.587
We wanna have the real cat,
the Tuna glow changed in a different

61
00:04:23.587 --> 00:04:29.079
rate from the black-tuna, so
we would put these both here.

62
00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:32.959
And we would change the opacity from,

63
00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.350
let's see, I might be doing this wrong.

64
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.803
Everybody feel free to correct me if I am.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So

65
00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:49.363
notice that now as we move up,
he fades in.

66
00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:53.470
Woo, so cool, so awesome, right?

67
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.560
Nice.

68
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.660
Love you Tuna, you're awesome.

69
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.650
And we could change when that happens.

70
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.870
So that maybe it happens closer
to the middle of the page.

71
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.740
Instead of happening at the beginning,
we could change.

72
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.770
Let's say we start at 400 from the top.

73
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.650
And end it when it gets, so

74
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.840
notice we've delete it here by
changing those data attribute values.

75
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.510
And it's fully finished
before it reaches the top.

76
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.850
So that's one way we could have done it,
but there's another way, the stateful way.

77
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.028
You may have noticed
that as Alice is mood is

78
00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:33.290
changing,
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: [SOUND] As

79
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.873
she's changing,
the body class changes as well.

80
00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:41.540
She goes curious, bored,
sleeping, waking, etc..

81
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.340
Well, the body class, it can scope any
of its contained elements to that.

82
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.125
So Tuna could technically change
his appearance when the body has

83
00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:55.510
a class of bored by scooping
Tuna with that bored class.

84
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.820
Let's have a look at that.

85
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.380
So let's first figure out
exactly where we'd like

86
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.640
him to change into the Cheshire cat.

87
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.826
I would say that would be right about,
let's see, she's here,

88
00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:09.340
she's looking around,
just getting a little bored.

89
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.960
And then she wakes up,
I would say maybe right about there.

90
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.600
So this is where she wakes up.

91
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.080
That would be, here's where I go find
that particular name for that thing.

92
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.550
There we go, bored, sleeping,
waking, waking Alice.

93
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.490
So around that time,
let's see, was Tuna glow so

94
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:38.300
waking tuna-glow and

95
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.160
it should be opacity 1.

96
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.830
So right around the time
that she wakes up boom.

97
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.800
But you noticed it happened all at once.

98
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.130
Right?

99
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.930
We could slow it down by overwriting
its default transitions,

100
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.780
I already added the transitions
to Tuna cuz I was

101
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.910
totally hoping you catch the Easter egg
but I'm gonna override some of that.

102
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.920
I'm gonna say transition-duration
should be 6 seconds here.

103
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.220
So now, when we scroll, and
she's waking up, he takes 6 seconds.

104
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.300
But notice that when you do stateful
animation like that, it takes 6 seconds.

105
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.960
It's not tied to how fast
the person is scrolling.

106
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.430
It just happens or it doesn't happen and
I would probably also define that.

107
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.699
While she's awake,
he would also remain opacity 1, etc..

108
00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.590
You have to repeat yourself sometimes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I've got

109
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.180
a question from online.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Yes.

110
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.116
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The question is from

111
00:07:39.116 --> 00:07:39.670
Kevin L..

112
00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:45.455
We would like to know what would be
the cons of attempting to use skrollrs,

113
00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:48.000
viewport-anchors to interpolate

114
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.060
Tuna's position?
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I

115
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.870
don't think there would be any cons.

116
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.290
Skrollrs a pretty cool library,
it has a lot of options.

117
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.700
I don't do a lot with parallax so
I can't speak definitively on that.

118
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.130
But it has a lot of handy functions for
figuring out where things are located

119
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.070
inside it and sometimes even
recalibrating where things have moved to.

120
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.900
So if you're interested in using skrollr,

121
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.350
I highly recommend checking
out skit hub pages.

122
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.310
There are links in the show
notes as it were and

123
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.120
seeing what features
are available to you there.
