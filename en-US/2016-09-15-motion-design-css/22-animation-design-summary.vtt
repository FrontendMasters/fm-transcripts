[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.360
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So let's have a moment
to review a site that I am a big fan of.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.034
It has music, so
I am gonna have to mute it.

4
00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:13.368
It's a band site, and

5
00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:18.180
get this, one of the members of
the band used to be a Flash developer.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.020
So when they needed a site.

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.510
What did he do?

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.710
He built it using SVG and
a heck of a lot of animation.

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.120
But it's also a really great example
of some sophisticated animations.

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.110
Let's go on an animation safari.

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.606
And I genuinely wish I had a little safari
hat I could put on right now, but I don't.

12
00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:38.910
But we're gonna go a little animation
safari and see how many supplemental

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.760
animations and transitions and
causal effects we can spot.

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.948
Ready?

15
00:00:44.948 --> 00:00:45.448
Ding.

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.318
The band is A Love Like Pi.

17
00:00:48.318 --> 00:00:52.990
And as you can see, it's got this
is beautiful central animation.

18
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.230
It's a showcase.

19
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.900
So it's decorative, but it makes sense.

20
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.914
And when we click on this button up here,
notice that there's a stateful transition

21
00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:03.079
over to this other section to show
people where they are in space and

22
00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.905
that they're seeing something new.

23
00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.703
When you close it,
notice it transitioned out perfect.

24
00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:09.260
Perfect, it's a 10 out of 10.

25
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.500
Look at this.

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.010
They're drawing attention
to the map by outlining it.

27
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.180
And when you hover over these,
more information,

28
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.900
supplemental animation brings it in.

29
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.452
Well that's bad.

30
00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:21.519
It took us to a new page,
that's a jump cut.

31
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.180
No fair, get rid of that thing.

32
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.970
The only animations on
this page are scrolling.

33
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030
All right,
here we go back to the beautiful page.

34
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.060
And we click on this one.

35
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.054
I'm a little upset that there's no hover
effect on those icons up there, but

36
00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:38.628
now there's a fade and a push in when
it takes us to a different space.

37
00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:42.390
This is the videos and
images of the band, and

38
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.270
notice how we keep moving through space.

39
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.650
To see these things,
we are moving through space.

40
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.230
The images are the only
things that are jump cutting.

41
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.170
Every single navigation feature
on this page is animated.

42
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.230
Look at that,
takes us back to where we came from.

43
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.898
My only concern is that it's a little
bit difficult to figure out how to get

44
00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:05.070
back to the main page from here.

45
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.330
You have to remember, to use
the navigation up in the upper right.

46
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.252
Which is just, I don't know,
that feels like an oversight on my part.

47
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:21.020
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So yeah.
And the reason why those all work together

48
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.470
is probably because the person who did
this used to be a Flash developer and had

49
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.110
many hours just doing this sort of thing
until figuring out how it felt right.

50
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.450
And that takes a lot of time.

51
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.440
You'll definitely find it difficult
to find any of these things codified

52
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.900
anywhere at this time.

53
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.110
Even game designers.

54
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.370
I've looked at the books.

55
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.690
There aren't a lot of
books that will be like,

56
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.080
this is a stateful transition from
one information space to the other.

57
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.210
Most people just pick
this up as they go along.

58
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.227
And you're going to pick
this up as you go along too.

59
00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:54.580
I'm just trying to help you
verbalize the animations,

60
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.690
because I find people learn a lot faster,

61
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.720
and they make better choices when they
can verbalize the reasoning behind that.

62
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.633
So hopefully, you'll be able to create
something this beautiful one day without

63
00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:07.595
having to create a whole lot of
flash micro sites to get there.

64
00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:15.058
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: [SOUND]
Do we have any questions?

65
00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:18.840
I see a question from the person
wearing a shirt that says rogue.

66
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.089
I like your choice in shirt names.

67
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.720
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thanks.

68
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.210
For the clarification,
that site's not built in Flash, right?

69
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.840
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: No, that site is-
&gt;&gt; Audience: It's entirely HTML-

70
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.060
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: And a lot of SVG.

71
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.120
&gt;&gt; Audience: A lot of SVG and animation.

72
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.780
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Well,
I think it is CSS animation on SVG, or

73
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.920
they might be using GreenSock.

74
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.070
I forgot to check.

75
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.880
But there's no reason that you couldn't
do a site like that just using CSS.

76
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.570
&gt;&gt; Audience: Right, nice.

77
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.020
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I know, you'd think
that site had been built in flash,

78
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.150
but that is what.

79
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.830
It also plays music when you arrive,
and it's super pretty.

80
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Also,
Sarah Drasner has a really good course.

81
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.181
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: She's
gonna ask a good question.

82
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:01.521
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No,
she has a really good course.

83
00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:05.880
So, she actually did a course on SVG,
advanced SVG animation.

84
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.250
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Sarah Drasner is
an excellent, excellent SVG animator.

85
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.430
Is that a Front End Masters course?

86
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

87
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.100
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Well, you should check

88
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.138
that out in the Front End Masters
library [LAUGH].

89
00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:20.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you're interested
in that kind of stuff, like she is,

90
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.351
a lot of it with.

91
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:25.380
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I can highly recommend
Sarah Drasner's SVG animation work.
