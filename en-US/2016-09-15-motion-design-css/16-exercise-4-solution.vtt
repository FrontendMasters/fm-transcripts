[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.929
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Let's do this
little experiment together now, and

3
00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.630
you can compare what I
get with what you got.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.570
So here we've got Tuna, and we want him to
wag his tail anytime we hover on his tail.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.510
So whenever we hover on his
tail he starts wagging it,

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.930
cuz cats beat their tails against
things when they're angry with you.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.490
I know this.

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.750
I have the scars to prove it.

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.050
So this, initially,
we've got this tail element.

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.800
And that's the thing that we're
gonna be animating, just the tail.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.850
And we are gonna scope,
scope our animations to it.

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.410
We've already got a tail
wag animation running.

13
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.860
And we want to give it
infinite iteration count.

14
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.663
We want it to run constantly.

15
00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:50.390
It just snaps back,
that looks terrible, right?

16
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.600
We don't want it to just be like thumping
down and up, it looks unnatural.

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.281
If we set it to alternate though,
that background position

18
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:02.880
is going to move from 0% to 100% over and
over again.

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.600
Down here, it's gonna go back and
forth, back and forth.

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.230
Giving him that wonderful
kind of pendulous tail swing.

21
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.931
However we don't want him to be running
his little tail swing by default.

22
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:18.687
We only want him to do that
when he's been hovered.

23
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:24.741
So let's give them an animation-play-state

24
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:28.540
of paused, get it, paused.

25
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.355
Somebody got it.

26
00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.788
[LAUGH] I made a joke.

27
00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:39.747
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go tail, pseudo class hover and

28
00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:44.105
we're gonna grab that
animation-play-state.

29
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.530
I'm a copy and paste coder what can I say.

30
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.018
You'll see all my typos if
I try to write it out and

31
00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:53.349
then we'll be here forever looking for
them.

32
00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:58.129
And so we set it to running when it's
being hovered, watch what happens.

33
00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:05.731
So anytime I pet him,
he's like stop it, I'm watching birds.

34
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:08.819
Stop it, stop it.

35
00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.948
All right, so that's a cute thing.

36
00:02:10.948 --> 00:02:13.445
You might use this, for instance,

37
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:17.783
if you have a very fancy button effect or
something like that.

38
00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:20.970
Which I'm not saying you should make
really fancy button effects, but

39
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.852
if you did, you might have it only
run when people hover over it.

40
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.907
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I don't know, I think
you could do some cool things with it,

41
00:02:29.907 --> 00:02:31.600
if you do feel free to send them my way.

42
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.540
I'm Rachel Neighbors on the Twitters.

43
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.750
I'd love to see what people come up with.
