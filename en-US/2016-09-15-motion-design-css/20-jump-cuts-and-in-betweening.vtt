[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.632
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So let's talk a little
bit more about those state full

3
00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:07.506
transitions.

4
00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:11.175
Now Silicon Valley has been
carefully studying and

5
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:16.048
using motion design in operating
system UIs since the early 90s.

6
00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.747
First, before we talk about why,

7
00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.335
we need to understand
a concept called the jump cut.

8
00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:23.670
You might have heard me
use this expression.

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.670
Now this is from film,

10
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.800
it describes when the camera cuts
directly to a different perspective.

11
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.630
For instance, a different angle or
a different screen.

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.740
No fade, no movement,
moving the camera is called a pan.

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.713
It's common in dramas, it's common for
showing conversations,

14
00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:42.914
I've got something from
the public domain here.

15
00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:45.939
Notice how we've got this establishing
shot of the two people and

16
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.922
now we've jumped cut to his face, right?

17
00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:52.294
We're looking at his face, he looks to the
side and now when we jump cut to her face,

18
00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:56.231
we're assuming cuz we had that little
early on directors figured that they

19
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.748
learned a couple of tricks.

20
00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:01.403
One was that if you jump cut in
the direction that a person,

21
00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:06.028
an actor on screen is looking, human
brains have now intuited that that is

22
00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:09.405
where the camera is now
pointing a few seconds later.

23
00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:13.501
There are a couple of other
rules like the 180 rule which is

24
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.390
that you never move the camera
outside 180 degrees of shooting.

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.520
Some people do break that for effect.

26
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.030
But you have to be a cinematic genius

27
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.700
to be able to break that
rule without consequence.

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.768
But for the rest of us,

29
00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:31.660
breaking the 180 rule would cause
a lot of confusion in our audiences.

30
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.405
But specifically that having actors
looking towards the location of the next

31
00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:40.110
shot and having these establishing shots
to show the relation of the actors in

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.318
relation to each other.

33
00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:45.263
These were little things that
directors used to train audiences.

34
00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:49.576
You think that back when talkies
first landed in cinemas that

35
00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.293
people were following along easily?

36
00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:54.430
No, they went through
a training period too.

37
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.340
And you can see this in very
early silent films, the motion,

38
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.670
there were a lot less cuts,
there were a lot more pans.

39
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.490
We've been stepping up how we use
these cuts as people have matured,

40
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.400
as our brains have become supple and
understood how it works.

41
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.050
So now we have this whole visual shorthand
that we're learning since the age we can

42
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.620
watch cartoons, and
we're not even aware we're using anymore.

43
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.670
So jump cuts, yes, let's take a look at
how jump cuts work in our user interface.

44
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.170
This is from codrops, now this is a drop
down and when you click on the button,

45
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.048
it's a little pale here, but
you can see that the whole drop down,

46
00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:36.370
it just kind of appears, got some monkeys,
you got bears and squirrels.

47
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.340
It's jump cut, open, close,
open, close, state one,

48
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.000
state two, state one, state two.

49
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.990
So the human mind is pretty
darn clever when this happens.

50
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.970
We're clever enough to figure this
out when we're watching movies.

51
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.560
We're clever enough to figure it out
when it happens to our user interfaces.

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.711
So what you're brain is doing behind the
scene is it's taking a before-image and

53
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.690
an after-image.

54
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.730
And it's extrapolating between these two

55
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.899
shots to create something
a little bit like this.

56
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.360
That takes cognitive effort though,
it does.

57
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.171
This effort in traditional animation
is called in-betweening and

58
00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:20.090
in-betweening in traditional animation
is only done by the most entry level or

59
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.660
inexpensive of animators.

60
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.690
People that you would perhaps,
ship this off overseas to do.

61
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.430
Steven Gordon, we saw him do the walk
cycle earlier, he's a key frame animator.

62
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.770
In an animation he would be
drawing the walking cat and

63
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.460
the sitting cat,
the before and after states.

64
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.390
And then they would send those frames
off to some people in Korea or

65
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.120
maybe in China,
a lot of animation happening in China now

66
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.670
where the dollar will get a lot more man
hours then it will in United States.

67
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.890
And nobody wants to be an in-betweener,
drawing all the cats in between.

68
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.240
It's a dead end job,

69
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.100
you cannot pay people in the United States
enough money to do this.

70
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.770
So all those little grey cats,
those are the in-betweens.

71
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.810
And when you have a jumpcut UI,
your brain is in-betweening all of that.

72
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.490
And we are all in our mental prime.

73
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.690
This, we look at this and
it's easy for us.

74
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.179
But we look at computers every day.

75
00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:17.970
So our brains are optimized for this.

76
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.638
You could say that we run every UI
in our brain on our mental GPU.

77
00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:24.510
They are all optimized for us.

78
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.810
But for really young and older users whose
brains are perhaps a little less nimble

79
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.160
and a little less adapted to working
in a strictly digital environment and

80
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.890
staring at a screen for
more than four hours a day.

81
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.810
Yes, we do stare at screens for
quite a bit of our waking life, do we not?

82
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.096
We do you have a few things we take for
granted and this is one of them.

83
00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:50.500
So there's no in-betweening done.

84
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.182
It's all on their brains to do this.

85
00:04:52.182 --> 00:04:54.972
It's all on their brains
to make this assumption.

86
00:04:54.972 --> 00:04:57.050
That can get a little tiresome.

87
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.080
It can lead to a lot of
hearing of what just happened

88
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.740
when people are using an interface.

89
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.770
In fact, if you were standing in on some
user testing, who here does user testing

90
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.177
and they actually like show up and
watch people over the shoulders?

91
00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:09.952
I see a couple of hands.

92
00:05:09.952 --> 00:05:11.115
Good on you, good on you.

93
00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:14.130
You might hear this what just
happened from time to time.

94
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.361
That's a good time to think,

95
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:17.837
could I have animated that to
make it a little more obvious?

96
00:05:17.837 --> 00:05:18.922
If there's no direct,

97
00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:22.451
immediate design decision you could have
made to have made it more obvious you

98
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:26.330
might consider how animation
might have made that work better.

99
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.560
So here's what happens when we've
actually animated the effect.

100
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.961
Now everyone is happy,
they can see clearly what's happening.

101
00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:42.345
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Researchers learned
back in the 90s that animating

102
00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:47.036
the transition between those two
states actually lets the user

103
00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:50.500
take a shortcut through
their visual cortex.

104
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.150
So it handles the change in user interface
without disrupting their main task.

105
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.180
You can think of a human brain
a little bit like a computer.

106
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.593
You have a main thread and
then you have a GPU,

107
00:06:05.593 --> 00:06:09.060
a graphics processing unit
in your visual cortex.

108
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.340
You can feed people a lot of information
through their visual cortex without

109
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.310
interrupting what they're
actually thinking about.

110
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.890
This is why you can drive and talk to
a person in your seat at the same time.

111
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.370
Here's a quote from a really great
paper that was released in 1993,

112
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.290
I love this one.

113
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.520
[COUGH]
Animation allows the user to continue

114
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.240
thinking about the task domain
with no need to shift context to

115
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.750
the interface domain.

116
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.682
By eliminating sudden visual changes,

117
00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:39.476
animation lessens the chance
that the user is surprised.

118
00:06:39.476 --> 00:06:43.791
So there were a bunch of papers published
about this in the early 90s and

119
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:48.885
then they all disappeared, probably as the
researchers were bought up and their work

120
00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:53.709
became classified by you guessed it,
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Companies

121
00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.930
that build operating systems and
later on, apps.

122
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.120
In fact, nowhere is motion in UI and

123
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.580
animation in UI for that matter more
apparent than in touch interfaces.

124
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.230
Can you imagine using your
smart phone with no animations?

125
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.460
Like it's just a tap and
a jump cut for everything you do.

126
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.410
Can you imagine that,
would you like using your phone?

127
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.060
Would you have bought your phone compared
to one that has an animated interface,

128
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.090
one that could anticipate gestures and

129
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.670
move things around under your
fingertips in response to your actions?

130
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.740
On such a small screen, you can't get away
with jump cuts like you can on a desktop.

131
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.530
Desktops have users trained, we spent
years learning how to disassociate

132
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.170
keyboard and mouse inputs from
what we see on the screen.

133
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.780
I remember doing that training
in elementary school.

134
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.405
Kids don't have to do it with touch
screens because they touch things on

135
00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.480
a screen and the things react to them.

136
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.509
That's very important.

137
00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:57.110
So Apple invested so
much in animation and touch and

138
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.850
coupling them tightly together.

139
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.520
Apple was not the first company
to come up with a touchscreen.

140
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.913
But it was the first company to couple
these two things so closely and so well

141
00:08:11.913 --> 00:08:18.002
together that people definitely preferred
this interface to the competition's.

142
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.310
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Animation was
a big part of the iPhone's success.

143
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.150
So the visual cortex, this is a much
better visual representation.

144
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.550
It works like your computer's GPU,
it's dedicated to processing graphical

145
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:38.430
information while the rest of the machine
can get on with doing what it needs to do.

146
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.520
It's a little shortcut you can take.

147
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.454
I use this image because this
image is like a shortcut too.

148
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.800
And this is one of the reasons
why jank is so dangerous.

149
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.440
And a little rough performance like
if that gesture on your phone,

150
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.170
the screen is dragging behind where you're
trying to pull it with your finger and

151
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.045
it's just not quite making it.

152
00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:08.750
It destroys that illusion of life,
that illusion of one to one

153
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.050
interconnection between your
interaction and the screen's response.

154
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.860
And this is why performance with animation
is such a big deal because if you don't

155
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.557
get those very smooth and

156
00:09:19.557 --> 00:09:25.260
sinuous animations down, it bounces
people right back onto their main thread.

157
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.430
So you might wanna use animation to get
people going through their visual cortex.

158
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.070
But if you're animation is janky,
if it stutters, if it shudders, if there

159
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.500
are breaks between point A and Point B, it
pops them right back onto the main thread.

160
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.995
And you're losing all that perceived speed
boost and all of that cognitive load ease,

161
00:09:43.995 --> 00:09:45.920
you're dumping it right out and

162
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.790
you're burning battery power
while you're doing it.
