2
00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:06.282
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: What's our
coverage like with CSS animations?

3
00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:12.380
Well, it's not as good as
the coverage with CSS transitions.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.691
Let me get into that.

5
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.161
Of course it's not available on IE 9 and
lower and Opera Mini.

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:23.103
But what you didn't know
is that Safari and Android,

7
00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:29.340
both of them still use webkit,
the webkit prefix.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.730
It looks like they're coming
down from that, but still,

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.350
if you actually go over to caniuse.com,
hang on, we can do this.

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.480
Here's my mouse.

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.090
If you actually go over here and you say,

12
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.168
I want to see the relative usage of these
things, here's where you can get the idea

13
00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:48.900
that, quite a few of some of these
browsers that are still popular and

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.990
still being used by a quite a lot of
people require that -webkit prefix.

15
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.936
[NOISE] And look at this.

16
00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:56.650
Look at this Opera Mini coverage.

17
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.310
Look at that.

18
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.400
So you gotta keep this in mind
when you're animating stuff.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.128
I always encourage people to look
at their actual user statistics.

20
00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:09.826
If you're working on a site, go find
the people in marketing and be like,

21
00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:12.523
could I have a look at our
relative usage statistics?

22
00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:18.649
And go see if you have lots of Opera Mini
user or lots of Internet Explorer 9 or

23
00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.089
8 users, and be sure to build your
animations bulletproofly on their behalf.

24
00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:31.240
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So
why do CSS Animations rock?

25
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.420
Well, they got looping.

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.711
You can't loop things with transitions.

27
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.064
If you wanna loop,
you gotta use CSS animations.

28
00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.687
They're self starting, they don't
require a trigger like transition.

29
00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:45.399
Transitional only kicks in if you're
taking a property and you're changing it.

30
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.967
With CSS Animation, you tell it
what properties you want to change,

31
00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:50.927
you dictate.

32
00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:55.257
They repeat, we talked about looping, but

33
00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:59.840
you can set how many times
it does that as well.

34
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.910
Alternating, you can alternate, make it
go from beginning to end and backwards,

35
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.840
that kind of swinging effect
we saw with the tail.

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.900
And lastly, Grouping, each animation
can change a number of properties.

37
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.900
So if you want to edit a lot of
things happening at the same time,

38
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.810
sometimes having a key frame
block is the better idea.

39
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.860
I also want to show you one tiny trick
that I didn't show you perhaps earlier.

40
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.530
Let's see if I can do this.

41
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.821
So remember when we had
Tuna walking earlier?

42
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:33.292
He's doing that catwalk strut there.

43
00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.168
Well, check this out.

44
00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:39.019
You don't actually need
the 0% on this one.

45
00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.506
Because the default values, the 00,
they're default so both just needed 100%.

46
00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:48.580
You don't always need to use 0%.

47
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.680
Check it out.

48
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.160
Anyone who tells you that CSS animations
are bulky and take up a lot of space has

49
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
never been introduced to the steps
function or has learned these tricks.

50
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.020
[LAUGH] Anyway, that said, it is now
time for our delectable lunch break.

51
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.240
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

52
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.400
But first, before we all depart,
are there any questions?

53
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.666
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Apples to apples,

54
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:19.330
is there a performance difference
between keyframes and transition?

55
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.734
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Is there a performance
difference between keyframes and

56
00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.660
transition?

57
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.381
So the difference between animations and
transitions,

58
00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:27.144
is there a performance difference?

59
00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:28.259
Not that I'm aware of.

60
00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.921
If there is one, it is news to me, but

61
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.790
I never like to say never when
it comes to these things.

62
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.539
I'm just gonna say, as far as I'm
concerned, they perform the same.

63
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.121
But good question, good idea.

64
00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.899
You can never be sure.

65
00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:47.834
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: With behavior like bouncing,
I noticed that you can mimic at

66
00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:52.963
least one kind of bounce with
the cubic herbs on easing.net but

67
00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:58.802
that there is no CSS functionality
at this time for multiple bouncing.

68
00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:05.464
And you have to pretty much manually
code that with keyframe's animations.

69
00:04:05.464 --> 00:04:10.672
So, how do you like make decisions
about whether to use transitions or

70
00:04:10.672 --> 00:04:15.719
keyframe animation for
something like an object bot's behavior?

71
00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.791
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Very good question.

72
00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:20.056
So those of you who are intense
who remembered the Flash days.

73
00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:20.776
Remember that?

74
00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:22.482
You could do bounces in Flash.

75
00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:26.224
That is to say that ball, when we moved
across there are cubic Béziers to give it

76
00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:29.186
a little bounce at the beginning,
a little bounce at the end.

77
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:33.209
But there's no cubic base Bézier curve for
dribbling the ball for instance.

78
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:37.237
That you could, technically,
make a bunch of CSS keyframes and

79
00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:42.410
run an animation on the ball and you
describe, I want it to bounce like this.

80
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.274
It takes a lot of work.

81
00:04:43.274 --> 00:04:46.290
Wouldn't it be nice if
there was an advance

82
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.660
cubic Bézier syntax we could
use to describe a bounce and

83
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.650
pass it that value instead of just
having that single bounce value?

84
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.710
That's something that I'm actually
working with the W3C right now to try

85
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.000
to come up with.

86
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.770
We've done our best to provide a need for
it because this does come up a lot.

87
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.290
It was a part of Flash.

88
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.862
I think there is a design need for it.

89
00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:11.333
But when the cubic Bézier
syntax was created,

90
00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:14.451
it wasn't created with bounces in mind.

91
00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:17.216
So maybe in the future,
that will be a possibility.

92
00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.460
But for now, if you want to do bounces,

93
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.000
you will have to rely on
CSS Animations and keyframes to do it.

94
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.183
And it will be a little manual and
I might be able to show you a couple of

95
00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:32.352
tricks to make it a little
less painful to do.

96
00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:36.343
Later on, we will talk about
how to use CSS Animation

97
00:05:36.343 --> 00:05:41.074
timing functions inside keyframe blocks,
which you can do.

98
00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:45.860
It is one of the few CSS Animation
properties that you can put

99
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.361
inside a keyframe block to
describe how each one of those

100
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:53.540
percentages should change over time.

101
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.885
I was surprised when I read the spec and
found it out too.

102
00:05:56.885 --> 00:05:58.987
It'll be a lot of fun when we get there.
