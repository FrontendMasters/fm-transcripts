[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:07.600
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I wanna give you the
chance to use some animation stacking on

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.276
your own.

4
00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:12.485
We're gonna use animation-delay start
the sitting animation after the walking

5
00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:13.160
animation.

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.020
Now it's time for the learning by
watching portion of this exercise.

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.090
Switching over to the editor view,

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.540
you can see that all we have going
on here is some serious CSS.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.190
We've got Tuna on
a walk-cycle right here and

10
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.220
I've also provided us with a sit-down
set of key frames as well.

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.180
We're gonna run sit-down after
the walk-cycle has finished.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.733
And it's gonna look a little
something like this.

13
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.705
So first, we start by adding a comma.

14
00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:52.260
And we're gonna do sit-down,
and let's see.

15
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.950
It's gonna use steps.

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.000
It's got five frames,
we're doing steps five.

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.090
And we want it to only happen once,
go by default.

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.113
So let's see what happens.

19
00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:06.493
We need to give it a duration so
it can actually run.

20
00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:10.395
Let's give it a 0.5 seconds duration.

21
00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:16.570
So now he's walking, he's walking and,
well, wait a minute, what happened there?

22
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.209
As you can see,
when they run at the same time,

23
00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.910
the last animation listed runs first.

24
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.292
So this animation is starting
with him sitting down and

25
00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.856
then it launches into him walking.

26
00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:27.277
That's no good.

27
00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:30.970
So this walk-cycle up here
is happening four times.

28
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.860
You'll notice that you
can actually rearrange

29
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240
these animation bits however you want.

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.310
It doesn't really matter where they come,
just so long,

31
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.950
the only part that matters is in
what order you put your time values.

32
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.634
So we've got 1 second times 4 iterations.

33
00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:55.140
So sit-down should run
after a 4 second wait.

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
So notice the first value is 0.5 seconds,
the second value is 4 seconds.

35
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.640
That's its delay.

36
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.410
He jumped back to his
original starting position.

37
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.570
You need to give him
a fill node of forward, so

38
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.910
he remembers his last animation value.

39
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.016
Let's see it happens now.

40
00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.040
He's walking, he's walking,

41
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.906
he's gonna start sitting and
he does what he is told.

42
00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.051
Good kitty.

43
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:24.190
We will give you a cookie after class.

44
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.360
Although, I don't think cats
like cookies but whatever.

45
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.860
He'll get one.
