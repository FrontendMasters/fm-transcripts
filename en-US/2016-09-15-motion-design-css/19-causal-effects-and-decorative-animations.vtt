2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:04.820
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Causal Effects.

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.950
Now, causal animation is great for

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.140
indicating when something has
caused something else to happen.

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.605
Consider loaders, spinners, those
are great examples of causal effects.

6
00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:20.228
They indicate when the server has gotten
up enough information to the page for

7
00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.664
it to be caused to load properly.

8
00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:25.009
Hover effects are also pretty familiar.

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.436
As such, we have all at one point or
another made a hover effect,

10
00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:29.459
I'm pretty sure.

11
00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.194
Here, we've got this button.

12
00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:34.930
When we hover over the button,
notice it depresses and changes colors.

13
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.750
That's pretty familiar.

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.780
All that they indicate, in this case,
all that this little animation,

15
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.290
this transition is indicating is that
you are the cause of this thing.

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.220
You are causing this button to activate.

17
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.046
Here's a slightly less familiar one.

18
00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:54.619
This is an interesting little
accessibility feature.

19
00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.540
So notice that when you hover over
the tab, it causes the menu to move up or

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.240
down the direction that it's gonna go and
if you click on it.

21
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.734
This gives the user a little
indication that, hi,

22
00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:08.649
you're interacting with this thing.

23
00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.525
If you do something to it,
it's gonna change things.

24
00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.396
So let's do that again.

25
00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.862
Notice, hover, it bounces down a little.

26
00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:21.106
Click, it actually pulls down.

27
00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.521
Hover again, it slides up a little.

28
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.860
You click it and it pulls up.

29
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.580
That's a nice little thing to do for
users, if you have time and

30
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.860
energy to invest in thinking
about their well-being.

31
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.950
It lets their brains have a little prep
the time to realize that if I do this,

32
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.480
it's going to change, and what direction
I can anticipate the change to come from.

33
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.770
Now something from not me.

34
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.830
Notice that big peacock.

35
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.330
I'm gonna talk about that peacock next.

36
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.190
Now notice hovering over
the buttons causes different

37
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.430
things to slide in and out.

38
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.238
Indicates that you
are the cause of these changes.

39
00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:02.687
When you hit Start, look,
stateful transition.

40
00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:05.839
And here, when you're hovering over
the different, like which one's the boy or

41
00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:07.620
which one's the girl?

42
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.840
This is a very strong indicator that
whichever one of these you click

43
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.190
is going to be your selection.

44
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.760
And look, boom, we got some
supplemental animation on the screen.

45
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.770
Now imagine how this would've been
in the era before animations,

46
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.424
like back in the 90s.

47
00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:24.360
This would've just been a series of
forms with radio buttons and a click.

48
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.970
And then the page would wipe and
show you whether you were right or not.

49
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.670
And then you'd move on to the next.

50
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.436
And I guess that would be fun, but
honestly this is so much nicer.

51
00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:37.001
Really fond of the Cornell Lab and
their work.

52
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.650
So lastly we have Decorative Animations.

53
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.210
Decorative Animations are embellishment.

54
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.380
They don't actually increase
the information density on the page.

55
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.620
This is important to think about.

56
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.130
All the animations I've shown you so far
have told you something about the content.

57
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.917
They've shown you what
direction it's going in.

58
00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:56.228
They've shown you that you were
going to cause something to happen.

59
00:02:56.228 --> 00:02:59.210
They've brought to light other information
that supplements the information

60
00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.840
that's there.

61
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.200
It's all very information based,
we're adding back feelings of physics.

62
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.370
We're improving the information
density on the page.

63
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.626
But decorative animations, they don't
actually contribute a whole lot.

64
00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.967
You can spot them because if you
ask the person who provides them,

65
00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:14.314
maybe this person is you.

66
00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:17.841
If you ask yourself,
why is this animation doing this thing?

67
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.326
If you can't verbalize a reason for why,

68
00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:23.805
there's a good chance that it
is a decorative animation,

69
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:28.490
might not be worth the development
hours or the battery life to display.

70
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.240
So keep that in mind.

71
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.490
So often animation, I should mention,
will be more than one of these.

72
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.793
You can have a stateful transition
that is also decorative or

73
00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:42.350
a supplemental animation that is
delightful and pretty to look at.

74
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.590
But sometimes if that's all it's doing,

75
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.260
if all it is is decoration,
it's not worth doing.

76
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.670
So here's my menu slowed down for detail.

77
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.470
You can see that I animated the in-between
states between more and nix this.

78
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.644
I didn't have to do this.

79
00:03:59.644 --> 00:04:05.530
I could've just changed it from one to the
other or faded it from one into the other.

80
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.260
I didn't have to animate that.

81
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.027
It's not actually making it more useful
to the person to see that change.

82
00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:16.953
But at the same time,
I had the extra hours and

83
00:04:16.953 --> 00:04:22.118
I thought it was a nice detail to add and
it added a bit of polish to the interface.

84
00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:26.765
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Now here's an example
of a decorative animation used for

85
00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:27.450
a good reason.

86
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.439
Who remembers this?

87
00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:34.167
Probably the first time you ever
saw SVG animated in this way.

88
00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:35.832
When it came out it caused quite the stir.

89
00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:39.055
I was fortunate enough to meet
the developers behind this,

90
00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:43.550
and I can tell you that they stumbled
across this effect by accident.

91
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.970
So what happened was around the time
that the Xbox One was coming out,

92
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.180
all the different venues,
Polygon included, this is from Polygon.

93
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.717
They were getting these consoles and
they were getting pictures and

94
00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:57.893
they were getting specs, and
they were running their reviews.

95
00:04:57.893 --> 00:05:02.937
So every console review site out there
was posting pictures of the Xbox One and

96
00:05:02.937 --> 00:05:07.202
then a long form article about
what was great, what was awesome,

97
00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:09.160
what wasn't so great, etc.

98
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.320
How was Polygon gonna stand out and make
an article that people would want to share

99
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.604
more than all those other articles showing
the exact same pictures of the exact same

100
00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:20.390
device, which looks the same everywhere?

101
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.490
How were they gonna stand out?

102
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.840
Well, I guess they could take
really nice photos of it.

103
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.890
Or maybe they could do a video
of someone playing with it, but

104
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.960
it's a console, it sits there.

105
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.030
So what could they do to add interest
to this thing that everyone else has?

106
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.560
They went with its specs chart.

107
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.860
They took that diagram of it and
they animated it.

108
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.610
And no one else had done this at
this time, so this was very new and

109
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.670
very different.

110
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.317
And yes, it's decorative but

111
00:05:45.317 --> 00:05:49.060
they used this to showcase an otherwise
boring piece of information.

112
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.720
So keep in mind, sometimes doing
things for a decorative reason.

113
00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.160
If you can verbalize why you should be
doing that, it still can be justified.

114
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.596
In this case, why would you do
this with this illustration?

115
00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.445
Because it's a centerpiece.

116
00:06:06.445 --> 00:06:10.745
Because it makes it stand apart from every
other image like it on the Internet.

117
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:14.414
Because it's doing something different
enough that it gives us an edge over our

118
00:06:14.414 --> 00:06:15.134
competition.

119
00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:18.779
A lot of people use this effect now
in places where it doesn't matter.

120
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.359
In places like I've seen itty
bitty icons used to separate

121
00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:27.320
segments of a page on
an interactive agency site.

122
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.130
Nobody's going to be looking
that closely at them.

123
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.509
They're probably not even
going to notice the change.

124
00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:32.252
Why are they done?

125
00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:35.070
So that the agency can be like,
we know how to do that Polygon effect.

126
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.170
That would not be cool in a banking site.

127
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.610
That would not be cool in an app
you expect people to use every day.

128
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.548
That is just too decorative
to be worth doing.

129
00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:50.154
But perhaps the agency was
able to justify it by saying,

130
00:06:50.154 --> 00:06:53.380
we have to use this effect so
people know we can do the Polygon effect.
