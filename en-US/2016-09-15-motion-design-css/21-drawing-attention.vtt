2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.716
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Now simple
little animations, as I mentioned,

3
00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:08.700
they accentuate tasks and states.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.600
Now research has shown that humans
are absolute suckers for movement.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.684
Which makes sense, because it meant
life or death for our ancestors.

6
00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:25.970
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So yeah,
this was a research paper in 2010.

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.464
Where basically the researcher found out
that people, basically, they're really,

8
00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:38.210
their attention is captured by
increasing the animacy of objects.

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
Animacy here not being a word
you'll find in dictionaries.

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.287
But it means to increase the aliveness of
an object, or how alive it appears to be.

11
00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:52.157
Now humans attention can be
immediately grabbed by two things,

12
00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:54.818
one of them is color and
the other is motion.

13
00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:01.248
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: This goes to reason that
if you want someone to notice something,

14
00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:04.228
you should make it bright and
jiggly, right?

15
00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:07.146
Well our ancestors,
they were always on the lookout for

16
00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.680
sudden movements of prey and predator.

17
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.230
So it would makes sense that bright
colors indicate poison or food,

18
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.630
and jiggly things equal a lion
in the bush or something to eat.

19
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.180
But you know,

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.530
it could also be a great way to get people
to click on your free screen savers ad.

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.840
Wonderful, of course any good
information can be abused.

22
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.910
So how do we use it responsibly?

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.750
Well there's another
thing to keep in mind,

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600
all humans have something
called a cone a vision.

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.410
When you're ever looking at something for
a long time, like a wall,

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.190
if you stare at this for

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.840
a long time, you'll notice that everything
around the edges starts to gray out.

28
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.108
That's because,
when you're walking through space,

29
00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:48.996
your eyes are constantly moving in
something called saccade movement.

30
00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:53.044
You're constantly looking at that thing
over there and that thing there, and it's

31
00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:57.320
like your brain is refreshing its mental
model of where everything is in reality.

32
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.000
So that, look,

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.520
when you start studying the human
visual system, it gets pretty intense.

34
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090
You start realizing that
what we perceive as vision,

35
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.040
is really sort of like an emulation,
like a game we're all living in.

36
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.754
That it's a second world that you
are moving in through, by interfacing your

37
00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:18.340
brain with your muscles and your inputs,
and it gets really interesting.

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.343
But to keep this model that we're living
in going, our eyes are constantly moving

39
00:02:22.343 --> 00:02:26.370
around subconsciously, gathering
information and updating the model.

40
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.170
If you stare one one direction for

41
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.130
too long it'll become apparent just how
limited your human eye actually is.

42
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.270
So in the center, the center of your
vision is very detailed and very accurate.

43
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.360
You can only really see the features on
my face when you're looking at my face.

44
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.750
When you're looking at the screen,
you do not see the features on my face.

45
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.289
You cannot tell if I have glasses
on in some cases or not, or

46
00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.544
even perhaps what my expression is.

47
00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:57.165
Although there is evidence that indicates
people are better perceiving perception,

48
00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:01.554
perceiving people's facial motions
in their peripheral vision,

49
00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:03.410
in the outer cone of vision.

50
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.880
One of the reasons that I've heard
that the Mona Lisa looks like she's

51
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.110
smiling when you look away from her,
but then when you look at her

52
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.580
she doesn't look like she's smiling, might
be due to being better able to perceive

53
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.606
the tonal values in our peripheral vision
than we are with our central vision.

54
00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:28.730
So tonal values like human, what is it,

55
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.700
luminance, yes, and motion, our peripheral
vision is very sensitive to those things.

56
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.780
However, we're more sensitive to
color in the center of our vision.

57
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.760
So it stands to reason that
you should try, if you can

58
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.670
kinda guesstimate where people will be
looking at a page on a page, to use things

59
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.925
that don't distract too much from their
experience, unless it's super important.

60
00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:55.255
So for instance, all right,

61
00:03:55.255 --> 00:04:00.060
I gotta look at the screen now for
this one.

62
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.880
So here we have a little
alert that shows up.

63
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.390
And we might do that using a fade,
because this isn't the center of vision.

64
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.960
We don't need to move it around.

65
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.580
We don't need to make it too bright, or
too loud, or increase its visual weight.

66
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.060
A fade is appropriate,
changing its color or

67
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.130
its density as it were, would probably
be enough to get people's attention.

68
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.790
However, if we're out
there in the periphery,

69
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.960
we might need to give
something a little bounce.

70
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.940
When I might need to move it around a
little bit to capture people's attention.

71
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.160
That might be why we see sidebars bouncing
so much in those terrible old ads.

72
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.970
Because if you make it bright and
bouncy, nobody can help but

73
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.820
notice it adds a distraction.

74
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.570
So keep this in mind when you
were animating your interface.

75
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.090
For instance that side bar that I
animated, it's kind of a lot of movement.

76
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.370
But I'm assuming that people
are intending for that to happen and

77
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.710
thus are expecting it to happen.

78
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.652
But if I wanted it to be more of an aside,
less interrupting,

79
00:04:56.652 --> 00:05:00.130
I might just have faded that out,
instead of bouncing it off like that.

80
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.697
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So
it's important to remember that motion and

81
00:05:06.697 --> 00:05:11.420
opacity are to animation, what font
sizes and weight are to typography.

82
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.910
That is to say, you don't want to make
everything 48 pixels tall, and bold,

83
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.380
and italic with an underline,
and all those good things.

84
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.920
When everything vies for tension and
users don't know what's to focus on.

85
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.040
So you want to be judicious
in your use of animations.

86
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.230
And try to limit yourself to just what
is necessary to get your point across.

87
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.550
And if you want to do more than that,
be able to justify it.
