[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:07.288
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So we've been talking
about taking a look at how fast

3
00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:09.760
things are going in the browser.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.870
And I said, whatever your duration is,
you wanna have it and then have it again.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.410
There's another option, which is
that you can work in your browser.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.674
Yes, you can do this today
with your developer tools.

7
00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:24.870
With all of your animations
slowed down by default.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.786
So you'll be developing with
short durations by default.

9
00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:31.778
Let me show you how you would do this.

10
00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:37.041
We're gonna use my site.

11
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.507
Let me open up
Firefox Developer Edition here.

12
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.168
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: We have these options

13
00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:52.843
in Firefox Developer Edition and Chrome
and I'm going to show you how to do them,

14
00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:53.689
do it in both.

15
00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:59.967
So here in Firefox Developer Edition I've
open the developer tools using Cmd+Alt+I.

16
00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:04.666
Or, if you're on a Windows machine,
you'd use Ctrl+Alt+I.

17
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:08.725
Now let's see,
we have got an animation tab right here.

18
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:12.718
Boom, I'm gonna make these
a little bit smaller, so

19
00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.397
that we can see a little bit better.

20
00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:18.802
But down here we've got the animation tab,
we've got a lot of timelines, there cool.

21
00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:20.061
We'll check them out.

22
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:25.210
But we can also set the entire playback
rate to run at a quarter of what it

23
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.666
should, and watch what happens now.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: It's working for

24
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.575
the main one, but
it's not working for the body.

25
00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:43.565
That was unexpected.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Hm,

26
00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:50.803
I think it only works if
I set it to a selected.

27
00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:54.964
Well that is odd, you can pause
all animations, but apparently in

28
00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:59.809
this version, there's a bug that's
not letting me slow them universally.

29
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.850
But it's there,
one day it will work as expected.

30
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.036
Let's take a look using
the Chrome dev tools.

31
00:02:11.842 --> 00:02:13.788
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Now in Chrome's dev

32
00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:19.250
tools it'll probably pop
up with the elements tab.

33
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.562
If you hit escape,
you will get this lovely

34
00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:27.346
console.
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: And

35
00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:30.920
there's some animation stuff happening up
here we'll talk about a little bit later.

36
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.675
But you also have these options,
these are liable to change over time.

37
00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:38.971
Like, you can set it to run it 100% or
10% or 25%.

38
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.110
25% is a sweet one.

39
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.550
So these might not be the same ones
that you're going to see in the future.

40
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.140
Problem is, as you can see when we
close the tab, the thing stop applying.

41
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.756
That might actually be what's
happening in Firefox too.

42
00:02:54.756 --> 00:03:01.233
So as you can see, it 100% slows down
every animation from the text change,

43
00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:05.790
to the slide out rate,
to how fast her hands are moving.

44
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.018
And this lets us work with animations and
see that there's a little slight bounce

45
00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:13.140
happening in this slider,
which is exactly what I wanted.

46
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.300
I wanted it have a little
bouncy happy feel to it.

47
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.490
But it's kind of hard to see that
when you're running it at 100%.

48
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.880
So, for development,
I might actually use my browser,

49
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.950
with my browser open,
my browser's div tools open.

50
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.297
I might do everything and at 25%.

51
00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:35.438
I'm gonna see if that's actually true over
here, let me see if I can get that right.

52
00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.290
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: The nice thing that I

53
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.150
like about the tools in Firefox is that
you can make them run even faster.

54
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.761
It has a little bit more options,
which I appreciate.

55
00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:03.492
Let's see, no,
it's being a little buggy today.

56
00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:05.630
The difficulties of using nightlies and
such.

57
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.240
Sweetness.
