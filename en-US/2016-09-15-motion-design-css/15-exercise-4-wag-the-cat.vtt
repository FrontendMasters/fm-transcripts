&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: This one's really fun
because we get to play with Tuna's tail.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.790
Who doesn't like playing with cats' tails?

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.210
I'll tell you who doesn't like it,
the cat.

5
00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:15.040
So what we're gonna to do is we
gonna change the default CSS

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.440
animation properties of tuna.

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.950
So I'm gonna actually go to the site and
I'm gonna check to make sure.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.732
So what we want is we
wanna make his tail wag.

9
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:27.470
Cats don't like to be pet, right?

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.036
So the idea is that this tail
should be wagging back and

11
00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:32.865
forth to show an angry cat.

12
00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.335
And when you hover over him,

13
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:39.010
we want him to start wagging his tail
because he's angry, cuz you're hovering.

14
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.620
When you move your mouse
away from his tail,

15
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.700
he'll stop wagging his tail,
it will go to paused.

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.066
You can do this, you have the power.

17
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.810
It's, all you're gonna be doing is
manipulating animation direction and

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.910
paused using classes and hover.
