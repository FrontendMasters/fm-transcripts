[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.190
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: I hope you still
have your ball exercises open,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.970
because now it's time for
a less taxing experiment.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.880
I want you to experiment with different
kinds of easing and durations to

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.330
find the combination that feels right to
you, for how that ball should be rolling.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.590
And when you're done, take a break.

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.680
We're going to have a moment for
everyone to go powder their noses etc.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.490
When we get back, I will talk about the
coverage for browsers for CSS transitions.

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.788
It's time to experiment
with some of those easings.

10
00:00:36.788 --> 00:00:42.250
All right.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.620
So.

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.550
I asked everybody before
break to go out and play with

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.120
the kinds of easing that they can create
and pick one that feels the best of them.

14
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.980
So here's the transition timing function,
defaults to just ease.

15
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.240
We are gonna try linear.

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.510
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So boring.

17
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.170
Nothing moves that way.

18
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.040
Nothing ever moves that way.

19
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.380
Well we could try ease out or
slow out, goes out slowly.

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.780
This is the default,
comes with your browser.

21
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.010
Notice it starts fast and
then it slows down.

22
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.665
I guess that works all right.

23
00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:30.240
Ease-in would look like it's
running up against the wall.

24
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.990
Wait, ease-is is not an actual easing,
here, ease-in.

25
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.060
Notice it accelerates and
then it stops abruptly.

26
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.540
That might look better, if we had stopping
right here against the edge of the screen,

27
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.440
then it would look like it
just slammed into a wall.

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.990
But that doesn't really show
the effect of inertia and

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.985
friction upon this ball
as it rolls across.

30
00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:56.695
What probably is gonna happen is that
when the cat officially initially

31
00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:58.015
pushes the ball.

32
00:01:58.015 --> 00:01:59.795
It's gonna go a little fast.

33
00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:04.827
It's gonna go a little fast as
it's got an input of energy and

34
00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:10.120
then it's gonna slow down as that energy
is siphoned off by the universe at large

35
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.180
and our slow and inescapable
progress towards violent heat death.

36
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.787
But that's for another talk.

37
00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:19.228
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm sorry.

38
00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:19.872
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: What?

39
00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:23.441
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That sure was fast.

40
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:24.530
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Sorry.

41
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.220
I go to these places fast,
such is my life.

42
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.295
So let's just pick one of these
where we're gonna, there we go,

43
00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:34.050
easeinOutQuint, that looks right.

44
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.340
It's gonna go fast, then it slows down.

45
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.600
Or no, no maybe.

46
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.690
I like easeinOutSine.

47
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.120
It's gonna speed up a little bit from
the input and then it's gonna slow down.

48
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.350
So copy the cubic buzeic curve,
now I go back here, and

49
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.290
we all like here's the cubic bezier
curve I want and it looks all right.

50
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.310
It does not look terrible.

51
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.140
So a little note about
cubic bezier curves here.

52
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.010
I was just talking with
a student about this earlier.

53
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.510
So we were talking a little
bit about performance and

54
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.310
perceived speed of interfaces earlier.

55
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.300
So that's something you should
keep in mind when assigning

56
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.120
easings to different elements in
your designs and user interfaces.

57
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.770
Ask yourself, when you're picking
whether you should use something that is

58
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.220
accelerated or decelerated, whether or
not this is a human initiated response.

59
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.080
Is the human interacting with something?

60
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.210
Is this a response to a click or
a hover or their behavior on the site?

61
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.130
In which case, you probably want something
that's decelerating, that is to say

62
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.400
it starts quickly, it responds immediately
and quickly to whatever their input is.

63
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.470
Yes ma'am, I am clicking on the button,
the button has been pressed,

64
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.500
you are awesome, we love you.

65
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.440
However, if it's something that the system
is doing, say you're giving them one of

66
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.310
those wonderful windows we've all seen,
sign up to this site now and

67
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.560
you'll get 10% off coupons, something like
that, something they didn't ask to happen.

68
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.170
You probably want something
that is accelerating.

69
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.380
That is, it comes in slowly and then
speeds up to get off to its final state.

70
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.990
That way,
they will be less surprised by the motion.

71
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.330
It's going to start slowly and thus be
less abrupt and less disruptful to them.

72
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.190
So keep that in mind when you're
working on your interfaces.

73
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.480
People do respond differently and
perceive differently.

74
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.430
How quickly something is changing has
to be something they've impacted, or

75
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.970
something that is going to impact them.
