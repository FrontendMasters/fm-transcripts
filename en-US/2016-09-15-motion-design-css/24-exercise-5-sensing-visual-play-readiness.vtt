&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So
here's a small exercise for

3
00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:07.650
sensing visual play readiness.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.620
When the browser has
finished loading everything,

5
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.310
we wanna change the class to remove
the visibility of the spinner.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.110
So we're gonna show and
hide the spinner using the loading class.

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.480
There's some information in
the actual exercise about what to do.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.840
I'm going to give you ten
minutes to do it, and

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.580
then we're going to do it together.

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.350
And yes we're using jQuery, but
if you don't want to use jQuery,

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.450
because you object to jQuery,
I respect your objection.

12
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.090
You can totally go ahead and

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.200
use JavaScript, plain old,
good old JavaScript, if you like.

14
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.326
But I'll be using jQuery.

15
00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.750
You're gonna listen for that load event.
