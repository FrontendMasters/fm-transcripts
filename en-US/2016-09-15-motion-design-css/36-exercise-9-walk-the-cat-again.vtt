00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: Background images aren't
the most performant thing to animate.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.270
Their positions are not the most
performant thing to animate.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.590
There should be.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.220
I totally lied, there is one, one more,
one more coding opportunity here, but

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040
it's super, super fun.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.760
It's all CSS.

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580
So you can totally show
off how much you know.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.220
We get to walk the cat again.

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.460
This time,

11
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.360
find a way to walk the cat without
using expensive background positioning.

12
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.320
I'm going to give you a big,
fat, hairy clue here.

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.562
You're gonna to wanna use transform and
you have a sprite image.

14
00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:43.913
What could you do to,
sa,y move that image around,

15
00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:47.276
instead of repositioning
it as a background image?

16
00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:51.388
It should be mentioned, by the way, that
the solution for this in the curriculum is

17
00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:54.470
a little bit different from
the solution I'm gonna show you.

18
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.860
So let me show you how
I would do it today.

19
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.192
And if you really wanna see some fancy
work involving a pseudo class you can

20
00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:02.760
check out the solution tomorrow.

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.180
So let's see what we've got here.

22
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.950
We've got a background-position and
it's set on the sprite here.

23
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.990
The first thing we're gonna do,

24
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.700
because animating this background
position is pretty darn non-performant.

25
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.590
And the background position
triggers all kinds of stuff.

26
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.320
It would be a lot nicer if we
move this over to a transform.

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.595
We can move a transform around in
more browsers more efficiently

28
00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:30.100
than we can move this background position.

29
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.030
So how do we get this image out
from that background position and

30
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.650
into a place where we can physically
manipulate it with transforms?

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.170
We do that by physically putting
it inside the tuna class.

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.510
So we're going to do img src=.

33
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.460
There is the sprite, he's still walking.

34
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.370
We've gotta stop that.

35
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.190
We remove the background image.

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.060
Actually, this is what it looks like
if I remove the background image.

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.116
You can see, it's just the cat.

38
00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:09.890
But I'm gonna give him a red background so
we can see exactly where the tuna div is.

39
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.440
Now the tuna div that he is sitting inside
has a height and width of 200 and 400.

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.570
We wanna only see the things inside
that window so we do overflow: hidden.

41
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.950
And this will automatically, automagically
hide the image that overflows.

42
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.170
But for now I'm going to leave that
commented out with some illegal CSS.

43
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.780
And now, we're gonna see what
we can do to animate it.

44
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.050
So let's get rid of this
animation on the tuna div,

45
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.910
we're gonna put it on tuna's image.

46
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.560
Well walk cycle, if we've noticed,
is still using background positions and

47
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.790
there's no background
position on that image.

48
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.380
We want it to use transforms.

49
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.219
So what's that gonna look like?

50
00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.046
Well you know I don't even
think we need this 0%.

51
00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:09.430
Let's do this, just use 100%.

52
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.650
Transform: translate,
we're gonna use translate.

53
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.741
And we're gonna use translateY cuz
we're translating on the y axis.

54
00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:20.720
And we're gonna try one 100%.

55
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.099
Let's see what that does.

56
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.829
Okay, we need to use- 100%.

57
00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.230
Boom.

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.960
So now all we've got
to do is come up here.

59
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.510
Turn on overflow hidden, and
get rid of the background.

60
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.950
And tuna is walking.

61
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.720
It is the same animation only instead
of using background position,

62
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.671
it's now actually using an image.

63
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:49.917
And moving that image around on the page.

64
00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:56.850
Doesn't disrupt the layout, doesn't
trigger repaints in Chrome, pretty nice.
