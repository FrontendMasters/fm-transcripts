2
00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.110
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: We're on
our way to CSS animations.

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.820
These are a little bit more
abusable than transitions,

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.940
part of that is because CSS
animations aren't supported

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.410
because CSS animations don't describe
a change from one state to another.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.430
Transition.

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.270
How should we change this property when
it is changed by some CSS animation?

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.590
I told you to change that property.

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.090
Now do it.

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.390
The property isn't gonna change if
the animations aren't readable.

11
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.140
So if you make an interface
that doesn't use transitions,

12
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.410
you're just using
animations on everything.

13
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.555
And animations aren't supported,

14
00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:38.110
then things don't change
the way you think they would.

15
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.480
They're a little bit more tricky.

16
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.890
I hope that I can share with you a little
bit more about how they are tricky.

17
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.330
All right, so
what does animation look like?

18
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.500
They share a lot,
a lot of similarities with transitions.

19
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.301
For instance, you might notice,
I'm gonna actually point here,

20
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:05.320
gonna use a pointing with my finger
&gt;&gt; Rachel Nabors: So

21
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.284
you'll notice this top line here,
animated thing, has an animation

22
00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:13.046
where a transition property would
be where you put a CSS property,

23
00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:17.370
you actually put the name of a @keyframes
block in this case black to white.

24
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.010
You give it a duration.

25
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.305
You can give it an easing.

26
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.690
But then you notice there's also
this number on the end here.

27
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.310
This one.
What does that mean?

28
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.340
Let's talk a little bit about
the differences between transitions and

29
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.150
animations, and that gets down to this
key frame block, and this number,

30
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.090
which is actually the number of times
you want that animation to run.

31
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.490
So here's how that looks in shorthand.

32
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.790
I've got the name, we've got the duration,
the timing function which is optional,

33
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.850
the delay it has a delay just
like transitions, also optional,

34
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.460
just like transitions, and iteration count
which is optional because it defaults to,

35
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.750
get this, one, just one.

36
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.430
So if you have an animation and you don't
tell it how many times you want it to run,

37
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.470
it will just run once.

38
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.090
In this regard you could use some
light transitions, but you shouldn't.

39
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.590
So let's take a look at each of those.

40
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.010
The animation name is the name of the key
frame block that you want to use.

41
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.080
Well talk a little bit about key frame
blocks and how we set them up later.

42
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.480
Let's just focus on
the animation syntax for now.

43
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.530
The animation's duration, or
how long the animation's going

44
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.000
to take to go from the beginning of that
key frame block all the way to the end,

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560
how long it's going to take to
animate all of those values.

46
00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:39.891
And animation iteration count, or
the number of times you want to go from

47
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:44.725
that 0% to 100%, you can set it to
infinite which means it will never stop,

48
00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:48.392
it will keep running forever,
it will keep iterating over and over.

49
00:02:48.392 --> 00:02:50.132
Or you could set it to say three,

50
00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:53.652
have the animation repeat three times,
it defaults to one.

51
00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:56.192
The animation will run one runs and
then be done,

52
00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:58.960
and it will evaporate like
it was never there before.

53
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.522
There's also animation-timing-function
which is like transition timing function.

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.140
It's so long.

55
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.410
It's so long.

56
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.880
Animation delay,
which is just like transition delay.

57
00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:17.830
All right, I told you were going to
talk about the key frames block.

58
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.120
This is the real magic of CSS animations.

59
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.500
Here you can see, we have key frames.

60
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.200
Key frames blocks named black to white.

61
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.860
Now it starts with a black background and
white color for

62
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.690
all of its text and
then by the time it's done running,

63
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.100
the background is going to be white and
the text is going to be black.

64
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.439
So it's essentially it's essentially
transposing those two values.

65
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.350
Now another way of writing it, instead of
doing 0%, 100%, you could use from and to,

66
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.650
the keywords.

67
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.175
This might help you when you're
getting started with CSS animations.

68
00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:59.740
Instead of using 0%, 100%,
saying you want to take it from these

69
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.510
values to these values can make a little
bit more sense syntactically for you.

70
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.020
However, there are some benefits
to using the percentages.

71
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.430
For instance you can say you want
things to happen like half way through.

72
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.930
We got 0%, 50% and
100% all up in this joint.

73
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.164
And check it out, you can even consolidate
shared values onto the same line.

74
00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:24.740
0% and
100% here have the same color value, so

75
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.320
we can just put a comma between them and
let them share a line.

76
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.980
They're very happy bunkmates.

77
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.560
So if you wanna have multiple animations,
just like with transitions,

78
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.700
you can write them out in longhand by
separating statements with commas.

79
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.026
So here we've got black to white,
it takes one second long.

80
00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:46.910
It's using, it's linear,

81
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.390
it runs once, we didn't actually
have to put that one there.

82
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.350
I did it, black to red takes two seconds,
it's going to use ease out.

83
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.870
It's going to run infinitely and,
just like with transitions,

84
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.010
that second timing value,
that two seconds, that's a delay.

85
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.320
So it takes two seconds before it runs.

86
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.052
Now as you can see,

87
00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:12.940
we could write all of this out with
the longhand via animation-property.

88
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.281
I mean animation-name black-to-white,
black-to-red.

89
00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:21.390
We could do that but at this point that
would get pretty gnarly pretty fast.

90
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.210
So I'm not even gonna cover
writing it out with the longhand.

91
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.190
I mean with the longhand,

92
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.630
we're going to jump right into
using shorthand on this one.
