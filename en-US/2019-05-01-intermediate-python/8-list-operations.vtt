00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.090
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: A few really
useful operations in Python,

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.310
going back to my simple list of squares,
so that would be for

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.350
num in range of six, and

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
num times num So if we look at
our squares, they're right here.

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.380
Python has a sum operation that will
let me quickly sum up the values of any

6
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.900
numbers, as a sequence.

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.740
All I have to do is call the sum built in,
and pass that list to it.

8
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.837
So, some squares
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: There

9
00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:52.156
is also a built-in min which gives you
the minimum value and built-in max.

10
00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:54.480
So biggest number, smallest number.

11
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.670
We can also use some of the other built-in
operations, we look at sorted and

12
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.380
introduction to Python, so

13
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.750
that we'll give us the sorted numbers that
are already sorted in ascending order.

14
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.500
What if I wanted to get a copy of
the sorted in Descending order.

15
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.200
&gt;&gt; Student1: Passing an argument.

16
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.820
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Passing an argument.

17
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.380
Does anyone remember what it is?

18
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.245
&gt;&gt; Student1: Sending.

19
00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.741
&gt;&gt; Student2: Reverse equal.

20
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:27.284
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Close.

21
00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:29.373
But yes, reverse=True.

22
00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:33.730
That'll give me back a list
that's sorted in reverse.

23
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.220
And just very quickly,
one more list comprehension.

24
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.858
Let's say I had a.

25
00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:52.480
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Say I had a string
here, Lottery_numbers_string,

26
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.257
and it contained my
Lottery numbers.Knowing

27
00:01:58.257 --> 00:02:04.355
everything we know
now.How would we get.The.

28
00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:08.310
Maximum value.In this list

29
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.310
of strings that are numbers.How
would we get the maximum value.

30
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.940
What's the first thing that we would need?

31
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.546
What does max take?

32
00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:18.330
&gt;&gt; Student3: OS.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: OS.

33
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.086
And what do the items
in the list have to be?

34
00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:21.699
&gt;&gt; Student3: String.

35
00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:22.388
&gt;&gt; Student1: Numbers.

36
00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:22.924
&gt;&gt; Student3: Verse.

37
00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:24.384
&gt;&gt; Student1: Imaging
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: They have to be

38
00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:25.080
numbers.

39
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.241
So, how do we get a list of
numbers from this string?

40
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.420
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: How do we get
a list of strings from this string?

41
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.860
&gt;&gt; Student1: Call split?

42
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.940
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Split, and
I'm just gonna make this a little shorter.

43
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.339
I'm gonna reassign my variable, just so
it's a little bit easier to read.

44
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.640
We're now reassigning to lottery_nums.

45
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.710
So I'm going to say lottery_nums.split(),
what is my delimiter to split?

46
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.520
&gt;&gt; Student1: Comma.

47
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.240
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Comma, and
here I'm gonna have to add a space, right?

48
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.550
Okay, now I have a list of strings.

49
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.783
We know that max takes a list of integers
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: How

50
00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:18.416
do I get my list of strings
to be a list of integers?

51
00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:21.991
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,

52
00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:24.830
[INAUDIBLE] comprehension, right?

53
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.060
So we're gonna loop over for
num in lottery_nums,

54
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.920
but we're gonna call split right in here.

55
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.500
And we're gonna split on
the comma space delimiter.

56
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.740
What do we wanna take?

57
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.410
What action do we wanna take
on each string in this list?

58
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.843
&gt;&gt; Student2: Pass it to int.

59
00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:48.901
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Pass it to int,
exactly right.

60
00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:54.711
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, now we have
a list of numbers and as we saw earlier,

61
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.880
I mean this is getting
a little bit complicated.

62
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.570
You'll probably want to introduce
this as a variable, right.

63
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.840
But as you're typing along in
the you can build on this.

64
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.430
So what does max take?

65
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.640
A list of numbers, and
now we have a list of numbers, right?

66
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.294
So I can just put max,
and open parenthesis, and

67
00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:20.393
put a closing parenthesis around
all of that, I'll pass it to max.

68
00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:22.570
And that gives me the biggest
number in my list.
