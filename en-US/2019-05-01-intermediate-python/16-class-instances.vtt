00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.575
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: But
the kinda funny thing about Python,

2
00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:04.182
in languages like Java.

3
00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:10.065
You're kinda required to make getters and
setters to modify stuff within your class.

4
00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:14.940
But Python is a little
bit more willy-nilly,

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.065
so I can just go and
change the value of dot runs for

6
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.940
my Subaru for my instance.

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.046
I don't necessarily need to
use a getter or a setter.

8
00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:34.984
Using them is a best practice in software
projects to take out some of the mystery,

9
00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.500
but you're not gonna get a syntax error.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.920
Python's not gonna stop you from
doing this type of modification.

11
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.228
So now if I call my_subaru.start and
it takes the name,

12
00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:50.847
so I'm gonna have to pass one in it again.

13
00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:53.034
What will I see printed out?

14
00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:55.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Broken set.

15
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.590
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: All is broken,

16
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.845
time to do more front end masters
classes to pay for the repair.

17
00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.801
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so

18
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:11.916
that self variable that refers to
an instance, and if I make a new car.

19
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.402
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's
call it a mustang car.

20
00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:21.830
&gt;&gt; [BLANK AUDIO]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If I

21
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.710
check runs on mustang car,
what will I get?

22
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.350
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's true, right?

23
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.572
So the changes that I made to my Subaru
only applied to my_subaru instance.
