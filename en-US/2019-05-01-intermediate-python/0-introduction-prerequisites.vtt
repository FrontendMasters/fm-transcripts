00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: A little about me,
your instructor,

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.295
my name is Nina Zakharenko.

3
00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:07.260
You might also know me as NNJA on twitter.

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.778
I've written software for

5
00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:13.473
some pretty cool companies over the course
of my decade long career in engineering.

6
00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:15.468
I've worked at Meetup.

7
00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:19.202
I've worked at HBO writing software for
satellite computers.

8
00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:20.997
I've worked at Reddit.

9
00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:27.456
These days, I work at Microsoft as a cloud
developer advocate focusing on Python.

10
00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:31.879
I've been a professional Python
developer for the past five or

11
00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.142
six years now, and
it's absolutely my favorite language.

12
00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:39.013
If you'd like to stay in touch
with me after the course,

13
00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:41.528
there are some links here
on the course website.

14
00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:48.020
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: This is
an intermediate Python course.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.240
You might also see it referred to as
Day 2 throughout the course website.

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.410
During this course,

17
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.030
we're gonna start getting more comfortable
with some of the more advanced aspects of

18
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.680
Python, like classes, list
comprehensions in the standard library.

19
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.980
At at the end of the day, you're gonna
know enough to build a small interactive

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.510
website using the Flask web framework.

21
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.090
Know that to fully participate in
today's class, you must have VSCode

22
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.120
set up locally, along with
a Python version greater than 3.7.

23
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.932
You must be familiar with all of
the concepts from introduction to Python,

24
00:01:27.932 --> 00:01:31.172
which you might see referred to as Day 1.

25
00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:34.796
Clicking through to
the Intro to Python section,

26
00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:39.208
you should be familiar with
Python conventions like PEP 8.

27
00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:44.265
Basic data types and variables,
numbers, strings, the common errors and

28
00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:47.912
common mistakes you might
make as a Python developer.

29
00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:53.318
Functions, defining them,
arguments, function scope.

30
00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:58.808
The more advanced types of Python,
the list, the tuple, the set and

31
00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:03.448
the dictionary,
you must be familiar with mutability and

32
00:02:03.448 --> 00:02:07.425
know that a tuple is
an immutable data structure,

33
00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:11.044
while list, set and dictionary is mutable.

34
00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:17.045
You should know about boolean logic,
the truthfulness of a value in Python,

35
00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:22.512
as well as how to make comparisons,
such as greater than, less than.

36
00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:26.926
And and, or, and not,
those boolean operators.

37
00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:30.396
You should know how to loop
along with control statements.

38
00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:36.234
You should know the if statement,
else, for loops,

39
00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:41.314
while loops and break,
continue and return.

40
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:44.493
Lastly, you should know how
to work with Python programs.

41
00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:49.267
How to run them,
what the main method is, exceptions and

42
00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:53.753
tracebacks, and
how to work with simple libraries.

43
00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:59.560
Lastly, you should know a little bit about
what an API is and how to work with them.

44
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.500
Requests and responses,
HTTP status codes, and

45
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.940
how to use the request library in Python.

46
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.210
If you're not sure if
you know these topics,

47
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.500
I would suggest that you go ahead and
watch the Intro to Python course first.

48
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.730
You're gonna get a lot more value
out of intermediate Python if

49
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.880
you have a solid understanding
of these foundational concepts.

50
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.013
If you're choosing to join us for

51
00:03:25.013 --> 00:03:29.356
Intermediate Python without doing
the Intro Python course first,

52
00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:32.857
go ahead and scroll up to
the top of the course website,

53
00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:37.762
click on the Course Introduction and
then go to the Requirements settings.

54
00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:41.035
You'll have to go through all
of these steps to be able to

55
00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:44.460
follow along with the exercises
in Intermediate Python.
