00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.530
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: By coding along with
me in this intermediate Python workshop,

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.500
you're gonna learn how to use
object oriented programming to

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.980
organize your code.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.500
You're gonna learn how
to diagnose problems

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.870
in your Python programs by understanding
exceptions, and even writing your own.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.140
We're gonna work with new features in
Python3 that make Python easier than ever,

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.950
such as f strings.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.172
You are gonna learn a little bit about
generators, a Python feature that allows

9
00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:29.333
you to loop over a large data
sets in a memory efficient way.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.622
You are also going to learn about list
comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions,

11
00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:36.840
and other advanced ways
of looping in Python.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.560
Lastly, for the final exercise, you're
gonna learn how to use an interactive API.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.050
And build a web application efficiently
using the Flask web framework

14
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.030
to make a really cool site that lets
us filter GitHub repositories for

15
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.796
a particular language by
their number of stars.

16
00:00:55.796 --> 00:01:03.510
Taking a peek at that final exercise, here
we go, we can filter by languages, Submit.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.598
And our little web app is gonna
hit the GitHub search API and

18
00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:09.364
come back with results.
