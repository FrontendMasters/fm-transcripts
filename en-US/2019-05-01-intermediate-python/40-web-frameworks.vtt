00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: In the next and
final chapter, chapter eight,

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.480
we're gonna talk about Web Frameworks.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.600
So web frameworks are a way for
us to test and

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.140
practice all of our
newfound Python knowledge.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.201
And build a very,
very basic web application with

6
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:22.271
unit tests using Python and
the Flask framework.

7
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.483
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's go
through the basics of Flask.

8
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.039
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: There are a few
different types of web frameworks in

9
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.190
Python.

10
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.104
Django is a very popular one.

11
00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:43.470
It's a fully featured, high level
framework for building web apps.

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.510
Django focuses on automating
as much as possible,

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.990
many large scale sites run on Django.

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.580
Instagram is one of them.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.520
Django started out as a CMS project, a
content management system for a newspaper.

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.940
And Django is a pretty heavy framework,
it has a lot of

17
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.690
opinions on how things should work and
how things should be structured.

18
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.220
If you want something lighter weight,
Flask is a good choice.

19
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.190
Flask is a micro framework for Python,
and it allows users to make pretty

20
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.830
basic backend APIs and
web apps with a minimum amount of code.

21
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.140
Flask is a little bit easier for
beginners.

22
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.450
It's not quite as opinionated, there
are less setup steps, less requirements.

23
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.070
So that's what I'm gonna be
focusing on for today's exercises.

24
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.520
But don't think that flask
is a simple web framework.

25
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.610
The great thing about Flask is as your
web application grows, you can add on all

26
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.340
sorts of different modules to
help you add on functionality for

27
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.820
databases or other types of things that
your web application might want to do.

28
00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:03.802
Yet, another web framework that you
might hear of or see as pyramid.

29
00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:08.021
It's a fast and
it's an advanced framework to

30
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:11.921
successor to the older pylons framework.

31
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:18.990
So, still popular and used but
not quite as popular for new projects.

32
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.996
Permit is opensource and
also actively developed.
