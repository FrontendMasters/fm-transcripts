&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Thanks for
coding along with me in this workshop.

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.350
I highly recommend that
you use Source Control

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.730
while working on your Python projects.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.370
GitHub is a popular and free option.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.380
If you want to learn more about Git,

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.470
you can check out my
Git In Depth Frontend Masters workshop.

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.850
For next steps,

8
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.220
now that you know the basics just enough
to get started working with APIs and

9
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.140
Python and the request library, I think
you know just enough to see exactly how

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.850
powerful Python can be when you chain
up all of these concepts together.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.440
Your next study topics are how to
authenticate with APIs, how do you use

12
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.757
the other http methods, like post, to
create resources, or put to update them.

13
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:47.310
And read up on the request
quick start guide.

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.300
Some additional resources,
if you wanna learn all about Python Flask,

15
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.630
I would recommend you read
The Flask Negatutorial.

16
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.310
They don't really tell you all about the
A to Zs of doing Python web development

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.650
in Flask.

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.710
Lastly, The Hitchhiker's Guide
to Python is a free book.

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.390
I hope that today I've shown
you that Python is fun.

20
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.530
It's easy to learn and
incredibly powerful.

21
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.149
And I hope you continue
on your Python journey.

22
00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.144
