00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.810
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We're going to
talk about libraries and modules.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.571
So I've been using a few modules here and
there.

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.537
You've seen me import a few things,
datetime, random.

4
00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:15.788
There was a library that helped me
do a live reloading of my modules.

5
00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:17.759
And that's just the thing about Python,

6
00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.302
the language was designed
to be batteries included.

7
00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:27.825
It has a rich and versatile standard
library, which is immediately available.

8
00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:30.226
I didn't have to download or
install anything external,

9
00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:31.750
it just comes with the interpreter.

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.330
And many people believe that this has

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.890
given the Python language
a head start in a lot of cases.

12
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.000
It's really helped vault Python to be
the popular tool that it is today.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.220
So let's take a look at some of those
helpful packages in the standard library.

14
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.169
One of the downsides of
the standard library is

15
00:00:59.169 --> 00:01:03.828
that,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's really

16
00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.210
optimized for
having a rich feature set, and

17
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.220
it's also optimized for
backwards compatibility.

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.515
So as the Python language grows,
for the most part they try

19
00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:21.935
to maintain as much backwards
compatibility as possible.

20
00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:25.882
That means that a lot of libraries
included are a little bit hard to use, but

21
00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:28.966
it's really easy to install
external libraries as well.

22
00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:37.481
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Some of the commonly
used features of the standard library.

23
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:43.008
sys, S-Y-S, that provides system-specific
parameters and functions.

24
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.970
OS has a lot of methods available for

25
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.935
working with the operating
system interface.

26
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:58.084
And there's a great os.path submodule that
helps us handle files on the file path.

27
00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:01.769
math gives us a lot of
advanced math functions.

28
00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:10.035
And json is an easy-to-use json parser and
encoder.

29
00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:15.532
Python even gives you a lot of other
built-in libraries like database access,

30
00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:20.376
logging, Internet protocols,
multimedia, there's a debugger,

31
00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:24.167
and there are libraries for
extending Python itself.

32
00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:28.566
Later, after this class, you can look
at this link for the full list of

33
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:33.206
standard libraries and you'll see
this guide from docs.python.org.

34
00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:36.702
So the language library.

35
00:02:36.702 --> 00:02:41.344
It'll show you all of the,
let me me bump up the font size there.

36
00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:47.018
It'll show you everything that's
available on the standard library,

37
00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.699
so a very quick tour.

38
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.950
And as you can see,
there's a lot of stuff here.

39
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:59.902
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So, I mean, you can
see there's a quite a bit more to scroll

40
00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:05.350
through, but,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If you're not sure

41
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.500
if something is included with the Python
language, this is a good place to look.
