00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.089
Now we talked about some practical
applications of Python as well.

2
00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.269
We talked about list comprehensions.

3
00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.757
Let's say that we wanted to create a list
of only odd numbers between zero and

4
00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:16.427
100 using a list comprehension.

5
00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:24.743
We can do that by using range to get
the numbers from 0 to 99 in this case and

6
00:00:24.743 --> 00:00:29.891
add them to our list
comprehension only if that

7
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:34.910
number that is generated
is divisible by 2.

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.527
You can also, use a set comprehension or
a dictionary comprehension.

9
00:00:42.527 --> 00:00:45.620
Those are outside of
the scope of the course but

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.516
they are included on the course
website for you to look at.

11
00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:53.590
Slicing is another important
concept in Python.

12
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.913
Let's say I had a list that looked like
this with individual characters in it.

13
00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:02.034
I can take a look at the length.

14
00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:05.353
I could also ask for slices of my list.

15
00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:12.956
So for example,
the slice from four to six.

16
00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:21.302
If I wanted to exclude that value, I would
get the same results because by default,

17
00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:26.054
if you don't provide the value,
it goes all the way to the end.

18
00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.988
If you don't provide a start value,
it goes all the way to the beginning.

19
00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:34.572
Passing in no arguments at all
is a quick shortcut to get

20
00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.773
a copy of a list in Python.

21
00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:44.268
You can also use the zip function to take
two lists and combine them together.

22
00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:50.236
This is especially useful when
you are converting between types.

23
00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:53.277
So I recommend that you
go through the converting

24
00:01:53.277 --> 00:01:56.700
between types exercise on
your own when you have time.
