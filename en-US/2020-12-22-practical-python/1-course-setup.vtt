1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.290
To check for Python 3.9,
you'll want to pull up a terminal.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.254
So, if

3
00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:16.030
I run Python 3 -- version,
I should see Python 3.9.

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.090
You should see that as well.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.820
It's especially important to install
the latest version of Python because

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.840
your machine especially if you're running
a Mac might already come with a version

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.880
of Python.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.610
Depending on your OS,
it might be an older one.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.020
So we want to make sure that we're
working with the latest and greatest.

10
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:44.270
Now we want to make a project directory
and create a virtual environment in it.

11
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.990
So for this example,

12
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.210
Let me start off from the same point
that you're all starting off at.

13
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.640
Make a directory.

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.394
Make sure that you're
in your home directory.

15
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:04.453
So in this case for Mac or
Linux, just cd.home, and

16
00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:07.793
then make a directory called pyworkshop.

17
00:01:10.273 --> 00:01:14.556
And cd into it,
should be an empty directory.

18
00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:19.340
Now we want to create a virtual
environment, and activate it.

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.067
In order to do that,
we're gonna use Python 3 -m the dash

20
00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:30.908
m means run this next command
as a module which is gonna be

21
00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:35.249
the vn pythons 3 built
in virtual environments.

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.760
And the next command is gonna be a name.

23
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.200
In this case,
I'm just gonna call it the standard env.

24
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.030
It's a pretty good idea to name your
virtual environments env because if

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.275
you're using a standard git ignore for
Python,

26
00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:54.880
this is one of the folders that's
gonna be automatically excluded.

27
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.820
And you're not going to want
these auto generated files to

28
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.380
end up in your git repository.

29
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.304
Now if I take a look here,
I should see a env directory.

30
00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:12.750
I'm not gonna talk about what's
in this directory for the moment.

31
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.664
We're gonna talk about that a little
bit later on in the class but

32
00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:25.100
basically it contains a standalone Python
version, a standalone Python interpreter.

33
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.492
And when we work in that interpreter,
we are guaranteed that we are using

34
00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:33.220
the version of Python that
we used when we created it.

35
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.029
And any packages that we install when that
virtual environment is activated are going

36
00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:43.140
to stay in that virtual environment and
not pollute your system settings.

37
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.375
So working in a virtual environment for
a project no matter how small it is,

38
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.270
is generally a pretty good idea.

39
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.015
In order to activate it on Mac,
I'm gonna source env/bin/activate and

40
00:02:57.015 --> 00:03:00.722
your terminal might not
be as fancy as mine,

41
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:05.350
you'll probably see something
that looks like this.

42
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.130
It'll say env in parentheses
followed by the rest of your prompt.

43
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.070
And that means that the virtual
environment is now activated.

44
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.320
Now I can type Python in here.

45
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.290
I don't need the three anymore.

46
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.346
And the Python executable points to
that version of Python that we used

47
00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:26.830
when we created the virtual environment.

48
00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:33.405
You also wanna make sure
that you have VS code.

49
00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:37.792
If you are running on Mac and
you recently installed VS code,

50
00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:40.725
you might not have the code executable.

51
00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:45.800
You can check if you have it
by typing code --version.

52
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.699
If you are on a Mac and
you don't see anything here,

53
00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.930
you might have to follow an extra step.

54
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.958
Sorry, that is right here which is called
launching from the command line, install

55
00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:08.200
code command on path, I'll show you how
to bring up this dialog box in a second.

56
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.620
But if you're not seeing that
the instructions are right there.

57
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.380
Now, we wanna do a little bit
of configuration for VS code.

58
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.110
We wanna make sure that we have
the Python extension installed.

59
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.393
You're not gonna see anything from
the Python extension until you

60
00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:27.100
open your very first Python file.

61
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.639
I have a link here to some list of keymap
extensions if you want to remap your key

62
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.498
bindings in VS code to Emacs or
Vim or Sublime or something else.

63
00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:41.235
But while we're working through the class,
there's only

64
00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:46.350
two keyboard shortcuts that you're
going to need to remember in VS code.

65
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.424
For Windows that is Ctrl + Shift + P and

66
00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:56.410
Command + Shift + P on Mac for
show command palette.

67
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.620
This is like your Swiss Army knife.

68
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.321
It's going to bring up a window
where you can type and

69
00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:08.260
see all of the lists of different
commands that VS code offers.

70
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.823
So if I bring that up in here,
if I type Python,

71
00:05:12.823 --> 00:05:17.856
we'll see that all of these
commands are available

72
00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:21.601
because I've opened a Python file and

73
00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:26.060
I have the Python extension activated.

74
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.324
The other command that you need
to know is Ctrl + P on Windows or

75
00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:35.490
Command + P on Mac, that's going
to bring up the Fast File Finder.

76
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.987
So you can type in any file name
that's contained in your project and

77
00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:43.790
it will quickly bring it up.

78
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.422
If you know these two keyboard shortcuts,
just write them down on a post it note

79
00:05:47.422 --> 00:05:50.880
somewhere near your desk,
you're gonna be using them a lot.

80
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.600
And that's really kind of all that
you need to know to get productive in

81
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.883
Python in VS code.

82
00:05:56.883 --> 00:06:01.912
Now, when you work with files when
you bring up a new Python file if you

83
00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:07.030
have not done that before,
if you don't have a VS code installation,

84
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.650
you might see some various pop ups.

85
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.390
So let's go ahead and create a new file.

86
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.666
It's just new file or
command + N, Ctrl + N and

87
00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:25.649
we're going to save this
file as my VS code is

88
00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:30.650
now angry that I have
renamed my directory.

89
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.500
We're gonna call this hi.py.

90
00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:41.849
And if you're opening up this file for
the first time,

91
00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:46.361
you might see some pop ups here asking
you whether you want to install a linter.

92
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:49.550
In which case, you do, click Yes on that.

93
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.204
And if there are any other pop ups for
things that are missing or

94
00:06:54.204 --> 00:06:57.580
not installed, go ahead and
click Yes and install them.

95
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.690
There's also an optional extension that
you might want to install called pylons.

96
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.150
And it is an additional feature
rich language server for VS code.

97
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.590
You don't need to have it but
I find it pretty useful.

98
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.990
So you wanna go ahead and install that.

99
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.700
Make sure that when you have
this Python file opened,

100
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.277
that the correct interpreter
is opened as well,

101
00:07:33.277 --> 00:07:37.100
in this case mine is the last one.

102
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.855
So it looks like VS code didn't
automatically pick it up maybe because of

103
00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:42.680
my directory weirdness.

104
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.420
So make sure that you go ahead and
select the right interpreter.

105
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.580
Here you'll see that
mine is in .n/bin/python.

106
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.890
And now I'll see here at the bottom that
I have the correct version of Python.

107
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.320
I'm just gonna bump that up a little bit.

108
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.120
Now, what do we need to do to
run Python code in VS code?

109
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.630
We've already gone ahead and
created a new file.

110
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:19.110
Let's copy this into our new file and
run it.

111
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.480
There are a few different options for
running your Python files.

112
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.040
I'll show you how to run them both from
within VS code and from the terminal.

113
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.510
So I pasted that right in there.

114
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.368
If you're already in VS code, you can open
up the command palette with Command +

115
00:08:42.368 --> 00:08:46.953
Shift + P or Ctrl + Shift + P and
select Python run Python file in terminal.

116
00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:51.586
And this has the advantage of VS
code being smart and if your virtual

117
00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:57.214
environment isn't activated, it will
automatically select it and you will see

118
00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:02.700
that it output right in the included
terminal window right here at the bottom.

119
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:12.954
You can also,
Navigate to this file in your terminal and

120
00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:19.086
make sure that your virtual environment
is activated and run Python, hi.py.

121
00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:23.608
So this is outside of VS code
if you're more comfortable in

122
00:09:23.608 --> 00:09:27.040
a separate terminal or
on the command line.
