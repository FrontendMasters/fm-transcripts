00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.610
Hi, everyone, welcome to Practical Python.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.890
My name is Nina Zakharenko,
and I'm your instructor today.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.686
This is an immersive
hands-on Python course, and

4
00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:15.470
it requires a little bit
of prerequisite knowledge.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.890
So in order to really succeed today, you
should be comfortable on the command line.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.000
You don't have to be a pro.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.900
And you should know a little bit about
programming in some other language.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.100
So understand basic constructs
like loops and variables.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.320
And those are gonna be the things
that set you on the path to success.

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.223
If you're a little bit more of a beginner,

11
00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:44.628
you might enjoy the the two day course
that I did for Frontend Masters last year,

12
00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:48.600
called Introduction to Python and
Python Fundamentals.

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.923
Now, you might see this course
website that I have up here,

14
00:00:56.923 --> 00:01:02.640
you can find this at
practical.learnpython.dev.

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.744
Let me bring that URL up for a minute.

16
00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:08.720
Practical.learnpython.dev.

17
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.835
Now, I recommend that you, Don't

18
00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:20.875
just follow along on this website,
don't read,

19
00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:26.395
because we're gonna be
moving pretty quickly today,

20
00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:33.360
and you're gonna get most comfortable
if you type along with me.

21
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.001
So by typing along with me, as I type,
you're gonna gain that muscle memory

22
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.059
that's really going help
that knowledge stick.

23
00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:45.762
A little bit about me.

24
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.832
My name is Nina Zakharenko,
and let's see here,

25
00:01:52.832 --> 00:01:59.840
I've been coding altogether for
probably about a decade now.

26
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.048
I started out in Java.

27
00:02:01.048 --> 00:02:04.210
[LAUGH] That is my secret.

28
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.042
But I moved towards Python probably
about six years ago now because I

29
00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.174
really liked the community.

30
00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:16.930
And I thought that the libraries and
the ecosystem were really amazing.

31
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.890
I started speaking at Python conferences
and just completely fell in love with it.

32
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.090
Recently, I've been elected
to the Board of Directors for

33
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.320
the Python Software Foundation,
which is really great.

34
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.240
I get to do a lot of good work.

35
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.110
And I've also written code for
companies like Reddit and Meetup and HBO.

36
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.360
These days, I'm a Principal Cloud Advocate
at Microsoft, focusing on Python.

37
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.330
If you wanna stay in touch with me,
I'm on Twitter or LinkedIn or GitHub.

38
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.570
All of the links are here.

39
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.586
And then I also included links to
some of the more popular conference

40
00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:55.780
talks that I've done over the years.

41
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.374
You can also find my other
courses on Frontend Masters.

42
00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:01.987
One of my personal favorites
is get in depth, and

43
00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:06.323
as well as Python Fundamentals and
Intermediate Python.

44
00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:11.563
A little bit about navigating the course.

45
00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:16.957
If you see any typos, which I have
not made because I am 100% perfect,

46
00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:21.394
but if you spot anything that
you think shouldn't be there,

47
00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:25.498
there's an Edit this page link
at the top of every page.

48
00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:32.320
And that will take you directly to GitHub,
where you can open a poll request.

49
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.296
There are navigation arrows here on the
left and the right side, and you can also

50
00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:41.910
navigate via keyboard shortcuts,
which is one of my favorite features.

51
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.850
There are breadcrumbs on the top
left here for each section.

52
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.650
And that will pull up a table
of contents right here.

53
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.077
Some sections look like this with double
arrows that have additional content.

54
00:03:57.077 --> 00:04:01.740
So you can just go ahead and click on
that and that content will expand.

55
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.129
If you want to copy any of the code or
any of the commands,

56
00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.930
you can hit this button right here and
it will copy to the clipboard.

57
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.484
If we're working in the Python REPL, for
example, where there are extra control

58
00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:18.312
characters that are in that will be
displayed on the course website,

59
00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:20.430
know that they won't be copied over.

60
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.160
You can search in this text box up here.

61
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.224
And as you go through the course,

62
00:04:27.224 --> 00:04:30.840
you'll see a little checkbox
next to each chapter.

63
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.570
You can go ahead and clear the history
if you find that distracting.

64
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.031
And again, I really suggest following
along with me in the class and

65
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.380
typing as much as possible.

66
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.217
This is a resource for you to have, cuz
I know that when I'm done with a class,

67
00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:49.784
especially one that's all day,
I feel like did I learn anything?

68
00:04:49.784 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm just gonna forget everything.

69
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.060
So it's here for you for afterwards.

70
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.821
It's here for the exercises or
if you need to go back and

71
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:58.452
figure out how to do something.

72
00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:01.610
But I do not recommend reading it.

73
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.810
I wanna quickly go through
the course agenda.

74
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.979
So I'm gonna explain to you, why Python?

75
00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.842
Why you might wanna reach for Python?

76
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.204
Why you might wanna choose Python for
your project?

77
00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:15.498
And talk a little bit about
some of the philosophies and

78
00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:17.990
Python's design principles.

79
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.500
Then we're gonna move on to data types.

80
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.510
Python is a dynamic language.

81
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.070
What does that mean?

82
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.980
We're gonna learn how to work with
numbers, strings, lists, and more.

83
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.557
Then we're gonna move on to some of
the more advanced data types that

84
00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:33.530
Python offers.

85
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.030
And those are sets,
tuples, and dictionaries.

86
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.050
These are container objects that let
us organize other types of objects

87
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.200
in different ways into other
kinds of data structures.

88
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.410
Then we're gonna move on to functions,
loops, and logic.

89
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.190
Functions help us organize our code in a
way that's more readable and reusable, and

90
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.400
they accept arguments and
defaults as needed.

91
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.295
And loops are gonna take us let us take
action on collections of different items.

92
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:07.090
Boolean logic, it's gonna allow us
to control the flow of our program.

93
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.667
We're gonna cover some practical
applications of what we've learned so far,

94
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:14.137
including using advanced looping types.

95
00:06:14.137 --> 00:06:18.642
Like list comprehensions, converting
between different types in Python,

96
00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:22.610
which I believe is really one
of its absolute strengths.

97
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.200
And we're also gonna cover
how to work with files.

98
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.254
Next is going to be
object-oriented Python,

99
00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:33.510
which allows us to represent our code
in a little bit of a different way.

100
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.339
We can define reusable classes and
define relationships between different

101
00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.290
objects and build modular and
reusable code.

102
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.060
We're also gonna cover libraries and
modules.

103
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.188
So now that you have all the foundational
understanding of how Python works,

104
00:06:49.188 --> 00:06:53.635
you're gonna learn how to structure your
code and work with different libraries,

105
00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:57.560
both the standard library and
external third party packages.

106
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.110
And then, in the last chapter we're
gonna cover web frameworks, and

107
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.540
we're gonna talk about
Django in particular.

108
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.751
So we're gonna practice all of our new
Python knowledge by building a basic blog,

109
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:12.616
a basic web application with
some unit tests and a database.

110
00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:19.890
This is gonna give you a great tour of
everything that's available in Python.

111
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.020
You might not be an expert in any one of
these areas by the end of the day, but

112
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.226
you have the tools available to learn and
discover more.

113
00:07:30.197 --> 00:07:35.099
Now, there are a few prerequisites
before going through the course.

114
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.480
You need to have a Linux,
Mac or Windows 10 machine.

115
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.176
If you're using Windows 10,
you need to make sure that you have

116
00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:49.084
administrative rights so
that you can run your programs correctly.

117
00:07:49.084 --> 00:07:52.289
We're gonna be working with
the latest version of Python,

118
00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:54.090
which as of today is Python 39.

119
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.366
We're gonna be using Visual Studio Code,
and

120
00:07:57.366 --> 00:08:00.654
the Python extension for
Visual Studio Code.

121
00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:06.855
Now, a lot of you are already programming,
you already have your environment set up.

122
00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:08.395
Why VS Code?

123
00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:12.203
Well, I recommend that we're all
on the same environment today,

124
00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:16.827
because if you run into any issues, this
is really gonna help us troubleshoot and

125
00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:18.950
figure out what's wrong.

126
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.790
Once you're done with the class, feel
free to go back to your editor of choice.

127
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.340
I have a section here for how to set
up VS Code with different key bindings.

128
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.594
For example, I use VS Code with Emacs key
bindings, and you can set up them, or

129
00:08:32.594 --> 00:08:36.230
Sublime, or
whatever you're most comfortable with.

130
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.330
Really appreciate if we were all
in the same environment, and

131
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.066
that way you can follow the steps.

132
00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:43.585
And you know there there's
nothing about your machine or

133
00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:45.694
your editor that's gonna
cause any problems.

134
00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:53.201
I'm gonna review the setup instructions
for Mac OS, because that's what I'm using,

135
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:56.550
but instructions for
Windows are available as well.

136
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.224
And then I'm gonna quickly show
you how to configure VS Code for

137
00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:02.246
maximum productivity in Python.

138
00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:07.113
All right, so here are all the things that
you should have downloaded and set up.

139
00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:12.390
Python 3, Visual Studio Code, and the
Python extension for Visual Studio Code.

140
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.135
If you don't have these set up right now,
please go ahead and

141
00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:21.220
start installing these prerequisites on
your machine while I continue talking.
