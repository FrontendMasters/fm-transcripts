00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:05.348
So, let's try a short exercise
where we work with files and

2
00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:12.486
then we will practice loops and our list
comprehensions and working with files.

3
00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:18.280
If you have the course website open,

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.148
you can download this file called
cities.JSON and let's take a look at it.

5
00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:28.081
Just has the top five cities and
their populations.

6
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.179
So we're going to import the JSON module,
which is built into the standard

7
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.888
library in Python, and we're gonna
use that to help us parse the data.

8
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.759
I'm just going to exit my repo here and
get this file.

9
00:00:56.384 --> 00:01:03.624
So now if I list here, I should see the
file in my directory called cities.JSON.

10
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.435
And I'm going to open my REPL again.

11
00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:15.234
So if I want to work with JSON and

12
00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:19.659
the JSON library in Python,
I need to import it.

13
00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.236
It's not a built in.

14
00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:26.324
And then I wanna use a context
manager to open this file, so

15
00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:31.594
I'm gonna use that with keyword and
say, with open("cities.JSON")

16
00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:38.692
And I'm gonna use another
keyword called as,

17
00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:45.337
to give this open file a name, so
that I can reference it later on.

18
00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:48.093
So I'm gonna say as cities_file.

19
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.296
And then I can go ahead,
while I'm in this context manager,

20
00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:57.482
notice that I have tabbed into it.

21
00:01:57.482 --> 00:02:02.460
So all of the code that is indented under
this statement belongs to the context

22
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.156
manager.

23
00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.066
Anything that is after
it that is not indented,

24
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.652
is not going to get run in
the scope of the context manager.

25
00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:14.382
So I wanna do my stuff with
the file in the context manager and

26
00:02:14.382 --> 00:02:17.325
then exit that block when I'm done.

27
00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:25.129
So I can say that the city's
data is JSON.load.

28
00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.093
The city is found.

29
00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:32.200
And then I can print this out.

30
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.105
And I'm gonna hit enter one more time
cuz now I'm done with this file.

31
00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:46.135
If I take a look at the type of city's
data, we'll see that it's a list.

32
00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:50.799
If I take a look at the zeroth element,
we'll see that it's a dictionary.

33
00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.800
So what this has returned is
a list of dictionaries that

34
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.704
matches to the JSON file,
and then I can work with it.

35
00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:05.744
I could use that pretty
print function from earlier,

36
00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:11.905
so from pprint import ppprint
to then pprint(cities_data).

37
00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:14.080
pprint in a more human readable format.
