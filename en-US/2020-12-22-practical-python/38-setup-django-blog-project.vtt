1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.370
So, Django, since this course is targeted
towards more of an advanced beginner,

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.670
we're going to jump right into Django.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.780
If you'd rather learn about Flask,

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.457
you can watch the last chapter of
the intermediate Python course

5
00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:18.170
on front end masters, or you can review
the final exercise on the course website.

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.793
So we're going to go ahead and

7
00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:27.390
grab the project code instead of
starting a Django project from scratch.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.232
If you do want to start a new Django
project from scratch, I recommend that you

9
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:37.170
follow the steps on the official Django
tutorial for building your first app.

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.022
That has everything that you need to
start up a Django project, but for

11
00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:48.320
the time being, we're going to work from
a project that I have already created.

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.451
So go ahead and
CD into your home directory and

13
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:56.130
get clone this project right here.

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.490
And then let's CD into the practical blog,
Directory.

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.989
One more thing, if you're not doing
this in a new tab, make sure that you

16
00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:14.790
type deactivate and clear out
the current active virtual environment.

17
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.621
We're going to create a new
virtual environment for

18
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:21.224
this project because it doesn't
share any of the libraries that we

19
00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:25.231
have been using in class before, and
we wanna keep everything separate.

20
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:35.330
Oops, that was already in the right place.

21
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.080
So now you should have a directory
that looks something like this.

22
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.870
And we're gonna go ahead and
create a new virtual environment.

23
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.495
And then we're going to use that pip
install -r command to install what is in

24
00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.170
requirements.txt in it.

25
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.852
So to make a new virtual environment,

26
00:01:56.852 --> 00:02:01.319
remember, you do python3 -m venv.

27
00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:08.077
And then we're going to source it,
so source env/bin/activate.

28
00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:11.880
And we'll see that now I have my
new virtual environment activated.

29
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.138
If I take a look at what is in
requirements.txt, see that it is a file

30
00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:22.517
with just one line and
it said the requirement is Django 3.1.2.

31
00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:26.331
So I can type python-m pip install-r,

32
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:31.605
which means install
the requirements from this file and

33
00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:34.423
pass in requirements-txt.

34
00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:36.389
And that's gonna go ahead and
install Django.

35
00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:46.644
While we're at it, we can also run
python-m pip install--upgrade pip to

36
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:53.230
be on the latest version of pip so that we
don't see this annoying warning anymore.

37
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.384
There are two things that we're going to
need to do to get set up to run this web

38
00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:01.650
application.

39
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.638
We're going to need to prime our
database by running a migrate command,

40
00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:11.542
and we're going to need to run the server
to make sure that our server has

41
00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.860
come up successfully.

42
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.544
So to prime the database,
you're gonna do python manage.py,

43
00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:20.983
along with the migrate command.

44
00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:25.526
manage.py is the file that's
automatically generated by Django and

45
00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:30.377
has shortcuts to a lot of the commands
that you might want to run when working

46
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.235
with a Django application.

47
00:03:33.357 --> 00:03:38.422
You should see something like this,
operations to perform, apply migrations.

48
00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:41.357
Most of these, four of these, admin, off,

49
00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:44.849
content type, and
sessions come baked into Django.

50
00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.761
And then blog is the app
that I've created.

51
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:53.170
So this goes ahead and
creates all of the database tables

52
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.053
that Django needs to operate
in a file called db.sqlite3.

53
00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:04.950
That's because we're currently
working with a local SQLite database.

54
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.738
When you're working in production,
you can move on to MySQL, or Postgres, or

55
00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:11.889
whatever database you want to use.

56
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.187
Finally, we can run python
manage.py run server and

57
00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:20.940
see if our server comes up successfully.

58
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.180
If it does, you should see
it running at localhost8000.

59
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.723
And when I visit that URL,
I'll see My Python blog, no posts yet,

60
00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:30.570
come back later.

61
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.592
So I'm just gonna give three or four
minutes for folks to catch up with me,

62
00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:39.966
and make sure that they're able
to start their Python server and

63
00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.940
see the same thing that I'm seeing.

64
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.045
Instructions for that should be here.

65
00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:48.630
I did notice one typo here.

66
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.891
Unfortunately, to make
a new virtual environment,

67
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:56.686
make sure that you use Python3 and
not Python.

68
00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:00.560
And I will go ahead and
fix that when I have a moment.
