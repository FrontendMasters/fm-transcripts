00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.261
Yes, so the question was,
there was a string here

2
00:00:05.261 --> 00:00:10.580
at the bottom that started
with the character f.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.890
Are there any other types of special
strings like that in Python?

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.910
Yeah, you might see r,
which stands for a regular expression.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.930
You might see b, which is a bite string.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.386
There are a few others that I can't
remember off the top of my head but

7
00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:32.050
pretty easy to look up.

8
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.970
&gt;&gt; Import requests,
it says my request module is missing.

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.070
&gt;&gt; That's because the request library
is not part of Python Standard Library.

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.340
So everything that comes with the Python
installation when you pull it down.

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.586
So in order to get this code to work,
you're going to have to install

12
00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:56.140
the request library with a different
tool that we'll talk about later.

13
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.610
Out and I think I misspoke earlier.

14
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.811
If you see an art here,
it's generally used for

15
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:07.587
regular expressions, but
it symbolizes a raw string.

16
00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:10.895
So when you're writing
regular expressions,

17
00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:16.520
you might not want to do a lot of escaping
like you would in a normal string.

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.730
So it's just formatted
a little bit differently.

19
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.960
Not something you see much unless you
are working with regular expressions.
