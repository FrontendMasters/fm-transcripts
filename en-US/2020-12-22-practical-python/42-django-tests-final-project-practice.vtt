If you wanted to write tests for Django,

2
00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:06.907
know that you need to use
a separate TestCase class.

3
00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:11.479
Not the one that comes in
the standard library with Python, but

4
00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.460
instead use django.test case.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.020
And there's guides for running Django
tests right here in the course website.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.100
And before we talk about the final,
actually,

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.396
I'll give you an overview of the final
project practice and then we will wrap up.

8
00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:34.690
And you will be done with the day with
a brain crammed full of Python knowledge.

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.989
For the final project practice, you're
gonna make sure that you're all set up.

10
00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.494
And then you're gonna do a few things,
we're gonna sort in reverse order.

11
00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:50.765
So if you saw earlier,
our blog posts are in

12
00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:55.760
chronological order,
which is not what we want.

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.229
We want them to sort in reverse so
that the newest posts are first.

14
00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.439
We're also going to add
a new is_draft fields so

15
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.210
that we can have some posts that we're
working on but we don't want displayed.

16
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.550
And then we're also going to write or
examine some unit tests.

17
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.050
And there's some links here for
going further with Django.
