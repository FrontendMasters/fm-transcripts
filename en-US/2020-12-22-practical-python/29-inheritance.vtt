00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.650
Python does have inheritance and
it also has multiple inheritance.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.696
I'm not going to jump into
a lot of these topics, but

3
00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.990
I do want to point out a few
important things about inheritance.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.335
When one class inherits from another,
you will put the class that

5
00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:25.058
is being inherited from in parentheses
after the definition of the class itself.

6
00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:29.259
When you are calling Dunder
in it on that subclass,

7
00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.046
if you then want to run all of
the code from the superclass,

8
00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:36.996
you need to explicitly call super.

9
00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:42.133
And then the method that you
would call ,in this case we know

10
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:47.600
that we wanna call Dunder in it
along with all of the arguments.

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.190
And this is syntax that you
are very likely to run into.

12
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.031
So it's important to keep track of.

13
00:00:56.031 --> 00:01:01.113
There is a lot more content here
in the course about overriding

14
00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:06.990
variables in subclasses that I recommend
you go back to and read later.
