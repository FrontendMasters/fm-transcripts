00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.726
And to wrap things up,
you have finished the course.

2
00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:06.754
You now have a pretty
complete foundation for

3
00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:13.090
what you need to continue on your Python
journey no matter what your passion is.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.988
Next steps, if you want to stay in touch,
if you enjoyed the course,

5
00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:19.150
I would love to hear from you.

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.412
I'm most active on Twitter,
sometimes I blog,

7
00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:27.348
sometimes I stream on Twitch, but
you can follow me on Twitter @nnja, or

8
00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:30.387
watch my other courses
on Frontend Masters.

9
00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:34.733
And I have a bunch of links for
you here for continuing your journey,

10
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.864
the basics, some more links about
web development and Django.

11
00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:43.164
Some information about AI and
machine learning and data processing.

12
00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:46.928
But most importantly, I think,
is the Python community.

13
00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:51.518
There are lots of local user groups
worldwide that are listed in the Wiki.

14
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:56.134
There's a Python discord with
a 100,000 developers on it.

15
00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:59.097
There are tons of supportive
groups out there for

16
00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:03.794
women and non-binary developers,
like I mentioned earlier, PyLadies and

17
00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:07.709
Django Girls, and the Python
community would love to have you.

18
00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:11.453
So congratulations for
finishing practical Python.

19
00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:14.169
Feel free to give yourselves
a round of applause.

20
00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:20.040
You all did a great job and I hope
that you continue your Python journey.

21
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.253
Are there any questions?

22
00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:27.220
I know.
[LAUGH] someone in chat just went.

23
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.362
[LAUGH] This course was head explode-y?

24
00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:35.402
Yeah, you all learned a lot.

25
00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:39.472
You really, I think, have a lot of the
foundational knowledge you need to write

26
00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:41.860
Python apps or
most importantly, read them.

27
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.357
You know about the tools and

28
00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:47.470
the skills that you need to work on
Python projects successfully on a team.

29
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.478
So you have it all and
I hope to see you succeed.

30
00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.814
I hope to read some of your
Python programs one day.
