00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.140
&gt;&gt; Pete DeBettignies: If
you were Minneapolis St.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.200
Paul, are you up in the Midwest?

3
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.760
You already know the headquartered
Minneapolis is UnitedHealth Group Group,

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.080
Best Buy and Target.

5
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.360
By the way, everybody applies at
UnitedHealth Group Group, Best Buy and

6
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.420
Target when they're first getting started.

7
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.450
That's okay.

8
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.520
Just lots of competition too.

9
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.950
So if you're here,
regardless of what town or city or

10
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.960
state country you're in, find lists of
companies in your region for us here.

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.276
If you go to Tech.mn,
MinneInno and the Minneapolis St.

12
00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.223
Paul Business Journal
articles you will stood.

13
00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:33.701
People are writing about these companies
everyday tech companies, big, large,

14
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:40.090
small private, public, venture backed
bootstrapped, find lists of companies.

15
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.760
Google for jobs just started what I think
they're about a year 16 months in now.

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.020
Google is now doing on steroids would
indeed used to do and still does.

17
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.970
Google is doing probably
a slightly better job at it.

18
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.640
All hate mail from indeed
people paul@mnheadhunter.com.

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.490
I'm also gonna find list of companies that
Angel.co, startup Angel place website.

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.592
So startups, lots of startups don't
actually have any other jobs in

21
00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.853
the career page [LAUGH] because they
don't know what they're doing it but

22
00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.050
the posted on
Angel.co Stack Overflow indeed.

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270
Go to the Inc 5000.

24
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.023
Inc 5000 is the 5000 privately held
fastest growing companies in the US.

25
00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:22.739
Think last year, Minneapolis,
there was 80 to 90, of the 80 to 90,

26
00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.465
I did not know who 22 of them were.

27
00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:27.392
And I'm pretty good at this.

28
00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:31.141
22 companies, now, they came a call
list for me, hi, my name is, and

29
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.520
some of them are manufacturing companies
who never gonna hire Fire Web developers.

30
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.970
But I can help them with the recruiting
strategy for manufacturing hourly workers.

31
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.690
A manufacturing company may need help with
that one thing on the website that you

32
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.800
need some experience in and you can go
do it for them, get paid a couple grand.

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.470
And now you've got another thing to show
off on your portfolio that you put on

34
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.180
LinkedIn, and you put on Twitter.

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.230
And now you've got to the question
earlier, how do I become a self-taught?

36
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.220
If I'm self-taught,
how do I become a developer?

37
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.540
Here it is.

38
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.990
I promised you I was gonna get here in
the end, it just took a while to get here.

39
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.460
Some more wish I look the big job boards.

40
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.580
I would still look at monster,
I would still look at Career Builder,

41
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.250
I would still go to dice.com for
a tech job.

42
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.540
Absolutely.

43
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.920
Niche and local job boards for
us here in town again,

44
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.834
like I just mentioned, Tech.mn, MinneInno.

45
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.929
Facebook or LinkedIn, Facebook and Mark,
I'll come back to that question, man,

46
00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.099
if you can remind me.

47
00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.832
Facebook by the way, General Mills has

48
00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:38.140
a Facebook group just for careers.

49
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.230
Facebook has a Facebook for careers' page.

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.478
Take advantage of those opportunities.

51
00:02:45.478 --> 00:02:47.750
How I became a recruiter was in 1997.

52
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.940
It was the mid October of 1997.

53
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.850
I answered ad in the newspaper,
old school I know.

54
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.940
But that's how I got
into this crazy world.

55
00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:01.650
But newspapers, a lot of times folks will

56
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.870
will overlook them but when you're on
the recruiting in HR side of things,

57
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.890
newspapers will sell you both the online
ad and the print ad and sometimes it's

58
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.640
like you can get four of these and two of
these and so you spread your jobs around.

59
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.883
So don't stop, I'm gonna do
some better grammar with that,

60
00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:22.498
start going back to newspapers.

61
00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:25.151
Any of the trade professional websites,
job search engines,

62
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.654
folks like me recruiter search
firm employment agencies,

63
00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:30.540
I wanna give you an extra put
an asterisk next to that one.

64
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.210
Here's the thing.

65
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.280
Know this, and this could be
a whole 40 minutes that I won't do.

66
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.540
I wanna do this.

67
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.970
A search firm recruiter,
we'll call them third party recruiters.

68
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.460
You've got your corporate recruiter,
your corporate HR person,

69
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.810
they are employed by the company.

70
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.610
And then you've got someone like me we
sometimes call ourselves third party

71
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.119
recruiters know this.

72
00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:58.069
In general, our vested interest
is with the employer, not you.

73
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.240
Whenever I am submitting candidates
to clients, I normally have three or

74
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.600
four candidates for that one role.

75
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.940
And usually two other search
firms are working on it too.

76
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.830
So you're now competing with 14 people.

77
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.960
One of the tools in your toolbox,
you should be doing all of these things.

78
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.230
Think of it like a toolbox or
you're building a house.

79
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.140
To be funny, your recruiter is your tool
because sometimes your tool, get it funny.

80
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.150
Come on,
I know it's the end of the two weeks.

81
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.092
But come on, that was funny.

82
00:04:33.092 --> 00:04:36.630
But we also know of roles though
that other people don't know about.

83
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.530
I tended know things to do
three weeks in advance,

84
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.780
in the startup space here in town.

85
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.740
So we are good in Avenue.

86
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.620
But a search for

87
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.680
recruiter as a junior developer roll
level, we rarely work with you.

88
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.020
Because employers generally
can find you on the road.

89
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.253
But make friends with us now for
four years from now.

90
00:04:58.253 --> 00:05:04.160
When you're wicked awesome and as cool as
we thought you were going to be today,

91
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.110
you are that person,
now we can work together.
