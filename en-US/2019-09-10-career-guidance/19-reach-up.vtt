&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Undoubtedly, you're
gonna see a job posted somewhere for

2
00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:06.047
an intermediate or a senior web developer
at a fill in the blank company.

3
00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:08.095
And you're gonna be like, man,
I really like to be able to do that.

4
00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:10.482
And you're thinking well, but
I'm not a senior web developer yet.

5
00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:14.371
And that's true yet, yet.

6
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.392
You don't know if they're looking for
an intern.

7
00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:18.375
You don't know if they're looking for
a junior role.

8
00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:22.959
We tend to not post these jobs because
we're afraid we're gonna get a bunch

9
00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:25.808
of resumes from people
that we can't handle.

10
00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.474
But if I see a role for
a senior web developer role and

11
00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:31.886
their skill set is what I have,
even though I'm a junior person.

12
00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.771
I am going to reach out to them.

13
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.092
My name is Paul Debadings, I'm a junior
developer here in Minneapolis, St.

14
00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:42.438
Paul, I saw your posting for
a fill in the blank on Tech.mn.

15
00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.892
I appreciate that I don't have the seven
plus years of experience you're looking

16
00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:47.302
for, but here's what I do have.

17
00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:51.098
Am I someone you would like to talk to?

18
00:00:51.098 --> 00:00:56.025
The worst thing they're
gonna do is say no, cool.

19
00:00:56.025 --> 00:01:01.004
See, I'm weird,
in my search firm industry if you are told

20
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:05.597
no 98 of 100 times a month,
you made six figures.

21
00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:09.836
Do you want to be rejected 98 times,
that sucks.

22
00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.860
But the cash is sweet on the two yeses.

23
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:17.765
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Your first job
search is going to be a bummer in a lot

24
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:18.325
of cases.

25
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:19.427
Can I just be blunt about it.

26
00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:22.100
It's going to be hard and so what?

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.444
You're getting yourself into an industry
that has lots and lots of doors and

28
00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:26.864
places to be able to go through.

29
00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:29.581
And you can create things and
the beginning part,

30
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.500
I'm hoping that some of this
will have helped out with
