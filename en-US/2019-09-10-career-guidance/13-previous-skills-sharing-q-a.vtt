00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.231
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So A,
don't have two LinkedIn profiles.

2
00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:03.744
It's actually against
the terms of service.

3
00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:04.956
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Yep, so

4
00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:10.797
many people now like post Great Recession,
post 2008 to 2011

5
00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:17.350
whether you're in the US around the world,
there was a global recession.

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.010
Many people now have literally had
three careers in the last ten years or

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.030
two careers the last ten years.

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.640
So it's more common place now.

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.310
That we tend to have more interest
as a workforce than we had,

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.990
say in decades past.

11
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.634
So I think it's very okay for
you to say I'm looking for a full time

12
00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:41.970
developer role and be continuing my
writing, how will you rephrase that?

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.930
Because what will undoubtedly happen is,
you will end up at a company and

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.260
then go away you can write for us too.

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810
Now I get that you may want to
be doing that on the side or

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.240
maybe you do some freelancing and
getting paid on nights and weekends.

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.920
You will likely find though that,
particularly companies,

18
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.150
maybe small agencies, startups in
particular small tech groups are like,

19
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.200
man, I'd be really cool if we had
a really good junior developer.

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.220
And if you can write for us too, yeah.

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.430
So I would incorporate that into that.

22
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.410
So these are really laid
back casual phrases.

23
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.360
I'll come up with a top of my head that
might not even be grammatically correct,

24
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.040
but it can be like I'm looking for
a full time developer role.

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.610
Where I can also help contribute content
on the company blogger website, or

26
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.480
I can also help with presentation or
sales material.

27
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.320
Like you can weave that in pretty easy and
I would do that versus not.

28
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.794
I would absolutely combine it in there.

29
00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:37.380
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.932
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does that mean that we
should also try to keep like personal

31
00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:43.690
interests out of our social media?

32
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.440
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
the question about,

33
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.980
should I keep my interest
out of social media?

34
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.420
I'm gonna venture here and I don't want to
but someone's gonna ask sooner or later.

35
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.820
We live in a hyper charged
political climate.

36
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.710
Not just in the US but around the world.

37
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.270
I'm good with most of the things that
someone might talk about online.

38
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.920
There are some things that I
actually don't venture near anymore.

39
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.497
So go back a number of years
when there was the then

40
00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:19.359
Senator McCain, not yet
President Obama debate.

41
00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.850
I'm gonna go here only for the sake for
this example, I'm a moderate at my heart.

42
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.770
A fiscally conservative socially don't
give a damn as long as you're not hurting

43
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.230
someone but can't quite be a libertarian
cuz they kinda wake me up to,

44
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.130
which means I never have like
a party on Tuesday when we voted.

45
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.760
My ballot was mixed across the board.

46
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.220
But I used to tweet a lot about politics.

47
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.520
So that year particularly,
I was like, I was not,

48
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.950
I was critiquing both candidates equally.

49
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.720
And so
my Republican friends were hating on me,

50
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.790
my democrat friends were hating on me,
like I am never gonna do this again.

51
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.550
Now, I said that at a Minneapolis junior
developers event last January and

52
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.460
then I had a young lady asked
me a question she goes, well,

53
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.160
what if I just flat out believe in
these causes and I don't give a shit if

54
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.350
someone's not gonna hire me because
of them and I'm like, cool.

55
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.390
If you know that the things you're
saying regardless of affiliation,

56
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.120
regardless of how you look at,
may potentially alienate you from certain

57
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.480
roles, cool, I know that I
have at times probably pissed

58
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.620
off a lot of Wisconsin Badgers football
fans over the years cuz I'm not kind.

59
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.230
I hate them.

60
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.310
I love the University of Wisconsin,
Massa's a fantastic city,

61
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.830
the school is amazing.

62
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.270
In college, my senior year,
I think it was my junior,

63
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.820
my senior year we played
the Wisconsin Badgers for homecoming.

64
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.247
And instead of like having Bucky and
then the Badger for

65
00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:45.080
those of you can kinda who
knows some college stuff.

66
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.420
It just said fuck Bucky and
I wore that proudly tell it was ripped and

67
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.910
had the stains,
I know I've annoyed some people,

68
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.520
I probably cost me a client or two.

69
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.354
You know, I'm cool with that.

70
00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:59.947
[LAUGH] On almost everything else though,
I don't because I'm

71
00:03:59.947 --> 00:04:05.630
trying to be sensitive that just
because you don't think like I do.

72
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.970
And by the way, thank God for

73
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.340
that, that not everybody thinks
the way that I do like I love banter.

74
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.900
I love back and
forth stuff but online, but

75
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.690
if you're saying that you're into flying,
you're into pottery,

76
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.400
you're into college football,
you're into nonprofits and volunteering.

77
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.794
But now and again,
I'll get a question like, should I say

78
00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:29.103
that I've been volunteering at
Planned Parenthood or for the tea party?

79
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:33.150
I'm not gonna answer that question cuz I'm
gonna let you all decide what's best for

80
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.070
you and your path.

81
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.720
Quick side note since I've had
a few of these, my Attorney and I,

82
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.460
she's like my big sister.

83
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.560
We were doing a presentation her
night together a number of years ago,

84
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.230
probably four or five years ago.

85
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.560
Minnesota State High School
hockey tournament was going on.

86
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.530
For those of you who are not familiar
with it, if you go to YouTube and

87
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.480
do a YouTube search like
Minnesota hockey hair,

88
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.260
you'll get an idea of what the Minnesota
State hockey tournament is like.

89
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.280
It's cult-like in our state.

90
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.510
That year a team Benilde St. Margaret's
was in the high school hockey tournament.

91
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.590
One of their players had recently
become paralyzed in a very

92
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.828
horrible hockey accident.

93
00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:15.310
And Benilde St. Margaret's was in high
school tournament neighbor doing well.

94
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.764
I was sitting at a coffee shop
with my attorney for two hours,

95
00:05:18.764 --> 00:05:22.443
explaining how I find Kant's on
social media with my attorney.

96
00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:25.170
And then I got followed by
a project manager here in town.

97
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.050
I said, well, let's play it out.

98
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.310
So on his Twitter stream, it was pretty
clear he graduated from this high school.

99
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.130
It's a private catholic school.

100
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.580
I then copy and pasted his name he's a
project manager like this might be someone

101
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.190
I'd wanna recruit.

102
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.162
So I copy and paste this name and
i put in a LinkedIn.

103
00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:44.425
On LinkedIn, I figure out, well,
he's indeed working for this really cool

104
00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:48.700
consulting firm in town and hey, like
this is someone I would wanna recruit.

105
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.927
A couple of the groups he belonged to
on LinkedIn were political affiliated

106
00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:56.963
a little more than a little to the right,
he was a little conservative.

107
00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:59.367
I still don't care,
he's a good project manager.

108
00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:03.469
Then did copy and paste and put it on
Facebook and this isn't Facebook when

109
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.173
in fact in where it was like parts
of your profile could be public and

110
00:06:07.173 --> 00:06:09.753
others could be private
his groups republic,

111
00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:14.016
it was really abundantly clear that
this guy was very, very conservative.

112
00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:17.217
And again, I don't care because
you're really good project manager.

113
00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:22.284
But what happens if you're hiring
manager is a Bernie Sanders

114
00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:26.571
liberal PETA loving
affiliation cuz by the way,

115
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:32.430
the Facebook profile was him wearing
blaze orange holding a deer head.

116
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.190
Do you hear what I'm saying?

117
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.850
These things do get judged though,
I'm just gonna let you all do it and

118
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.940
I'll probably wouldn't normally not
gone this far but you know what?

119
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.940
I think this is an important thing
to talk about now, so thank you for

120
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.970
let me go on a huge tangent.

121
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.250
And I'm hoping that everyone else is
going to take some value in that.
