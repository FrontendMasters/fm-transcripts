&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: In order to
have an All-Star status on LinkedIn,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.250
you need these things, all of them.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.940
The three recommendations
part sometimes is difficult.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.870
If you want a new, if you're like me I
hate, I don't like to use the word hate.

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.890
Hate's a strong word, but
I hate asking people for recommendations.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.070
I just send them to other people and one
out of three will write one back for me.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.210
[LAUGH] Okay, so
think of your former bosses and

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.860
it doesn't need to be in
technology right now.

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.440
By the way, I get that for many of you,
you're just getting into this but

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.960
this could be your supervisor at
the retail store you worked in a year ago.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.150
But you want to be able to have someone
say some nice things about you,

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.160
because that kind of matters a little bit.

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
But too, but in order to actually,
as a part of LinkedIn's algorithm and

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.920
how they rank people for like,
are you the first search result or

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.320
the 495th, this plays a part in it.

16
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.100
So in order to have a LinkedIn profile
that they love, it goes by that.
