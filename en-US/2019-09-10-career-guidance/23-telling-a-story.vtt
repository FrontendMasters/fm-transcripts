00:00:00.337 --> 00:00:03.518
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Getting
better at telling my story.

2
00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:07.838
Over and over and over and over again,
you're gonna tell your story for

3
00:00:07.838 --> 00:00:09.577
the next 30, 40 years.

4
00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:16.470
For me it's 20,
cuz I wanna be done before I hit 70.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.883
Yes, I'm 48, if I didn't say that earlier.

6
00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:20.513
I don't try to look nor
act my age most days.

7
00:00:20.513 --> 00:00:21.239
Get better at telling my story.

8
00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.402
The idea is, this is who you are.

9
00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:24.087
This is what you do.

10
00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:24.836
This is what you're about.

11
00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:25.526
This is what drives you.

12
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.873
This is what you're passionate about.

13
00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.487
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: That's the last one,
what are y'all waiting for?

14
00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:35.466
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: You've been here for
two weeks, you've busted your ass.

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:39.168
You're going to continue busting your
ass cuz if you don't, we'll find you and

16
00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:39.935
bust it for you.

17
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:44.335
Okay, take advantage of these
opportunities that you have, and

18
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.977
when you get bogged down, keep going.

19
00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:50.552
There isn't another option by the way,
what are you gonna do, quit or

20
00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:51.589
do something else?

21
00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:52.855
That's my confrontational,

22
00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:55.440
sort of motivational speech that
I'm gonna kinda end up with.
