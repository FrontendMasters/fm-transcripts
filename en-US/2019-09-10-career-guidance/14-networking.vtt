00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Now I'll get back
to the normal thing of our program.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.050
So, I am 48 years old, which means
I grew up with Winnie the Pooh.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.590
I think Winnie the Pooh was
the greatest philosopher ever.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.310
If you have, are not familiar with
Winnie the Pooh, just Winnie the Pooh,

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.200
just go to Google and
do Winnie the Pooh quotes.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.730
They're amazing.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.960
I love this one though when it comes to
recruiting, networking, and job search.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.850
It tends to be that we create
these awesome LinkedIn profiles,

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.370
we create these awesome websites,
and we wait for people to find us.

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.240
It's kind of a waste, right?

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.690
We gotta go to other people.

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.130
We have to go seek them out.

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.785
So we're gonna talking about
some networking stuff.

14
00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.300
And I'm going to go through this stuff
at apparently fairly quick pace.

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.690
If you've got questions,
stop me, otherwise,

16
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.150
I'm going to ramble here for
a few minutes.

17
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.650
Okay?

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.610
Don't ask for advice.

19
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.630
You're looking for thoughts,
advice, and opinions.

20
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.660
When someone says to you,
hey, can you help me move?

21
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.550
You immediately go, how the heck do
I become busy on this Saturday, so

22
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.360
I don't have to help you move.

23
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.810
But do you know of a mover?

24
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.790
Can I borrow your trailer or your truck?

25
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.910
Well yeah,
just bring it back in one piece.

26
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.480
The difference between the two
was an emotional attachment.

27
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.430
Can you help me with my job search?

28
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.980
No.

29
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.580
Can you help me build my website?

30
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.680
No.

31
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.380
If you were me,
how would you build a website?

32
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.730
If you were me,
how would you reach out to that company?

33
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.540
If you were me, where would you go to
find my first junior developer role?

34
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.620
Because now, it's, I don't know about you,
but I've got lots of noise and and

35
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.970
lots of opinions, clearly.

36
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.150
And I've got 30 seconds to 25 minutes,
depending on my ranting of the day.

37
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.440
By the way, side note,
I did create on LinkedIn a skill for

38
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.250
an endorsement for ranting.

39
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.080
I now have been endorsed six times in
the last 24 hours for ranting on LinkedIn.

40
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.940
And I'm gonna boost that sucker
cuz I think it's awesome.

41
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.190
But ask for advice and opinions.

42
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.540
Who do we know is hiring, who do you
know is looking for someone like me?

43
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.710
Who do you know who's looking for
someone like me?

44
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.670
Who you know is looking for
a junior developer

45
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.100
with a strong attachment to community
service and nonprofit work?

46
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.750
Where would you go if you were me?

47
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.470
People will answer those questions,
they will answer it on Twitter,

48
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.610
they will answer and LinkedIn,
they will answer it via email.

49
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.000
But if you ask for help, usually, it's
like now I got to carry you type feeling

50
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.480
and you all experienced this too though,
okay?

51
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.060
Who are your connections?

52
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.940
So often people say to me,
but I don't know anybody.

53
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.570
And I really think,
well that's BS, clearly.

54
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.340
I do it with high school and
college students all the time.

55
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.394
They'll say, I don't know anybody
like how'd you find your boyfriend or

56
00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:39.070
your girlfriend, and they'd go so
and so and introduce me.

57
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.969
I'm like so you network your way
into a boyfriend or girlfriend?

58
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.940
And they're like how do you
figure out what movie to go to?

59
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.740
Well I asked a bunch of friends,
so you networked?

60
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.290
What happens is we do network
in the professional sense,

61
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.870
we all get freaked out,
we all get locked up.

62
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.100
My God, what am I gonna say,
what am I gonna do,

63
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.144
I don't know anybody like where am I.

64
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.070
You're asking about a movie,
like settle down,

65
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.700
as an introvert, I'm saying this to you.

66
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.360
Some of the introverts, the rumor
like yeah but I still can't do that.

67
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.610
I'm not that forward.

68
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.490
There's a part of this you
have to get over though.

69
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.110
And that's hard for
me to say but it's kinda true.

70
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.460
It's like who did you
go to high school with?

71
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.740
Who are your peers in your industry?

72
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.700
Former bosses.

73
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.030
Who were you a boss of,

74
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.660
like who read the people that reported
to you, you have connections.

75
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.290
Okay?

76
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.650
If I am a junior developer and
I'm walking out of here this week,

77
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.980
I'm going to go home wherever home is and
home can also be online.

78
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.389
I'm going to start finding some user group
and meetups to attend or watch online.

79
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.280
This is actually one of the very
first things I'm gonna,

80
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.150
it's probably seventh first
thing I will do after.

81
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.170
I'm telling you all, like this is what you
got to do, this is what you got to do.

82
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.550
I get that, I said that seven times now.

83
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.970
But I will tell you that in order for
you to increase your skill set,

84
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.570
here's some like stories interact and
engage with someone like you.

85
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.360
Find a CTO or senior developer.

86
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.900
Do it in person, if you can,
in a group of meet up in your town.

87
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.685
So you can go to meetup.com.

88
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.580
So, meetup.com, for us in Minneapolis,

89
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.980
if you just type Minneapolis user group,
there's like a lot.

90
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.610
Okay?

91
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.920
So last week I was the JavaScript meetup,
next week,

92
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.760
I'm gonna be at the React meetup.

93
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.730
The last, I just know this instinctively
in my mind, the last Monday of the month

94
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.200
in Minneapolis St. Paul is the Ruby
meetup, Wednesday's the JavaScript meetup.

95
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.820
Monday's at Dave block brewery,
Wednesday is now at Space one.

96
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.960
I just know because this is where I go,
and this is where I learn by the way.

97
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.800
By the way, I always sit at the back
of the room at every meet up.

98
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.970
Because inevitably, in every meet up,

99
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.370
someone starts geeking on about something
that I have no clue what it's about.

100
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.140
And I sit at the back of them,
so I can get my work done.

101
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.250
But then still hang out
with everybody afterwards.

102
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.520
Answer career questions,
I answer job search questions.

103
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.960
I do this all the time.

104
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.600
Every meetup I go to though,
I normally meet two or three new people.

105
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.430
Usually one or two or a developer that
one of my clients would wanna talk to.

106
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.770
This is where you go to learn.

107
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.260
These people are giving presentations.

108
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.920
They are giving you, here's my code.

109
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.420
Take advantage of those opportunities.

110
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.390
So here in Minneapolis St.

111
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.540
Paul, there's something called tech.mn,
it's the portal for our community.

112
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.930
I don't care where you live.

113
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.660
If you're in Phoenix or in New York,
in your'e Sydney or wherever,

114
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.600
find a portal for your city,
your state, your region, your country.

115
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.856
Every, I have to, I don't know, there
has to be, I don't want to say every,

116
00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:38.150
because my region doesn't,
most regions do.

117
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.890
Figure out what that portal is.

118
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.860
Whether it's in person or through
Twitter because now you're on Twitter,

119
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.770
now you're gonna use Twitter.

120
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.590
Now you start following the speakers
of the events that you're going to,

121
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.140
thank them on Twitter.

122
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.900
Take a photo of them
doing their presentation.

123
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.180
Say hey,
it was really cool that presentation that

124
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.960
fill in the blank did last night.

125
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.350
Give back, stop just, there's this idea
that you just can't go to the bank across

126
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.170
the street and take out $1,000
unless you put $1,000 in first.

127
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.310
We tend to try to extract from networking
before we actually invested anything.

128
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.870
So don't do that.

129
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.970
Hackathons are a glorious way
to be able to do this, again,

130
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.600
whether it's in person or online.

131
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.550
You sit with somebody for 48 hours and

132
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.150
you've only taken two four hour
naps who develop a tribe fast?

133
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.820
You ate a bunch of bad food.

134
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.930
Y'all need to take a shower.

135
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.790
You're all exhausted.

136
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.640
You'll have this fantastic thing to show.

137
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.100
And by the way, for a junior developer,

138
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.040
this is a glorious opportunity to
have something to show afterwards.

139
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.350
I attended the hackathon,
fill in the blank, sponsored it.

140
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.600
We built this thing for this nonprofit.

141
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.390
I helped with the front end,
blah, blah, blah.

142
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.840
Now you've got something to show.

143
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.550
I'm always going to try to make things and
find ways to show off what I can do.

144
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.550
I can screenshot that, I can put it on
the website portfolio that we spoke about

145
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.060
earlier, I can put something
about it on LinkedIn, and

146
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.980
I'm a junior developer looking for a role,
that's how you tie it all together.

147
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.759
Find the cool kids, networking stuff,
you are at any event,

148
00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.513
go back to your junior high school days,

149
00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:24.051
there was always that one kid who
had seven other kids around them.

150
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:27.183
And that's where you go when you
don't have a network of people.

151
00:07:27.183 --> 00:07:29.251
Go find where the cool kids are and
hang out and

152
00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:32.529
get involved in their conversations,
listen and say hello my name is.

153
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.450
When you're a junior developer,

154
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.380
you have free reign to introduce yourself
to everybody because everybody expects it,

155
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.500
and most people will try
to give you some advice.

156
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.190
Take advantage of this opportunity.

157
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.410
It's not a bad thing.

158
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.220
It can be a good thing.

159
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.980
Find the cool kids.

160
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.070
Network gravity is the concept of this.

161
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.780
It's like a tree.

162
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.480
It goes back to earlier,
the idea of now you found the CTO for

163
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.120
that startup cuz they posted a job.

164
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.342
I want to suggest you,
if it's a company of 150, or

165
00:08:04.342 --> 00:08:07.545
200, or less, email the CEO,
email the CTO.

166
00:08:07.545 --> 00:08:10.999
Hey, I see you're looking for
an intern for the summer of 2019.

167
00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:14.546
My name is and I am a,
don't just fill out online,

168
00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:18.880
don't just go through their HR at,
send an email to the CEO.

169
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.870
Here's the idea.

170
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.820
You could start off with high in the
trees, you can, you will fall down within

171
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.230
it but if you start at the bottom,
you cannot work your way up.

172
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.389
My HR generalist friends, my recruiting HR
friends get pissed when I give this advice

173
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.340
cuz we're going around them, hell yes.

174
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.190
If I'm a junior developer and
I'm looking for a job,

175
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.400
I'm going to the person who can
probably get me there the fastest.

176
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.510
The CTO, the CEO,
not the decision makers, but

177
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.400
now they will forward you to the hiring
manager or the HR person who now is

178
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.980
compelled to get back to you because
they're in a hole if they don't.

179
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.250
Take advantage of this.
