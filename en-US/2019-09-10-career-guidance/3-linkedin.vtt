00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
&gt;&gt; Teacher: How many of you
have a LinkedIn profile?

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.230
Right, keep your hand up.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.733
How many of you think it doesn't suck?

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:12.060
[LAUGH] So I lost all but
two or three of you.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.400
So I wanna kinda give you some brief
ideas of things to do on LinkedIn, okay?

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.710
And so judging by the microphone card,
here's the deal.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.740
Do not, when you leave here or do not when
we get finished doing this presentation,

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.505
walk over to this wall and
take this photo.

9
00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:33.297
&gt;&gt; Students: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Don't look like you just got

10
00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:34.352
arrested.

11
00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:38.634
You probably don't want to be your
passport photo cuz those always

12
00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:39.867
look really like.

13
00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.933
Have a photo like with you and
a city as a backdrop or

14
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:47.810
for those of you who have been here and
taking those when I said to you last week.

15
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.600
Take photos of you working here,
do that for those of you who are online,

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.100
like the next time you could take
a selfie or have your kid, your spouse.

17
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.970
You can train your dog, I don't care.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.190
But the idea of get
a photo of you working and

19
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.860
then use that as your LinkedIn profile,
use that as your headshot.

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.140
Usually what happens is people
do this photo though and

21
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.900
I would suggest I would rather
see a photo than not see a photo.

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.250
But like this on you might as well not
have one because you don't look like you.

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.440
That makes sense?

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.020
But there is a weird statistic,
I think it's 68%.

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.460
It's like if you have a photo, 68% more
likely someone will click on your profile.

26
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.780
So if you don't have one, get one.

27
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.119
If you have one that you look
like you were just arrested,

28
00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.868
get a different one instead.

29
00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:38.350
Get a headline that says
here's what I'm looking for.

30
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.289
I'm a junior developer looking for
an internship.

31
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.680
Like be really specific about
it like don't make people gas.

32
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.596
So happened on the slides for a second.

33
00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.720
I didn't think about do this until just
now something about this on the fly.

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.231
So if I wanted to find
&gt;&gt; Wait for it.

35
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.922
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Yes, the Python,
let's just do that.

36
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.260
&gt;&gt; Teacher: Well, here's one right there,
Python developers searching for work.

37
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.440
Like that's okay, it's okay to say
to folks I am looking for a job,

38
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.524
I'm looking for a internship.

39
00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:34.370
I am looking to volunteer
of the non profit and

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.900
I know these skills, I want you to do
those things, especially now coming out.

41
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.820
So what I'm saying to you as
I would leave here, I would

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.260
be thinking about next week and if I'm
ready to offer my services in some form or

43
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.820
fashion or I'm looking for
an internship a part time something.

44
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:57.234
I'm going to say that on my
LinkedIn profile, like own it.

45
00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:01.610
Software engineering SmartThings doesn't
do anything for me as a recruiter.

46
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.090
I know you're an engineer in SmartThings,
but if I'm trying to recruit, again,

47
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.300
actively looking for a job opportunity,
senior Python developer at Target.

48
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.671
By the way, someone's like it.

49
00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:19.910
[LAUGH] I should take a photo of this so
I can remember to contact this person.

50
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.380
Really, I'm serious.

51
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.640
You might think I'm joking but
that's how this happens.

52
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.870
Let people know you're looking,
volunteer, intern.

53
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.150
Find a non profit,
find a junior developer role,

54
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.950
if you don't say it, I'm not gonna know.

55
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.150
So fill all the sections,
personalizing it whenever you can.

56
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.440
So if you are,
I wanna talk about this in a few minutes.

57
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.940
If you want to send an LinkedIn invite
to one of our two fantastic instructors,

58
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.710
you can do one of two things.

59
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.992
You can just hit like sent,
go to connect with them on LinkedIn.

60
00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:06.786
And it's gonna send,
it's gonna be like so and so

61
00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:08.234
wants to connect with you on LinkedIn.

62
00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:15.090
[APPLAUSE] Yey, how about, hey, my name is
I was at the front end masters bootcamp.

63
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.610
I appreciate those three things you taught
me, would you accept my invitation?

64
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.950
Yes, right?

65
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.620
So instead of trying to like spam a bunch,

66
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.470
you'll explain to them why you
would want to connect with them.

67
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.720
And we're gonna to talk more in a little
while, but why that will matter.

68
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.800
But personalize these things,

69
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.679
like take the time to actually invest
in trying to get to know someone.

70
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.140
Creep on other's profiles.

71
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.360
So I'm assuming and I just state all
this lies to make this transition easy.

72
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.057
I'm assuming that many of you like me
have a bit of a narcissistic side.

73
00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:51.875
And you're wondering who
viewed your profile.

74
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:52.690
We do this all the time.

75
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.170
And if you have a free profile or
if you have a free version of LinkedIn,

76
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.700
you can usually see like the last six
to nine of them or whatever it is.

77
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.565
What I do though frequently and I hesitate
to say this but I call it LinkedIn

78
00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:08.070
flirting but not the way you're all gonna
laugh and giggle and think it is about.

79
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.003
I frequently will go look at
a bunch of frontend developer

80
00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:18.366
LinkedIn profiles and
I'm literally just clicking on them.

81
00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:21.870
I will try to remember or I will keep
a spreadsheet of those who I clicked on.

82
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.760
When they click on my profile back,
I now don't have a cold call.

83
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.630
I now can reach out to them.

84
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.870
Hey, Zach, my name is Paul DeBeddings.

85
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.472
I saw that you looked
at my LinkedIn profile,

86
00:05:33.472 --> 00:05:36.496
I might even put in brackets
after I looked at yours.

87
00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:39.710
And I wanna reach out to you and
talk about an opportunity I have.

88
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.499
So if I'm you, if I'm coming on to you,
I'm gonna start trying to figure

89
00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.750
out who are the people I need to
connect with three weeks from now,

90
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.399
three months from now, a year from now.

91
00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:54.831
We're gonna talk about gleaning some of
this information out press releases and

92
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:57.419
stories we're seeing online
about technology companies.

93
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.120
But almost, now I live in a different
world, a bunch of technology,

94
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.930
a bunch of developers, and

95
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.710
a bunch of recruiting HR folks that
we're always on LinkedIn, it seems.

96
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.430
If you haven't yet been, you will.

97
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.069
And for those folks who
are listening to this bootcamp and

98
00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.310
you're overseize,
you may not be using LinkedIn.

99
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.990
You may be using another tool that's
specific to your region, and that's okay.

100
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.829
Still all these concepts were still
be the same that we're talking about.

101
00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:29.945
So I will try frequently give my,
I just did today, I said, so

102
00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.559
working with the company here in town,

103
00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:38.050
I sent that co-founders to link in
profiles for them to each to click on.

104
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.520
Because I'm gonna end up talking
to those folks this weekend,

105
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.240
I want them to think that the CEOs have
interested in them because they do.

106
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.300
But now they're gonna see that
it came from them versus me.

107
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.370
Odds are they're going to be more
interested in talking to us about this

108
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.770
role because a co-founder of the startup
looked at my LinkedIn profile.

109
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.130
For us on the job seeking
side is the same thing.

110
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.757
So start looking at
some of these profiles,

111
00:07:00.757 --> 00:07:04.278
start picking who you're going to wanna
network with a little bit in advance.

112
00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.360
It's a little bit like even
a popcorn trail in the forest.

113
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.820
You look at their LinkedIn profile,
you follow them on Twitter,

114
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.490
you like something that they posted
on LinkedIn, send them an invite.
