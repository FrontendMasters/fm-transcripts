00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:01.517
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I don't
talk a lot about resumes,

2
00:00:01.517 --> 00:00:02.967
I've only got two slides for it.

3
00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:06.659
Cuz if you had looked at tech resumes for
21 years you, too,

4
00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:08.296
would think they all suck.

5
00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:12.573
I'm being sort of funny about that and
relatively serious, okay?

6
00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:16.970
Anything you're doing,
pretend you're receiving it, and

7
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.021
ask you if you would call or
email you back.

8
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.189
If your email's a copy and
paste and you're like, wow,

9
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.020
this looks like I copied and
pasted this 25 times then don't do it.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.480
Your email and your resume,
to that employer,

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.797
should be personalized just like those
LinkedIn invites should be personalized.

12
00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:37.988
Just like I am hoping that the recruiters
who will be reaching out to you in two

13
00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:42.001
years or four years are personalizing
their information to you, yeah.

14
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.140
&gt;&gt; off screen: Yeah,
I would definitely agree with that.

15
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.768
If I see an email address
that's like @comcast,

16
00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:55.265
some sort of ISP or Hotmail or
some sort of weird.

17
00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.377
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So there are a lot
of people in the tech industry who

18
00:00:57.377 --> 00:00:59.202
actually judge you by your email address.

19
00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:00.102
Mark's a judger.

20
00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:01.341
&gt;&gt; off screen: I will, for sure.

21
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:02.288
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I am not.

22
00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:06.546
I will gladly accept your aol.com email or
resume.

23
00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:07.955
In the tech industry get a Gmail.

24
00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:10.512
But in the tech industry,
yes, get something that is-

25
00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:11.060
&gt;&gt; off screen: Just a Gmail.

26
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.824
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Cool.

27
00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:12.984
&gt;&gt; off screen: @Gmail.com.

28
00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:16.953
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: See I'm trying to
be not specific to a particular, but yes.

29
00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:21.530
Okay, there's probably still three or
four times a year I get, and this is

30
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.488
because you all, anyone under the age of
30 has now grown up with the Internet.

31
00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:31.519
Anybody my age has not, so for
those not familiar with Minneapolis,

32
00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:36.395
St. Paul or the Minnesota region,
we have lots and lots of lakes.

33
00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.119
And to the west of here is a very
large lake called Lake Minnetonka.

34
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.964
It's actually seven small lakes
dredged to make one big lake.

35
00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:46.399
And there tends to be a lot of fun on the
lake in the summertime because we get it

36
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.047
for about three months, so
you take full advantage of it.

37
00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:53.942
So a year ago,
I got an email from a Senior Director

38
00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:57.555
of Product at a big company in town and

39
00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:03.516
the beginning of her email address was,
goodtimesusie@.

40
00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:04.930
&gt;&gt; off screen: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Like really,

41
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.222
so again, Gmail or not, but
can we at least all agree where

42
00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:13.612
you get your email address from
to have it be professional.

43
00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:20.014
Another quick side story, about a decade
ago now, I got an email from a candidate.

44
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:23.793
Was a VP of engineering role,
was a fantastic opportunity.

45
00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:26.781
And that person had
done their research and

46
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:31.102
had said, hey,
I understand you're a gopher football fan.

47
00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:32.008
I'm a badger fan.

48
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:33.585
I'm okay, we'll see how this goes.

49
00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:34.667
I'm joking.

50
00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:40.268
But his email address
literally was sogophersuck,

51
00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:44.600
borrowing the S, right, gophersuck?

52
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.286
And then badgerules borrowing the R,
gophersuck_badgerule@.

53
00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:53.887
A and he could not figure out why
would not submit him as a candidate to

54
00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:54.400
the client.

55
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.860
Because the client, the CTO,
had both as undergrad, his MBA and

56
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.991
his JD from the University of Minnesota,
and he was a pretty uptight dude.

57
00:03:03.991 --> 00:03:07.595
So I didn't and this guy started
swearing at me in an email,

58
00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:09.263
I still have it to this day.

59
00:03:09.263 --> 00:03:14.384
You do wanna start though, a lot of
your email though will be templated and

60
00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:18.446
then a beginning and
an end will be a little bit different.

61
00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:25.739
Right, cuz, you can't personalize
52 submissions, you just can't.
