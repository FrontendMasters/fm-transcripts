00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.570
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
these next two, are things for

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.524
you to copy and paste and for some reason
and I will add it to the to the deck.

3
00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:13.720
I'm gonna add copy and paste don't click,
cuz for some reason when I

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.670
just click on this right now it says
this isn't supported in your browser.

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.380
Like well I'm using Chrome I
copied it in Chrome.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.960
We tested it last night.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.760
But if you copy and
paste this search string, so

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.643
I made it very specific right now for
Minneapolis St Paul.

9
00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:41.059
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So it's a search of
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Keyword,

10
00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.590
software manager, CTO, CIO, in many
in greater Minneapolis and St. Paul.

11
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.750
Thinking about I'm leaving here,
I wanna start figuring out who would

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.520
be that CTO at that one startup that
I might wanna go work at one day.

13
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.090
So this is a real and this does not
matter the kind of profile that you have,

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.570
you can do this from a free profile.

15
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.350
My search results show 5925 of these
individuals in Minneapolis St. Paul.

16
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.810
That's a pretty slick place to start.

17
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:21.317
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I have another list
then of course then for recruiter and

18
00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:24.830
HR folks 13,314 search results.

19
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.220
This does not depend on the number
of connections you have on LinkedIn.

20
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.640
All right?

21
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.090
I'm gonna explain to you in a moment why
that's really going to matter to you.

22
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.640
So the idea is this if you are in here and
we'll just take it as a hypothetical,

23
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.910
say you want to go to
current companies and

24
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.110
anybody have a company in talent or
curious about right now?

25
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.440
Just off the top your head.

26
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.683
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Target's a big one.

27
00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:53.190
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Let's not do
Target there's too many search results.

28
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.224
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Then Masters.

29
00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:56.990
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: You
don't wanna become too small.

30
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.040
I think you wanna work with Mark, kidding.

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.840
We're old dear friends.

32
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.470
He's my brother.

33
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.060
Let's do it.

34
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.244
Well, let' just do Target anyway.

35
00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:15.737
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So now we got
it down to 82 including the CTA at.

36
00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:22.340
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Why
the Chief Technology Cargill, pop up?

37
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.100
We'll figure that part out so

38
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.980
that the search string will be a little
more specific to those currently in this

39
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.880
role, okay.

40
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.860
But the idea being is now you
have seen,a job posting in

41
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.830
Target you're really interested
in curious about it.

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.150
We'll talk in about 15 slides about how
it is that you have now gone to Target to

43
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.680
that applicant tracking system.

44
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.240
You have filled up their nine web pages,
you have copied and pasted your resume,

45
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.460
and then attached your resume.

46
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.590
If any of you have gone through
the job search process and

47
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.390
applied online, you're already knowing
what I'm talking about that they can get

48
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.819
a little monotonous really fast.

49
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.620
I am going to suggest that you also
wanna send your info to a person.

50
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.790
Not just into a applicant
tracking system and submit and

51
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.920
then pray they're gonna get back to you.

52
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.380
I'm gonna show you how to do that
here in a couple of minutes.

53
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.660
But the idea then is that you can
start finding people to network with.

54
00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:15.990
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
let's come back to this.

55
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.330
So that's what these two are.

56
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.400
And you can play with these.

57
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.670
You can add.

58
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.610
It's made so that when scroll correctly,
if you click All Filters.

59
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.510
So we're doing this search in
Greater Minneapolis-St Paul.

60
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.460
So again, all you gotta do is flip
it to San Francisco, New York.

61
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.080
London, it's the same scenario.

62
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.890
You could change it by
the company's current companies,

63
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.600
past companies where they went to school.

64
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.960
So if you went to school at Cal Berkeley,

65
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.230
and you're trying to find
alumni who work at Google.

66
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.380
Okay, I'm guessing that that search
results still gonna be a lot of people.

67
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.020
But to get what I mean,

68
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.480
like you can now start trying to find
out ways you can start finding names to

69
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.050
reach out to people who work at Google and
went to the same school you did.

70
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.170
Because now you have
a networking opportunity.

71
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.840
It's not just you reaching
out to someone cold.

72
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.310
So you can play with these filters,

73
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.420
relatively easy to do just play around
it don't like you can't break LinkedIn.

74
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.920
Right?

75
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.110
Like a lot of people like I
didn't know if I can do that.

76
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.700
The thing is gonna do is is gonna
show up as an error, like who cares?

77
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.860
So I want you to be a little
curious about this.
