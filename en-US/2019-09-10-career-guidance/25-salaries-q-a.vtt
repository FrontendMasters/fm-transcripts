00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What about like
startups versus big mega corp.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.520
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So because this is
being recorded [LAUGH], for the first

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.979
15 years of my recruiting career most
of the work was done with large groups.

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.827
I am not always a fan of the startups
that have ping pong tables,

5
00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:32.161
fuzz ball, and beer on tap 24/7, 365.

6
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:36.909
I'm also not a fan of large office towers
with like, you can hear the lights,

7
00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.650
because it's that crappy
overheard lighting that buzzes.

8
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.740
That freaks me out too.

9
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.410
This is antiseptically clean and
this one's really dirty, and

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.870
I don't like either one of those for me.

11
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.110
Okay?

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.580
I like startups and small tech companies
that have raised some cash in the Midwest.

13
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.690
If they're raised a million or

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.220
two at this point they're
relatively stable, relatively.

15
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.110
I like those groups because you're built
you tend to be building stuff from

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.650
scratch.

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.280
The flip side is you're
building from from scratch, and

18
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.620
you have anybody else's code to lean on.

19
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.420
So there's opportunity there.

20
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.690
There's also the lots of opportunity to
really large companies in town who do

21
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.160
in any town who have an internship, or

22
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.980
hire recent grants because
they now have a program.

23
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.840
There's a really cool company here
in town called Kipsu, K-I-P-S-U.

24
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.020
They have a 12 month rotational program,
and they're a startup of like 45 people.

25
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.774
It's kind of amazing.

26
00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:36.260
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Find those
places where you can learn stuff.

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.150
And I get this question a lot of the time,
what should I do?

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.090
And I'm like, If it were me,

29
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.750
I'm gonna go to the place where I can
learn the most and tolerate the salary.

30
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.210
I need to learn as much as I can
with smart people as fast as I can.

31
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.380
And then maybe in two or
three years, I'm out the door.

32
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.050
And I'm gonna contribute and bust my butt.

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.710
They're gonna get every penny they put
into me But if you can find a startup.

34
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.488
If you are in the bay area, if you are in
New York city, if you are in Austin,

35
00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:07.120
Seattle, our startup community
here is really strong now.

36
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.380
Might never have said that seven
years ago but it is today.

37
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.520
There are these really cool opportunities.

38
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.650
So really it is going back though and
doing that research.

39
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.520
Asking your friends and
your peers, who do you know who?

40
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.370
Who's in a good place who's
really good at teaching?

41
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.840
Teaching, training, mentoring,
really, really matter.

42
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.410
I do applaud ya'll for having gone
through this the last two weeks.

43
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.570
Stay in touch with the front
end masters folks.

44
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.580
Good luck with what's going on.

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.130
Stay in touch with everyone
who's been speaking with you.

46
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.630
Thank you.

47
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:44.128
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: All right awesome.

48
00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:46.692
