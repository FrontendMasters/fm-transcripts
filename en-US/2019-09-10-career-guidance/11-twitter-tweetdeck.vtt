00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.470
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I wanna tell
you about Twitter really fast.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.850
In the tech space, a lot of developers,
all the cool kids, the thought leaders,

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.030
the people putting out really
cool stuff are on Twitter.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.980
If you're not on Twitter,
go get an account.

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.490
I rarely use absolute terms and
phrases on things.

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.680
You have to do this,
you shouldn't do that.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.670
I highly recommend you get a Twitter
account if only to absorb information.

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.590
If nothing else, just for that.

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.040
So I use a tool called TweetDeck,
most people are using Hootsuite.

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.460
I'm a bit old school sometimes.

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.350
But I have been,

12
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.140
for the last 12 days, monitoring
the Frontend Masters Twitter account.

13
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.720
So I've been watching what
you all have been tweeting or

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.170
what others have been tweeting online.

15
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.740
So for those of you who have been
watching the boot camp online, and

16
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.310
you've been sending messages,
I've been creeping and watching.

17
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.912
If you wanna find a way to build a network
on Twitter, if I were you and I will for

18
00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:58.103
the most part, I will go through and
anyone who has tweeted in the last

19
00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:02.105
two weeks about Frontend Masters,
I will start following them.

20
00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.334
Some of them are gonna follow me back,
some of them won't follow me back and

21
00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:06.330
I'm eh, their loss.

22
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.380
But I'm gonna keep following them anyway.

23
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.120
Some people will say, if you don't follow
me back then I'm gonna stop following you

24
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.818
and I'm like,
we're not in fourth grade any more, right?

25
00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:16.550
But this is a way to develop a network.

26
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.080
So if you're on Twitter, and

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.414
you don't follow Jen Kramer who was in
here last week, you're kind of silly.

28
00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.550
Like follow her, figure out what she's
talking about now that she's gone home,

29
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.820
what is she teaching in her classroom,

30
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880
what are the cool articles
that she thinks are important?

31
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.670
You don't have to tweet a damn thing,
although it's weird that you don't, but

32
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.780
absorb stuff.

33
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.859
So why I use Twitter, I don't do it like
I used to, I'm not as active as I was.

34
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.605
On the far right-hand corner,
I have a constant search for,

35
00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:48.470
we had Twin Cities Startup Week here,
in Minneapolis three or four weeks ago.

36
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.600
I'm still following
the hashtags from that event.

37
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.178
I am also following, I should probably
show this so you can get an idea, so

38
00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:58.669
if you're using this tool,
these are the searches I'm always doing.

39
00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:02.066
So the first year for Twin Cities Startup
Week, MN tech is just something we've

40
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:05.175
been using here in Minneapolis for
a couple of years now, a number of us.

41
00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:08.775
Mini Demo or Mini Bar, those
are events that go on here in our town.

42
00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:12.190
And then Mini Star, which is
the group that runs those two events.

43
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.468
So I'm constantly, that's not true,
I'm not constantly.

44
00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:21.656
This is, so I follow,
I don't know 10,000 some folks on Twitter.

45
00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:23.866
And so on the left hand
side of the screen, right?

46
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.622
That's spitting out probably
15 tweets every 2 seconds.

47
00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:31.055
There's no way I can absorb
that much information, nor

48
00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.700
would I want to, who cares?

49
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.780
So I create lists of people
I'm following on Twitter.

50
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.934
So all stars,
Mark is indeed there by the way.

51
00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.346
It's just people of Minnesota,
I've got a couple of lists for

52
00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:48.670
recruiter and HR folks.

53
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.440
So again, you're gonna wanna start
following companies on Twitter.

54
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.330
Their company page, also the CTO,
cuz you saw him or her on LinkedIn,

55
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.569
you see they've got a Twitter account,
now you gonna follow the Twitter account.

56
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.340
I'm getting ready to do a job search,
I'm trying to build a network,

57
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.710
this is what I would be
doing if I were you.

58
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.221
This is usually running on my laptop, and

59
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.103
I probably don't look
at it 15 minutes a day.

60
00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:17.075
I probably should be spending
more time than I have.

61
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.490
Right, I have a tech news, so

62
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.020
I don't have to go to TechCrunch,
I don't have to go to any of those sites.

63
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.265
I'm just catching their articles as
they're posting them on Twitter,

64
00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:26.336
cuz they all do, okay?

65
00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:29.746
VCs and angels for obvious reasons,
for me in the startup space,

66
00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:31.984
I wanna know what they're talking about.

67
00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:36.800
This list for me is like your
list of CTOs or recruiters.

68
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.160
I'm trying to make friends with the VCs
and the angels, both in the Midwest and

69
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.680
across the US, because I wanna know the
next time they invest in a company here.

70
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.250
I want them to think about hiring me to
help their group for the first six months.

71
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.300
So I am you.

72
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.460
I'm literally you in this scenario, okay?

73
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.340
And then, I took them out just for
this because it got so long, but

74
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.800
I also then monitor all of my company
clients' Twitter accounts too.

75
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.805
I just absorb information as I can.

76
00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:10.520
Ten years ago,
I was watching this all day every day and

77
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.780
sometimes it didn't get work done
cuz I could get absorbed in it.
