00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: To
the question about, for

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.520
those who have not been in technology yet,
who are learning on your own,

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.930
who have gone to a boot camp,
who this is your first boot camp.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.860
So here's some things I
would suggest you wanna do.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.240
First of all, go to LinkedIn and
find someone like you.

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.280
Okay, so here's what I mean by that.

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.490
And actually, there is a photo I took or
did a screen image.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.960
So this image on the screen right now,

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.850
it is the summary section of a person
who went to a boot camp here in town.

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.350
And none of it's about technology,
but here's why.

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.470
This, your previous roles that you've
had until this moment still matter.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.314
A company might see that you
worked as an intern somewhere, and

13
00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:56.441
then you became a full time employee and
then you became a manager.

14
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:59.065
And it could be at a retail shop,
it could be at a restaurant,

15
00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:00.872
it could be at a manufacturing facility.

16
00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:02.508
I don't care.

17
00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:04.700
Your past up until now matters.

18
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.230
It will very much matter, because you
will need to relate to an employer.

19
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.710
Why it is you got into technology?

20
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.080
Why you wanted to learn how to code?

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.870
And now your past helps you.

22
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.090
Many of you have probably been
in customer service, teachers.

23
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.870
There's someone in town who has
become a dear friend of mine.

24
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.320
She was a nurse before
she learnt how to code.

25
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.560
And the reason why I bring that out is
this, you have a talent called empathy.

26
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.850
And you tend to really like people, and

27
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.874
you tend to want to know how
technology can fix their situation.

28
00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:45.336
You wanna write, you wanna create an app
that's going to make their experience

29
00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.210
better in some way on something.

30
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.064
So your experience up until now matters,
you want to document it.

31
00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:55.758
Also, if for
ticket sales Rapids Minnesota Orchestra,

32
00:01:55.758 --> 00:02:01.034
if we even said there are two like,
because I did this one thing,

33
00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:04.220
we increased ticket sales by 12%.

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.530
It's still this idea that you were
a valuable, you benefited your employer.

35
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.340
Because, when you say that you're
a junior developer and you're looking for

36
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.950
your first job, your work history
is still gonna be what we're gonna

37
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.010
base some of this stuff on, okay?

38
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.206
So if you can say, and
I think I have one more here, and

39
00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:23.282
I'll slip these into the slides.

40
00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:29.170
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So,
make sure that you can read it.

41
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.760
Technology is a part of my life,
starting and

42
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.780
I delve into ways to work
digitally from games to a VCR.

43
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.100
That seems kind of,
that's interesting to me.

44
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.158
The last thing, I recently completed
the GA Web Developer Immersive course,

45
00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:42.610
the goal being to push me forward
to become a better web developer.

46
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.120
That's their summary on LinkedIn.

47
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.790
So it could be in my previous life, I did
these things, I saw ways that technology

48
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
could benefit patients, customers,
users in some form or fashion.
