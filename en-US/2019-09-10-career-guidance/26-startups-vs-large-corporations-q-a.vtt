00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.247
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Last things, yes.

2
00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:05.023
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you talk about
salary expectations ,specifically for

3
00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:06.307
Minneapolis, St. Paul?

4
00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:08.515
So I know the correct
amount of money to ask for

5
00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:12.368
is the largest amount you can say with
a straight face, but what is realistic?

6
00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:13.553
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
you don't even need me to answer.

7
00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:14.545
You already know the answer
to your question.

8
00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:22.609
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I'm going to
give you some general, not, so again,

9
00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.823
these numbers are for Minneapolis, St.
Paul, start there.

10
00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:34.195
Jumping off, so I can say, someone who
has gone through Prime Digital Academy,

11
00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:36.887
the boot camp code school up the street.

12
00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:41.104
My guess is they're getting 50 to 58 grand
a year after having gone through that

13
00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:41.657
program.

14
00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:46.961
Was it, 16, 20 weeks, whatever it is now.

15
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:50.432
Most of the folks that get
admitted in there have some,

16
00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:55.197
whatever that definition is,
some experience previous to, but not all.

17
00:00:55.197 --> 00:01:01.237
University of Minnesota, IT grads this
year, we're making 62, 67 give or take.

18
00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:05.200
Anybody with a data analytics background
who went through that program were getting

19
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.388
offers at UnitedHealth Group for 70 grand.

20
00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:10.356
So that's that pool of people.

21
00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:13.930
I'm seeing a lot of internships for
15 to 25 an hour.

22
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.994
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
that's 30 to 50 grand a year, so to speak,

23
00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:24.845
if you just double it to make
the math simple, real quick.

24
00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:29.824
The hard part though is that you then
have large companies who would just say

25
00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.497
this is our salary band.

26
00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:36.085
Startups and small tech companies don't
tend to pay as much as the big companies,

27
00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:39.822
but they can offer equity and
maybe ping pong if that's your deal.

28
00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:42.694
I'm getting to is this, it sounds like
I'm trying not to answer your questions.

29
00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:44.158
There's actually four answers.

30
00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:46.967
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sure.

31
00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:51.407
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I'm a fan of
asking questions like what did last

32
00:01:51.407 --> 00:01:53.518
year's intern make?

33
00:01:53.518 --> 00:02:00.561
Can you give me an idea what the general
developers are making on your team?

34
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.524
Usually, you can try to,
if you ask it four different ways,

35
00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:09.286
the recruiting I do, I tell everybody
my salary range from the get-go.

36
00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:11.976
And then they tend to fudge less.

37
00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:16.604
Cuz they already know what we're doing.

38
00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:20.231
I also would go to a,
do it over the weekend,

39
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:24.838
do IT, in this case,
I would do entry level as a search,

40
00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:29.268
entry level IT developer salaries,
do some of that.

41
00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:31.494
I would go look at Robert Half, Lotus,

42
00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:35.752
any of the other large national
consulting firms all have salary surveys.

43
00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:39.433
Now understand that they're
Fortune 500 clients.

44
00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:40.986
So the pay tends to be more.

45
00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:44.186
And they tend to say three years,
plus seven years,

46
00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:46.948
plus ten, so they're not getting here, but

47
00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:51.327
at least you can get an idea of where
does three start and back it up a bit.

48
00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:53.919
It's the one part of
this thing I don't like.

49
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.860
Cuz in town right now, the same front
end a developer could be making 50

50
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.321
at one place, 62 at another and
70 at another, same person.

51
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:06.973
Because none of this stuff is really
out there and it's not easily obtained.

52
00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:12.550
So I'm not trying to dodge your question,
a little maybe, anyone else?
