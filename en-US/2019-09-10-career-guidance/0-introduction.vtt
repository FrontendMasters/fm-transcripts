00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:06.575
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: All right, so I know
you all have had a long couple of weeks,

2
00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:09.042
busy couple of weeks, learned a lot.

3
00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.924
What I wanna do now is talk
a little bit about what to do next.

4
00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:16.074
So I'm gonna talk about whether
it's gonna be doing a job search.

5
00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:18.309
I know that for
those who are the entrepreneur types,

6
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.655
you're gonna be looking for
technical co-founders.

7
00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:22.719
All of this stuff is gonna
kind of tie in together.

8
00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.024
Okay, so a quick little bit about me.

9
00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:28.656
I don't like to do these slides, but
I'm always told you're supposed to, right.

10
00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:31.817
I've been recruiting
here in Minneapolis St.

11
00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:36.170
Paul for 20 years in the technology
product, UX design space.

12
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.928
Mostly the last six plus years
now focusing on startups,

13
00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:42.844
small tech companies in town who don't
have a recruiter, an HR person in place.

14
00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:45.348
And so I come in and
try to help them get up to speed and

15
00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:47.985
then usually hand that role
off to a full time person.

16
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.831
And then I do a lot of public speaking
in the Midwest and around the country on

17
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:56.120
recruiters, recruiting HR stuff, social
media, how to recruit like a startup.

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.190
Okay, so what I want to do
then is talk to you all about,

19
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.360
here's what I would do if I
were you tomorrow or Monday.

20
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.728
And so some of you are gonna
be at different places, okay?

21
00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:09.570
Some of you are gonna have already
completely filled out LinkedIn profile.

22
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.339
It's gonna look amazing.

23
00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:14.229
And some of you are gonna be like,
LinkedIn, why do I have to be on there?

24
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.089
So just understand when I
do some of these examples,

25
00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:18.301
you're gonna be at different places,
and that's okay too.

26
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:23.026
All right, one thing I wanna do from
the get-go is say that you are not

27
00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:24.911
an entry level developer.

28
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:29.837
Please do not ever say that anywhere,
anytime, ever.

29
00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:33.097
I know that sounds weird to say, right,
but when you say that you're an entry

30
00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:36.124
level developer to an employer,
they automatically assume you suck.

31
00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:37.317
Okay, you don't.

32
00:01:37.317 --> 00:01:39.695
You're going to be learning, you're
going to be expanding your horizons,

33
00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:41.171
you're going to learning new tools and
stuff.

34
00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:45.143
But if you say an entry level developer
they're gonna offer you $12 an hour.

35
00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:47.511
That is not your goal,
that is not why you're here.

36
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:50.688
That's not why you're gonna be trying
to get into this industry, okay?

37
00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:54.377
So if I'm you, I'm gonna be talking
about I'm an associate developer.,

38
00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:55.656
I'm a junior developer.

39
00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:58.004
That's actually the phrase I always use.

40
00:01:58.004 --> 00:01:59.966
And you'll use that for the first year or

41
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.728
two, could be three years depending on
what your curve is going to be, okay?

42
00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:05.369
You can say you're a software engineer.

43
00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.791
That's fantastic too.

44
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:09.848
But please don't say you're entry level.

45
00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:11.696
Everyone raise your right hand.

46
00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:13.121
No, really raise your hand.

47
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.136
Say after me.

48
00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:15.209
I will not.

49
00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.000
&gt;&gt; I will not.

50
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.896
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Call myself.

51
00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:17.664
&gt;&gt; Call myself.

52
00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:18.810
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: An entry
level developer.

53
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.098
&gt;&gt; Any entry level developer.

54
00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.568
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Thank you very much,
you guys are amazing.

55
00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:22.762
See how much fun this is?

56
00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:23.869
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
