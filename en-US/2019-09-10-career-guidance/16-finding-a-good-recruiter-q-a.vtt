&gt;&gt; off screen: Questions about good versus
bad recruiters that a waste your time.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.930
&gt;&gt; Paul DePettignies: Best way
to find a good search firm or

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.850
consulting firm recruiter, because you
may six weeks or six months from now

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.710
just take a $25 an hour gig through
one of the national consulting firms.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.960
Ask your friends who is a good
consulting researcher and

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.630
recruiter that they like, know, and trust.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.530
Because if you think about it,
a search firm recruiter or

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.020
consulting firm recruiter is literally
going to be able to mess up your life.

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.930
We will know where you live, where
you're working, how much you're making,

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.320
how much you wanna make.

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.632
You wouldn't trust your family
with some of that info.

12
00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.388
And you're gonna trust some complete
stranger who reached out to you on

13
00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:41.834
LinkedIn and spammed you.

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.364
You have to take control
of your career now, okay.

15
00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:54.560
If I had a hammer and I could knock you on
the head, that might be one of the things,

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.920
that would be a theme.

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.960
You now need to take control of your
career, and this will go as fast or

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.090
as slow as you take it.
