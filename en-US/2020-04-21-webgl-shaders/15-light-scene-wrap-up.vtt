1
00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.291
I'm gonna sort of park
this demo to the side.

2
00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:05.418
There's tons more we could still do
to this if we wanted to get into more

3
00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:05.955
lighting.

4
00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.891
We wanted to maybe make this like burning
sun, or starting to make like glows around

5
00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:13.710
the earth or something like that,
maybe introducing rim lighting.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.380
But what we're gonna do instead is
we're gonna introduce some more,

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.060
some slightly more advanced
concepts around geometry.

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.420
So one of the things about this course
today is that it's not so much just

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.450
creating things, but it's also trying
to understand how this pipeline works.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.775
And so this next little exercise
is gonna be a little bit less

11
00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:40.055
interesting visually speaking, because
we're just gonna create a simple geometry.

12
00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.835
But the more we understand that, the more
we can create these interesting visuals.

13
00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:49.342
And so if we go to the demos, you'll
see we sort of covered these first for

14
00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:52.265
light material mesh groups.

15
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.526
And this lighter material demo, actually,

16
00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:58.342
you might wanna just pop it open just
to see how it's using multiple lights.

17
00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:00.288
And the two lights
are just different colors.

18
00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:04.765
And so when those two lights combine,
it creates this nice sort of effect.

19
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.209
And you can also use different
colors in the light parameter here.

20
00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:16.112
And the actual movement, this has to
do with cosine and stuff like that.
