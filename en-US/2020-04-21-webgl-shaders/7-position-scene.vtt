00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.916
So now we have position which is just like
our earlier example of the coordinate

2
00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:08.926
system, but now we're able to change
the position of this mesh, and

3
00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:10.535
you can try changing this.

4
00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:12.642
So mesh.position is a vector three.

5
00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:17.426
So you could say
mesh.position.setScalar(0.5) and

6
00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:23.988
it's gonna set the xyz to the same, or for
example you could say mesh.position and

7
00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:30.101
then set which is gonna allow you to
change the x y and z values independently.

8
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.901
So yeah it's a vector 3 so it's just look
into the docs there if you're confused or

9
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.438
you need a refresher about that.

10
00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:44.015
And then rotation, so rotation is similar
to vector 3 but it's called Euler,

11
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:49.116
but for our purposes, we can think of
it like a vector three has an x, y,

12
00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:53.984
z as well has a lot of the same
functions like set, setscalar, etc.

13
00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:59.167
And rotation allows us to rotate a mesh
around these three axes, so rotation is

14
00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:04.521
something that's when you first encounter
in 3D it can be kind of mind bending.

15
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:09.224
And so the way I like to think about it is
with my arms or with my fingers, and so

16
00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:14.223
generally speaking, when we're working
in WebGL, the y axis goes up and down,

17
00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:18.293
and so you can put your arms up and
down and that would be the y axis.

18
00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:22.895
And so if we're rotating something around
the y axis, we're literally rotating

19
00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:26.362
it around this axis as if you're
like spinning around a pole or

20
00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:28.712
something like that in the fire station.

21
00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:33.430
And then the x axis would
be this sort of formation,

22
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.819
where you have your arms
out to either side, and

23
00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.540
you're rotating an object
around this axis here,

24
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.080
and so
that would be the actual form of rotation.

25
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.905
And so you could see how,
when we rotate this cube,

26
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.752
it's as if we're rotating
around that that line.

27
00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:55.950
And then the Z axis would be front and
back, and

28
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.391
it's the same concept we're just
rotating it around this way.

29
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.552
And so you can either use your arms or

30
00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:07.310
another tip is to use your fingers where
you point yourself a gun with your thumb

31
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.361
up, your right hand, and
your first finger out.

32
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:14.961
Just like a gun and then you stick your
second finger, your middle finger up, sort

33
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.841
of perpendicular to your index, your first
finger and it creates the same structure.

34
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:23.896
With the thumb going up and down for
y, the middle finger going left and

35
00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:28.038
right for x, and your first finger
here going forward backwards for z.

36
00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:31.646
So that's just a bit of a way to
remember these kind of things.

37
00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:36.024
You'll often see me when I'm working with
3D math, I'll just put out the gun and

38
00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:40.040
sort of visualise how I wanna rotate
something, so it's pretty helpful.

39
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.514
And then lastly we have scale, so
this is another property of mesh,

40
00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:49.378
that allows us to scale objects in the X,
Y, Z, this is a vector THREE, so

41
00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:51.590
we have all those same commands.

42
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.851
Okay, and the last thing that ties
everything together is the scene, and

43
00:02:55.851 --> 00:03:00.315
so, the scene graph is a bit like the DOM
tree, we can place objects into it and

44
00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:04.186
then we can place objects into those
objects and so on and so forth.

45
00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:08.987
We can create this tree of different
meshes that makes up a scene,

46
00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:10.570
a virtual 3D scene.

47
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.288
So you just create a scene which is an
empty object, and then you go through and

48
00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:19.644
when you create a mesh after the mesh
is created, you say scene.add and

49
00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:23.438
then the name of the mesh, and
that will add it into the scene.

50
00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:27.467
Without this line, if we're gonna comment
this line out, the mesh wouldn't appear.

51
00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.205
So if you're working with 3D and
you don't see a mesh,

52
00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:32.431
just make sure it's been
added to the scene.

53
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:34.882
Sometimes it might have been
added to another object, but

54
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.791
that object hasn't been
added to the scene.

55
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:37.540
So just make sure
