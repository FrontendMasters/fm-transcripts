00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.670
How do we actually get this
moon to orbit around the Earth.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.890
And so to do that, we're gonna introduce
the concept of grouping and hierarchy.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.430
And so right now everything is just
being placed into the scene, and so

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.250
if we wanted to rotate this
moon around the Earth.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
What we actually want to do is
place this moon into an anchor

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.690
sort of an empty object and
then we're gonna rotate that object and

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.940
that way it can actually
orbit around the Earth.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.377
And so to do that, I'm gonna scroll up,

9
00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:35.408
we're gonna go to where
the moon mesh is defined.

10
00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:40.326
And just above that, we're gonna
create a new object called moonGroup,

11
00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:43.832
we're gonna say moonGroup
= to new THREE.Group.

12
00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:48.133
And so THREE.Group is a way of parenting

13
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:53.720
objects just like we
would with divs in HTML.

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.690
If we wanted to create a parent we can use
a div, but in three js, we use .Group.

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.510
So now we add the MoonMesh,

16
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.095
instead of adding to the scene we added
to the group, and so now you're not

17
00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:11.940
gonna see it anymore because
the moonGroup is not added to the scene.

18
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.940
So then we're gonna say scene.addmoonGroup
to make sure that it's actually visible

19
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.590
in the the scene.

20
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.160
And so if you've done all that
it's gonna look just the same,

21
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.470
and that's because we haven't
actually rotated our moonGroup.

22
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.680
So now what we can do, because we've
got our moon inside of this anchor,

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.920
we can just rotate the anchor and the moon
should just rotate around our earth.

24
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.583
So you've to say,
moonGroup.rotation.y=time.

25
00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:45.182
And now all of a sudden
we've got this orbit,

26
00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:49.750
maybe it's too fast,
you can work with the speed there.

27
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.710
So this is kind of if
we go to these demos,

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.400
this is pretty much the first three demos.

29
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.530
We have, creating mesh,
we are creating multiple meshes and

30
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.260
we have created groups, you can always
go back to these for reference.

31
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.261
These are not using any sort of require
statements or anything like that,

32
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.986
cuz it's all running in glitch, but it's
ultimately the same kind of concepts here.
