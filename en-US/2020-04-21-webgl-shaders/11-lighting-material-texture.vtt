1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.447
So the next concept would be
to introduce lighting, and so

2
00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:06.750
we'll go back to our demo here,

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.364
Because let's say right now the world two
evenly lit, everything just looks like

4
00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:17.934
it's being lit up perfectly and
we wanna add some sort of drama.

5
00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:22.886
So as we go from here to this image
from here, everything is lit perfectly

6
00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:27.773
to somewhat more realistic, of a look,
and so we'll just add that in.

7
00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:32.003
And the way we're gonna do that is with
lights, so we're gonna create a light,

8
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:36.172
it doesn't really matter where we create
the light somewhere before we return

9
00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:37.516
render and everything.

10
00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:41.073
So we're gonna say const
light = new THREE.PointLight,

11
00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:45.707
we're gonna start with a Pointlight,
there's different types of lights.

12
00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:49.389
There's like spotlights, there's
directional lights, hemisphere lights, but

13
00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:51.893
for now we're just going to
be working with PointLights,

14
00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:54.772
it's the simplest one to work with,
and it's kind of like a bulb.

15
00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:59.335
You can think of it like a little light
bulb shooting light off in all directions,

16
00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:04.033
and it's just something that we placed in
space and then it shoots light around it,

17
00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.203
sort fo equally from all directions.

18
00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:09.928
So the first argument is the color,
so we can say white as the color, and

19
00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:13.655
then the second argument is the intensity
which is just gonna be 1 which

20
00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.226
is like a default intensity.

21
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:17.175
Higher numbers would be really bright,

22
00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.936
lower numbers would be really
dim just like a light bulb.

23
00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:26.681
Then we're gonna add this light to
the scene, I'll say scene.add(light).

24
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:31.560
So remember, I mentioned earlier that
MeshBasicMaterial, has nothing to do,

25
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.512
with lighting, it's always gonna be the
same color in the same output regardless

26
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:39.404
of whether there's lights in the scene or
not.

27
00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:42.438
And so, what we really need to
do is we need to change this

28
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:46.588
MeshBasicMaterial into a different
material type that accepts lighting.

29
00:01:46.588 --> 00:01:51.783
So we're gonna say MeshStandardMaterial,
and standard is just their way

30
00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:56.977
of saying it's their good quality like
typical material that you wanna use

31
00:01:56.977 --> 00:02:02.099
in your sketches, in your 3D virtual
worlds that have to do with lights.

32
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.196
And so now if we look, it's got this
kind of cool eclipse thing going on,

33
00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:10.636
it's like the poster for
Gravity or something.

34
00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:14.548
But we want to make it so that it's
actually lit, and the problem right now is

35
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:18.215
that the light is in the same position
as the sphere in the center, and so

36
00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:20.375
it's just hidden inside of this sphere.

37
00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:25.428
So we're gonna push the light out
by placing it somewhere in space so

38
00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:30.837
we're gonna say light.position.set,
maybe we'll make it 333 or

39
00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:35.291
any number you want really just
some position in the world.

40
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:49.365
And then the other thing that we might
notice if we compare this to our demo

41
00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:54.545
here, is that this looks like what we
sort of expect, it's nice and smooth.

42
00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:57.609
But in this demo that we've got,
everything's kind of shiny,

43
00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.894
it's like we're looking
at a metallic globe.

44
00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:04.754
And so to fix that, we're going to change
the material properties, we're gonna say

45
00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:09.765
instead of MeshStandardMaterial with map,
we're gonna say roughness is equal to 1.

46
00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:13.411
So roughness,
if we're talking about different

47
00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:17.850
properties of let's say a ball
that has some material on it.

48
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.231
If it's a perfectly
mirrored reflective ball,

49
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.493
it's gonna be zero in terms of roughness,
it's not at all rough.

50
00:03:23.493 --> 00:03:26.955
The surface of this ball is
gonna be perfectly smooth, and

51
00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.367
the metalness is gonna be one 100%.

52
00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:34.203
So the metalness is another value we can
use, and so for a mirror, it would be one.

53
00:03:34.203 --> 00:03:39.371
But for what we want, we want it to be
perfectly rough and not very metal at all.

54
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.867
We wanna turn off the metal on this, so

55
00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:46.484
we get rid of this sort of glaring
effect in this sort of glossy effect.

56
00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:48.395
Then we're gonna turn up the roughness so

57
00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.687
that it's just a lot
smoother on the surface, and

58
00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:54.303
we're gonna do the same thing for
the other material, just copy paste those.

59
00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.977
And then you can either increase the
intensity of the point light, or you can

60
00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:07.564
reposition it, to be a little bit closer,
and that will also increase the intensity.

61
00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:23.192
So maybe Iâ€²ll just increase
the intensity a little bit, And yeah,

62
00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:29.138
now all of a sudden we have the scene,
it's a little bit closer to what we want.

63
00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:34.103
And again at any point we
can just hit Cmd+S and

64
00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:37.674
export PNG, we should get a PNG.
