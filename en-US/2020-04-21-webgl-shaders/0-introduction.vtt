1
00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:03.323
We're gonna be talking about WebGL and
GLSL.

2
00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:08.038
This is sort of a advanced course
compared to my other Frontend course,

3
00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:12.911
which is more of an introduction to
creative coding with Canvas with 2D,

4
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:15.439
and a little bit of WebGL and Shaders.

5
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.837
But today we're just gonna be
focusing on WebGL and shaders and

6
00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:21.733
Three.js trying to get a bit
more in depth with that.

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.583
And trying to actually break
down how the pipeline works and

8
00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.436
trying to understand some of
that the lower level details.

9
00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:31.889
And so just the tools we're gonna be
using, we're gonna break this down

10
00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:35.466
into a few different parts,
so I'm gonna start with the,

11
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:39.198
we're gonna be using Node.js
just like in the last course.

12
00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:43.313
We're gonna be using Node.js to run
applications on the command line,

13
00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:45.480
it's all JavaScript applications.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.929
And we're gonna be using npm,

15
00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.334
which is gonna allow us to
bring in modules of code.

16
00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:53.634
This is gonna allow us to download and
install modules, but most importantly for

17
00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:58.011
this course, we're gonna be using npm as
well to bring in modules of shader code.

18
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.304
So npm isn't just JavaScript,
some of the modules

19
00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:06.217
that exist on npm are also written in
GLSL, which is gonna be really useful.

20
00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:11.027
I'm also gonna be showing glitch demos,
so glitches, a really nice,

21
00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:13.841
helpful platform for sharing some code.

22
00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:18.682
It's a glitch.com, you can check it
out and it allows us to basically

23
00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:23.208
just share some code and you guys
can open it up and remix the code.

24
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.169
And it's just a really good platform for
like sharing some demos.

25
00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:32.484
And then when we actually go to code our
work, I'm gonna be using Canvas-Sketch.

26
00:01:32.484 --> 00:01:36.745
This is gonna give us a sort of consistent
framework for all of our sketches,

27
00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:38.952
all of our demos to sort of live within.

28
00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:43.717
It's gonna be really useful for
exporting mp4, mp4 files, Gifs,

29
00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:47.433
high resolution prints,
like a high resolution PNG,

30
00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:50.852
bringing in modules of code,
requiring things.

31
00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:54.494
And then actually just having
this like running locally so

32
00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:57.777
that we can really quickly code and
see the results.

33
00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:00.024
And then lastly,
we're gonna be using Three.js,

34
00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.178
which is gonna sort of
wrap everything together.

35
00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:07.193
This is a very high level engine
that sits atop WebGL and GLSL.

36
00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:13.248
And that's gonna be sort of the, the
engine that we use for all the 3D stuff.

37
00:02:13.248 --> 00:02:15.051
It's not the only engine in JavaScript.

38
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.541
We'll talk a little bit
about some other options.

39
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.780
But for today,
it's it's gonna be a good starting point.

40
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.612
And the nice thing about Three.js is that
it's really good for doing basic stuff,

41
00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:29.822
but it also gives you all the features
that you need if you wanna dive in and

42
00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:31.780
do really complex stuff as well.
