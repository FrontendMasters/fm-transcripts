00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.770
Okay, now, we've got a scene with lots of
helpers, you can always comment those out.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.490
One other thing that you
might wanna do is, or

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.630
let's say I'll leave them there for now,
you can leave them in, it's up to you.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.700
One thing that you might
also wanna do is let's say,

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.370
if we think about sort of the sun,
I mean, this is not at all accurate, but

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.510
let's say we're looking at this.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.940
And what we really want is more like
this light to orbit around as well.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.017
So we can just do what
we were doing before,

9
00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:32.327
which is instead of adding
things to the scene,

10
00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:36.456
we could say maybe adding the light to the
moonGroup and see how that changes things.

11
00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:41.329
And now,
we're gonna get something more like that.

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.620
Or you might want it,
maybe add a light with its own group and

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.140
rotate that group independently.

14
00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.770
If you want it to get really
accurate with like the solar system,

15
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.370
you have to look into things like
rotations, speed, and positions.

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.800
But the nice thing here is because we're
just working with this world units,

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.440
which are arbitrary units,
they're not pixels.

18
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.893
You could potentially say, okay, my Earth,
let's say what is the radius of the Earth?

19
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.049
It's this many miles, so

20
00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.490
you could potentially work
entirely in miles for your units.

21
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.162
And when you create your mesh here,
so your new mesh for

22
00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:28.445
the Earth, you could still use
geometry as a scale of one which

23
00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:33.241
is the default scale when we
create a new geometry here.

24
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:38.180
But we could also say mesh.scale.setScalar
and we could paste this in,

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.885
which is the the number of miles.

26
00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:44.390
But then all of our other units,
things like the size of the moon,

27
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.770
the position of the moon,
they would also have to be in miles.

28
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.790
So this is just to say that the units in
Three.js, they're arbitrary, it's not

29
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.390
necessarily pixels or anything like that,
it's actually whatever units you want.

30
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.240
So typically, we work in meters,
that's like a pretty common thing.

31
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.880
Or if we're just doing
these little sketches,

32
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.470
we just work in these arbitrary sort
of normalized range around zero to one,

33
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.700
where zero would be really small one
would be sort of a default size, and

34
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.880
anything above one is just
larger than the default size.

35
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.340
So if you wanted to make a game,
I would work with a specific unit.

36
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.045
So I would start working in meters,
let's say.

37
00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:24.370
And then when you make a 3D model,
let's say of a coffee cup,

38
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.740
you can measure this out exactly, you
can say it's this many centimeters high.

39
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.909
And because it's this
many centimeters high,

40
00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.521
I'm gonna set the mesh to be
this many centimeters high.

41
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:37.436
And maybe I'll have to place it in
the scene and if I just place it in

42
00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:42.660
the origin, it might get cut off just like
our spheres getting cut off by the axis.

43
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.940
So you might have to move it up exactly so
many centimeters.

44
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.160
So that's just all to say that
the units can be in meters, or

45
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.310
it can be in miles, or it can be in
whatever unit you want to work in.

46
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.530
And so, yeah,
if you wanted to make a solar system,

47
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.710
you could basically just take all
these numbers, plug them in, and

48
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.570
you'd end up having to scroll lots because
the distances between these plants

49
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.980
are gonna be huge but
that could be kind of fun.
