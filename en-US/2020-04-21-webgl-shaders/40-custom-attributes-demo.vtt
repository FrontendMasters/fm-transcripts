00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.477
This demo is page.

2
00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:06.310
I mean, I didn't end up going through
each and every single one of these.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.400
But a lot of what we did
is gonna be within these.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.810
Probably the biggest confusing
one is going to be this last one.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.450
So this one is a little bit more advanced.

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.840
But it's similar to what we are doing but

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.440
what we're doing in this demo is
we're using a buffer geometry.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.060
So, instead of just saying a quasi
hedron geometry, you can always put

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.790
buffer in between and that's going to make
it a buffer geometry which is, remember

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.050
the difference with the regular geometry,
all the vertices are defined as vector 3s.

11
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.103
But with the buffer geometry,
all the vertices and

12
00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:53.862
the vertex data is defined as flat arrays
of just x, y, z, x, y, z, x, y, z.

13
00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:58.574
And with this,
we can actually use the flat arrays but

14
00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:02.350
then add in additional attributes.

15
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.920
So in this case,
I'm adding in a random vector and

16
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.400
then in my shader,
I'm able to access these attributes.

17
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.320
So here I'm adding an attribute for
direction, and

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.360
adding an attribute for strength.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420
And then in my vertex shader,

20
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.230
I'm saying attribute vec3 randomDirection
attribute float randomStrength.

21
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.360
So that each of these triangles is getting
pushed out in a random direction and

22
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.340
with a random strength.

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.726
And so this demo is definitely
a little bit more advanced but

24
00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:35.602
it's sort of building on the same
stuff we've been talking about.
