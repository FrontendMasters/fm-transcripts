WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.740
At one point, we had a question
about how do you take your app and

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.520
maybe put it into a web view on iOS.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.230
So this is a bit unrelated to Shaders and
WebGL,

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.670
but you could do this to take advantage
of some of the native extensions.

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.260
So this is maybe one of the ways in which
you could use something like ARKit and

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.080
start to do 3D AR stuff using 3GS for
the rendering but

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.370
using a ARKit on the iOS for
some of the placement.

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.950
So there is a framework called Ionic.

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.150
And there's other frameworks like this but

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.880
this is a this is one that's got
a lot of traction behind it.

11
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.340
And it's basically it allows you to build
out these HTML and JavaScript apps, and

12
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.060
then deploy those onto an iOS or Android
phone, using this WebView under the hood.

13
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.220
There's another one called Ejecta.

14
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.950
This one's pretty nice because what it
does is actually it translates a lot of

15
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.010
the WebGL into native OpenGL on the iOS.

16
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.640
And so you end up with a WebGL scene, like
the scene that we've been working on here.

17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.220
But when it transpires into iOS,

18
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.245
it's actually using native OpenGL calls
and so it's super, super performance.

19
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.880
The downside is that you can't do
things like sound or things like that.

20
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.290
Actually, you can do sound but
you can't do things like Dom's and CSS.

21
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.120
So it's a bit limited, but
it's also pretty useful.

22
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.010
That's Ejecta.

23
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.625
Thanks so much.

24
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:45.600
