00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.134
Okay, so far we have this,

2
00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:06.371
a couple little things came up
just in the last few minutes.

3
00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:10.432
So one of the things is let's say we have
this light and it's in our scene, but

4
00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:13.244
we can't really see where
the light is placed, and so

5
00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.200
we wanted to move this light around.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.767
We're gonna just have to like kinda
start messing with these numbers,

7
00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.436
it starts to get a bit confusing.

8
00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:25.018
You're like trying to reason about where
it is, well, there's a thing called point

9
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:28.345
light helper, in three.js,
that we can use just like this.

10
00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:33.631
We're gonna do scene.addnew
THREE.PointLightHelper,

11
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.433
we're gonna pass in the light.

12
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.861
And, what that's gonna do,
is wherever the light is in the scene,

13
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:45.148
it's gonna draw this huge sort of,
shape this wireframe shape.

14
00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:48.940
And actually it's a little bit huge right
now because it's default size of one,

15
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.251
so let's make it a bit
smaller by saying 0.1.

16
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:56.913
That's the second argument there
is the size of this little helper.

17
00:00:56.913 --> 00:01:01.263
And so, if we've got that now we're
gonna see a little white diamond

18
00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:03.600
wherever the point light is placed.

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.729
So now we can actually start to
position the light just as we want and

20
00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.961
we can see where it is, and we can
just get a bit more exact with that.

21
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:16.535
So there's a lot of these concepts
in Three.js called helpers,

22
00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:22.523
these helpers are usually these wireframe
things that just show us where things are,

23
00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:25.452
and it's really helpful for debugging.

24
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.898
But then for the actual production,

25
00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:31.823
you might wanna just turn those off
by commenting that out, Question?

26
00:01:31.823 --> 00:01:35.824
&gt;&gt; Is there a similar helper for
the plane or the axis lines?

27
00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there is, good question.

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.640
So let's say we're confused about
how to orient ourselves here,

29
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.695
we can say scene.add(new
THREE.GridHelper).

30
00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:51.882
And the first argument here is the size of
the grid, so if we just use 1, it would be

31
00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:55.801
almost the same size as the sphere
something, so we're gonna use maybe 5.

32
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:58.508
And then the second
argument is the divisions,

33
00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:02.498
the number of divisions in our grid,
we can leave it as the default, or

34
00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:06.371
we can make it more divided if we want
to sort of see that a bit better.

35
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:10.274
And then the third and fourth arguments
have to do with the color of the grid, so

36
00:02:10.274 --> 00:02:13.234
if you're working with a scene
that has a gray background,

37
00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:15.977
you might actually wanna
change the color of the grid.

38
00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:20.989
And so, if we actually look now,
we're seeing our world a little

39
00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.281
bit better with this grid, there's also
another let me just check the docs here,

40
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:32.867
cuz there should be also another helper
that has to do more with the axes.

41
00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:36.718
So it's called AxesHelper, so again,
just maybe keep the docs open,

42
00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:41.149
you might wanna pop this open whenever
you're lost I'm always forgetting things

43
00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.863
with the docs cuz there are so
many features here.

44
00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:49.267
But if you just copy that, we can pop that
in this as well and see how that looks.

45
00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:53.751
Yeah, question?

46
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:55.408
&gt;&gt; How do I restart my server?

47
00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:59.591
&gt;&gt; Good question, so
let's say something is wrong here,

48
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:05.376
maybe it's no longer working, what you
can do is you can open the terminal and

49
00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:09.041
hit Ctrl+C, and
that will quit the the server.

50
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.848
So that'll stop serving and if you reload,
you're gonna get like a blank page for

51
00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:13.798
this kind of thing.

52
00:03:13.798 --> 00:03:17.821
And then we're gonna wanna restart our
server by just running canvas-sketch in

53
00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:20.069
the same folder that we
were running before,

54
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.817
with the filename that we've been editing,
so it's called sketch.js.

55
00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:27.790
And you no longer need to add dash
dash new or dash dash template or

56
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.145
anything cuz those are only necessary
when scaffolding out the file.

57
00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.851
But now that it's there, we can just run
this command, and it will open back up.

58
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.206
Yeah, so
one thing I might not have mentioned, but

59
00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:45.124
when we ran all these scaffolding things,
it ended up creating this sort of

60
00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:48.970
structure of file like a package.lok,
package.json.

61
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.153
And also a node modules folder
which is gonna bring in and

62
00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:56.895
include things like Three.js or
Canvas Sketch.
