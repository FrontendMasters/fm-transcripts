WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.985
And now we're gonna actually dive into the
repository start to get familiar with some

2
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:04.717
of these tools.

3
00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:08.350
And so this is the sort of
workshop home base for today.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.982
It's under my GitHub,
mattdesl/workshop-webgl-glsl.

5
00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:19.959
And so if we open it up, mostly this
repo is just a collection of resources,

6
00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:21.304
collection links.

7
00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.944
You don't have to clone this repo,
there's not much that you're gonna gain by

8
00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:29.283
cloning this repo and
trying to run things locally here.

9
00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:34.002
We're gonna start to work locally more
in our desktop or something like that,

10
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:38.158
just starting from scratch rather
than starting from a cloned repo.

11
00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:42.632
But it goes through some guides, so
if you're not comfortable yet with command

12
00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:47.058
line, you can always go through this
guide and just sort of refresh yourself.

13
00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:51.702
It also includes some sort of
Quick Start commands that we're

14
00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:56.356
going to be using here and
there just to sort of use as a review.

15
00:00:56.356 --> 00:01:01.156
Another intro is to note in npm, so
if you haven't used Node and npm before,

16
00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:03.937
we're gonna be using
that a fair bit today.

17
00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:08.507
You wanna make sure that you have
recent version of both so version 8 or

18
00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:11.382
above of Node, version 6 and above of npm.

19
00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:18.081
Another thing that comes up quite often
is when we try to install some modules,

20
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:21.473
sometimes we're gonna get this
little error that will pop up,

21
00:01:21.473 --> 00:01:26.148
especially if you've just installed Node,
you might see some sort of access errors.

22
00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:30.330
And in this guide, there's a few
suggestions on how to troubleshoot that.

23
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.253
So if you do run into that during
the workshop, to check out this guide,

24
00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:36.246
go to the troubleshooting, and
maybe try to follow some of those steps.

25
00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:42.215
There's also a little
intro to Canvas sketch and

26
00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:46.775
we'll be talking a bit more about
Canvas sketch throughout the day.

27
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:50.582
But for those who have never
heard of it or never used it,

28
00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:53.090
the main purpose is right here.

29
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.030
The main idea of Canvas sketch is to set
up our work in a consistent structure so

30
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.838
that all the demos are gonna be
really easy to reason about.

31
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.081
We can say, okay,
this is where the renderings happen,

32
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.740
this is where the setup's happening.

33
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.071
This is where the settings for
the dimensions and the frame rate and

34
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:10.986
those kind of things is gonna happen.

35
00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:15.510
It also allows us to do
required statements from npm.

36
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.283
And it includes support for GLSL,
which is gonna be really important today.

37
00:02:19.283 --> 00:02:23.588
And then also, it's really good for
exporting PNGs and MP4s and

38
00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:25.397
GIFs and things like that.

39
00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:29.735
And so if you've already got it installed,
I would suggest reinstalling it because

40
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:33.540
I've made some updates in the last week or
two that you might not have.

41
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.436
And you can reinstall it here as we're
talking or we'll have some time to

42
00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:42.623
go through and actually install
these dependencies as well.

43
00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:43.413
But if you want,

44
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.249
you can start reinstalling it
now might take a few minutes.

45
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.879
Another guide here would
be the GLSL syntax.

46
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.755
This will be here as sort of a cheat
sheet so we can refer to this later, but

47
00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:57.090
we don't need to worry
about that right now.

48
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.430
Once we learn about GLSL and some of
the syntax, we can start to learn about

49
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.560
glsify, which is gonna allow us to
bring in modules of code from npm and

50
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.136
use those directly in our shaders
which is really powerful.

51
00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:13.826
Way of doing things like noise functions
and randomness within our shaders.

52
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.359
And so
you'll also see a lot of other links.

53
00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.411
One of the things I'm gonna be
walking through this morning is this

54
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.344
interactive book.

55
00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:27.878
It's kind of like a guidebook, but
it's also mostly just slides for

56
00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.839
me to show certain concepts.

57
00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.225
And so it's these fullscreen slides and
I'll pull them up on the screen here,

58
00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:34.369
I'll walk them through.

59
00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:39.055
But you can walk through this guidebook
on your own laptop as I'm explaining it.

60
00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:42.663
And you can work with these interactive
demos yourself and just try and

61
00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:45.917
understand interactively how
these concepts come together.

62
00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:52.968
And then there's tons of demos, so
there's a few different types of demos.

63
00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:57.475
There's some demos on glitch so for
example, here's a Canvas sketch demo.

64
00:03:57.475 --> 00:04:01.332
This is the most basic thing we can
do with Canvas sketch is just to draw

65
00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:04.004
a rectangle, and
this is all using Canvas 2D.

66
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:07.844
So if you haven't used Canvas sketch,
you might wanna just pop this open and

67
00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:09.589
try to wrap your head around this.

68
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:14.569
I'll be talking a bit more about how
this works and the idea of this, but

69
00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.567
this is the bare bones Canvas 2D version.

70
00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.711
But we're gonna be using Canvas
sketch more for, for three js demos.

71
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.941
So this other link here,

72
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:28.796
this is gonna show us quite a few
different demos around three js.

73
00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:33.837
And the nice thing here is because
this is using glitch, you can open

74
00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:39.949
up any of these links here and then you'll
be able to see the code, see it running.

75
00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.295
So let's say you open up
a link like this and glitch,

76
00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:48.009
you can then click the Show button and
click Next the code and all of a sudden

77
00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.596
you can have something that should
show on the right here once it loads.

78
00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:03.001
There we go.

79
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:07.224
So yeah, you can click Show next
to the code or in a new window and

80
00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:10.507
then you can also remix
this on your own account.

81
00:05:10.507 --> 00:05:14.966
So you can just click the link at
the top left remix projects or

82
00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:20.753
there might be a button here to remix
the project and you can edit it, tweak it.

83
00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:24.732
We're gonna be mostly using
this as a sort of reference, so

84
00:05:24.732 --> 00:05:29.681
it'll be there if you need to remind
yourself of how to do certain things.

85
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:33.420
It'll be here as the way of copy paste
some certain functionality into our

86
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.972
own work.

87
00:05:33.972 --> 00:05:38.453
Occasionally, I'll go in and I'll actually
edit some of these files, but mostly,

88
00:05:38.453 --> 00:05:40.461
I'd like to work with the local code.

89
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:44.688
So stuff that's running through terminal,
stuff that's running through Canvas

90
00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:49.165
sketch locally, because that will allow us
to do things like exporting PNGs and MP4s.

91
00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:51.911
You can't really do that on the web so
easily.

92
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:58.207
And it'll also allow us to import things
from npm, which we can't really do here.

93
00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:03.697
But yeah, these are some of the demos,
we'll sort of walk through them as we go.

94
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:07.366
We might not get through each and
every single one individually, but some of

95
00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:11.681
the concepts we're gonna be talking about,
we'll cover many of these types of things.

96
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:15.054
So we'll hopefully get
through almost all of it.

97
00:06:15.054 --> 00:06:21.013
There's some other demos here in the repo,
and these are again, more reference.

98
00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.304
So this is here as a reference, but

99
00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:27.337
we're gonna be trying to create
some of these from scratch.

100
00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:32.193
In the tools and prerequisites section,
you can see this link.

101
00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:35.755
See here on how to install it,
it’s also the same link up here,

102
00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:37.191
intro to Canvas sketch.

103
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.165
And then running locally are Quick Start.

104
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:46.680
There we go, running locally
inside the Canvas sketch guide.

105
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.404
And so,
if you’re lost you can refer to this.

106
00:06:49.404 --> 00:06:52.980
But let’s try and create a very bare
bones sketch just to start off and

107
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.494
we’re gonna create it on our desktop,
or in our Downloads folder or

108
00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:58.177
Documents folder, whatever.

109
00:06:58.177 --> 00:07:02.522
I’m going to go to my
desktop in my terminal.

110
00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:07.303
And then I’m going to start by installing
the command line globally with the command

111
00:07:07.303 --> 00:07:07.985
line tool.

112
00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:14.262
So it’s npm install canvas-sketch-cli,
make sure the cli is there.

113
00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:18.835
And then --global and
this might take a couple minutes.

114
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:22.885
And so once it's installed,
or as it's installing,

115
00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:26.154
you can create a new
folder on your desktop.

116
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.966
Let's just call this webgl,

117
00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:34.239
we can just call it webgl for now.

118
00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:39.089
And then we're gonna cd into webgl and
so now we're inside this folder.

119
00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:43.787
And we're gonna just start
with a simple three js scene.

120
00:07:43.787 --> 00:07:45.196
Three js setup.

121
00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:51.124
So we're gonna write canvas-sketch because
now that we've installed it globally,

122
00:07:51.124 --> 00:07:53.328
we should be able to just run it.

123
00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:59.033
And we're gonna say, canvas-sketch and
let's call it our files sketch.js.

124
00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:03.447
So the first argument here is
the file name that we wanna edit and

125
00:08:03.447 --> 00:08:06.879
then we're gonna pass in
these arguments here.

126
00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:13.167
We're going to say --new space and
then --template = 3.

127
00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:18.044
And so this is the command that we can
use to scaffold out a new three js.

128
00:08:18.044 --> 00:08:23.110
Project or new three demo or
artwork or whatever you're building

129
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.360
the --new is going to create a new
file in the --template is going

130
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.449
to use the three js template
instead of the default 2D template.

131
00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:37.866
And so if it runs correctly,
you should have this kind of a message and

132
00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:42.988
you should be able to open this link or
open local host 9966 in your browser.

133
00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:45.510
And actually see a 3D object of some kind.
