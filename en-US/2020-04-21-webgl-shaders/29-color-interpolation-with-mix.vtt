00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.634
Okay, so this is not exactly but
we're learning a little bit more

2
00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:09.798
about some of these circles and
how to draw circles in a shader.

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.353
One other thing we'd like to do here is
maybe instead of using black and white,

4
00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:18.335
we would like to introduce some color.

5
00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:22.070
And in order to do that, we can use
another built in function called mix.

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.360
So, what we're gonna do is we
already have a color uniform here.

7
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.900
We're gonna say we want it to be
the red color, or the pink color,

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.990
whatever the color is of our cube that
we wanna define down in JavaScript.

9
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.930
We're gonna use that color, where all
the black is, and then we're gonna

10
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.580
modulate the color towards some
other color where all the weight is.

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.060
So, down here once we define our mask,
we're going to create a new vec three.

12
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.420
Let's call it fragColor just like this.

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.770
We're going to say
the fragColor is equal to mix.

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.370
Whatever color you want to
replace the black with, so

15
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.530
let's say we're going to use color,
which is the uniform.

16
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.250
And then the next one is whatever
the circle color should be,

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.240
let's say, just leave it as white for now.

18
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.520
And then we're going to use the mask value

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.210
to interpolate from the first
parameter to the second parameter.

20
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.170
And I'll explain that in just a second.

21
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.840
But for now we can try putting
this value in to the frag color,

22
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.720
the final frag color.

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.821
And one of the things you
might see is just pure white.

24
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.870
And that's probably because the color
in JavaScript might just be pure white.

25
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.210
So I'm gonna change this to a different
color, tomato, or pink or red.

26
00:01:43.823 --> 00:01:49.690
And so what this is doing is it's saying
I want to mix from this first parameter,

27
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.160
which is the the color in JavaScript.

28
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.620
And I want to interpolate or
I wanna switch the value towards

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.870
this second parameter which is white,
based on this value here.

30
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.690
So, when this value is zero,
it's gonna use the first parameter.

31
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.400
When this value is 1, it's gonna use
the second parameter which is white.

32
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.270
That's why I can't see anything.

33
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.197
When this value is exactly in between
0 and 1, it's going to use some sort

34
00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:21.200
of blended version between
the color in between pure white.

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.782
And so this is called interpolation, or

36
00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:25.480
linear interpolation actually
is what it's called.

37
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.670
So we're interpolating from
A to B using the mask value.

38
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.790
Because the mask value is also between
zero and the mask value is zero.

39
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.890
When we're outside or

40
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.560
inside of the circle depending on
whether we have it inverted or not.

41
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.640
And then it's one, on the other side.
