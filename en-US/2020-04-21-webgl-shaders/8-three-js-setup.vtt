WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.645
So why don't we start with
a simple exercise here.

2
00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:07.905
We're going to take this idea
that we've already started with.

3
00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.360
We have a sphere.
We're gonna add some texture to it.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.118
We're gonna make maybe
an orbiting moon around an earth.

5
00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:18.430
And we're gonna learn a little bit
about how to set up our scenes,

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.190
how to set up our camera and
controls and things like that.

7
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.000
And then also how to do
some basic texturing.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.820
And you'll see this is gonna be very
similar to the first three demos.

9
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.380
So the concepts I'm about to show
are very similar to this mesh demo,

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.530
very similar to the meshes which
just shows multiple meshes.

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.820
And then very similar to groups,
which we're going to be doing.

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.740
But we're gonna do it in a more fun
exercise using Canvas sketch locally and

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.690
bringing some images and

14
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.460
things like that rather than
just blank doing plain circles.

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.087
So to start of,
let's just pop on our sketch,

16
00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:54.714
we can set the settings
to some default value,

17
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:59.610
just clear the settings back
to how it was when we started.

18
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.840
So just make it so that anime is true and

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.620
context is set to WebGL which
is gonna allow us to use WebGL.

20
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.980
And then let's just walk
through this a little bit.

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.160
So we have a render,
which is gonna allow us to render things.

22
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.450
This is the sort of bulk
of the three.JS engine.

23
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.160
We have to make sure we pass
the same Canvas we're working with

24
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.290
from Canvas sketching, and
then we can change the background color.

25
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.314
Let's use black.

26
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:30.620
And this next bit here has
to do with the camera.

27
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.020
And so camera, we define this with
a field of view, which is in degrees.

28
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.610
And so this first parameter, usually you
would use some value maybe between 30, or

29
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.490
70, or 75, or 80, or something like that.

30
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.890
The higher the value the more
it's going to get stretched out.

31
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.550
But the more you'll start to notice some
distortion sometimes around the edges.

32
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.200
So I like to stick around 50,
or 45, or around there.

33
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.360
And then this next value here is aspect
ratio, which we can leave it as one for

34
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.470
now because we're going to update
it when the scene resizes.

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.000
And then we have the near and far values
and this is gonna clip the object

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.830
based on how close it is the camera or
how far away it is to the camera.

37
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.770
So if you remember in,
if you've ever played a 3D game,

38
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.410
you might see these distant mountains and
the mountains might sort of disappear

39
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.530
after a while or
as you go far enough away from a tree or

40
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.030
something like that all of
a sudden the tree disappears.

41
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.730
That's getting clipped by the far plane.

42
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.770
And so if I was to use a low number here,
we might not see our sphere.

43
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.370
So we have to make sure that
these numbers are high enough so

44
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.600
that they don't clip our scene.

45
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.290
So you just use 500 or 100 or
something like that for now.

46
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.230
And then this is the same concept,
the near is the same concept, but

47
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.910
it has to do with how close we are.

48
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.540
So eventually you'll see
when I'm zooming in here,

49
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.240
these front lines disappear and
that has to do with the near clipping.

50
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.920
So the larger this number
the more likely we're gonna

51
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.570
clip earlier on as we start to zoom in.

52
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.470
So just so you keep in mind but
we can leave it at the default for now.

53
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.340
And then the position,
we set the position of the camera.

54
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.950
So right now we're setting it to
be negative four in the z-axis so

55
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.780
that we can just look
directly at the sphere.

56
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.840
If we don't have this, it starts at 000,
which is actually pretty useful sometimes,

57
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.500
but right now, that's not what we want.

58
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.550
So we move that back so

59
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.510
we can see the sphere and
then we look the camera at the center.

60
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.770
This line here just says look
at the origin of the world,

61
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.600
and you can try tweaking this to sort
of raise the camera a little bit and

62
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.690
maybe offset it on the x-axis as well.

63
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.980
This next bit here has
to do with controls.

64
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.020
So this is where we add
in the interactivity, so

65
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.270
the ability to click and drag.

66
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.740
If you want, you can take all these
control references, comment them out, and

67
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.910
no loner will you see the interactive.

68
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.430
But that might be useful if you’re
creating just an animation that

69
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.100
runs on its own.

70
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.200
You don’t want it to be interactive so
you might want to take out these controls.

71
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.620
Or you might want to
use different controls.

72
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.790
Like first person controls or
track ball controls.

73
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.989
Or some sort of other controls.

74
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.280
These controls are part of
an extension of three.js.

75
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.900
They are required right
up here in the top.

76
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.187
And this is how we can require different
things from the three.js examples.

77
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.200
So if I keep scrolling down we've
got our scene, just a plain object.

78
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.820
We have some geometry which is the sphere.

79
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.680
And then we have a material which
is just a wireframe red material,

80
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.500
we can turn off wireframe to
make it a bit more obvious.

81
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.420
Or we could set this to another
material like mesh normal material.

82
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.650
And with mesh normal material you
don't need to specify a color.

83
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.680
But you could specify flat shading true
and then you have this, let's scene now.

84
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.680
And then finally we just
add the mesh to the scene.

85
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.120
We create the mesh and add to the scene.

86
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.200
And this last bit here we don't need
to worry so much about this right now.

87
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.720
This is just a resizing the camera,
resizing the render, and

88
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.060
then actually updating the controls and
dispatching this render call,

89
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.130
which is gonna actually create.

90
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.800
It's going to take our scene, It's going
to take our camera, combine those two

91
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.750
things to actually create this image
that we're seeing in our browser.
