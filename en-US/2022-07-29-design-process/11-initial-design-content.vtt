1
00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:04.020
Let's move on and start getting into some
of the nitty gritty cuz we've been very

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.720
much at 30,000 feet so far.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.160
And I think it'd be helpful to get into
producing that initial design, right?

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.920
Sooner or later,
you got to produce the design concept and

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.767
actually start visualizing some of
this stuff and yeah that can be fun.

6
00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:26.569
So let's start by looking at
some techniques to keep in mind

7
00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.363
when you're designing, right?

8
00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.808
And this is to avoid,
remember what we're trying to avoid?

9
00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:36.714
We're trying to avoid scope creep,
we're trying to avoid kind of

10
00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:42.328
people's subjective opinions and
we're trying to avoid iteration hell.

11
00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:45.055
Those are the key things that
we're trying to get around.

12
00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:50.166
So what can we do as we do design to
avoid some of those things happening?

13
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.979
Well, first thing we can do
is involve the client, right?

14
00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.726
And I said earlier about how this is
somewhat counterintuitive that we wanna

15
00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:58.789
exclude the client.

16
00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.185
And so we tend to isolate them from
the process of fear that they're gonna

17
00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.432
interfere in the design in some way.

18
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.527
However this is really big mistake,

19
00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:12.337
stakeholders are more likely to reject a
design if they haven't contributed to it.

20
00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:15.628
And that big reveal can turn
into an uncomfortable surprise.

21
00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:18.662
So we wanna get them involved,
point one to remember.

22
00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:26.985
Point two is we wanna separate out
the two elements of design, right?

23
00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:32.479
Element one is the aesthetics,
the visual appearance, things like color,

24
00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.324
typography, styling, imagery, that kind
of thing and the structure, right?

25
00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:40.300
The layout, the navigation,

26
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.936
those kinds of things because one of
the things I've observed over the so

27
00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:49.504
many years that I've been doing this and
I see this time and time again.

28
00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:53.744
Is a stakeholder can reject
an entire design because they

29
00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:57.467
personally don't like the aesthetics,
right?

30
00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.858
I don't like the color so
therefore this design is rubbish.

31
00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:04.610
Well, no, that's not right,
there's a singular issue here.

32
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.690
So by approaching the aesthetics and
the structure separately,

33
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.767
you focus the client or
stakeholder on one thing at a time, rather

34
00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:21.163
than letting them get bogged down with,
get mixing up those different elements.

35
00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:23.984
So I'll show you how to do
these things in a minute but

36
00:02:23.984 --> 00:02:27.145
I just want to lay the principles and
set them in your mind.

37
00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:29.725
And the third one is to
work with real content.

38
00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.481
Going back to the question
that was asked earlier,

39
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.798
you cannot separate design from content.

40
00:02:34.798 --> 00:02:38.324
The design process should
begin with the content,

41
00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:43.654
in terms of how it's organized and
how we users can easily access it, right?

42
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.874
We should always be working with
actual content, not Lorem Ipsum.

43
00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:52.672
That doesn't mean final content,
but it does mean something, right?

44
00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:58.165
So those are some techniques to keep
in mind as we move through things.

45
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:01.463
So how do we start that design process?

46
00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:08.090
Because the temptation is let's open Figma
and really very, very bad idea, right?

47
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.133
In most situations, you don't wanna
start with Figma, so where do you start?

48
00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:19.269
Well, you start by making the content
findable with good navigation.

49
00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.420
Now I wanna clarify the word content
here so that I don't fall into

50
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.114
the same trap as I've been doing with
using the word website all the time.

51
00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:33.490
Content in my mind does also
encompass functionality, right?

52
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.323
Content can be words or
it can be functions.

53
00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:40.445
In other words, it can answer questions or
enable tasks, all right?

54
00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.903
So just to clarify that.

55
00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:48.672
So really, the first thing you need to
be starting with is that content to

56
00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:54.077
make it findable to organize it in
a way that makes sense to the user.

57
00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:58.779
You can't design anything until
you've got an understanding

58
00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.893
about how the site is gonna be navigated.

59
00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:02.721
And to be honest,

60
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:05.555
have a good understanding of
what the content is going to be.

61
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:13.547
So this goes back to the question,
we were dealing with of,

62
00:04:13.547 --> 00:04:19.098
well, hang on a minute,
I'm not a copywriter.

63
00:04:19.098 --> 00:04:20.837
How am I supposed to do this bit?

64
00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:24.705
Well, obviously, if you can get
your content creator involved,

65
00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:27.133
that's amazing and definitely do that.

66
00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:31.614
But you'll be surprised at how much
you can do even if you're not actually

67
00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:36.398
a copywriter because don't forget
you're not creating final content here.

68
00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:39.953
First of all, you can identify
what content is needed, right?

69
00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:44.270
You can identify what different types of
content needs to appear on the website.

70
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.358
Whether that be some functional thing,

71
00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:54.022
an interactive map or
an event system or whatever it be.

72
00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:56.677
Or alternatively written content.

73
00:04:56.677 --> 00:05:01.603
What questions the users need answering
for them about this product or service?

74
00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:05.692
What's its benefits, what value does
it provide, those kinds of things.

75
00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:11.234
So and that can include everything from
how the products are described to whether

76
00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:16.545
there's gonna be blog posts on it,
what features, benefits, questions.

77
00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:19.289
All the things you can identify.

78
00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.675
And that's really your starting point,

79
00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:24.408
is just identify what
needs to be in this thing.

80
00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:27.171
Then you can start structuring it.

81
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:30.247
So content needs to be structured
into some kind of hierarchy,

82
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:34.076
some way of navigating around it that
enables users to quickly find the content

83
00:05:34.076 --> 00:05:35.077
that they require.

84
00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:37.143
So that's the second step.

85
00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:38.686
We haven't opened Figma yet.

86
00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:40.892
We've not thought about colors or
type or anything.

87
00:05:40.892 --> 00:05:45.747
We're just focusing at the minute on
the fundamentals of how this thing is

88
00:05:45.747 --> 00:05:48.582
gonna operate and
then we need to draft it.

89
00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:52.548
We need to, you know don't wait for
your stakeholders to deliver content for

90
00:05:52.548 --> 00:05:54.451
templates that you then prototype.

91
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:57.704
Just draft some initial copy
that deals with some of these

92
00:05:57.704 --> 00:05:59.546
different things themselves.

93
00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:03.475
Or how this functionality will work, etc.

94
00:06:03.475 --> 00:06:10.773
Now let's talk a little bit more about
drafting the copy or the content.

95
00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:14.501
Now if that content is functionality
that's not too painful.

96
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:18.667
You're usually writing a little bit of
micro copy and things like that and,

97
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.501
again, it can be changed later.

98
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:25.257
If you're getting into more of the kind
of marketing content territory

99
00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:28.042
then that feels much more overwhelming.

100
00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:31.850
Cuz that's a lot more difficult and
you have to agree on things like

101
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.872
a value proposition, for crying out loud,
whatever one of those is.

102
00:06:35.872 --> 00:06:40.266
And really this ideally does
need doing in collaboration

103
00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:45.034
with the stakeholders,
you'll find it a lot easier to do it.

104
00:06:45.034 --> 00:06:49.653
But again, I'm a great fan of just
having a go at it yourself because when

105
00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:52.231
you show marketers something rubbish,

106
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:56.195
then suddenly you'll find that
they start doing their work.

107
00:06:56.195 --> 00:07:00.349
So [LAUGH] there is something to be
said from having to go in it yourself.

108
00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.637
But so something like a value
proposition is strapline,

109
00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.317
summary of what the company does and

110
00:07:07.317 --> 00:07:12.067
don't be afraid if they've got
a rubbish strapline, right?

111
00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:15.773
Which doesn't actually explain whatever
this thing is that you're doing.

112
00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:17.929
Change it, see what happens.

113
00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:22.654
They'll only change it back,
getting into the benefits,

114
00:07:22.654 --> 00:07:25.307
how does this thing help people?

115
00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:28.495
Why would they wanna buy it,
what do they wanna do on it, etc.

116
00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:31.397
And then the features of,
what does that actually do?

117
00:07:31.397 --> 00:07:37.098
And that formula applies whether
you're doing a marketing site or

118
00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:41.793
even if you're talking about a web app or
a mobile app.

119
00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:47.954
You still need to in a single line
explain what this thing does, right?

120
00:07:47.954 --> 00:07:50.414
You still need to say how
it's gonna help people.

121
00:07:50.414 --> 00:07:52.811
And you still need to say
what features it's got.

122
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:57.471
So whether you're doing a web app,
whether you're doing a marketing site,

123
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.491
this kind of stuff is necessary.

124
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:05.931
Now with the kind of micro projects you're
talking about, then isn't relevant to you.

125
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:11.231
You can pretty much,
it's a lot less of a thing, yeah.

126
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:13.574
&gt;&gt; We have a question about the content.

127
00:08:13.574 --> 00:08:18.608
Sometimes we deal with
content that is not fixed.

128
00:08:18.608 --> 00:08:22.461
Meaning when you're talking
about translations.

129
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.638
&gt;&gt; Yes.

130
00:08:23.638 --> 00:08:28.033
&gt;&gt; A sentence in English could
be three sentences in Spanish.

131
00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:29.810
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.

132
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.075
&gt;&gt; How do you deal with that?

133
00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:37.393
&gt;&gt; That is a big issue.

134
00:08:37.393 --> 00:08:40.535
I do a lot in Europe.

135
00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:43.394
And German is like a hobby.

136
00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:49.489
Even an individual word can wrap on to
a second line if you're not careful,

137
00:08:49.489 --> 00:08:51.244
it's a big problem.

138
00:08:51.244 --> 00:08:53.945
In those kinds of situations,
you've got to design for

139
00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:55.621
the worst case scenario, right?

140
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:58.813
So in a scenario like that I would
actually start with the German.

141
00:08:58.813 --> 00:09:04.189
Because I know the German is gonna be
longer and then kind of work backwards.

142
00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.302
That said, it is a nuanced thing,

143
00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:14.283
interfaces do need to change for
multiple languages sometimes.

144
00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.201
It's a huge area.

145
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.940
So for example, I mean in your situation,

146
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.138
I imagine you're only dealing
with English and Spanish, yeah?

147
00:09:23.138 --> 00:09:27.966
But sometimes, you get into situations of
dealing with languages that read right to

148
00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:29.870
left rather than left to right and

149
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.216
that fundamentally alters the design and
the interface.

150
00:09:33.216 --> 00:09:36.312
So in your situation my
advice is start with,

151
00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:40.799
if you know Spanish is gonna be longer,
work with Spanish first.

152
00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:43.520
But yeah, I mean, it's a difficult area,

153
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.507
there's no magic answers I can
give you on that one I'm afraid.

154
00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:51.182
Are there any more questions in the chat
while we're paused for a second?

155
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.931
No, I'll keep going then.

156
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.841
One of the the other big things in content
that I think I would encourage you to

157
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:04.002
start thinking about almost on
behalf of the content creators.

158
00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:08.518
Because you don't always get
access to them early enough,

159
00:10:08.518 --> 00:10:12.233
is actually questions,
objections and tasks.

160
00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:16.766
So in the kind of discovery
phase that I talked about,

161
00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:19.485
one of the things I always try and

162
00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:24.554
explore is this idea of questions,
objections and tasks.

163
00:10:24.554 --> 00:10:26.952
What do people want to know?

164
00:10:26.952 --> 00:10:31.033
What do they want to do and
what are they worried about, right?

165
00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:35.705
Cuz your content needs to be
able to adjust for those things.

166
00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:40.941
And actually, that basic principle applies
whether you're doing a marketing site,

167
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:43.822
or whether you're doing
your little updates.

168
00:10:43.822 --> 00:10:45.869
Things like, for example,

169
00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:51.000
an individual question on a form
field might throw up some objections.

170
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.974
Can I trust these people with my
email address is a classic example.

171
00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:57.839
Or why are they asking for
my date of birth?

172
00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:01.684
Or obviously,
it might have associated tasks or

173
00:11:01.684 --> 00:11:07.330
I've got to get my credit card cuz I
need to enter my credit card number.

174
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.771
All right, now they're gonna walk away,
is it gonna timeout while I do that?

175
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:14.712
Knowing those constitutional tasks that
go alongside it is really important.

176
00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:17.075
And then answering questions
that they might have.

177
00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:19.870
For example, a great example,

178
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.778
I said I was doing a pet plan websites,
insurance for pets earlier.

179
00:11:25.778 --> 00:11:30.878
And one of the questions that came up
was I don't know my pet's specific

180
00:11:30.878 --> 00:11:35.474
date of birth, is it enough to
put month and year in, all right?

181
00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:38.701
So all of those kinds of things
you kinda need to know beforehand.

182
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.704
And that's part of what your
discovery phase needs to be about.

183
00:11:41.704 --> 00:11:45.476
And then when you move into prototype and
you need to make sure that any content you

184
00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:48.436
put in actually does address
these kinds of different issues.

185
00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:53.091
So it does need to address all
of these different areas, so

186
00:11:53.091 --> 00:11:57.184
how do you go about collecting that stuff,
right?

187
00:11:57.184 --> 00:12:01.048
You obviously,
you can make some educated guesses but

188
00:12:01.048 --> 00:12:05.921
it'd be nice to be a bit more informed,
presuming budget allows it.

189
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.161
So I often speak to sales and

190
00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:13.527
people within the sales team if
I'm working on a marketing site.

191
00:12:13.527 --> 00:12:16.235
For example, if they've got a sales team,
I tend to talk to

192
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:19.828
them because they're the ones that
are talking to customers on a daily basis.

193
00:12:19.828 --> 00:12:22.367
They know the objections
that customers have got,

194
00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.440
they know what questions they ask, etc.

195
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.723
And the same is true if you've
got a customer service team.

196
00:12:26.723 --> 00:12:32.017
So in your example, in your company, they
will be getting calls all the time about,

197
00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:34.417
I didn't know to do this on the website or

198
00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:37.048
I didn't know how to do
that on the website.

199
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.001
Talk to those people, right?

200
00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:42.253
Because they're full of insights
into what people are stumbling over,

201
00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:45.841
what questions they have, what objections
they've got, that kind of stuff.

202
00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:50.668
You could also look at the search terms
people use sometimes on your website,

203
00:12:50.668 --> 00:12:53.723
that can be pretty enlightening for
questions.

204
00:12:53.723 --> 00:12:57.932
Ask users, it's not rocket science
that you speak to some users,

205
00:12:57.932 --> 00:13:02.308
perhaps little survey or
something like that can be really helpful.

206
00:13:02.308 --> 00:13:05.183
Sometimes I will just look at
social media feeds, right?

207
00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:07.742
Who's following you guys on social media?

208
00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:10.892
Go and
have a look at their their content and

209
00:13:10.892 --> 00:13:16.332
what questions they're asking there,
what comments they're making.

210
00:13:16.332 --> 00:13:19.572
But the one thing that I
probably do the most is,

211
00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:23.139
I actually just run a question and
answer workshop.

212
00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:26.757
If I've not got a lot of time and
a lot of money, I'll just try and

213
00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:31.403
get some stakeholders that have regular
contact with the user together in a room.

214
00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:33.611
And we just brainstorm
a load of questions and

215
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:37.226
their associated answers just to get
people thinking about the content.

216
00:13:37.226 --> 00:13:40.284
It can be quite a challenging area and
you can feel like, well,

217
00:13:40.284 --> 00:13:41.681
that's not really design.

218
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:44.820
That's the client's problem or
that's the stakeholders problem.

219
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.516
But in truth, I don't think we can kind
of separate it out that easily and

220
00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:52.100
you kinda need to know these things
in order to be able to do the design.
