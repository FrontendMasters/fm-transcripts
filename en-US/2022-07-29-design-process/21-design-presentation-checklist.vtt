00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.600
First of all,
prepare that video presentation up front.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.164
Please do that, please try it just once.

3
00:00:05.164 --> 00:00:08.084
I promise you, it will be worth it.

4
00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:12.481
It's one of the best pieces of advice
in my opinion at this entire course.

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.028
So definitely give it a go.

6
00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:17.760
Second, brainstorm those objections and
possible answers, right?

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.487
So what people likely to come back with,
and what are they likely to ask you and

8
00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:24.840
try and preempt those, if possible.

9
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.320
Attempt to speak to those stakeholders
individually before you present to

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.603
the group, so
you can appeal to their selfish gene and

11
00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:33.700
whatever it is that
they're trying to achieve.

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.354
When you're presenting, heavily reference
that previous work that you've done.

13
00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:45.303
Gather some structured feedback,
after the presentation not during but

14
00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:47.151
keep that for afterwards.

15
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:51.837
And then finally channel all
that feedback via you and

16
00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:55.806
challenge anything that you disagree with.

17
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.534
Have a conversation around it,

18
00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:01.886
don't feel you need to blindly accept
every piece of feedback that you receive.

19
00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:08.815
So that's it, that's how to do your design
presentation and hopefully that's helpful.

20
00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:13.650
Are there any questions around that
before we move into our final session?

21
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.688
I was right.

22
00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:16.184
&gt;&gt; Makes this all very clear.

23
00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:20.620
And it seems so obvious once you hear it,
yet I don't do any of those things.

24
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.349
I think this is gonna change my life and
the life of my clients.

25
00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:25.483
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

26
00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:26.802
That is so sweet.

27
00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:30.627
Thank you so much whoever said that,
that is hugely appreciated.

28
00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:34.096
That's the trouble,
I teach common sense in some ways.

29
00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:37.065
But when you're in
the middle of a project,

30
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.562
common sense goes out of the window.

31
00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:43.143
You have to be really disciplined to
remember and do all these things.

32
00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:46.838
That's why I've produced the checklist
screens that you've got here,

33
00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.518
so that you've got that nice
summary that you can go,

34
00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:52.931
okay, have I done everything,
have I prepared for this properly.

35
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:56.821
Cuz there's nothing worse than being
blindsided in the presentation or

36
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:58.480
dealing with design.

37
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.877
Cuz what happens is you end up
looking like you'll bssing.

38
00:02:02.877 --> 00:02:07.054
Somebody will come back and say, yeah,
so I really think this needs to be this

39
00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:11.167
way or that way in the design and you
come up with some reason why this isn't,

40
00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.164
it just feels like you're
making it up as you go along.

41
00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:18.181
Well, if you've kind of talked them
through this process and you justify,

42
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.780
you sound in control and
confidence is a big part of this, right?

43
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.293
It's coming across as confident
without coming across as arrogant.

44
00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:28.010
And that does take practice to get right.

45
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.680
But yeah, I went off on one then,
and I really.
