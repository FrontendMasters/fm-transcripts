00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.206
Let's talk about this better design
process, my magic design process that I've

2
00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:07.215
been building up for
the best part of 40 minutes, right?

3
00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.815
[LAUGH] Really ought to get to the point,
Paul.

4
00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:15.834
First of all,
I split my projects into multiple phases.

5
00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:19.030
Phase one is discovery, okay?

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.596
We do a short discovery phase upfront to
understand the project better before we

7
00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:24.720
jump in.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.836
Phase two is prototyping,

9
00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:31.903
where we visualize the experience
from beginning to end, okay?

10
00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:37.365
Phase three is the build, where the
developers take the design and build it.

11
00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.976
And then and
phase four is while the website is live.

12
00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:45.438
I will talk about these phases,
okay, all the time,

13
00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:49.313
from the moment I start
working with a client.

14
00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:55.013
And there is huge benefit to working
in these phases because not only

15
00:00:55.013 --> 00:01:02.090
does it ensure the design is appropriate,
it will also deal with scope creep.

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.350
It will also manage the iteration process.

17
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.987
And if you're an external person,

18
00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:14.573
it will lead to long-term
work during the live phase.

19
00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:19.143
And if you're internal, it gets your
stakeholders to think how they're

20
00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.471
gonna manage this digital
service once it goes live.

21
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:27.535
Now, the key component here is this.

22
00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:35.284
Each phase is a separate project
that defines the next, right?

23
00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:40.763
We have a tendency of going in and
thinking about these

24
00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:46.380
big projects as single
monolithic projects, right?

25
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.182
We're gonna redesign
the website from top to bottom.

26
00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:55.544
That is a ridiculously big
project to plan, right?

27
00:01:55.544 --> 00:02:01.660
Even if you work with smaller clients and
it's a relatively small project,

28
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.451
for them proportionally,
the investment is big, right?

29
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:11.271
So it's all about the level of investment
and the level of associated risk.

30
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:15.292
And let's be honest,
if I said to you, okay,

31
00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:21.894
we've got a WordPress site that's got,
I don't know, 20 templates and

32
00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:27.588
some basic functionality like
contact us and a few other things.

33
00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:32.314
And ask you to provide me with
a fixed price, you could do it,

34
00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:37.059
but it probably won't be that
accurate in reality, right?

35
00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:42.059
Because what'll happen is, well,
actually, when we said we've got some

36
00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:47.221
basic functionality, that includes
an events capability, I didn't know that.

37
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.086
So there's a lot of amorphous stuff.

38
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.966
It's very hard to accurately
price any project, and

39
00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:54.531
the bigger the project gets,
the harder it is.

40
00:02:54.531 --> 00:03:01.117
By splitting it into these phases and
having each one as a separate engagement,

41
00:03:01.117 --> 00:03:06.229
a separate project,
then in the discovery phase you can learn

42
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.866
enough to define how long it
will take you to prototype.

43
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:14.961
Not the whole rest of it, but
just that next phase, the prototype phase.

44
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:19.346
When you finish the prototype phase,
you can hand the prototype to

45
00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:24.060
the developer and go, we wanna build that,
how long will it take to do?

46
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.373
And that is a hell of a lot easier
to cost than some functional

47
00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:33.574
specification where it's easy to
misunderstand and stuff like that.

48
00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:36.572
So that will inform how
long the build will take.

49
00:03:36.572 --> 00:03:41.365
Once you've done the build, you'll be
in a good position to know what kind of

50
00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:44.258
optimization post-launch needs to be done.

51
00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:50.848
So don't go for these big projects,
break them down into distinct sections.

52
00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:55.637
So let's very quickly look at the benefits
of taking this kind of approach, for

53
00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:58.570
our stakeholders and
our clients' initially.

54
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.732
First of all, it reduces the risk, right?

55
00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:06.032
The client, if you're working
with somebody external, or

56
00:04:06.032 --> 00:04:10.587
you are external working for
clients, then it's a great way for

57
00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:14.828
them to try out the working
relationship with you, right?

58
00:04:14.828 --> 00:04:20.600
So let's say I was hiring you
guys in the room here, right?

59
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.950
And each of you represented a different
agency, and it was a redesign project.

60
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.460
You come back with 50 grand for
the project,

61
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.143
you came back with 56 grand,
you came back with 47 grand.

62
00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:43.652
And then the final person came back with
five grand for a discovery phase, okay?

63
00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:49.200
The level of risk of going with you
other people is 50 grand, right?

64
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.843
And if I work with you and I don't like
you, right, or there's a problem in

65
00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:59.620
the working relationship, I'm committed to
50 grand or 47 or whatever it was, right?

66
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.182
But if I go with the final person,
that's only gonna charge me five grand for

67
00:05:04.182 --> 00:05:07.689
the first part of the project,
then my risk is much lower.

68
00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.914
If I don't like them, if they don't
deliver, if they annoy me, right?

69
00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:14.789
I just get rid of them.

70
00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.885
So it's a really good way of
reducing risk when it comes

71
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:22.725
to talking about working
with external agencies.

72
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:27.862
But it's also good for just the overall
risk of the project, right?

73
00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:33.000
Because each phase validates
the validity of the next, right?

74
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.635
So the discovery phase basically goes,
is it worth pursuing this or

75
00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:39.589
are we gonna launch it and
it's gonna be crap, right?

76
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:43.840
Or is the technology
gonna be too difficult?

77
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.909
Are there gonna be compliance barriers
that can stop this project happening?

78
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.922
All of those wrinkles, right?

79
00:05:50.922 --> 00:05:54.621
And if it passes the discovery phase,
if it turns out to be valid,

80
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:56.721
it goes into the prototyping phase.

81
00:05:56.721 --> 00:06:00.072
And the prototyping phase
will work out whether or

82
00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:04.480
not it's gonna be accepted by
users through usability testing.

83
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.207
And if it's not and needs to change, we
can change it there in the prototype when

84
00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:11.840
it's cheap rather than once it's gone
live, when it's expensive to do so.

85
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.898
So it manages risks there.

86
00:06:13.898 --> 00:06:17.843
So basically, by breaking it down,
you can validate each stage

87
00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:21.944
without committing to one large and
potentially flawed project.

88
00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:26.781
The second is it provides
much more accurate costings.

89
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:32.338
Because each phase is fully costed,
they can be much more accurate, right?

90
00:06:32.338 --> 00:06:36.979
So you can be much more controlled
because you're just costing

91
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.493
the current stage rather
than the whole thing.

92
00:06:40.493 --> 00:06:43.820
And that means it's easier
to allocate resources,

93
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.853
it's less overspending,
that kind of thing.

94
00:06:46.853 --> 00:06:50.118
And then finally it reduces failure,
right?

95
00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:55.112
Because the project is broken into
self-contained phases, if you like,

96
00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:59.243
then each one is gonna be well researched,
well considered.

97
00:06:59.243 --> 00:07:04.869
And the chances of building something
that doesn't generate return

98
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:11.951
on investment will reduce significantly
because you're validating as you go along.

99
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:16.064
So let's look at those
different phases very quickly,

100
00:07:16.064 --> 00:07:18.520
what they are and how to run them.
