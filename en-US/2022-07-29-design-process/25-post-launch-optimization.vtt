1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.226
But the final thing I wanna talk about for

2
00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:06.977
today really is that post
launch optimization phase.

3
00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:11.585
Is the, go live phase, the live phase.

4
00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.349
And is the bit that gets,

5
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.818
it's like the ugly stepchild
that everybody tries to ignore.

6
00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:23.127
It's like people don't seem to think about
what happens when something goes live.

7
00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:31.978
And to be honest, I think that comes
from our culture as organizations and

8
00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:37.834
the way that we are structured and
we work in projects, right?

9
00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.616
And a project has a beginning,
a middle and an end.

10
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:46.910
And everything about the people
that are assigned to a project,

11
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.932
the budget that's assigned to the project,

12
00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:54.326
the timelines that a project has,
they're all finite, right?

13
00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:58.290
But digital services,
digital channels, digital apps,

14
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.154
whatever you wanna call, are not finite.

15
00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:03.417
Well, they're not gonna be
there until the sun burns out.

16
00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:08.375
But they don't end when
the project to development ends,

17
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.015
they develop well after that.

18
00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:17.488
And so thinking about what happens when
this thing first launches is really,

19
00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:21.970
really important,
both in terms of its resourcing,

20
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.730
in terms of its funding and
the rest of it.

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.877
But also in terms of its design because
no design is perfect on launch,

22
00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:35.164
no matter how much you've
tested it beforehand, right?

23
00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:39.935
Nothing beats real users
carrying out naturally into

24
00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:45.024
interactions on your website,
on your app, whatever,

25
00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:49.702
to realize what could be
improved about the design.

26
00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:53.282
You need to see real people using it
in the real world to understand what's

27
00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:54.410
working.

28
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.288
And so really that's why post
launch optimization from a design

29
00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:04.258
perspective is the single most
important phase of the project and

30
00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:08.437
yet it's the one that's
neglected the most, right?

31
00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:12.560
I've been designing for 27 years,
you think now I'd get it right every time.

32
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.088
If you did nothing else for
20, 27 years repeatedly,

33
00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:18.248
you think you get pretty good at it.

34
00:02:18.248 --> 00:02:23.233
I mean, we were hearing earlier about
Mark and his VR games that you put

35
00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:28.280
300 hours into, which I personally
I just think is obscene.

36
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.284
But by that he was getting perfect score
every time but it doesn't work like that

37
00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:36.200
with design, is variable,
it's changeable, is always different.

38
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.960
And so you never get it perfect
until you've launched it.

39
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.700
And it can make such
an enormous difference.

40
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.780
And there's such a big
business case here for

41
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.870
doing that kinda post launch optimization.

42
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.870
And what it basically comes
down to is very, very simple.

43
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.794
We watch what users do and
we learn from that, right?

44
00:02:55.794 --> 00:02:58.640
And it can make an enormous difference.

45
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.601
My all time, one of my favorite articles
is an article by Jared Spool, right?

46
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.374
Jared Spools is an amazing user
experience guy who works with some

47
00:03:09.374 --> 00:03:11.558
incredible organizations.

48
00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:16.309
And he worked on one project
where they identified a problem

49
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:20.593
on the site with the login and
registration process.

50
00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:25.197
They realized that people were dropping
out, they decided to do some testing and

51
00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:29.069
improvement and iterations,
A/B testing and that kind of thing.

52
00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.135
And through one change, they increase
the company's revenue by 300 million.

53
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:40.950
That is the power of A/B testing, that is
the power of post launch optimization.

54
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.572
Now that you might not work
on sites [LAUGH] that can

55
00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:50.091
make one change and
make 300 million extra.

56
00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:53.353
But even a more modest projects
like the kind that I work on,

57
00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:56.941
I work with one company for
five years, an e-commerce company,

58
00:03:56.941 --> 00:03:59.305
just to stand in the e-commerce company.

59
00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.125
Nothing particularly special about it,

60
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.010
they sell frozen ready
meals to old people.

61
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.318
It's not exactly sexy, I don't get to
work on sexy things like Jared does.

62
00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:12.232
But over a five year period
of optimizing their site and

63
00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:17.595
improving over time, we increased
their conversion rate a hundred fold,

64
00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:22.041
not their conversion rate,
their revenue, a hundred fold.

65
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:26.000
Now that's huge,
that's an enormous return investment.

66
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.280
Did we redesign the website from
top to bottom in that time?

67
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280
Not really, no,
we incrementally improved it.

68
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.320
Sometimes those incremental
improvements were bigger than others.

69
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.372
But that's the power of post launch
optimization where you can see real users

70
00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:43.620
interacting with your
website in real time.

71
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.090
So how do we do this kind of work,
for a start,

72
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.340
how do we get the client agreed
to this kind of work, right?

73
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.290
And that's all about preparing the ground
for this kind of optimization.

74
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.614
Before you get to it,
before you get to the live stage,

75
00:04:56.614 --> 00:05:00.930
you've gotta get this into your
stakeholders and clients heads.

76
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.890
So start early,

77
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.010
from the very start of the project
talk about post launch optimization.

78
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.010
Add at least some time to your
timeline for that kind of work.

79
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.299
So as a rule of thumb these days,
we're not,

80
00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:19.194
cuz inevitably they want a gantt chart or
time line for

81
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:23.670
your project,
which are always works of fiction, right?

82
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.100
Nobody's ever stuck to one of
those things, I don't believe,

83
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.180
at least not in my experience.

84
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.930
But the temptation is the last thing
on that timeline, is go live, right?

85
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.270
New, new, new, never do that.

86
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.890
Have that about two-thirds of
the way through the timeline, right?

87
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.270
So you've got a good chunk of time for
development bug fixing for a start.

88
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.750
Once the website goes live or an app goes
live, you find bugs, it's just inevitable.

89
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.591
But also to at least start the process
of optimizing the website post launch,

90
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:55.154
simple thing you can do,

91
00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:59.041
makes a ton of difference to
build that in from the beginning.

92
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:01.113
The other thing is to
create that ideas list,

93
00:06:01.113 --> 00:06:04.175
remember earlier I was talking
about how to deal with scope creep.

94
00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:10.082
And that you just start a list to have
post launch features and improvements.

95
00:06:10.082 --> 00:06:14.806
And the list then encourages, everybody
starts adding stuff to it, they get ideas,

96
00:06:14.806 --> 00:06:19.005
people then start getting excited about
what you could do once you go live and

97
00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:21.718
you build a bit of buzz and
enthusiasm around it.

98
00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:25.358
So that starts to introduce some stuff.

99
00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:27.791
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; A bit of a comment,

100
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:31.977
I feel like with a product
versus a website with a product,

101
00:06:31.977 --> 00:06:35.235
oftentimes launch is
really just the start.

102
00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:37.634
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; It's that whole release early,

103
00:06:37.634 --> 00:06:39.250
release often.

104
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.409
And, for instance, with Frontend Masters,

105
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.225
we should have done this much earlier but
we just hired.

106
00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:52.549
It was about at the beginning of the year,
we hired a user research, user testing.

107
00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:56.878
And have a company to kinda go through and
audit the product and

108
00:06:56.878 --> 00:07:00.634
give suggestions and
then come up with A/B testing.

109
00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:04.321
And so we're starting to run some of
that to try to improve the product,

110
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.496
improve the website.

111
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:09.750
&gt;&gt; It's surprising mine, I mean, you
say what people that have products tend

112
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.880
to think more in this way and
you're absolutely right, they do, right?

113
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.397
But I'm still surprised especially
with an enterprise companies,

114
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:24.543
traditional, large,
retail businesses or places like that.

115
00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:28.881
There often there isn't that mindset
still that they often launch,

116
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:33.369
a product is launched out of associated
with some marketing campaign,

117
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.382
something that's not
core to their offering.

118
00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:40.094
They often are left to wither and die.

119
00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:45.878
Yeah, I've seen companies start community
sites that are left to wither and die.

120
00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:50.387
Or they they decide that they're gonna
launch a mobile app cuz everybody has apps

121
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:54.580
these days and needs to be in the app
store and then nothing's done with it.

122
00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.190
So, yeah, I think there is
a better mindset with that.

123
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.355
But I think it tends to be in
more progressive companies and

124
00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:09.880
that older companies tend to be a little
bit stuck in that project mindset of,

125
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.590
do a project, move on.

126
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.220
Especially if it's driven
by marketing cuz marketing

127
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.228
are very orientated about campaigns, you
do a campaign you move on to the next one.

128
00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:23.180
So it's breaking that thinking that I
think we all need to be doing really
