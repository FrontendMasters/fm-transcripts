00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.819
This is where I'm happy to take any
kind of specific situations and

2
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.241
specific challenges any issues
that you've come up with.

3
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:11.881
I will say I've put all of
the slides from today online at

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:16.047
subscribe.boagworld.com/designprocess.

5
00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:19.472
Can download them all from there,
it's all linked up.

6
00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:23.864
So that PDF that you download will have
links off to all those articles and

7
00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.376
tools that I mentioned.

8
00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:27.066
So hopefully that will help.

9
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.177
I will reiterate what I said earlier.

10
00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:32.866
I'm more than happy to answer any
questions you've got via email,

11
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.593
even if you're watching
this three years later.

12
00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:36.461
I'm more than happy.

13
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:41.244
Because I know how frustrating
the design process can get.

14
00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:46.135
And if you feel stuck in iteration, hell
if you're struggling to get control of

15
00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:51.319
the process hopefully today will help them
all that you've learned on this course.

16
00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:54.714
But they're always nuances,
particular challenges you face.

17
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:58.934
Talking to which hopefully we've got some
challenges and things to talk about.

18
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.810
Mark, what do you got for us?

19
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.689
&gt;&gt; Do you have any good examples of design
systems that we could go and look at for

20
00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.688
inspiration?

21
00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:15.483
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some companies
that posted them online.

22
00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:21.378
My mind is now gone blank to
all the ones that do that.

23
00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:24.188
I know that the BBC does.

24
00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:29.165
They've got one called the BBC
gel global experience language.

25
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:33.653
I quite liked the looking at the BBC
one because that is very clever.

26
00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:36.335
They built it very early on.

27
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:40.726
And what makes one clever is
that the BBC has to cater for

28
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:43.219
vastly different audiences.

29
00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.547
So they have to cater for
people interested in sports.

30
00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:53.441
Kinda holly brow RT people
that listen to radio four,

31
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.217
all the way down to toddlers, right?

32
00:01:56.217 --> 00:01:58.304
It really is everybody.

33
00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:02.228
And so the way that they've built
their design system is very clever.

34
00:02:02.228 --> 00:02:08.738
That they've got their components,
which are effectively the same.

35
00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:12.875
Whether whether you're on CBS,
which is for the kids site, or

36
00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:17.179
whether on BBC News,
you're using the same kind of components.

37
00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:21.482
Using lists and navigation,
and content blocks and

38
00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.626
carousels, and all of those things.

39
00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:26.073
So they've built one of those.

40
00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:31.668
But they've built them independent
from the aesthetics, right?

41
00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:35.364
So they've got this very neutral kind

42
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:39.991
of no aesthetics really
on them via grayscale.

43
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.666
And then what they do is for

44
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:46.770
each of the brands effectively that
they've gotten the different audiences,

45
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.430
they layer on a level of CSS on top of
it which then visually styles those.

46
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.702
So all the functionality is consistent
across all of their different

47
00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:57.108
platforms and sites.

48
00:02:57.108 --> 00:03:00.475
And if you know how to use one of
their sites, you can use all of them,

49
00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:04.678
which is a great user experience, yet they
can still be tailored to their individual

50
00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:06.834
audiences, which I think is very clever.

51
00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:11.132
There are loads of other design
systems out there to check out, but

52
00:03:11.132 --> 00:03:12.447
that's a good one.

53
00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:15.127
Even just searching on
design systems examples,

54
00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:19.338
there's sites that actually collected
design systems that you can look at and

55
00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:21.721
just don't know them
off the top of my head.

56
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.857
Any other questions?

57
00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:32.032
&gt;&gt; I'll just comment that we do have
a design systems course by I'm in Boston.

58
00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:34.251
&gt;&gt; Bro
&gt;&gt; All willing to it.

59
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:38.621
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely,
definitely was that because,

60
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:44.779
design systems are one of those things
that are really simple to explain,

61
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.971
but actually can be frustratingly
complicated to get right.

62
00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:52.017
Just basic things, right?

63
00:03:52.017 --> 00:04:00.026
Let's say you've got a design system
that contains a carousel, right?

64
00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:02.156
When you improve that carousel,

65
00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:07.330
cuz your design system needs to evolve
over time obviously as you change things,

66
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.836
do you version the carousel or
do you version the whole design system?

67
00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:16.286
And how do you manage that process to,
and how do you roll it all out?

68
00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:20.311
There's a lot of underlying complexity
that kind of when you start digging around

69
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:22.189
in it, becomes quite overwhelming.

70
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:25.554
And and how to structure your components
and all these kinds of things.

71
00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:30.994
So yeah, what's your course on it will
really help a lot more than I will.

72
00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:35.464
&gt;&gt; I was in a project once that
like we had a giant design by like,

73
00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:38.459
if they were depending on a third party.

74
00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:39.136
&gt;&gt; Right.

75
00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:44.205
&gt;&gt; And they didn't deliver on time,
so we had to scale back our design.

76
00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:45.813
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Completely and

77
00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:47.935
I made it almost pointless.

78
00:04:47.935 --> 00:04:49.545
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

79
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.841
&gt;&gt; Have you encountered that?

80
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:54.051
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have a lot.

81
00:04:54.051 --> 00:04:58.125
And I have, for
someone who ran an agency for

82
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:02.546
13 years,
this is gonna sound a bit strange.

83
00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:09.207
But I have increasing concerns about how
most large organizations use agencies.

84
00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:14.600
Agencies are a necessity when
you're a smaller organization.

85
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.005
Say for example like Front End Masters
they can't have a staff of

86
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.463
designers on board the whole time.

87
00:05:21.463 --> 00:05:23.733
They couldn't keep them busy.

88
00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:31.093
But for a larger organization, relying on
third party suppliers is problematic for

89
00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:35.459
precisely the reasons
that you've identified.

90
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:39.880
So one answer is building your own in
house team, but that doesn't [LAUGH] you

91
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.905
probably don't have the power to
make that happen, I'm guessing.

92
00:05:43.905 --> 00:05:49.242
So, I think the other way of
doing it is possibly changing

93
00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:53.703
the working relationship
with that supplier.

94
00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:58.069
So if you are gonna take on a third party
supplier at the moment we still have this

95
00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.859
arm's length relationship
with our suppliers.

96
00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:04.914
So you go away and do your bit and
then you come back with the deliverables.

97
00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:08.600
And it's a fixed deliverable and
a fixed timescale, right?

98
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.486
And inevitably it goes wrong because
there's been miscommunication or

99
00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:14.147
problems and stuff like that.

100
00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:16.992
So actually a better way to work
with third parties is say, okay,

101
00:06:16.992 --> 00:06:20.638
we're gonna work with you, but we're
gonna integrate you into our team, right?

102
00:06:20.638 --> 00:06:25.588
So you aren't gonna operate at that arm's
length relationship, but instead you're

103
00:06:25.588 --> 00:06:30.216
gonna bring design resources into the
company either virtually or physically.

104
00:06:30.216 --> 00:06:34.238
And you are gonna work as part
of our cross disciplinary team.

105
00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:36.417
And you're gonna work on a time and
materials basis.

106
00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:38.787
We're not gonna do fix deliverables or
anything like that,

107
00:06:38.787 --> 00:06:40.929
cuz you're gonna be integrated
into our team itself.

108
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:43.791
So that would avoid a lot of those
problems because it would force

109
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:45.438
those designers to work in your way.

110
00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.752
So that's a beneficial step, right?

111
00:06:47.752 --> 00:06:48.733
That you can do.

112
00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:55.896
If you can't do that either, then is
setting up front very clear standards.

113
00:06:55.896 --> 00:07:00.216
So one of the things cuz I often work with
companies that have to work with third

114
00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:04.617
parties, and one of the first things I
say is look, you need to design system.

115
00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:08.429
It's one of the environments where you
really do need a design system quite

116
00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:09.225
importantly.

117
00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.625
Because you say to your suppliers,

118
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:16.826
we are expecting you to work with this
design system using this set of assets.

119
00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:20.595
So that we can easily
implement it afterwards.

120
00:07:20.595 --> 00:07:23.604
And it stops them going off and
doing weird or

121
00:07:23.604 --> 00:07:29.231
stuff that really is impractical or
doesn't understand all of the constraints.

122
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:32.020
And then the final piece
of advice I would give,

123
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.993
if you're gonna work on that relationship
is you need an active manager at your end.

124
00:07:36.993 --> 00:07:41.850
Who is actively almost not relying just
on their internal project managers to do

125
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.198
their job right, but have a counterpart
of your end that is essentially

126
00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:49.987
actively running the people on
the ground within the agency.

127
00:07:49.987 --> 00:07:56.879
Cuz it's very hard for an agency to
understand all of the complexities and

128
00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:03.791
nuances up front in a way that your
own internal project manager could do.

129
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:06.614
But it is a tricky one working
with third party agencies.

130
00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:10.410
And increasingly my attitude
is well hang on a minute.

131
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.928
If you're saying digital is
business critical to you, right?

132
00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:16.167
It's business critical to your operation.

133
00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:19.805
Would you outsource any other business
critical part of your operation?

134
00:08:19.805 --> 00:08:20.698
You wouldn't.

135
00:08:20.698 --> 00:08:24.916
It's insanity, to the thing that
you are reliant on to operate,

136
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:26.459
you have to outsource.

137
00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:31.004
So that's why I intend to these days
recommend they bring it in house.

138
00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.663
That was a very long
answer to your question.

139
00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:37.421
But it's a difficult one, so.

140
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.531
&gt;&gt; My situation was like it
was an in house team, but

141
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:44.339
it was a completely different department
&gt;&gt; Completely different department.

142
00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:46.618
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting one.

143
00:08:46.618 --> 00:08:50.138
Yeah, yeah,
now that's I've come across that as well.

144
00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:55.599
And that goes back to the problem
of these departmental silos.

145
00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:59.806
That you've got different
components reporting into

146
00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:02.373
different departmental silos.

147
00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:09.240
The real answer to that is to implement
cross disciplinary teams, right?

148
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.038
That basically break that down.

149
00:09:11.038 --> 00:09:15.899
So effectively that whoever was working
on that project would be seconded out

150
00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:19.575
of their existing department
is still reporting into it.

151
00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:23.506
But then seconded into a project team
that would consist of a developer or

152
00:09:23.506 --> 00:09:27.831
designer and all the other people that
can work on it simultaneously together.

153
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:33.243
In practical terms, making that
happened can often be really difficult.

154
00:09:33.243 --> 00:09:35.802
Because everybody protects
their business silos.

155
00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:38.975
So that kind of unofficial
way of doing it,

156
00:09:38.975 --> 00:09:43.833
is you find out the actual person
that is working on this project.

157
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.406
And you reach out to them personally.

158
00:09:46.406 --> 00:09:49.861
And say,
let's set up a slack group with just us.

159
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.438
Or let's set up a place where
we can talk and share things.

160
00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:57.968
So we're not always going through
the intermediate of our project manager or

161
00:09:57.968 --> 00:10:02.918
our manager on the set, and actually get
your build that relationship directly with

162
00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:07.399
the person you'll be working, and
just circumnavigate the bureaucracy.

163
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:14.391
But yeah, so that's a very
difficult situation you're facing.

164
00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:16.329
[LAUGH] Anything else?

165
00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.221
Yes.

166
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:22.313
&gt;&gt; That hand wavy question, but-
&gt;&gt; Hell I don't mind

167
00:10:22.313 --> 00:10:23.804
hand wavy questions I go.

168
00:10:23.804 --> 00:10:29.285
&gt;&gt; When should designers stick with
established design pattern like a card,

169
00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:32.680
or when should they create
like a new pattern?

170
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.131
&gt;&gt; Okay,
actually this is a pet subject of mine.

171
00:10:36.131 --> 00:10:41.863
So it's not a hand wavy question,
it's a passionate question.

172
00:10:41.863 --> 00:10:46.590
There is a school of thought
within design at the moment

173
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.306
that all design is looking seamy, right?

174
00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:55.570
And that there's a lack of
innovation going on within design.

175
00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.039
I strongly disagree with this position.

176
00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:02.561
We are not artists, right?

177
00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.955
Our job is not self-expression.

178
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:10.070
Our job is not to push the boundaries.

179
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.136
Our job is to provide an outstanding
user experience, okay?

180
00:11:15.136 --> 00:11:19.943
An experience that people can
interact with seamlessly.

181
00:11:19.943 --> 00:11:24.072
The web is a horrible environment for
that, okay?

182
00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:26.937
Every website, every app that you visit,

183
00:11:26.937 --> 00:11:31.323
the user has to relearn the interface and
how to interact with it.

184
00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:34.087
Can you imagine that
in any other scenario?

185
00:11:34.087 --> 00:11:36.385
Every time you walk up
to the traffic lights,

186
00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:40.206
they've got different color lights and
are organized in a different way.

187
00:11:40.206 --> 00:11:45.802
Every time you went to open a door,
it was a different latch mechanism.

188
00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:48.231
It would be ridiculous.

189
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:52.334
Standards and conformity
provides clarity to the user and

190
00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:55.105
enables them to interact more easily.

191
00:11:55.105 --> 00:12:00.324
So if there is a design pattern
that supports what you want to do,

192
00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:06.607
that already exists, like a card,
a carousel, navigation, pagination,

193
00:12:06.607 --> 00:12:13.106
hamburger menu which is an abomination
in many way, but people have learnt it.

194
00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:16.928
If they have already learned and
they are standards you stick with them.

195
00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:19.752
You do not change things
just to be creative.

196
00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:23.683
Equally if there are conventions
about where things should appear,

197
00:12:23.683 --> 00:12:25.179
do not move them, right?

198
00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:27.540
And I can say this from
personal experience.

199
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.118
Let me give you one example.

200
00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:36.506
I had an agency site that
specialized in disability.

201
00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:40.272
So you'd expect a website to be usable.

202
00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:44.861
And I was the designer, hands up,
this is entirely my fault.

203
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:48.370
But in a moment of sheer
inspiration on my part,

204
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.779
I decided that we wanted to
encourage newsletter sign ups.

205
00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:57.774
And I knew, cuz I'm very knowledgeable,
that a lot of people do seem to

206
00:12:57.774 --> 00:13:02.792
fixate on the top right hand corner
when they first arrive at a website.

207
00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:05.393
Just the way the web works.

208
00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:08.869
So I thought what a great place
to put a newsletter signup form.

209
00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:12.789
So I put a form field for their email
address and a button next to it,

210
00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:13.771
to submit that.

211
00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:15.431
Genius I thought.

212
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:20.434
Newsletter sign ups will come through even
put sign up to our newsletter above it.

213
00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:22.935
And then I noticed months later,

214
00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:28.830
cuz I wasn't paying much attention to
my website, cuz I'm a bad human being,

215
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.784
that we hadn't had really
any newsletter sign ups.

216
00:13:32.784 --> 00:13:34.136
I thought that strange.

217
00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:36.290
And I looked at our analytics.

218
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.205
And I found that there was lots
of submissions of the button,

219
00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:40.987
people were clicking on the button.

220
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.685
Why was we not getting a newsletter?

221
00:13:42.685 --> 00:13:44.413
I must have coded it wrong.

222
00:13:44.413 --> 00:13:47.301
No, I coded perfectly.

223
00:13:47.301 --> 00:13:50.967
People were typing search
queries into that field,

224
00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:56.400
because of its position, cuz that's
where you find search is the top right.

225
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.771
So they just presumed without
reading the instructions,

226
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:04.308
it was a search box everybody was typing
in a search query hitting the button and

227
00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:08.385
it was giving them an error saying,
that is not a valid email address.

228
00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:13.332
And they will go, well,
this is a shit site leaving, right?

229
00:14:13.332 --> 00:14:16.081
Because I wasn't following
the conventions,

230
00:14:16.081 --> 00:14:18.909
that said searches in
the top right hand corner.

231
00:14:18.909 --> 00:14:20.564
Okay, rant over.

232
00:14:20.564 --> 00:14:23.430
So there you go stick
with the conventions,

233
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.682
[LAUGH] all of that was to say [LAUGH].

234
00:14:25.682 --> 00:14:28.918
It's always nice to hear somebody
else's messing up, isn't it?

235
00:14:28.918 --> 00:14:34.058
So it's something deeply reassuring to
hear, somebody's screwing things up.

236
00:14:34.058 --> 00:14:35.526
I'm sure I've got lots of them.

237
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:39.382
Examples of me doing things horribly
wrong, but we'll leave it there.

238
00:14:39.382 --> 00:14:41.178
And there is a place, don't get me wrong.

239
00:14:41.178 --> 00:14:44.180
I'm not saying that you
should never innovate online.

240
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.857
Of course not.

241
00:14:44.857 --> 00:14:47.108
That's just damn.

242
00:14:47.108 --> 00:14:51.166
But I would suggest that
you don't innovate at

243
00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:55.440
the expense of your client or
employer, right?

244
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.652
You innovate in your own projects,
your side projects.

245
00:14:58.652 --> 00:15:00.761
So it's where you can do fun,
stupid stuff.

246
00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:04.694
I do all kinds of stupid
things on my website.

247
00:15:04.694 --> 00:15:07.574
And I'm probably one of the few
people that have my own

248
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.241
personal website these days.

249
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.104
It's very full and out of fashion.

250
00:15:11.104 --> 00:15:13.472
But they're a great place for
messing around.

251
00:15:13.472 --> 00:15:20.151
And I often like,
I'm trying to think overlays, right?

252
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:26.642
Those annoying popup overlays that, and
I've been bad mouthing them for years.

253
00:15:26.642 --> 00:15:30.773
Saying that they're just annoying and
they're detrimental, but I thought, well,

254
00:15:30.773 --> 00:15:33.673
let's run it on my own website and
see what happens, right?

255
00:15:33.673 --> 00:15:35.905
And see whether it does
make any difference, and

256
00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:38.909
whether it made no difference to
my conversion rate whatsoever.

257
00:15:38.909 --> 00:15:41.986
And just got a whole load of angry
people going, why are you doing this?

258
00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:43.505
You should know better.

259
00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:47.067
But that was my chance to learn.

260
00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:50.723
And we need an environment where
we can push and innovate, but

261
00:15:50.723 --> 00:15:55.804
I don't think it's on our client websites
or our employees websites, I'm afraid.

262
00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:59.521
Unless your employer happens to be,
I don't know,

263
00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:04.673
Harry Potter's website, where you
expect it's about exploration and

264
00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:09.164
finding things, and
that kind of thing, that's different.

265
00:16:09.164 --> 00:16:12.450
But if you work in e-commerce or
whatever it's not a good idea.
