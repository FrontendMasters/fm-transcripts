00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.069
I'm hoping that there is nobody that
still does speculative design that's in

2
00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.987
the chat that's watching us.

3
00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:10.737
Is there anyone from out of interest,
if you're in the chat let me know.

4
00:00:10.737 --> 00:00:14.185
And don't worry I'm not gonna
condemn you as a human being,

5
00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:17.220
because I know that clients
do still ask for it.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.865
Just to clarify what I mean
by speculative design,

7
00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:23.506
speculative design is the practice
of producing unpaid design work.

8
00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:30.040
For a prospective customer, or client
to prove your capability to deliver it.

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.871
And actually, it's really bad,
it's really bad for

10
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.710
everybody you do need to be avoiding it.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.120
Is anybody willing to admit that
they do speculative design in chat?

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.770
&gt;&gt; The only note in there is never ask
the client what you were thinking.

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.195
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,
that is a very good comment.

14
00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.433
So, let me explain why
speculative design is a problem,

15
00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:56.300
first of all,
it costs everybody money, right.

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.314
&gt;&gt; This person said they did for
their first job.

17
00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.369
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's understandable,

18
00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.349
it's a thing that generally has
fallen out of favor in the industry.

19
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.967
But I just wanted to point out why
it was so fundamentally wrong, and

20
00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:13.130
enable you to deal with clients
that still occasionally ask for it.

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.770
The first thing is it costs
everybody money, right.

22
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.467
Let's say you hired me or you wanted
to hire me to produce a design and so

23
00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:21.670
did you, right.

24
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.789
Two of you both wanted to hire me.

25
00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.029
Both of you asked me to do
speculative design, okay,

26
00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:32.290
so I do speculative design for both of
you producing three designs for free.

27
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.343
Now you decide to hire me and
you decide not to, okay.

28
00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:41.506
So where does the cost of your
speculative design goes, right,

29
00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.950
you're not paying for it.

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560
So am I paying for it?

31
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.117
Well, yeah, but if I'm paying for it,
I have to recover that cost, don't I,

32
00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:53.210
cuz otherwise I go out of business, okay.

33
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.760
So who pays for it?

34
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.510
Hello, that will be you, right,
as the person that actually has hired me.

35
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.739
So asking for speculative design,

36
00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.537
if you are serious about hiring
somebody is very dangerous.

37
00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:11.071
Because you end up paying for every piece
of speculative design they've done before.

38
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.902
For other clients that haven't hired them,
so

39
00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:16.531
it's really bad from
a money point of view.

40
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:20.195
Secondly, it's about selling and
not delivering, right.

41
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:22.955
So it doesn't matter if I'm
doing the right thing or

42
00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.725
not, doesn't matter about
my design principles.

43
00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:29.125
It doesn't matter about user testing, none
of that matters in speculative design.

44
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:34.445
All that matters is that you like it,
right, cuz I want you to hire me.

45
00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:39.160
So I just designed for you, okay,
so what does that mean then.

46
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.089
So I've produced a completely
inappropriate design just to

47
00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:44.640
make you like it.

48
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.876
And you said, I like that, I'll hire you.

49
00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:51.358
So one of two things
happens at this point.

50
00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:55.089
Either we go ahead with that horrendous
design that's totally inappropriate, and

51
00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.500
you don't get what you
need out of the project.

52
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.965
Or alternatively,
we throw it away, all right, and

53
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:06.130
start again in which case you're now
paying for two lots of design work, okay.

54
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.130
And in addition it's uninformed, right.

55
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.572
When I'm doing a piece of speculative
design I know that nothing about

56
00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:15.567
the users, nothing about the company.

57
00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:18.281
All I know is what you like and
what you don't like, and

58
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.960
even that I've got to guess that
from asking a few questions.

59
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.310
And it's certainly not collaborative in
any way, it's not involving the client.

60
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.368
So anyway, that was just a little bit of
an aside that I wanted to touch on before

61
00:03:30.368 --> 00:03:31.670
we got too much further.

62
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.030
Yeah, what's being said in chat.

63
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.354
&gt;&gt; This person said, Ben said,

64
00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:41.010
you have to do it often would love
to know how to get out of that loop.

65
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, basically it's
having the bravery to say no.

66
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.122
And then to be able to back that up
with what I've literally just shared,

67
00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:52.840
all right.

68
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.189
So then,
basically take this slide deck afterwards,

69
00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.072
go through these points
on the screen right now.

70
00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:05.323
Cuz if you talk the client
through each of those things, and

71
00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:10.184
also I suspect, I'm pretty sure if
you go to my website and google.

72
00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:12.372
Can't google on someone else's website,

73
00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:15.333
we can actually my search is
driven by Google, but anyway.

74
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:19.151
Go to my website and
search on speculative design, and

75
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:24.590
you'll get an article that comes up and
talks you through this logic.

76
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.191
And you basically say, look,
we don't do speculative design

77
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:35.560
because we believe that it is bad for
our clients, right.

78
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.870
And then you explain why you
believe it's bad for your clients.

79
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.460
You don't say it's bad for me as an agency
or a freelancer, cuz they don't care.

80
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.500
But you do need to explain
why it's bad for them.

81
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.700
Now that feels like quite
a brave thing to do.

82
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.349
But I promise you,
at least in my experience,

83
00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.239
I win more work because
I'm willing to challenge

84
00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:02.832
the client, and explain my logic.

85
00:05:02.832 --> 00:05:06.205
Than I do if I just roll over and
do what they want, but

86
00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:11.390
even more significantly, it shifts
the relationship with the client.

87
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.877
So instead of you being a servant,

88
00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:20.902
down in abbey under the stairs
yes sir no sir kind of person.

89
00:05:20.902 --> 00:05:25.100
You become the peer that works
with them to find a solution.

90
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.937
So are you'll be willing to
challenge a client and say, no,

91
00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:31.580
I'm not gonna do this, it's very good.

92
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.031
And then there's a final reason why
it's really good to do this, and

93
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:36.780
have the bravery to do this.

94
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.761
Which is if you get heavy pushback
from the client, and the client says,

95
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:46.020
no, we want speculative design,
that is a serious red flag.

96
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.792
Because what it shows is they're not
willing to listen to your opinion, and

97
00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:55.838
that they're stuck in their own process,
in their own mindset.

98
00:05:55.838 --> 00:05:59.545
And you will almost certainly
lose money on that project, so

99
00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:02.170
that's my thoughts on speculative design
