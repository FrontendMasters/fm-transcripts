WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.945
And I guess the ultimate
example of this collaboration

2
00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:09.997
between design and
development is the design system and

3
00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:14.742
I do want to just touch on
the idea of a design system.

4
00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:19.421
This is especially important when
working on larger websites, but

5
00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:22.867
to be honest,
these days even when I'm working on

6
00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:26.084
a small website I build
a design system as I go.

7
00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:28.963
It just is the way that
I work these days and

8
00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:34.564
I think it's very important when we think
about that post-launch iteration and

9
00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:37.712
improvement to have
a design system in here.

10
00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.762
I'm sure all of you know what a design
system is, but it is a set of

11
00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:46.645
components and stars that helps you
ensure consistency across the website.

12
00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:47.832
Why is it so important?

13
00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:52.428
Well, when we would, especially on larger
sites, the design system will help

14
00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:57.301
multiple designers and developers quickly
create new templates for a website of any

15
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:01.437
size or new functionality for
a website or web app and visualize those.

16
00:01:01.437 --> 00:01:03.538
It helps coordination between
designers and developers.

17
00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:07.176
It helps standards between
multiple designers.

18
00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:09.786
They're just really useful tools.

19
00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:13.233
In terms of when to use it,
when to start creating it?

20
00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.202
Ideally, really from when you're right
at the beginning of the project,

21
00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:21.174
start planning and design system as
soon as you're working on the design.

22
00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:23.495
It's something that
a lot of people try and

23
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.087
retrofit after they've
produced the design.

24
00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:29.271
And that's perfectly possible, but

25
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:33.946
actually there is a huge
advantage to doing it as you go in

26
00:01:33.946 --> 00:01:39.034
the sense that makes you think
in terms of those components.

27
00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:43.634
And stops you ending up with lots
of similar components that do

28
00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:45.674
basically the same thing.

29
00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:48.829
But you can create
a design system anytime.

30
00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:54.965
I do work just to briefly
reiterate what I believe

31
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:59.086
should be quick key components
of a design system.

32
00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:02.673
Styles is the obvious one styles
include your typographic styles, so

33
00:02:02.673 --> 00:02:06.831
things like headings, quotations,
links, color palettes, all that stuff.

34
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:14.064
You've then got the elements which are
the smallest element of a design system.

35
00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:19.124
I could start using Brad Frost's
atomic design systems, but really,

36
00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:23.861
that's probably too granular for
what we're getting into here.

37
00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:27.042
But basically, elements include the
fundamental building blocks of a website.

38
00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:31.044
So these are things like buttons,
form fields, navigation forms, and

39
00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:32.233
that thing, icons.

40
00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:33.957
And then there's the components,

41
00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:36.898
which are the more complex UI
elements that make up a design.

42
00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:39.863
So I mean, you're looking at this thing.

43
00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:42.431
So you can see how the text,

44
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:47.467
the insurmountable value
is styled in a certain way.

45
00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.912
So that has a style associated with it.

46
00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:53.681
The quotation mark,
the Chevron's, the pagination,

47
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:58.939
they're all elements are small components
and then together all of that the end

48
00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.904
of that block fits together into
a quotation component that can be reused.

49
00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:08.577
I'm probably today going into way more
detail than it's necessary, yeah.

50
00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.646
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a question.

51
00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.849
I'm going from l a developer's side.

52
00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:14.655
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

53
00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:17.013
&gt;&gt; We have a design system
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

54
00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:17.747
&gt;&gt; But sometimes.

55
00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:24.034
While talking to designers,

56
00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:28.938
they quickly come up with why their
design has to be pixel, perfect.

57
00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:29.893
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

58
00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:32.079
&gt;&gt; Or like why they design is a special?

59
00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:32.858
&gt;&gt; Yes.

60
00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:36.179
&gt;&gt; How do you iron out that?

61
00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.205
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it's really good when you snap them.

62
00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:44.801
[LAUGH] So
there's this two different issues there.

63
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:51.423
There's the Pixel Perfect issue, and
then they're coming up with designs or

64
00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:56.858
design elements that aren't in
the design system, all right?

65
00:03:56.858 --> 00:04:01.229
Let's deal with the pixel
perfect thing first I mean,

66
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:07.610
essentially that one it comes down to
that's not how the web works, all right?

67
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.618
And especially in the world
of responsive design

68
00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:18.975
those pixel values just don't
exist in that way, all right?

69
00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:24.071
So that's a bit of a frustrating
one because that's not

70
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:29.287
a difference of opinion,
that's a difference of fact.

71
00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:31.939
[LAUGH] Pixel perfect design
is not possible on the web,

72
00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.564
why are we even discussing this.

73
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:37.851
So it's a bit hard to argue with that one.

74
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:42.474
It probably is an indication they
come from a print background and

75
00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:46.172
in which case I think I tend
to announce situations,

76
00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:51.656
start talking a lot about responsiveness,
a lot about the different sizes.

77
00:04:51.656 --> 00:04:54.363
I talk a lot about the accessibility and

78
00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:59.447
the fact that people resize their,
like for me as I've reached 50 now,

79
00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:04.139
and I'm getting long reading glass
I have to wear reading glasses.

80
00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.097
So I've increased the font size on
everything which obviously completely

81
00:05:08.097 --> 00:05:10.311
mucks up anybody's design, all right?

82
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:14.328
So it's exposing them to those
scenarios that help deal with that.

83
00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:18.368
In terms of that are this is a component
we don't currently have, I think that's.

84
00:05:22.294 --> 00:05:30.270
That is really an educational piece in
terms of wire design system exist and

85
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.586
how it benefits everybody, all right?

86
00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:39.073
So if a design system is set, you have
a design system as a development team.

87
00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:41.512
But if they're not using it
within the design department,

88
00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:43.235
they're not getting any value out of it.

89
00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:45.792
It's just a barrier to them, all right?

90
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:48.988
But once they've got the design
system set up in Figma,

91
00:05:48.988 --> 00:05:51.444
as well Suddenly it's a huge boon to them.

92
00:05:51.444 --> 00:05:54.707
They can produce designs and
mock-ups much quicker, and

93
00:05:54.707 --> 00:05:58.171
the temptation on their part just
to use an existing component

94
00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:01.784
rather than create a whole new
thing is huge because it's easy.

95
00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:05.887
I could do that in seconds rather than
however long it takes me to great

96
00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:07.108
something custom.

97
00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:08.886
So the key though, I think,

98
00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:13.423
is to get them set up with the design
system in Figma for them, all right?

99
00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:16.910
So they've got all of those components,
and they can interact with them.

100
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.145
Then you'll find that they
naturally start using those more.

101
00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:23.812
When they do want to create a component
that doesn't currently exist in

102
00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:24.860
the design system.

103
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.541
That's fine, all right?

104
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.937
That's, okay?

105
00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:31.852
A design system is a living, breathing
document and does change over time.

106
00:06:31.852 --> 00:06:35.909
But there are cost implications of that,
all right?

107
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.701
That's gonna take you a lot more
development time than it is going to take

108
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:41.575
just to use an existing component.

109
00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:45.544
So in that case, it's a matter of they
need to create a business case for it,

110
00:06:45.544 --> 00:06:46.175
all right?

111
00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:51.528
Simple as that, they need to justify
that particular element, all right?

112
00:06:51.528 --> 00:06:56.379
Why that element has to be done in the way
it's done to offset the additional

113
00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.613
hours work or
however long it will take to do that.

114
00:06:59.613 --> 00:07:03.539
And they just need to be able to show
that even, anecdotally, all right?

115
00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.969
We're not gonna make them do
a whole business case, but

116
00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.683
there needs to be some justification.

117
00:07:07.683 --> 00:07:13.108
And then it's not just done as
a one-off element, all right?

118
00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:15.533
It's done, it becomes a new component.

119
00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:18.523
So they can't just go,
well, we only need it here.

120
00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:23.307
Well, if we only need it here it's
really not worth the developer's time to

121
00:07:23.307 --> 00:07:25.347
build it cuz it a one of use case.

122
00:07:25.347 --> 00:07:30.129
If it's an entirely new component
that could be used across the whole

123
00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:33.600
site then that's more justifiable,
all right?

124
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.817
So that kinda pushes their thinking
towards this mutual base thinking.

125
00:07:37.817 --> 00:07:42.258
But to be honest the big win if you
just get them set up in Figma with these

126
00:07:42.258 --> 00:07:46.946
elements already built in they'll
just use them because it's easiest.

127
00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:47.981
Does that help in any way?

128
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:49.586
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

129
00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:53.830
&gt;&gt; It's not a black and
white simple answer but, yeah.

130
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.156
Okay, so yeah,
let's talk about organizing our

131
00:07:57.156 --> 00:08:01.987
design systems because that begins to
think about what in your case, for

132
00:08:01.987 --> 00:08:06.203
example, you've got to introduce
that into the design side.

133
00:08:06.203 --> 00:08:08.957
Sometimes you're starting
completely from scratch.

134
00:08:08.957 --> 00:08:12.184
In either cases,
I would say look, start simple,

135
00:08:12.184 --> 00:08:16.614
don't if you've got like loads of
components probably don't try and

136
00:08:16.614 --> 00:08:20.537
put all of them in Figma in one
go because it'll take too long.

137
00:08:20.537 --> 00:08:26.617
[LAUGH] So just pick the most common
ones and create them to get them going.

138
00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:30.066
Even if to begin with you do nothing
other than set up a few styles,

139
00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:33.224
not even components, but
just here's the color palette.

140
00:08:33.224 --> 00:08:35.236
Here's the typography so

141
00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:40.631
that you don't have to pick the color
palette color every time you go,

142
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:45.952
that's, target red or whatever
that thing makes a big difference.

143
00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:50.423
And then add the really basic components
start with things like the header and

144
00:08:50.423 --> 00:08:53.860
the footer so that he can just
drop those in really easily and

145
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.602
then just add to it over time.

146
00:08:55.602 --> 00:09:00.521
It's a bit of, it messes with your
mind working on a design system.

147
00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:05.818
I don't know whether you found that,
but you can often overthink them.

148
00:09:05.818 --> 00:09:09.283
I think one of the common
problems with design systems

149
00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:12.979
is they need to strike the balance
between having too many

150
00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:16.991
components where you end up
with components for everything.

151
00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:20.231
Or completely abstracting
the components so

152
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:23.648
that they fundamentally
become meaningless.

153
00:09:23.648 --> 00:09:28.509
So for example, it would be okay
to have a separate news component,

154
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:32.434
a news listing and
an events listing even though really

155
00:09:32.434 --> 00:09:36.978
they're probably quite similar
in terms of fields and stuff.

156
00:09:36.978 --> 00:09:40.375
And that's especially true
with the designer side.

157
00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.618
From your point of view,
from a developer point of view,

158
00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:44.410
you want to do that abstraction,
all right?

159
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.995
Because you want to keep
the code as lean as possible.

160
00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:51.339
You want as little, tables in
the database or whatever it is you do,

161
00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:53.257
I don't really understand.

162
00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:56.133
But from a designer point of view,
I wanna create mock-ups.

163
00:09:56.133 --> 00:10:01.158
So having a news listing mock-up and
events listing component the two separate

164
00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:05.890
components that makes it easier for
me to create those mock-ups quickly.

165
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.967
Even though on your side, you probably
use the same code and database for both.

166
00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:11.040
You see what I mean?

167
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.168
So sometimes there is,
you got to strike that balance.

168
00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:18.723
I don't know whether any of that
makes sense, but hopefully it did.

169
00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:20.358
And then finally, I'd say stay flexible.

170
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:22.723
Your design system should evolve.

171
00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:27.353
You'll be adding new components when
you need to, as they come up, but

172
00:10:27.353 --> 00:10:32.526
also seek to combine components when your
system starts to become too bloated,

173
00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:36.332
that's normally a signal that
you need to move things on.

174
00:10:36.332 --> 00:10:41.270
In terms of keeping your design and
your code components

175
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.798
in sync with one another,
which is a huge problem.

176
00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:50.990
It's been solved thankfully by a tool
called zipline that I don't know whether

177
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.116
you've checked out, but it's really
good integrates straight with Figma.

178
00:10:56.116 --> 00:10:59.104
And you can basically see the code and

179
00:10:59.104 --> 00:11:03.259
what the element actually
looks like side by side.

180
00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:08.125
And it will keep them all in sync and
stuff like that is really, good for

181
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.042
this thing.

182
00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:15.038
Managing this stuff, and together it
makes it really powerful is a way for

183
00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:18.050
a designer to quickly mock up a page.

184
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.412
And a developer to go, well that page is
made up of this component, this component,

185
00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:25.858
this component, this component or
just grab those put it in job done.

186
00:11:25.858 --> 00:11:29.033
That's where you're trying
to get to basically, but

187
00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:33.106
actually a big area people overlook
when it comes to design systems and

188
00:11:33.106 --> 00:11:37.817
components is actually the benefit that
it has to your content creators as well.

189
00:11:37.817 --> 00:11:43.394
So, for example, my own website which
is just built on WordPress, all right?

190
00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:48.456
And it's only my site, yet
he's still got a design system behind it.

191
00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:53.703
Seems like a sledgehammer to crack
a nut but what it enables me to

192
00:11:53.703 --> 00:11:58.956
do is I can add in things really
simply using Gutenberg blocks.

193
00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:03.758
So for example, we've got a component on
the screen here which is just a quote that

194
00:12:03.758 --> 00:12:05.300
can be shared on Twitter.

195
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.057
And I built a custom block really, really
simple custom block that basically allows

196
00:12:10.057 --> 00:12:13.476
me to put in that content, and
it will display it in that way.

197
00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:18.321
So you can use actually that component
mindset and that basic design

198
00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:23.345
system even on a tiny little site,
it doesn't need to be on a big site.

199
00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:28.237
The other thing I would say with
a design system is a design system

200
00:12:28.237 --> 00:12:31.869
can go much further than
maybe you think it can.

201
00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:35.388
I've written an article on this, and I'll
let you check it out in your own time and

202
00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:36.164
read through it.

203
00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:40.368
But a lot of people when people
think of a design system,

204
00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:44.674
they're thinking of a set of
UI components, all right?

205
00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:48.236
But I would say that a design
system is a lot more than that.

206
00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:52.348
Or at least it's got
the potential to be that a design

207
00:12:52.348 --> 00:12:57.208
system is a way of systemizing
design as the name implies, and

208
00:12:57.208 --> 00:13:00.586
that isn't just about the UI components.

209
00:13:00.586 --> 00:13:03.436
Or other things on the go here,
for example,

210
00:13:03.436 --> 00:13:06.821
those design principles I talked about,
all right?

211
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:10.363
Those are a part of
a design system in my view,

212
00:13:10.363 --> 00:13:16.335
they are part of the decision-making
process ,part of the infrastructure

213
00:13:16.335 --> 00:13:21.671
around which your principles can
be created a content style guide.

214
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:24.618
Really, that's a part of
the design system as well,

215
00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:28.561
it's the design of the content and
how the content integrates into it.

216
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:31.808
And even something like a service
manual or digital play book,

217
00:13:31.808 --> 00:13:35.116
which documents how digital is run,
how your projects are run,

218
00:13:35.116 --> 00:13:38.010
all of that could be a part of
your design system as well.

219
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.834
So, if you have a design system already,
I'd encourage you to maybe expand it

220
00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:46.355
beyond just the UI components
that everybody thinks of.

221
00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:50.537
And actually think of it more holistically
in terms of how you're running projects,

222
00:13:50.537 --> 00:13:53.381
and how is that dealt with,
what your design principles,

223
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:55.783
what's your content guide,
all of that stuff.

224
00:13:55.783 --> 00:14:00.092
So yeah,
all of these things you can be developing

225
00:14:00.092 --> 00:14:04.510
alongside your build or
post launch if you need to.
