00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.522
So let's look at the process that I use,
cuz I get this is a big

2
00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:09.060
chunk of the work that I do is
post-launch optimization work.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.882
So I'll just very briefly talk you
through the process that I sell into my

4
00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:16.186
clients and I tend to do with them.

5
00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:19.536
It's very high tech and
you may well have trouble following it.

6
00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:22.735
No, it's not, it's very straightforward.

7
00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:25.181
It's embarrassingly straightforward,
actually,

8
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:27.313
considering the amount
that I get paid to do it.

9
00:00:27.313 --> 00:00:32.072
So, first of all,
identify drop out pages, right?

10
00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:34.656
So where in your app,
where in your website,

11
00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:39.148
bear in mind I tend to do conversion
rate optimization on marketing websites.

12
00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:43.456
So apologies if I talk in that tone,
the same principle applies.

13
00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:49.165
I find where things are going wrong,
and that's step one.

14
00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:56.145
Then step two is identify the problem
with that underperforming page.

15
00:00:56.145 --> 00:01:00.991
There's a particular place in the app or
in the website or whatever where things

16
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.497
are going wrong, but okay,
what's the specific problem on that point?

17
00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:09.791
Then that hopefully triggers
a load of potential solutions.

18
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:13.579
I then test the solution, right?

19
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.498
Mind blown at this
amazing technique I have.

20
00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:21.255
Then I roll out that solution, right?

21
00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:24.727
And I go back to the beginning and
start all over again,

22
00:01:24.727 --> 00:01:29.955
identify the next drop out point and
rinse and repeat endlessly forever, right?

23
00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:33.705
So let's just run through that a bit
more detailed so it makes sense.

24
00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:38.032
So I start almost always in
Google Analytics, really.

25
00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:40.411
I'm basically just looking for

26
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:45.180
pages that have got high bounce rate or
a high exit page, right?

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.412
So where people are going,
screw this, I'm off, right?

28
00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:49.955
Those are the points that you've got.

29
00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:51.976
And, of course,
you're gonna find lots of those.

30
00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:54.888
So that's your list that you're
working through over time,

31
00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:57.464
you start with the ones with
the highest bounce rate and

32
00:01:57.464 --> 00:02:00.223
the highest dropout rate and
then just work your way down.

33
00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:05.432
So once I've found a page from that,
I then shift across typically

34
00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:10.002
into that Microsoft Clarity
that I talked about earlier.

35
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.986
And I'm looking for
certain things on the page.

36
00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:15.250
First of all,
you gotta identify what the problem is.

37
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.252
Is it the fact that the user
is missing something, right?

38
00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:20.570
So are they missing something on the page?

39
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.069
So what I'll look at is, say, the heat
maps of the page to see where people's

40
00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.475
attention is going on the page,
where they're looking.

41
00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:34.148
I look at the session recorders and I
might even use my eye tracking software to

42
00:02:34.148 --> 00:02:40.099
see where people are looking and whether
they might have overlooked something.

43
00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.848
So if it's not that,
another common problem is,

44
00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:45.012
did people not understand something?

45
00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:49.440
So they've seen it, but they didn't
understand what it is or how it works.

46
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.379
So in that case I'm looking for
things like rage clicks.

47
00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.458
You know when someone repeatedly clicks
on something that's not clickable because

48
00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:57.440
they're annoyed?

49
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.265
Or any click on a non-clickable item,
they're clicking on an image where

50
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:06.873
it's only the text underneath
that's clickable, things like that.

51
00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:10.075
Or did they trigger some kind
of validation error on a form?

52
00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:13.708
That's another common one that
causes people to abandon,

53
00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:17.202
cuz they entered their data
in the wrong way or whatever.

54
00:03:17.202 --> 00:03:21.882
And if it's not those,
then the third area I'm often

55
00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:25.949
looking at is do we not convince them,
right?

56
00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.909
So is it that what we're producing,
our messaging is not convincing enough,

57
00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.292
is not compelling enough.

58
00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:34.201
And so
I tend to use an exit intent survey,

59
00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:39.534
asking people why they didn't act,
right, for my kind of marketing site.

60
00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:43.131
But it's normally one of those
three reasons, basically, and

61
00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:46.001
you just look at different
sources to identify it.

62
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:51.045
And then you go, okay, so people
aren't understanding this form field,

63
00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:54.740
or they missed this drop down menu,
or whatever it is.

64
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.754
Then okay, how do we fix that?

65
00:03:56.754 --> 00:04:00.531
I've got some ideas about how to fix that.

66
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:04.308
And I come up with those different ideas,
maybe even multiple versions.

67
00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:10.169
I tend to favor three or four at least
different versions that you can have.

68
00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.238
It depends on how you're gonna test it but
basically, yeah,

69
00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:17.461
I get a variety, and
then I'll test it, right?

70
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:21.691
Now, how I test will depend on size,

71
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:27.159
basically, of what your solution is,
right?

72
00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.989
So if it's just a little small solution,
if you're making changes to color,

73
00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:37.112
text, layout, little things like that,
then I tend to favor doing A/B testing,

74
00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:39.914
which is what we're talking about earlier.

75
00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:44.907
So with me I use VWO a lot
of the time to do that.

76
00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:48.342
You could use Google Optimize that's free.

77
00:04:48.342 --> 00:04:49.520
It's up to you what you use.

78
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.166
But basically, I'll run a test where I'll
send a small portion of the audience,

79
00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:58.561
to see each one of the different
solutions, right, that I've come up with.

80
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:03.182
If it's a more substantial test,
like I'm changing the whole flow of, say,

81
00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:07.593
a checkout system or something like
that which has got multiple changes and

82
00:05:07.593 --> 00:05:11.111
they're quite complex, so
it's a larger set of changes.

83
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:16.028
That's when normally I end
up prototyping a solution.

84
00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:21.998
And as we were discussing earlier, I tend
to favor a facilitated usability testing

85
00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:27.729
to actually understand, well, if it did
work better, why did it work better?

86
00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.352
Because the why is a really
important aspect of it,

87
00:05:31.352 --> 00:05:36.002
because that allows you to further
refine the idea even further.

88
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:41.296
So, for example, I remember doing
one test once where we replaced

89
00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:46.212
a VeriSign logo on an e-commerce site,
you know where it says

90
00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:50.958
you're verified, signed secure,
and we replaced that.

91
00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.710
I couldn't help but feeling that my
audience didn't know what that meant and

92
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.452
they were worried about security.

93
00:05:56.452 --> 00:05:59.184
So that was my hypothesis, if you like.

94
00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:03.682
And I then replaced that with just
a padlock and some text, right?

95
00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:07.644
Little picture of padlock,
bit of text saying secure.

96
00:06:07.644 --> 00:06:12.413
And when I did the usability testing,
they would say, so

97
00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:17.207
that's so much better,
I understand now that it's secure.

98
00:06:17.207 --> 00:06:21.073
And they actually started to give
me some feedback about wording.

99
00:06:21.073 --> 00:06:23.750
It'd make even more sense if it said blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

100
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.284
Great, you don't get that from A/B
testing, do you see what I mean?

101
00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:29.077
So just bear that in mind,

102
00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:33.081
depending on the size of
the test that you're working on.

103
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:37.723
And then like I said,
it's just launch and repeat, basically.

104
00:06:37.723 --> 00:06:43.422
You fix one problem, you go on to
the next, and that is really forever.

105
00:06:43.422 --> 00:06:47.414
[LAUGH] You just carry on
working through the list,

106
00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:51.414
constantly refining and
constantly improving.

107
00:06:51.414 --> 00:06:57.158
And that is fundamentally it with
that post-launch optimization phase.

108
00:06:57.158 --> 00:07:02.643
It's not complicated, but
it is where you make the real wins.

109
00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:07.313
It's small little changes that make
an enormous difference to improving

110
00:07:07.313 --> 00:07:08.450
the experience.

111
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.297
And you need to get in the habit of doing
that on an ongoing continual basis cuz

112
00:07:13.297 --> 00:07:15.660
there's always things to improve.

113
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.336
There's always things to fix
because you improve one thing and

114
00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:21.080
you end up breaking another.

115
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.098
Or you improve one area and
it just exposes problems

116
00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:31.478
that users didn't get to
further down in the journey.

117
00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:36.256
So really, right from the beginning, start
talking about the importance of this kind

118
00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.475
of work cuz it is absolutely
fundamental to your success.
