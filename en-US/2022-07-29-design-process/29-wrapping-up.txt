>> So, thank you very much for joining us. I hope you found this really useful presentation and introduction to managing design process. Something I'm very passionate about. There's no need to suffer through the hills of endless iteration. There's no need to have your design taken over by other people and turned into design by committee.

Just need a proper structure to get through. So thank you very much for listening and sticking with me through this. If you've got any questions, drop me an email anytime. Otherwise, good luck.
