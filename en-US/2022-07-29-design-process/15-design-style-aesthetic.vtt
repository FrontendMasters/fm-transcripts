1
00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:07.447
It's time I believe to address the
elephant in the room, which is aesthetics.

2
00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:10.553
This is the area that
causes all the problems.

3
00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:15.104
This is the point where we get
into design being subjective and

4
00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:17.913
not liking your auntie's curtains.

5
00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:20.895
So how do we deal with this one?

6
00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.406
How do we deal with it?

7
00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.519
We've done a wire frame, so we've dealt
with a lot of the content issues,

8
00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.132
we've dealt a lot with
the structural issues,

9
00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:33.471
page flow, whether people spot key
elements, all of that we've dealt with.

10
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:36.511
But we need to deal with the aesthetics.

11
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:41.582
Now, if you're lucky then
the company you're working for

12
00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:45.242
has a brand guidelines all ready in place.

13
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:49.209
He's all ready made those big
decisions in terms of aesthetics,

14
00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:53.041
in terms of color choices,
typography those kinds of things.

15
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:55.544
And if that is where you're at,

16
00:00:55.544 --> 00:01:00.015
I highly recommend you do not
fight that battle, right?

17
00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:03.175
You don't try and
change those brand guidelines.

18
00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:06.611
It is a big fight and
you'll get nowhere and anyway,

19
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:09.828
it's saving you a lot of hustle and
a lot of time.

20
00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:12.883
I know it's hard to work with
a brand identity that maybe

21
00:01:12.883 --> 00:01:16.133
you're not fully invested in or
you don't believe in, but

22
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:20.294
really you make the most out of the the
constraints that are placed upon you.

23
00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:24.648
And that is the difference between
being a designer and an artist,

24
00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:27.460
that you have to work within constraints.

25
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.093
So if you've got brand guidelines,
really this next bit,

26
00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:33.137
you can kinda largely skip over.

27
00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:37.986
But for the rest of us, we are in
a position where we're faced with having

28
00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:42.837
to establish the aesthetics of a website
and that includes your colors,

29
00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:46.595
your typography,
your styling those kinds of things.

30
00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:49.057
So if you're in that position,
where do you start?

31
00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:50.849
How do you begin to address this?

32
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.466
Well, naturally, I would say would
begin right at the beginning of

33
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:58.058
the project in your discovery phase.

34
00:01:58.058 --> 00:02:02.888
In that phase, I would suggest
discussing with your client

35
00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:07.926
a set of key words they want to
represent their brand, right?

36
00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:12.806
So, these are words that
are used to help define who

37
00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:17.585
the company is and
what they want to communicate.

38
00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:23.415
So these might be words like we
want to be seen as professional or

39
00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:30.015
friendly or fun or whatever,
a set of words that represents the brand.

40
00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:33.776
So how do you go about
deciding that with the client?

41
00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:37.476
Well there are kind of three
ways that you can go about,

42
00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:42.639
deciding defining the brand and
those key words, with your stakeholders.

43
00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.532
And again, this is a great way of
engaging with your stakeholders.

44
00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.944
It's a great way of getting them on board.

45
00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:51.979
So this is definitely worth doing.

46
00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.746
So your three options are, first of all,
what I called the famous person exercise,

47
00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:58.773
which is a really simple exercise.

48
00:02:58.773 --> 00:03:06.186
It's use ask your various stakeholders
if your brand was a famous person,

49
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.195
who would that famous person be, okay?

50
00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:14.662
And you ask them specifically why,
what is it about that famous person?

51
00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:20.765
So there are certain reoccurring
people that often come up,

52
00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:26.878
Obama is one that is often
mentioned in American companies.

53
00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:31.569
In British companies,
there's a there's a celebrity

54
00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.474
called Stephen Fry who
often comes up as well.

55
00:03:35.474 --> 00:03:38.464
And it's not so much the name
of the person that's important.

56
00:03:38.464 --> 00:03:43.027
What's important is what they describe
that famous person is bringing,

57
00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:47.602
they're charismatic, they're articulate,
they're intelligent.

58
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:51.430
Those are the kinds of
words that basically

59
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.265
you can use to discuss the brand identity.

60
00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:59.906
Now that's great and from doing that
exercise you will get words that

61
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:03.359
are descriptive of
personality unsurprisingly.

62
00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.534
But sometimes it's useful to get words
that are more design focused words.

63
00:04:09.534 --> 00:04:12.188
So if you want to go down that route,

64
00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:17.231
another exercise you can run is
the reception room exercise, where

65
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:22.999
you're asked participants to describe
a reception area for their company.

66
00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.880
What it would look like in their
idealized view of it, right?

67
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.552
So they would get them to describe
things like the furniture, the deck or

68
00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:34.475
what musics playing, what's on the walls?

69
00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:39.328
Is there someone to greet them, what that
person's like, how they they approach you,

70
00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:42.033
all of those kinds of characteristics,
right?

71
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:43.974
And they will use a lot of adjectives.

72
00:04:43.974 --> 00:04:48.622
They will say things like minimalistic
furniture or colorful wallpaper or

73
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:49.811
things like that.

74
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:54.352
So write down those words like
colorful minimalistic and

75
00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:57.480
those can act as brand keywords again.

76
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.100
Now, the final way of doing
it is to use a brand deck.

77
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.449
So there is actually a website that
I've got linked to in the slides.

78
00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.169
Cool brand cards and basically you can
either buy a set physical cards or

79
00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.769
you can do this online and the cards
have got lots of different words.

80
00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:19.516
And you can get stakeholders to pick
different words to kind of help

81
00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:24.116
identify what your brand is going
to be and how you represent it.

82
00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:30.423
Really, which of these methods you
use is somewhat abstract, right?

83
00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:34.696
Is somewhat up to you and
the particular route that you want to go,

84
00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:37.431
there is no right or
wrong way of doing it.

85
00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:38.672
The key however,

86
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:43.634
is to end up with a set of words that
you want the design to represent, and

87
00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:48.706
everybody is bought into the design
needs to represent these keywords.

88
00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:53.386
So what that does is it
sets a standard by which to

89
00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:58.541
confirm whether the design is succeeded or
failed.

90
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:02.173
Rather than it being open to
people's feelings about it.

91
00:06:02.173 --> 00:06:05.701
We've now got a tangible
thing that we can measure.

92
00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:09.359
Now if you want more information about
these different methods and working,

93
00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:12.734
I have written an article on building
a brand using the web that you might

94
00:06:12.734 --> 00:06:14.891
find useful you might
want to check that out.

95
00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:17.790
So again that's in the slides.

96
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.655
So once you've got this set of words,
now we need to start kind

97
00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:27.533
of interpreting those words I'm
in some kind of visual form.

98
00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:31.370
And actually one of the great tools that
a lot of designers using this regard is

99
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.973
something called style times.

100
00:06:32.973 --> 00:06:37.442
Instead of designing a whole website,
where you might get it wrong or

101
00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:42.925
you might have the wrong feel or whatever
else, you just produce these mood boards.

102
00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:47.906
Basically, which have got examples of
typography examples of color imagery that

103
00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:52.466
represent whatever those key words are or
whatever those brand words are.

104
00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:56.099
And you'll probably do a lot of these for
different brand words, for

105
00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.497
different combinations of brand
words in order to experiment.

106
00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:01.379
They're very quick and easy to create.

107
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.349
You literally open up,
you can do it in PowerPoint,

108
00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.521
if you want to do it whatever you want.

109
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:10.770
You just dump in fonts and
colors and that kind of thing.

110
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.482
And actually, if you really want
to engage with your stakeholders,

111
00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:20.715
and give them a sense of
ownership over the design,

112
00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:24.363
then this is a great
opportunity to do that.

113
00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:28.591
Remember that the reason we want people to
feel a sense of ownership is if they feel

114
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:31.141
that they were involved
in creating the design,

115
00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:34.772
then they're less likely to reject
it because it's their own work.

116
00:07:34.772 --> 00:07:37.625
And they're also more likely
to defend it to others.

117
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:41.549
We also wanna involve
the stakeholders at this stage.

118
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:44.847
Because a game was showing
them the design evolving,

119
00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:47.127
we've shown them some wireframes.

120
00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.522
We've shown them the style tiles, and
then they'll see the final design and

121
00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.624
it won't come as a surprise, okay?

122
00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:55.949
And remember surprises are bad.

123
00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:57.863
So whether you wanna do it yourself or

124
00:07:57.863 --> 00:08:02.375
whether you wanna get your stakeholders
involved, basically what you're doing is,

125
00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:05.800
going to Google Images and
typing in that particular brand word.

126
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.707
So you wanted the design to feel calming.

127
00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:11.521
So you typed the word calming
into Google Images and

128
00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:13.556
see what images it comes out up with.

129
00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:17.400
And then you grab the ones you like,
and you sell them in your style title,

130
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.275
simple as that.

131
00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:21.561
You could use a site called Pickler,

132
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:25.907
I think that's how you say it,
which is great for

133
00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:32.384
finding colors that are associated
with different images or feelings.

134
00:08:32.384 --> 00:08:36.958
So you can go to that website link in
the slide deck and you can type in

135
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.878
a particular keyword and it will
suggest colors based on that keyword.

136
00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:44.484
Brilliant., great, so
you've now got a color inspiration.

137
00:08:44.484 --> 00:08:47.617
You can drop that into your style tiles.

138
00:08:47.617 --> 00:08:52.324
And then there's photography,
that's a photography typography even,

139
00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:57.106
right where you can go to Google fonts and
you can pick some fonts that you feel

140
00:08:57.106 --> 00:09:01.456
kind of represent those different
feelings that you're going for.

141
00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:04.614
And then if you want some
stylistic inspiration,

142
00:09:04.614 --> 00:09:09.048
you go to a site like Dribble, and
you search on your keywords there and

143
00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:12.454
see what it comes back with and
maybe pick and choose.

144
00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:16.544
So you'll end up creating these
different style tiles with these

145
00:09:16.544 --> 00:09:20.261
different combinations,
either yourself as a designer or

146
00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:22.879
ideally with some of your stakeholders.

147
00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:27.789
So once you've got the style tiles
the next stage is to work out which of

148
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:30.964
these is gonna be most appropriate, right?

149
00:09:30.964 --> 00:09:36.018
Now, there are many different
approaches that you could do here.

150
00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:41.022
But my preference is or
what the ultimate aim is that you're

151
00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:47.229
seeking to show your stakeholders that
there is hard evidence supporting

152
00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:53.654
your approach rather than it just being
based on your opinion as a designer.

153
00:09:53.654 --> 00:09:56.443
So we want some testing
again at this point, but

154
00:09:56.443 --> 00:09:59.524
again, we want to keep it very,
very lightweight.

155
00:09:59.524 --> 00:10:04.149
So how would you go about testing
style tiles or indeed any aesthetic

156
00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:09.034
approach you might do a final design
mock up and want to use this as well?

157
00:10:09.034 --> 00:10:13.729
This is where there is
a technique called a semantic

158
00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:18.539
differential survey,
which I mentioned earlier.

159
00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:20.652
And there are kind of
different ways you can do it.

160
00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:25.416
But, basically what you're doing is
you're testing the aesthetics with your

161
00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.844
target audience to see what they think.

162
00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:32.057
And it's done as a survey, right?

163
00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:35.443
And you could do this and styled tiles or

164
00:10:35.443 --> 00:10:39.248
final design comps or
both, if you want to.

165
00:10:39.248 --> 00:10:45.764
The way that this survey is worded can
vary, but the basic approach is the same.

166
00:10:45.764 --> 00:10:47.712
In approach number one,

167
00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:53.384
what you'll do is you'll show your
target audience the design, okay?

168
00:10:53.384 --> 00:11:00.302
And then you'll ask them to rate their
impression of the design on a scale.

169
00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:06.768
So let's say what would the brand word
you want to represent is cashew, right?

170
00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:12.607
So you'd have a one to five scale with
casual at one end formula at the other,

171
00:11:12.607 --> 00:11:13.255
right?

172
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:17.338
So another one might be
simple to complex or fun,

173
00:11:17.338 --> 00:11:21.130
too serious, and
they rate it on that scale.

174
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.949
And if it obviously rates towards casual,
which is the brand words you want,

175
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:28.562
you know your style toe or your design
is heading in the right direction.

176
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:31.650
You're good to go without having
to say the dreaded words,

177
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.200
what do you think do your stakeholders,
right?

178
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.103
You've got hard data instead.

179
00:11:37.103 --> 00:11:41.096
Now, if that doesn't appeal to you,
there is another method, right?

180
00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:45.357
If you're sliding scale is potentially,
some keywords don't work on

181
00:11:45.357 --> 00:11:49.204
a sliding scale, because they
don't have an opposite to them.

182
00:11:49.204 --> 00:11:53.827
So if you're in that kind of situation
then you show the style tile and

183
00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:57.574
you ask them to pick from
a whole selection of words which

184
00:11:57.574 --> 00:12:00.383
ones they feel best represent the brand.

185
00:12:00.383 --> 00:12:03.745
And that list of words would be,
your brand keywords,

186
00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:07.192
would be their opposites,
if they've got opposites.

187
00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:11.612
And then throw in some other random
keywords cuz sometimes somebody will come

188
00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:14.406
back and go,
I feel that design looks a bit cold.

189
00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:18.466
All right, so I'm gonna put the word
cold in and see if anyone selects it.

190
00:12:18.466 --> 00:12:19.973
So that's another way of doing it.

191
00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:24.149
And then the final way of doing it is
if it's a very competitive market, and

192
00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:27.216
people wanna compare
themselves to the competition.

193
00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:31.588
Or alternatively, if you've got lots of
style tiles and you wanna compare them

194
00:12:31.588 --> 00:12:35.440
against one another, you can ask
the questions which of the following

195
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.380
sites looks most approachable or
calming or whatever your keyword is.

196
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.785
And then they select
from a series of options.

197
00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:45.148
But basically it's the same thing.

198
00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:49.956
What we're trying to prove is
that are designed matches our

199
00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:54.764
brand keywords, all right,
to provide us with evidence so

200
00:12:54.764 --> 00:12:59.393
that this isn't going to
become a semantic discussion.

201
00:12:59.393 --> 00:13:00.108
Now again,

202
00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:04.622
all of those tests can be done with
usability hub that I mentioned earlier.

203
00:13:04.622 --> 00:13:08.719
There's also another tool called
maze which can be used for this.

204
00:13:08.719 --> 00:13:12.895
Again, it's very quick to set up,
and to run the test and

205
00:13:12.895 --> 00:13:15.956
you can get results back in under an hour.

206
00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:20.209
The only thing that makes this
slightly more trickier than

207
00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:24.893
the earlier example I gave of wire
frames is that you've got to,

208
00:13:24.893 --> 00:13:29.687
in this particular case have
the right target audience, right?

209
00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:32.555
So when it comes to usability and
find ability,

210
00:13:32.555 --> 00:13:37.361
unless your audience is has got some kind
of cognitive or physical disability,

211
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.680
maybe they're more old or
maybe they're very young.

212
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.086
Basically most of us will struggle
with the same things when it comes to

213
00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:44.729
usability.

214
00:13:44.729 --> 00:13:48.429
However, we will all have
radically different opinions about

215
00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:50.181
design aesthetics, right?

216
00:13:50.181 --> 00:13:55.005
And so you do need the right target
audience when it comes to the aesthetic

217
00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:56.122
side of things.

218
00:13:56.122 --> 00:13:59.700
Now again,
usability hub will help recruit people for

219
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.122
you, if that's what you need here.

220
00:14:02.122 --> 00:14:06.450
But ,to be honest most of the time,
I used to just use a mailing list, or

221
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.132
used your social media followers,
or something like that,

222
00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:12.454
to reach out to your target audience.

223
00:14:12.454 --> 00:14:16.383
And once you've got those style tiles and
once you know your style

224
00:14:16.383 --> 00:14:19.956
tiles are all right with your
target audience then really,

225
00:14:19.956 --> 00:14:23.120
its just a matter bringing
it all together, right?

226
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.787
It's a matter of bringing
those wireframes together, and

227
00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:33.216
bringing the aesthetic style tiles
together, into a final design.

228
00:14:33.216 --> 00:14:37.386
And by this stage,
it should be fairly straight forward.

229
00:14:37.386 --> 00:14:40.710
Because the stakeholders have
been involved in the creation of

230
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.240
the style tiles and the wireframes they've
seen and been engaged with that process.

231
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.294
You've done testing to provide
evidence around those things.

232
00:14:49.294 --> 00:14:53.570
So you're going to be in a really strong
position to produce the final design.
