00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.973
Okay, so you got a rough
idea of the kind of content,

2
00:00:02.973 --> 00:00:04.962
it's probably just a bullet list.

3
00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:09.208
Like bullets of questions, bullets of
functionality, bullets of whatever, so

4
00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:09.951
you got that.

5
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:11.618
Now what do you do with it?

6
00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:14.768
Well, the first thing to realize,

7
00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:19.398
is that can get pretty damn big,
right, that list.

8
00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:24.642
Especially if you work on international
websites like I tend to do with many

9
00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:29.651
different products across many
different parts of the organization.

10
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:33.637
And you're trying to deal with different
user groups, going different paths,

11
00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:36.756
I mean, obviously you don't tend
to deal with it all in one go.

12
00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:39.656
But even if you're just tending
to deal with one part of it,

13
00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:41.229
it can get really complicated.

14
00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.101
But even on a smaller side you can
end up with a not insignificant list.

15
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:50.048
So we need to basically now prioritize it,
right?

16
00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:54.506
Because not all questions, not all
objections, not all tasks are equal in

17
00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:58.635
people's minds, they care a lot
more about some things and others.

18
00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:00.057
And we need to highlight those.

19
00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:04.767
We need to make sure that that
functionality, that content,

20
00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:11.125
those answers, whatever, have floated to
the top and are quickly identifiable.

21
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:15.597
So the way that I tend to do
that is through something

22
00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:17.996
called top task analysis.

23
00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:23.080
And I'm not gonna get into a huge amount
here because it's a big old subject.

24
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.203
There's a great article on
the list apart website,

25
00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:33.399
where the guy who came up with this talks
you through the process, how to do it.

26
00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.143
So I've got link in the slides,
you can go and check it out yourself.

27
00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:39.403
But very briefly the summary of it,

28
00:01:39.403 --> 00:01:44.083
is you basically get users to prioritize,
right?

29
00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:48.393
You get them to say which of
the various tasks, objections,

30
00:01:48.393 --> 00:01:51.702
questions, matter most to them, all right?

31
00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:55.645
So that means when you start
wireframing you know, okay,

32
00:01:55.645 --> 00:02:00.240
at a glance they need to be able
to see this, this, this, and this.

33
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.720
And it really kinda helps
provide focus to where different

34
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.844
functionality is placed,
and how it's organized.

35
00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:14.305
The other thing that kinda, a little bit
of a tangent on this, is that something

36
00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:19.454
can be important to somebody within
a certain context at a certain moment.

37
00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:22.434
So, for example,
let's say in your insight,

38
00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:26.466
I'm now coming back to your example
a lot because you raised it.

39
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.031
But you talked about these micro
projects where you're looking at

40
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:29.864
a particular thing.

41
00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:34.426
I would still carry out a very lightweight
top task analysis in a situation

42
00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:39.281
like that, or at least think it through
in terms of what was most prioritized,

43
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:42.610
because, let's say you're
updating a form again.

44
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.703
Okay, so somebody's got a question
that's really important to them.

45
00:02:45.703 --> 00:02:49.721
But that doesn't necessarily mean that
question needs to be answered at the very

46
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.816
top of the form, cuz that might not be
when it comes into someone's head, right?

47
00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:55.049
They might not think of that.

48
00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.302
For example, what are you gonna
do with my email address?

49
00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:01.728
They won't think about that until
they get to the field that says,

50
00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:03.142
enter your email address.

51
00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:07.999
So being contextually aware is quite
important as well in those kinds

52
00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.176
of situations.

53
00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:13.659
But looking more kind of holistically
on a bigger website scale,

54
00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.143
once you've kind of prioritized
your content or content areas,

55
00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:22.150
and I'll say what you need to
do is start organizing that.

56
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.576
And the way that I tend to do
that is with card sorting.

57
00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.465
When I've got the budget and
time to do that, so

58
00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:35.162
instead of me guessing as to how content
should be organized and structured,

59
00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:38.507
I get some users to organize it and
structure it for me.

60
00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:42.985
There's a great tool that's free at
the moment called uxmetrics.com.

61
00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:47.234
That does open consulting,
and clouds card sorting, and

62
00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:50.278
to explain the difference very quickly.

63
00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:54.769
Open card sorting basically
allows people to organize your

64
00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.731
different content areas in
any way that suits them.

65
00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.826
With closed cards sorting, they have to
organize it within predefined buckets.

66
00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:07.766
So closed card sorting is better when
you're trying to validate a navigation

67
00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:12.098
you've already come up with,
while open card sorting is better for

68
00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:13.697
getting initial ideas.

69
00:04:13.697 --> 00:04:17.303
It's a really great tool, it talks you
through the process of how to do it.

70
00:04:17.303 --> 00:04:24.809
Essentially, basically users just
drag stuff into different groups.

71
00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:29.310
And then once they find those different
groups, they just basically name the group

72
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.056
whatever they want to name it, and
they can create multiple groups.

73
00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:37.577
And then you could analyze that data,
just to give you some kind of inspiration

74
00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:41.016
into how to organize that,
how to structure your website.

75
00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:42.508
It's not gonna do it for you,

76
00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:45.503
you're still gonna have to
make some educated decisions.

77
00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:50.650
But it's a really great way of
saving a lot of internal discussion.

78
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.746
Because one of the big problems that
you come across when you're working on

79
00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:56.697
information architecture,
which is what we're talking about here,

80
00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:58.632
is it becomes about ego and
politics, right?

81
00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:02.518
I wanna be on the top level section
because my team is the most

82
00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:03.695
important team.

83
00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:08.712
Obviously they don't say it like that,
but that's the underlying message, right?

84
00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:12.158
Or we wanna call our top section,

85
00:05:12.158 --> 00:05:16.721
top level product section, Gizmo 2.4.

86
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:22.055
Well, nobody knows what Gizmo 2.4 is, so
do we really want that in the navigation?

87
00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.217
So if you test and do card sorting,

88
00:05:24.217 --> 00:05:28.179
then you've got evidence that
voids all of that kind of stuff.

89
00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.391
So yeah, it does take a little bit more
effort and a little bit more time,

90
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:34.959
but it's really worth doing to avoid that.

91
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.258
Next thing I do is I then
map that content onto pages.

92
00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:41.607
So I've got my navigation,
it's done, look pretty.

93
00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:45.779
I've got the navigation running across
the side, I've got the sub navigation down

94
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.671
the, sorry, main navigation across
the top, sub navigation down the side.

95
00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:52.500
And then I'm just putting bullet
points of the questions and

96
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.894
things that need to be
raised on that page, right?

97
00:05:54.894 --> 00:05:57.558
So now I've got a map of my app,
my website,

98
00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:02.239
my whatever of how it all kind of fits
together without any attempt to design.

99
00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:05.448
So this is even before you do a wireframe,
really.

100
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:10.362
And like I said, I mentioned earlier
that I just kinda throw something like

101
00:06:10.362 --> 00:06:12.084
this together in notion.

102
00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:16.849
But you could use Google Docs, anything
that can interlink pages will do it or

103
00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.403
just do it in plain HTML.

104
00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:20.699
We could go old school.

105
00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.633
So just helps you now to see the structure
of the site however links together.

106
00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:29.006
In theory,
you could test that if you wanted to.

107
00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:33.029
You could test, can people navigate it,
can people find it?

108
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.870
But it is a great way of kind of
visualizing that cuz you can show your

109
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.383
client this, you can show your
stakeholders this, right?

110
00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:43.614
To minimize the surprise later on,
you could show them the research,

111
00:06:43.614 --> 00:06:45.112
you could discuss it with them.

112
00:06:45.112 --> 00:06:49.052
You could get them involved in things
like, for example, that brainstorming

113
00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:53.003
workshop of coming up with questions,
and objections, and functionality.

114
00:06:53.003 --> 00:06:55.091
Start building them into the process.

115
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.344
So we now wanna move a bit closer to being
able to actually do some wireframing.

116
00:06:58.344 --> 00:07:03.311
So the next thing is to start
chunking some of your content.

117
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:08.334
So one of the big problems that
you'll find when you're working on

118
00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:13.625
things like site structures,
is that you tend to start adding more and

119
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:18.845
more things to navigations cuz
everybody wants more and more stuff.

120
00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:22.096
She maybe start off with four top
level sections, then it becomes five,

121
00:07:22.096 --> 00:07:24.292
then it becomes six, and
then it becomes eight.

122
00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:27.537
Product categories are another great
example of this on e-commerce sites

123
00:07:27.537 --> 00:07:28.781
that get longer and longer.

124
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:33.827
Drop down menus on forms are another
example where they get longer and longer.

125
00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:38.409
So this is kind of a fundamental problem
you need to deal with when it comes to

126
00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.615
navigation and that kind of thing.

127
00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:43.656
So, the problem is that we can only hold

128
00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:47.723
about four things in our
short term memory, right?

129
00:07:47.723 --> 00:07:51.139
So that's why your credit card, if
you've ever looked at your credit cards,

130
00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:53.441
I better get my credit card out and
show it on camera.

131
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:56.058
That would have been a really bad idea.

132
00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:59.613
Well, if you look at your credit
card number it's 16 digits long and

133
00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:01.480
it's broken into four sets of four,

134
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.449
because we can only have four
numbers in our head at a time.

135
00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:08.408
So when you get into navigation
that's got like 20, 30, 40,

136
00:08:08.408 --> 00:08:13.274
categories in or something like that,
it's just, forget it, it's ridiculous.

137
00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:16.234
So the way you get around
this is by chunking it,

138
00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:20.313
just like the credit card numbers
chunked into four sets of four.

139
00:08:20.313 --> 00:08:26.139
So I tend to do that with content as well
as we're starting to think about content.

140
00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.483
So beginning with navigation.

141
00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:35.123
So if I'm working on a website like
the one that's on the screen now,

142
00:08:35.123 --> 00:08:39.320
I can split the navigation
into different groups.

143
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.416
So there's one group that is
dedicated to bout the company.

144
00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:47.198
There's another one that's the resources
that the company provides, and

145
00:08:47.198 --> 00:08:50.046
then the third one,
which is kind of utilitarian stuff.

146
00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:54.779
So we can do that kind of thing in our
navigation to help break things up.

147
00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:58.463
And then also even within
my content itself, right?

148
00:08:58.463 --> 00:09:01.384
That's where you think about a page,
and the pages structure and

149
00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:03.145
all the things you wanna communicate.

150
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:09.656
I tend to think in terms
of content blocks, right?

151
00:09:09.656 --> 00:09:14.196
And this is quite an important
thing to communicate to any content

152
00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:16.765
creator that you're working with.

153
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:20.686
Cuz a lot of people who aren't
familiar with writing for

154
00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:24.201
the web will produce reams
of copy [LAUGH], right?

155
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:28.650
Like they're writing an article, and
that's absolutely useless online.

156
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.286
People only read about 25%
of the copy on a page.

157
00:09:33.286 --> 00:09:37.701
And so, they scan it,
they don't read it word for word.

158
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:41.760
So what we wanna do is break up
our copy into content blocks.

159
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.968
So let's say we've got our
list of benefits, right?

160
00:09:46.968 --> 00:09:49.510
We identify some benefits,
or some questions,

161
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.681
or whatever kind of content you've got.

162
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:55.638
You wanna display each of those
as a separate content block.

163
00:09:55.638 --> 00:10:01.108
And that content block normally consists
of a heading, maybe a short description

164
00:10:01.108 --> 00:10:05.878
that explains what that benefit is,
what that feature is or whatever.

165
00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:08.235
And then maybe a link to more information.

166
00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:13.120
So if you're working on a content
heavy website, start talking very

167
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.109
early with your stakeholders about
content blocks and this concept.

168
00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:22.487
Because it stopped them delivering
content that really is inappropriate for

169
00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:23.302
the website.

170
00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:24.850
And I tend to show them
examples like this.

171
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.945
You can go to pretty much any website,
this happens to be the Stripe website.

172
00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:35.273
And you can see how basically they've got
content blocks within content blocks here,

173
00:10:35.273 --> 00:10:39.703
where you've got kind of a headings for
each content block.

174
00:10:39.703 --> 00:10:43.917
You've got short description,
a link, and an image, right?

175
00:10:43.917 --> 00:10:46.475
So as you start to draft up content,

176
00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:50.825
whether you're doing it on
behalf of your users or, sorry,

177
00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:56.048
your stakeholders, or whether you
are working with a content creator.

178
00:10:56.048 --> 00:11:01.677
Start thinking in terms of content blocks,
start thinking in terms of chunking.

179
00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:06.211
And I put all of that into notion,
my really crappy kind of

180
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:11.413
wireframe thing that just shows
the basic structure of the site.

181
00:11:11.413 --> 00:11:15.880
And only once I've done that do I
really start to wireframe pages
