00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.902
So before we move on completely from this
process, I do wanna take just a moment to

2
00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:08.740
pause and talk about defining
the stakeholder relationship.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.238
How we work with our stakeholders,
and by extension,

4
00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.279
our own relationship, our role,
and what we do as designers.

5
00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.466
So, this is so incredibly important
because, let's be honest,

6
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:25.478
most stakeholders provide a lot of
irrelevant feedback to the design process,

7
00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:28.278
or they attempt to micromanage the design.

8
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:33.138
And so it can be really helpful
at the very beginning of

9
00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:36.810
a project to define what their role is and

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.349
what you want them to
achieve within the project.

11
00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:46.236
So there are kind of three things
that I define as a client's role in

12
00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:47.644
a design project.

13
00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:54.424
Number one is that their job is to
find problems and not solutions.

14
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:57.395
I explained this to them right up front.

15
00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:00.573
And the example that I give is,

16
00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:06.810
let's say you're looking at
a design that I've produced,

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.984
and you're not entirely happy with it.

18
00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:15.958
Maybe it's aimed at
a preteen girl audience, and

19
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:22.243
I've used a lot of corporate blue in it or
something like that.

20
00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:26.583
Your desire as a stakeholder will be
to come back to me with a solution.

21
00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:29.709
Can you change the blue to pink, right?

22
00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.230
Which is maybe a perfectly good
solution to the problem, but

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.764
it doesn't educate me as to
what the underlying problem is.

24
00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:43.868
And it kind of stops you getting value for
money out me as a designer because

25
00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:49.399
if I don't understand the problem,
I can't suggest alternative solutions.

26
00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.651
So if you come to me and say, I'm worried,
the preteen girl audience isn't gonna like

27
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:57.515
the corporate blue, that's something I
can work with, and I might solve it.

28
00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:01.290
You can say, also,
shall we change it to pink?

29
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.653
That's fine, you can express an opinion.

30
00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:08.704
But I might come back and go, well,
actually, instead of changing it to pink,

31
00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:11.606
let's add, I don't know,
more unicorns and fairies or

32
00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:15.798
whatever it is that preteen girls like,
I don't know, I don't have a daughter.

33
00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:19.689
So but you get the kind of idea
that defining their role within

34
00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.143
the relationship works really good.

35
00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:27.027
I also say that their role is
to champion the business needs.

36
00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:31.149
They exist really to say, well,
this isn't going to work for

37
00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:36.162
the business or this is what we're
trying to achieve, that kind of thing.

38
00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:41.238
And then finally, I do suggest that
their role is to defend the user.

39
00:02:41.238 --> 00:02:45.303
Now, to be quite frank, my role as
a designer is to defend the user as well.

40
00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:48.043
But by actively giving
it to them as a role and

41
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:52.340
saying to them that upfront and
repeating that through the project,

42
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.467
it just reminds the client
not to forget the user.

43
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:59.621
If they're made responsible for the user,
then they think about the user.

44
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.253
So just take a bit of time to define
the relationships up front will make

45
00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:04.617
an enormous difference.

46
00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:09.604
So really, that's all I wanna
say about that kind of overall,

47
00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:16.001
how to run a design project, and how to
make the different stages work, and all of

48
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:22.239
that before we get into the very specifics
of how to approach the design, etc.

49
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.200
So I thought it might be helpful to have
a little checklist summary cuz I know

50
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.237
I dumped a lot of content on you in a very
longer length of time than I thought,

51
00:03:32.237 --> 00:03:35.501
but still a lot of information
in the short time.

52
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:41.732
So, this is really a checklist before
you start doing a design project, right?

53
00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:45.250
These are the things that
I would advise you to do.

54
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.495
One, define both your role and
that of the client,

55
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.603
that will make an enormous
difference upfront.

56
00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:57.109
Second, outline your product process,
even if you don't use the project process

57
00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.075
that I've presented and you use
a slightly different one, that's fine.

58
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:06.728
But make sure you clearly explained
to the client what's gonna happen,

59
00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:12.154
when it's gonna happen, and specifically
why that is a good approach, all right?

60
00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:17.357
Then a greater set of design principles
that can aid your decision making.

61
00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.745
It will be something you
can come back to time and

62
00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:23.523
time again through the project to keep
the client or stakeholder on track.

63
00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:29.289
Make sure you carry out
as much user research as

64
00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.811
you can within the limitations
you're operating with.

65
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.897
And as a minimum,
turn that into empathy maps,

66
00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:39.038
you might want to do customer journey
mapping and other things as well.

67
00:04:39.038 --> 00:04:42.550
But that depends on what
you've got available.

68
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.134
And then agree on that list of key
performance indicators to define success

69
00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:50.058
because you can come back
to that later as well.

70
00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:55.263
And then finally, identify and
speak to as many stakeholders as possible.

71
00:04:55.263 --> 00:04:58.794
Search out those hidden stakeholders,
right?

72
00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:02.968
So that senior manager that you don't
normally get to talk to, try and

73
00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:06.788
find access to that person, and
find out what their agenda is and

74
00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:08.516
draw them into the process.

75
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:13.200
If there's an unofficial stakeholder,
my nephew says,

76
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.040
that kind of stakeholder, then find
those and engage with them as well.
