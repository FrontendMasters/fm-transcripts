00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.310
You've got your content
straight in your mind,

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.978
it's all kind of beginning to
form up in a bit of a wireframe.

3
00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:09.702
You haven't even thought
about aesthetics yet, but

4
00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.374
that's okay cuz that's a problem for
another day.

5
00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:16.474
We just wanna be sure that this
wireframe is right, right?

6
00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:19.674
And the reason we wanna be sure
that this wireframe is right is A,

7
00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:21.346
we wanna deliver a good product.

8
00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:26.131
But B, we don't want our client or
our stakeholders picking it apart later.

9
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:29.185
We need solid evidence to back it up.

10
00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:33.638
Now, you could do a huge
amount of testing on this.

11
00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:38.244
You could do A/B testing,
you could do usability testing,

12
00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:40.783
you could do all kinds of things.

13
00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:45.638
But to be honest, I think it can
become a little overkill in that.

14
00:00:45.638 --> 00:00:49.593
And you end up doing testing for
testing sake because that's what you're

15
00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:54.270
supposed to do, rather than testing that's
actually useful in achieving our goals.

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.212
So most of the time
there's just two really

17
00:00:58.212 --> 00:01:02.712
lightweight tests that I
do on wireframe pages.

18
00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:06.604
And they can both be used with
a tool called UsabilityHub.

19
00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:10.542
There are other tools available, but
that happens to be the one that I use.

20
00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:15.304
And the two tests are called a 5-second
test and the first-click test, really,

21
00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:16.603
really lightweight.

22
00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:24.326
So let me explain the 5-second test first.

23
00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:29.577
So a 5-second test, basically,
you take your wireframe of any key page,

24
00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:35.176
you might do it with multiple pages cuz
you probably have wireframed quite a few.

25
00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:40.540
And you get a URL that you can send
out to users through social media or

26
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.979
email, friends and family,
doesn't really matter.

27
00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.469
It can be anybody that's not involved with
the project for this kind of test, right?

28
00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.776
When we talk about aesthetics later,
it needs to be the target audience.

29
00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:57.340
But in this situation, it really can
be just anybody outside of the project.

30
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.596
You send them a link,
they go to a website,

31
00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:03.319
they're shown the wireframe that
you're testing for five seconds.

32
00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.341
I normally set it for a bit longer, right?

33
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:07.423
I normally set it for eight seconds.

34
00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:11.913
The reason being is because of that
research that says we've got about

35
00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:15.273
eight seconds to swing
somebody to get them to stay.

36
00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:19.395
So eight seconds, show them it,
then it gets taken away.

37
00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:22.803
Then you can ask whatever
question you wanna ask, right?

38
00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:27.570
So the two main questions I ask,
depending on the type of website,

39
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.391
let's say it's a marketing website.

40
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.843
I might ask the question,
what does this company do,

41
00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:36.079
and does it look appealing to you?

42
00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.266
Could be as simple as that, right?

43
00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:42.313
The more common question, which is
one that you can use in almost all

44
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:46.646
circumstances, is the question,
what do you remember from this page?

45
00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:51.393
Write a list of all the elements
that you saw, right?

46
00:02:51.393 --> 00:02:54.705
So as a kid, I don't know whether you ever
played that game where you put loads of

47
00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:56.791
things on a tray,
you covered it with a tea towel.

48
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.338
You saw it for a few seconds,
covered it back up,

49
00:02:59.338 --> 00:03:01.650
and you had to remember
what was on the tray.

50
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.734
It's that, basically,
in a website testing form.

51
00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:09.167
So then you can pay attention,
did they see all the key elements?

52
00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:11.737
Did they see what I needed them to see,
right?

53
00:03:11.737 --> 00:03:16.702
So from the top task analysis, I know
that they need to see this, this, this,

54
00:03:16.702 --> 00:03:18.974
and this, did they see it, right?

55
00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:21.519
Great, hard evidence.

56
00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.457
So what that'll prove,
you know the classic make my logo bigger,

57
00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:28.671
right, it's become a meme.

58
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:31.399
So why do clients say make my logo bigger?

59
00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.102
Cuz they're worried people
will miss their branding and

60
00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:35.909
won't realize who they are, right?

61
00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.947
Do a 5-second test.

62
00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:38.102
Did people see the logo?

63
00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:39.271
Yes, they did.

64
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:41.135
We don't need to make it bigger then.

65
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:42.807
Solved it, instantly.

66
00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:48.741
But also it's like,
that's below the fold, right?

67
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:50.344
They might not see it
cuz it's below the fold.

68
00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:51.151
Did they see it?

69
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:52.274
Yes, they did.

70
00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.759
Don't need to worry, right?

71
00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.317
5-second test.

72
00:03:57.317 --> 00:04:00.253
The other tests I do is
called a first-click test.

73
00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:01.732
Again, a really easy test.

74
00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:04.121
Does your navigation work, all right?

75
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.737
Do people know where to go to find x,
okay?

76
00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:11.211
Really simple to test.

77
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:15.863
One of the most fascinating things is if
somebody gets, first, let's say you're

78
00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:20.925
testing something really deep in your app,
right, some hidden piece of functionality.

79
00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:25.672
There is a fascinating piece of research
that shows if they get the first click

80
00:04:25.672 --> 00:04:29.398
right, if they're heading in
the right direction, okay,

81
00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:33.657
the probability of them completing
the task jumps up considerably.

82
00:04:33.657 --> 00:04:38.878
So that's why the first click matters so
much, right?

83
00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:40.228
So let's say you wanna test,

84
00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:42.827
are they gonna find this
particular feature in your app?

85
00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:46.586
You show the homepage or
the feature or the, sorry,

86
00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:51.723
the homepage of the app or the overall
interface of the app or whatever.

87
00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:57.310
And you say,
let's imagine you wanted to do x, right?

88
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.297
Where would you click?

89
00:04:59.297 --> 00:05:02.706
And then you see where they click on
the page and you get a heat map back.

90
00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:06.335
And the heat map will basically show
you where they clicked on the page.

91
00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:09.927
Did they click on the right link to
take them in the right direction or

92
00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:10.691
did they not?

93
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:15.408
If they did, you know you're heading in a
good direction with the interface, right?

94
00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:19.394
Now it's not that you didn't follow
the user the whole way through yet, but

95
00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:20.211
that's okay.

96
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:22.783
You know that they got
the first click right, and

97
00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:26.120
that's good evidence to show
you're in the right direction.

98
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.463
Those two tests you can set up and
get results back that

99
00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:37.412
are valuable in under an hour,
doing both of them, right?

100
00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:40.628
It is so quick and so simple to do.

101
00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:45.909
And if you go, but
I can't recruit the people, right?

102
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.422
I don't know why you would do that,
but yeah, I can't recruit the people.

103
00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:53.435
Well, like I said, you can use anybody,
you can use friends and family.

104
00:05:53.435 --> 00:05:58.574
But even if you wanted to do people
that were a bit more appropriate,

105
00:05:58.574 --> 00:06:01.461
UsabilityHub will recruit people for

106
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:06.439
you to complete these surveys for
like a dollar a person, right?

107
00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.370
It's so easy,
there is no reason not to do this.

108
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.972
You think how many man hours have been
wasted sitting in meetings, debating

109
00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:20.850
with various stakeholders about is the
logo big enough or will people see this?

110
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.666
Or will they understand that or any of
these questions, stop discussing it,

111
00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:27.677
just test it, it's so simple.

112
00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:31.008
And going back to your little micro tests,

113
00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:36.752
these kinds of tests are ideal for
those scenarios, really simple to do.

114
00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:41.237
So yeah, don't worry,
yeah, go for your question.

115
00:06:41.237 --> 00:06:46.797
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
how would you factor in annoying content

116
00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:51.803
like legal, cookies, or must have text?

117
00:06:51.803 --> 00:06:56.303
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I work a lot in
the financial services sector,

118
00:06:56.303 --> 00:07:02.413
which is highly regulated, and so
I'm battling with this all the time.

119
00:07:02.413 --> 00:07:06.807
You quantify how big a damage it's having,
right?

120
00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:10.177
So there's a couple of ways of doing that.

121
00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:16.126
One is that you run your 5-second test,
right?

122
00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:20.502
One without that information in there and
one with it in there, right?

123
00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:22.380
And you do a comparison between the two.

124
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.665
Do people not spot
important stuff as often

125
00:07:26.665 --> 00:07:31.187
because of all the clutter
of the legalese and

126
00:07:31.187 --> 00:07:35.364
terms and conditions around it, right?

127
00:07:35.364 --> 00:07:38.372
So you could do a 5-second test and
a comparison 5-second test,

128
00:07:38.372 --> 00:07:39.813
that's one way you could do it.

129
00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:43.213
The other way you could do it is you could
do it through your A/B testing, right?

130
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:47.394
We're gonna A/B test with that
stuff there and with it out there.

131
00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:50.658
Now your problem is that A/B testing
is gonna be more problematic cuz you

132
00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:53.293
might be doing that with live
transactions on a live site.

133
00:07:53.293 --> 00:07:57.587
So that segment of the audience
will be non-compliant.

134
00:07:57.587 --> 00:08:02.202
If you're in that kind of situation,
you probably can't do A/B testing and

135
00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:04.551
you'll do a 5-second test instead.

136
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:07.708
You can also do something called
a semantic differential survey, right?

137
00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.125
Which I'm gonna come to in a minute,
which is a very pretentious name for

138
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:12.593
a really great, easy survey.

139
00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:17.229
And what you can judge there is how
much through a survey like that of doing

140
00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:18.599
a comparison again.

141
00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:23.957
You can judge how much that
legalese undermines trust or

142
00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:27.721
some kind of emotional response to it.

143
00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:30.974
So you can test both whether
it's distracting people and

144
00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:33.964
whether it's making them
less likely to purchase.

145
00:08:33.964 --> 00:08:37.940
So I'll come on to the other
survey in just a minute, but yeah
