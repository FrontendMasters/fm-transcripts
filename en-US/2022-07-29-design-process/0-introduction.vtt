00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.240
Hello, and welcome to this course
on mastering the design process.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.720
And whatever your background,

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.690
I'm pretty convinced that this
course is gonna prove helpful.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.077
So whether you work in-house, whether
you're a freelancer, whether you work for

5
00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:14.706
an agency.

6
00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:19.459
The advice that I'm gonna give today
should really help you to get control of

7
00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:20.657
design projects.

8
00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:24.170
And the advice that I'm gonna
give will apply pretty much,

9
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.736
whether you're working on an app,
whether you're working on a mobile app or

10
00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:33.183
a web app, it makes no difference,
whether you're working on a website.

11
00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:35.355
So whatever you're working on,

12
00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:40.711
the advice I'm gonna give should help you
better manage those design projects and

13
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.984
avoid some of the pitfalls
that come with design.

14
00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:48.428
Cuz I'm guessing that because
you are watching this course on

15
00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:53.306
Frontend Masters that you love your
code and you love doing coding.

16
00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:57.125
But my question for you is,
can you say the same about design?

17
00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.957
The truth is, design projects
are pretty challenging, aren't they?

18
00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:04.359
When it comes to coding,
it either works or it doesn't.

19
00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.588
Yes, you can debate about
the best way of coding and

20
00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.606
how to go about approaching
it in the right way.

21
00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:15.631
But at the end of the day, there's nobody
really sitting over your shoulder,

22
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:19.223
sharing their personal impressions of it,
are there?

23
00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:23.112
And those people that are commenting
on your code, at least, probably know

24
00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:27.324
something about code, your average
stakeholder or client isn't gonna do that.

25
00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:32.142
But design, on the other hand, everybody's
got an opinion about, everybody thinks

26
00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:36.113
they're right, and that is what
we're gonna get into in this course.

27
00:01:36.113 --> 00:01:39.810
We're gonna look at how
to overcome some of those

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.688
challenges that we face as
designers running design projects.

29
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.382
But before we get into that,

30
00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:50.343
I think it's worth just me introducing
myself a little bit first.

31
00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.837
My name is Paul Boag.

32
00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:55.626
I've been working in this industry for
over 27 years.

33
00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:57.684
Now, I'm ashamed to say,

34
00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:02.165
13 of which I have been involved
in running my own agency.

35
00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:05.409
So I'm very familiar with
running design projects or

36
00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.039
that my agency was a full stack agency,
we did both design and development.

37
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.206
And then since then, I've spent
the last six, seven years, whatever,

38
00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.712
I can't remember exactly, working on
advising and helping other agencies and

39
00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:22.971
freelancers to optimize their processes,
and how they go about working.

40
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:27.502
So I'm very familiar with some
of the challenges that go around

41
00:02:27.502 --> 00:02:29.643
working on design projects.

42
00:02:29.643 --> 00:02:32.932
And I've worked on projects for
all sizes of clients as well.

43
00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:37.645
And so whether you happen to work for
large multinational companies, or

44
00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:42.435
whether you work for small startups,
the advice I'm gonna share today,

45
00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:44.384
I think is gonna be relevant.

46
00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:47.272
No matter the size of
the company worked for,

47
00:02:47.272 --> 00:02:49.784
no matter the sector that you work for.

48
00:02:49.784 --> 00:02:52.000
So what am I gonna share?

49
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.238
Well basically, what I'm gonna
share is my experience of running

50
00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:58.821
design projects in the last 27 years.

51
00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:04.466
Experience that I regularly share online
via my blog, and my books, and my emails.

52
00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:08.328
And actually, in this slide deck
that I'm gonna be sharing with you,

53
00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:13.120
I've got links and detailed information on
everything I've talked about on my site.

54
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.010
So there'll be links that you can click
through, and go read more information.

55
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.523
I've got links to all of the apps,
etc., that I cover on this.

56
00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:24.480
So the slide deck, I'm hoping, is gonna
be really useful for you after the fact.

57
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.224
And I've got a lot of information that
may be, you're not gonna be able to read

58
00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:30.835
everything that's on the screen
as we go through, but

59
00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.180
afterwards you can return to it.

60
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.520
So there you go, that's a little
bit of background information.

61
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.369
Let's now, dive in and
look at what we're gonna cover today.

62
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.740
We're essentially gonna look
at four key areas, okay?

63
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.800
And these really are the four factors
that make the biggest difference over

64
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.700
whether a project like a design-based
project is successful or not.

65
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.558
So the first one is how you actually run
the design project, how you organize it,

66
00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:02.380
how you structure it,
the different processes that you use.

67
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.123
All of that kind of information will
help you tailor your projects in such

68
00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:11.025
a way that you get less pushback
when it comes to the design.

69
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:14.474
And don't worry those of you
who are very technical-based,

70
00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:18.665
that doesn't undermine how you will
inherently want to work on projects.

71
00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:21.572
In fact, it complements it quite well.

72
00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:26.151
So we're gonna look at how to run
a design project really well.

73
00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:31.580
We're also gonna look at how to go
about producing those initial design

74
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.737
concepts in a way that, again,
it reduces the amount of friction,

75
00:04:36.737 --> 00:04:41.551
and conflict, and
disagreement people get about the design.

76
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:46.432
And people coming up with comments like,
I don't like the color, or

77
00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:50.161
it just doesn't wow me, or
can you make my logo bigger.

78
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:54.881
All the classic things that you hear
when you have to deal with design.

79
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:59.201
Once we've looked at how to produce the
initial design, then we're gonna get into,

80
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.790
well, how do you present
that in a compelling way?

81
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.294
And specifically, how do you manage
the feedback you get on design?

82
00:05:07.294 --> 00:05:13.835
And ensure that that feedback doesn't
become really problematic, all right?

83
00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:15.001
Then finally,

84
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:20.840
we're gonna look at what happens when
that design is actually built, okay?

85
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.162
So whether you're building
the design yourself or

86
00:05:23.162 --> 00:05:25.430
you're getting someone
else to build it for you.

87
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.314
There can often be compromises
made during the build process, and

88
00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:34.620
that's fine, and that's as it should be.

89
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.038
But how do we ensure that the design
survives that process and

90
00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:43.080
more importantly,
survives post launch, right?

91
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.680
So once your website is out in the world,
what happens to it then?

92
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.379
Because, let's be honest, we've all been
in situations where we've gotten our

93
00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.552
portfolio, we worked on this site and
it looked great in the screenshot.

94
00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:59.533
And then people click through,
and go and see the live site,

95
00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:03.408
and it looks like a train wreck, because
it hasn't survived the test of time.

96
00:06:03.408 --> 00:06:09.006
So to the person that said about they're
looking to learn more design and

97
00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:14.236
how to become a better designer,
that there is already a course that

98
00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:19.498
we produced about how to create
compelling websites that convert.

99
00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:24.395
So you might wanna check that one out,
because that will be much more helpful

100
00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:28.386
in doing the design fundamentals and
what makes good design.

101
00:06:28.386 --> 00:06:33.160
This course is more about how to get that
sign off, [LAUGH] which is the critical

102
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.060
thing, and how to keep the design
moving through the process.

103
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.204
So, yeah, I think this will be from
the audience you've just described.

104
00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:47.464
It's gonna be a helpful
presentation to anybody, really,

105
00:06:47.464 --> 00:06:54.372
who is either actively involved in design,
wants to be doing more design work or

106
00:06:54.372 --> 00:07:00.685
as one of the people here today,
described it is just designed curious.

107
00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:04.370
This will be a really great course for
all of you guys.
