00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:04.272
Now, if you're really tight on time and
budget,

2
00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:08.662
then you can skip the wireframing bit and
just use whatever you did in notion.

3
00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:13.223
But actually, it's really worth to start
visualizing it a little bit more so

4
00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:16.814
people can see how the content
is gonna be placed on the page.

5
00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:20.875
Now we're starting to explore some
of the structure, and layout, and

6
00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.050
flow of the actual individual pages.

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.091
And Greyscale wireframes are a great
opportunity to organize your content,

8
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:32.899
test your layout, establish your page
flow without necessarily getting

9
00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.326
drawn into those conversations
about aesthetics.

10
00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:39.289
What color blue it is or whatever.

11
00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.041
So that's why I like wireframing.

12
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.719
I don't wireframe every page of a website.

13
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.733
I wouldn't wireframe necessarily every
page of an app or state of an app.

14
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:56.670
It kinda depends what's appropriate
in an individual situation.

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.695
So the typical things on,
let's say a website I would wireframe is

16
00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:07.723
things like the homepage, any key landing
pages, kind of standard text page.

17
00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:13.733
But I also will tend to if we're getting
into a lot of kind of functionality and

18
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.942
interaction.

19
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:19.604
I will tend to wireframe those because
that's gonna make it a lot easier for

20
00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:24.488
a developer that's has to pick it up if
they can see exactly how it's gonna work

21
00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:25.376
and operate.

22
00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:29.915
So things like forms,
ecommerce checkouts, account management,

23
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.726
app functionality, etc.

24
00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:37.595
So those are the kinds of things
that I tend to wireframe.

25
00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:42.750
So far I've kind of talked about
the process of creating content,

26
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.628
but I'm talked a lot about how we
can integrate this clients and

27
00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:50.574
our stakeholders into that process,

28
00:01:50.574 --> 00:01:54.829
which is a really important
part of the whole process.

29
00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.043
So, there's a couple of
little exercises that I do.

30
00:02:00.043 --> 00:02:02.421
And I'm not talking really
about content creators here,

31
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.297
I'm not talking about the people
that gonna write the final content.

32
00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:08.450
I'm talking about everybody
else that has an opinion

33
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.189
[LAUGH] on what should be in this app or
website.

34
00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.397
So it's a couple of things I do.

35
00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:18.479
One little exercise I do is called
the user attention point exercise.

36
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.758
I've got a link to this and I'll do this.

37
00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:26.411
You know those scenarios where people
kind of just keep stuffing more and more

38
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:30.936
content or more and more functionality
into any particular page, right?

39
00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:33.947
And it becomes this big problem cuz
everybody just wants to have one

40
00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:35.901
more thing, just one more thing, right?

41
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.573
We just got to put this disclaimer text
here, or we've just got to put this error

42
00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:44.898
message, or this announcement, or
we've got this event coming up, and

43
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:49.060
we need to meet and before you know it,
it ends up this kind of hot mess.

44
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.417
[LAUGH] So the user attention point
exercises the way of dealing with this.

45
00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:57.469
So what I basically do is I get all
of those different stakeholders that

46
00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.383
have all got opinions about what
should go on this, whatever it be,

47
00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:03.184
let's say a homepage for now.

48
00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:07.847
And I basically get them to brainstorm
everything that needs to go on this.

49
00:03:07.847 --> 00:03:12.509
Absolutely every element,
from the drop down menus to the privacy

50
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.851
policy to everything
that's gone on the page.

51
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.309
And they normally come up with
a pretty damn long list, right?

52
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.854
So I let them get it all
out of their system.

53
00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:26.015
And seeing all those things side
by side instantly makes them go,

54
00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:27.612
that's a lot of things.

55
00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:33.346
And then I introduced the idea that
users only have limited attention.

56
00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:39.118
And there's actually a really
good Times article that says,

57
00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:44.779
we've got about eight seconds
to grab someone's attention

58
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.674
using a particular website,
or app, or whatever.

59
00:03:49.674 --> 00:03:55.477
And I say, okay, so we know we've got
about eight seconds to communicate

60
00:03:55.477 --> 00:04:01.095
the key information on this particular
page, let's be optimistic and

61
00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:05.887
say, people can look at three
elements in a second, right?

62
00:04:05.887 --> 00:04:12.258
But that is the equivalent of 24
points of user attention, make sense?

63
00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:15.342
So now you spend your 24
points of user attention,

64
00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:19.266
they'll have more than 24 elements
written down for a start, so

65
00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:22.722
that immediately they've got
to start removing things.

66
00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:26.883
But here's the killer catch, right?

67
00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:30.310
You might want somebody to look at
some elements more than others on

68
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.298
the page, right?

69
00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:36.286
So you want people to pay more attention
to your strapline than your privacy

70
00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:37.481
policy, right?

71
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.762
So you have to give it more
user attention points.

72
00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:45.474
So, basically, you could give
all 24 just your strapline and

73
00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:48.884
have nothing else on
the page if you wanted to.

74
00:04:48.884 --> 00:04:51.797
Or you can give one point to everything,
but

75
00:04:51.797 --> 00:04:56.698
then your privacy policy is gonna
appear as important as your strapline.

76
00:04:56.698 --> 00:04:59.523
So they have to reach a middle ground.

77
00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:04.038
So you get to get them to go away and
do this exercises they go through, and

78
00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:08.269
they make some attempts to spread
the points around, but not a lot.

79
00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:12.704
It's like two points here, one point here,
one point here, two points here, etc.

80
00:05:12.704 --> 00:05:14.752
So they narrow it down a little bit, but

81
00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:17.369
they don't quite get it
normally in the first go.

82
00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:21.334
And then when they've done,
you congratulate them, you thank them for

83
00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:25.429
getting rid of so many elements that
they've removed from their list, but

84
00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.641
you probably haven't gone far enough.

85
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.680
Let me show you.

86
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.616
And I bring up the Google homepage and
say the Yahoo homepage, right, and

87
00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:36.095
you say, which is better of the two?

88
00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:39.721
And they will go with Google,
Google's really easy you to use,

89
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:41.009
it's really simple.

90
00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.877
Where they spend like 15, 16, 17 points
on the search box alone, while Yahoo

91
00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:52.269
have spread out all over the place and
there's far too much going on the page.

92
00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.023
And it's like this light bulb moment for

93
00:05:55.023 --> 00:05:59.654
stakeholders where they go,
yeah, we've not focused enough.

94
00:05:59.654 --> 00:06:04.136
And you get to redo the exercise and
they'll make all the hard decisions for

95
00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:08.620
you and remove all this clutter from
the website without you having to argue

96
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.849
with them, right?

97
00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.019
You've just created the environment for
them to learn to do it themselves,

98
00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:18.917
and immediately now they feel
engaged with the content.

99
00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:23.126
They are better educated about the
content, and so it means that they're less

100
00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:27.679
likely to reject the design because you're
just reflecting back what they agreed.

101
00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.073
So that's a really good one.

102
00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:32.291
And then I've already talked
about defining content blocks.

103
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.854
And once you've decided what
needs to appear on the page,

104
00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:38.321
then you can start working with clients
around the different content blocks.

105
00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:41.329
You don't need to worry about
the exact wording at this stage,

106
00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:43.213
but rather focusing on key messaging.

107
00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:48.029
And if you engage them a little
bit with that, they feel like I've

108
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:53.471
contributed there as well, and so
then you just wanna frame it up really.

109
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:57.862
But I really would highly encourage
people when it comes to the wireframe to

110
00:06:57.862 --> 00:06:59.755
pick the right tool for the job.

111
00:06:59.755 --> 00:07:06.026
I see so many people jumping into Figma or
Sketch to do wireframing.

112
00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:08.946
It takes far, far too long.

113
00:07:08.946 --> 00:07:13.203
And you end up getting stuck into
designing screen elements and

114
00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:16.345
what should it look like and
all the rest of it.

115
00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:20.409
And it's too early for that stuff, right?

116
00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:22.630
And you'll be too
precious over the design,

117
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.553
and when you show it to the client,
they won't like it, and

118
00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:28.483
then you've spent long time creating it,
don't do that.

119
00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:31.459
So there's a couple of tools
that I tend to prefer.

120
00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:35.407
This Balsamiq, which is a tool
that's been around forever.

121
00:07:35.407 --> 00:07:39.258
Brilliant for really quickly
throwing together wireframes,

122
00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:42.170
are very lightweight,
quick to put together.

123
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:47.964
My latest favorite is Whimsical,
which does very similar thing.

124
00:07:47.964 --> 00:07:51.402
Really lets you mock up pages,
just drag elements in, and

125
00:07:51.402 --> 00:07:53.865
you can put pages together very quickly.

126
00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:58.380
Or if you are absolutely
set on using figma or

127
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.902
sketch, then use a wireframing template.

128
00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:05.446
My favourite is this one called form for

129
00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:08.694
envision where it's got
ready made components.

130
00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:12.738
You literally just drag in and assemble
the page and put in your own content.

131
00:08:12.738 --> 00:08:16.445
So really quick and nasty,
these are supposed to be because

132
00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:21.339
they're a discussion point, they're
to include the client in the process,

133
00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:24.306
show them something early,
get them engaged,

134
00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:29.594
get them focusing on the content and the
structure rather than getting distracted.

135
00:08:29.594 --> 00:08:33.069
Before we move on to kind of
testing these wireframes,

136
00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:37.765
any questions around that process of
going from content to wireframing?

137
00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:44.445
Because I'm aware that
it's quite a lot there.

138
00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:48.298
And by the way, when it comes
to questions, I include, yeah,

139
00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:49.625
buts in that as well.

140
00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:52.989
Yeah, but
pool that may work in this situation.

141
00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:58.070
But in my situation, I'm quite happy
to talk about some of those as well.

142
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.657
So yes, go for it.

143
00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:02.902
&gt;&gt; At what point do we go
from discovery to prototype?

144
00:09:02.902 --> 00:09:04.846
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question actually.

145
00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:09.649
Yeah, when the money and time runs out,

146
00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:13.475
it's probably [LAUGH].

147
00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:18.934
Yeah, there is no definitive
answer to something like that and

148
00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:20.898
it is a judgment call.

149
00:09:20.898 --> 00:09:25.338
For me, I think you get diminishing
returns at certain point.

150
00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:30.560
You could carry on doing user research and
competitive analysis forever, but

151
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.274
normally before that, there is a pressure
organizationally to move the project on.

152
00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:41.527
So a discovery phase is almost always
as long as you can get away with rather

153
00:09:41.527 --> 00:09:46.794
than it being, okay, we need to now
make a conscious decision to move on.

154
00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:51.591
If you are in a position of making
a conscious decision to move on,

155
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.910
then a lucky you.

156
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.704
But I think that moment for
me would be when you feel

157
00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:02.613
confident that you've
learned enough to be able to

158
00:10:02.613 --> 00:10:07.420
create a wireframe,
that's the honest answer.

159
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.065
So you need to have a clear understanding
of what the questions, objections, and

160
00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:12.751
tasks are.

161
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:16.153
You need to have a clear understanding
of who your audience is,

162
00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:17.640
what the ultimate goal is.

163
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.610
You need to have an understanding
of any constraints on the project,

164
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.162
any broader context of the project
such as competition, etc.

165
00:10:27.162 --> 00:10:30.637
But once you've got that,
you're good to go really.

166
00:10:30.637 --> 00:10:32.088
Any other questions?

167
00:10:32.088 --> 00:10:34.370
&gt;&gt; And which of the four
phases are we in right now?

168
00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:38.993
&gt;&gt; We're talking about with
the content and the wireframes.

169
00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:42.543
This would be prototyping,
very much in the middle of prototype.

170
00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:44.604
I'm sorry, that wasn't clear.

171
00:10:44.604 --> 00:10:47.623
Yeah, we're now out the discovery phase.

172
00:10:47.623 --> 00:10:52.943
With the questions, objections, and tasks,
just getting that initial list together,

173
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:56.168
that might,
you could do that in the discovery phase.

174
00:10:56.168 --> 00:10:57.247
It's kind of fluid.

175
00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.184
It's up to you really.

176
00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:02.548
I will often have an initial
stab at it in discovery

177
00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:06.566
just to give me a sense of what
we're gonna be prototyping.

178
00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:10.394
But as soon as I've got that
initial bullet point list,

179
00:11:10.394 --> 00:11:15.532
I wouldn't do any more on content
until we start prototyping personally.

180
00:11:15.532 --> 00:11:18.544
But it's up to you to some extent,
make it your own,

181
00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:22.180
I don't think you're gonna do
harm if you wanna do it earlier.
