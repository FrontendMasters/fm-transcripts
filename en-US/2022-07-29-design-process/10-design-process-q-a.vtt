1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.192
So really,

2
00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:07.850
that's all I wanna say around that
particular process of running projects.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.395
So before we get into how to go about
producing initial design, I just wanna

4
00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.740
come at you very hard with a lot of
information in a short length of time.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.362
So I wanna give you an opportunity
to ask some questions.

6
00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:22.803
If you happen to be
watching this not live,

7
00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:27.590
I'm always open to answering
questions via email as well.

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.300
You're more than welcome to
drop me an email anytime.

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.071
Once you get the slide deck,
you've got my email address.

10
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:34.178
Feel free to use it.

11
00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:39.630
Now, I know you had a question
because you work in-house, don't you?

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.450
So tell me about your situation.

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.342
&gt;&gt; So a lot of times, we don't design.

14
00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:53.279
I mean,
we kinda squeeze a lot of design process

15
00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:57.106
to do early tests on certain things,

16
00:00:57.106 --> 00:01:02.292
specific things like if
we do a drop-down instead

17
00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:06.621
of a button or
if we do a series of buttons.

18
00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:14.514
We call that AB testing, but
it's kind of like discovery, in a way.

19
00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:17.746
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where do you see that factored in to

20
00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:19.712
the design process?

21
00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:24.169
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what you're talking
about there is the kind of micro

22
00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:28.885
projects that you run internally
to optimize something over time

23
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:33.446
rather than the big project like
redesigning a whole website.

24
00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:38.082
Actually, I'll still use that same
basic process in that situation.

25
00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:43.770
But it's a very, very small scale
because the project is very, very small.

26
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.570
So my discovery phase is really validating
the problem in the first place.

27
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.390
So typically, let's say, for example,
you've got a form that's underperforming,

28
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.750
right, on the website.

29
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.471
So first of all,

30
00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:01.620
you've got to identify that that
form is actually underperforming.

31
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.023
So that's where you look
at your analytics, and

32
00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.949
your analytics will basically confirm
that there's dropouts from that page or

33
00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.959
whatever else, so
that you do that as part of the discovery.

34
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.542
Then you'd probably look at some heatmaps
or session recording of that page.

35
00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:22.142
That's where something like Microsoft
Clarity comes in if you want something

36
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.700
free or I suspect you guys have something
like Hotjar or something like that.

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.898
So then you're validating where
on the page that form is failing.

38
00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:31.500
Is it this drop-down menu?

39
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.070
Yeah, we can see it is from users.

40
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.192
So that's your discovery phase
is defining the problem, okay?

41
00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:41.129
Your prototyping stage is
what you just described.

42
00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.668
If we remove the drop-down menu and
we try buttons instead,

43
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:50.297
we create a little mock-up of that,
see whether that works.

44
00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:54.440
Now, how you test that, you're talking
about testing it with some AB testing.

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.709
That's absolutely valid because if you can
throw something together very quick and

46
00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.880
easy in that situation that you can
run a real AB test on, that's awesome.

47
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.070
The only thing that I would
say is with AB testing,

48
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.870
you're learning why a problem.

49
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.531
No, so you're learning that
something works or doesn't,

50
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:22.432
but you're not necessarily learning
anything about why, if that makes sense.

51
00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:29.078
So actually, I tend to favor kind
of usability testing at that stage,

52
00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:35.965
not facilitated, not that I have to
sit down and watch all these people.

53
00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.936
But basically, you send out a link,
let them try it,

54
00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:41.450
let them talk over as they're doing it.

55
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.785
So you get some more
insights that way I find.

56
00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:48.347
And then from there, once that's been
done, once you're happy with it,

57
00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:50.963
it goes into build where you
launch it on your website.

58
00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:54.521
Then your equivalent of the live stage,
right, so

59
00:03:54.521 --> 00:04:00.005
you've pushed it live now, that's
the point where I would do the AB testing.

60
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.950
And I would see how well it's performing
compared to what we had before.

61
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.677
So it's exactly the same stages,
it's just in a really kind of micro way.

62
00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:12.511
Does that answer the question?

63
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:15.747
Good, what have we got in the chat room?

64
00:04:15.747 --> 00:04:20.750
&gt;&gt; Does Paul consider getting content
created to be an important part of

65
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.290
the process or does he prefer to delegate
all the words to the stakeholders?

66
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.505
&gt;&gt; No, I do not prefer to delegate
all the words to the stakeholders.

67
00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:37.102
Look, I mean, that is a whole
workshop in itself, that question.

68
00:04:37.102 --> 00:04:38.130
It's a really good question.

69
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.774
Basically, content, yeah, in your
discovery phase, right at the very front,

70
00:04:42.774 --> 00:04:45.805
you wanna involve all
the key stakeholders, right,

71
00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:49.731
which will include the content creators,
includes the developer.

72
00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:52.249
When you get to the prototyping stage,

73
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.149
I would heavily involve the content
creators at that point.

74
00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:02.436
When I do a grayscale wireframes,
that is with first draft content in it.

75
00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:03.581
It doesn't need to be perfect.

76
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:10.180
It doesn't need to be 100%, doesn't have
to even have the right tone of voice.

77
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.115
But I need to know what content
is gonna go where on the page,

78
00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:15.245
what messaging is gonna be communicated.

79
00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:20.854
So yes, your content creators should
be very, very much involved in that.

80
00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:25.928
That said,
it's not always possible because

81
00:05:25.928 --> 00:05:33.744
content is often created by people
that aren't full time in that role.

82
00:05:33.744 --> 00:05:39.169
And so as a result, they're always
a bit slow in delivering that.

83
00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.937
So what I would suggest in those
kinds of situations is that

84
00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:47.062
actually you draft first go content.

85
00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:50.847
Now you might think, whoa,
I'm not a copywriter.

86
00:05:50.847 --> 00:05:53.600
I'm not good at any of that.

87
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.806
It doesn't need to be good, right?

88
00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:58.889
In fact, almost if it's bad,
that's better.

89
00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.571
[LAUGH] I know it sounds so weird.

90
00:06:00.571 --> 00:06:03.917
What you will do is you will identify
what kinds of content needs to go

91
00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:05.160
into different places.

92
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.036
So let's say you're designing a homepage.

93
00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:09.280
You'll go, okay, we want benefits here.

94
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.470
Here are the three benefits
that spring to my mind, right?

95
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.522
Doesn't need to be researched,

96
00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:16.557
doesn't need to be considered,
doesn't need to be anything.

97
00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:20.848
The role of you putting real content in
is you set a placeholder on the page that

98
00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:24.027
says benefits are going in here,
right, which is good.

99
00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:28.347
And secondly, because your
content might be not very good,

100
00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:32.595
then what will happen is that
forces the content creators.

101
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:35.241
They suddenly go, no, no,
no, we're not having that.

102
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:36.803
And so they'll put something else in.

103
00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:39.898
So it's a way of kind of
forcing them into action.

104
00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:41.505
But yeah,
you should absolutely integrate them.

105
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:44.799
You should be using real content
from the very beginning.

106
00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:48.490
Never go with lorem ipsum ever.

107
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.069
I know it's so tempting,
but please don't do that.

108
00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.820
&gt;&gt; You have been using websites as
an example of deliverable per project.

109
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.388
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How much of this advice pertains to

110
00:06:58.388 --> 00:07:01.330
products such as web apps or mobile apps?

111
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.379
&gt;&gt; It applies 100%.

112
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:09.146
Sorry, I'm showing a little bit my bias
in the kind of work I do, I suspect.

113
00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:13.345
I do a lot of conversion rate optimization
work on effectively marketing websites.

114
00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:19.167
But no, I also over the years have
worked extensively on web apps and

115
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:22.447
exactly the same principle applies.

116
00:07:22.447 --> 00:07:27.162
All the way, I can't think of anything
I've said that doesn't apply to that.

117
00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:31.040
If they can think of any
particular problem that maybe

118
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.522
what I've suggested doesn't work with,
then by all means,

119
00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:39.243
let me know through the chat and
we'll discuss it.

120
00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:43.732
But now, I would say it's pretty much
consistent across the whole thing.

121
00:07:43.732 --> 00:07:45.839
Yeah, I tend to use shortcuts.

122
00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:49.526
I say the word website when I
mean web app and mobile app.

123
00:07:49.526 --> 00:07:53.460
I also use the word client when I mean
internal stakeholders as well, so

124
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.649
apologies for that.

125
00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:59.731
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think from my perspective,
that's the biggest difference is

126
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:05.674
usually in the agency world, you have
an external client who's paying the bills.

127
00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:08.878
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Whereas it's management and

128
00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:10.990
product situation.

129
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And they're not

130
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.110
necessarily paying your bills,
where you have to sell them on a process.

131
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.830
You just have to have a process and
go through.

132
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:23.402
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes and no, I think I've
worked with a lot of in-house teams.

133
00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.697
And actually, there's not as
big a difference as you think.

134
00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:30.912
The way you described it is 100% right,
but actually,

135
00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:36.151
I think a manager can almost be more
problematic than a client sometimes.

136
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:41.013
Because with a client,
if I set the relationship up right,

137
00:08:41.013 --> 00:08:47.110
then the client that I'm working
with is my peer, my equal, right?

138
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.892
So I can turn around and say, no,
I don't think that is appropriate.

139
00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:52.613
We're not going down that road.

140
00:08:52.613 --> 00:08:59.013
That can be quite hard to do with
someone who's your line manager, right?

141
00:08:59.013 --> 00:09:03.783
You feel of a bigger obligation to kind of
roll over and do whatever they ask you.

142
00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:07.527
So actually, you do need to sell
just as hard, if not harder,

143
00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:10.911
to justify what you're doing and
why you're doing it.

144
00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:12.931
At least that's been my experience, but

145
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:15.538
other people might have
had different experiences.

146
00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:18.838
I guess it depends on the kind of
boss you've had over the years.

147
00:09:18.838 --> 00:09:24.160
I had some terrible bosses [LAUGH] so
that could be probably clouding my view.
