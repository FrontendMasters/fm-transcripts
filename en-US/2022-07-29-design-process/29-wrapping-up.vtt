00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
So, thank you very much for joining us.

2
00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.649
I hope you found this really
useful presentation and

3
00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:08.820
introduction to managing design process.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.420
Something I'm very passionate about.

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.970
There's no need to suffer through
the hills of endless iteration.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.710
There's no need to have your design
taken over by other people and

7
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.690
turned into design by committee.

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.415
Just need a proper
structure to get through.

9
00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.882
So thank you very much for listening and
sticking with me through this.

10
00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.343
If you've got any questions,
drop me an email anytime.

11
00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:32.153
Otherwise, good luck.

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:36.603
