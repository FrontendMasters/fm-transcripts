00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.692
Quickly wanna mention build, I don't wanna
get into it in a huge amount of detail,

2
00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:06.766
because it's a little bit beyond
the scope of what we're covering.

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.321
But the build stage is where
the website is turned into a functional

4
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.058
website, right?

5
00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:14.300
It's where the design is finalized,
you make it fully responsive,

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.869
everything works, it operate at scale.

7
00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.802
It's better to completely finalize
the design in the browser.

8
00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:27.310
So there is a design elements still
going on here, I would argue, right?

9
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.186
I see people spend hours mocking
up every form of button,

10
00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.596
every form error message,
and everything else.

11
00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:38.038
When really, that's a lot easier
to just do in the browser

12
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.848
sitting alongside the developer
than it is to do it all in Figma.

13
00:00:41.848 --> 00:00:46.276
So I think involving the designer at
this stage is still essential and

14
00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:48.349
still something you should do.

15
00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:49.884
How do you do that?
Well, obviously,

16
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:53.238
you're working on the fully
responsive design at that stage.

17
00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:56.260
You're looking at all the buttons and
form states, all that kind of stuff.

18
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.310
You're looking at your error messages.

19
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.485
This is where you get into
things like design systems,

20
00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.130
animation to enhance the design.

21
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.570
And again, you can do some last minute
usability testing at this stage.

22
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.112
But again, that's all a lot of stuff.

23
00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:15.588
You might not have the time or
capability to do that.

24
00:01:15.588 --> 00:01:20.780
So the minimum here is, look,
you've gotta work with the developer

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.630
to work out button states and
how forms work and error messages.

26
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.988
And I'm sorry that I know that
there are some pure developers

27
00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:33.236
listening to this that don't do design,
but

28
00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:38.630
we can't be allowing developers to
make these kinds of design decisions.

29
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.783
It's a train wreck, right?

30
00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:46.684
When your error messages read some
code that nobody understands,

31
00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:49.930
you know that developer has been involved.

32
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.040
Just saying, sorry to offend.

33
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.220
Okay, so that's the minimum.

34
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.311
And then finally, live, well,

35
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:01.550
that's one we're talking about this
perception that a project ends, right?

36
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.770
We've redesigned the website, we're done.

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.672
And then in five years, the website
is piling, steaming massive BS,

38
00:02:08.672 --> 00:02:13.509
because it hasn't been maintained,
it hasn't been looked after.

39
00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.849
So that's why from the very beginning,
I talk about the life stage.

40
00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.516
Once the website is launched, how are we
gonna maintain it, how are we gonna

41
00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:24.777
improve it, how are we gonna optimize it,
how are we gonna maximize conversion, etc?

42
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.089
And really, until a website goes live,

43
00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:31.577
even if you've done usability testing,
user research, you've really only

44
00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:35.334
got a theoretical knowledge of how
users are gonna respond to it.

45
00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:39.695
So the live phase allows you a chance
to observe user behavior and

46
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.080
that kind of stuff.

47
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.586
And that's where you're
looking at analytics,

48
00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:48.008
you're looking at session recordings,
heat maps, AB testing, usability testing.

49
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:52.614
As an absolute minimum, I would recommend
you have up and running on a website,

50
00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:54.630
a tool called Microsoft Clarity.

51
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.220
Microsoft Clarity is a great free
tool that it's a bit like Hotjar.

52
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.385
It lets you watch sessions back.

53
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.067
It lets you see where people
are getting frustrated on a website,

54
00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:05.500
where they're making mistakes.

55
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.750
It gives you loads of really great
insights, and you just check that,

56
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.429
see where people are going wrong and
fix it.

57
00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.900
But we'll come on to more of
that kind of stuff later.
