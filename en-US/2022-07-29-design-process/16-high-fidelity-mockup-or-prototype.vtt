1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.170
So, let's talk about creating that
high fidelity mockup for a moment.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.730
So, there are there are various
ways of going about this.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.255
But what the one little thing that I would
say that you wanna keep in mind is that

4
00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:20.150
you do wanna pass this via developer
before you show it to the client right.

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.330
And get their feedback and
their thoughts on it.

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.530
And as well, I will say, as you
are creating your high fidelity mockups.

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.962
If you are not gonna be
the person building it,

8
00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:39.682
I would highly recommend that as you
build it in something like Figma sketch,

9
00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:42.681
you keep the developer in mind, right?

10
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.116
I know I'm speaking to the converted here,
because I know that vast majority of

11
00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:51.630
people that will watch this video
are actually developers as well.

12
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.244
But one of the great things
about tools like Figma and

13
00:00:55.244 --> 00:01:01.010
Sketch these days is they've got really
powerful developer tools if you use them.

14
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.042
So just by way of example,
In things like Figma and Sketch,

15
00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:10.380
use their components and
styles in there, right?

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140
Don't set the font every size.

17
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.388
Don't pick the color every time you'll end
up picking slightly different colors and

18
00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.550
slightly different fonts but
instead create a library.

19
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.954
So that there is consistency for

20
00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:25.876
the developer when they come
to do this kind of work.

21
00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:30.420
Also another more recent tool that's
began to emerge is auto-layout

22
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.060
features it's particularly
strong in Figma.

23
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.808
So instead of positioning
all your elements by eye,

24
00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:38.310
all that looks about right.

25
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.708
Have a robust underlying layout system and
then use auto layout

26
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:48.526
to position elements rather than
just dragging it around to design.

27
00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:52.271
It's gonna make it so
much easier when it comes to the build for

28
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:56.955
developers because they can just look at
this has got this amount of padding or

29
00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.930
this amount of margin
without having to go well.

30
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.424
On that side, you've got 13 pixels because
you've just kind of positioned it by eye.

31
00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.827
And at the bottom, it's eight pixels and
it's all a little bit out and

32
00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:13.923
they have to kind of create rules around
this stuff do it for them use auto layout.

33
00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:18.064
So I just wanted to say a couple
of little things around that and

34
00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:22.927
think of won't anybody think of
the developer because they're the ones

35
00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:26.105
that have to pick up your horrible mess.

36
00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:27.289
Name your layers kids,

37
00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.815
as well that's another big one
that often gets overlooked.

38
00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:33.085
Anyway, I digress.

39
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.306
Let's talk about quickly to
sanity checking your mockups.

40
00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:38.868
So I mean,
we've done a lot of testing already, and

41
00:02:38.868 --> 00:02:41.666
I don't wanna make it any more
complicated for you guys,

42
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:45.183
cuz I know time is often limited when
it comes to doing this kinda thing.

43
00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:49.876
But there is one little glorious tool that
is worth its weight in gold right, and

44
00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:51.850
it's called a tension insight.

45
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.275
And what you can do is you can
take your Figma mockup of a page.

46
00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.301
And you can do I upload
it to this website and

47
00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:04.610
it's dirt cheap I think it's about
$18 a month or something like that.

48
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.660
It's not very expensive and
it's worth it you'll see why in a minute.

49
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.180
You upload your design to it.

50
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.966
Now it takes hundreds and hundreds of
hours of eye tracking studies to predict

51
00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:20.290
with machine learning where people
are gonna look at your design right.

52
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.015
And this clients lapped this stuff up,

53
00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:27.649
[LAUGH] It's only I think of it as
a spell checker for for a designer.

54
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:32.456
So it's okay to ignore some of it
what it shows you because it's

55
00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:35.188
It's not always a 100% right.

56
00:03:35.188 --> 00:03:37.294
But, it will give you a heat map,

57
00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:41.380
that will show you where people
will look on the page, okay?

58
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.360
With a 90 plus degree of accuracy, right?

59
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.930
Percent degree of accuracy.

60
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.177
So you can then show this to your
clients and you can prove to them that,

61
00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:55.276
if the person is facing in this direction,

62
00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.650
they're actually seeing
the call to action.

63
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.021
But if I replace that image with
the rubbish when you suggested,

64
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:04.150
then they won't see the call to action.

65
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.059
You've got evidence to back
up your design decision.

66
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.771
And it cuts through so
many arguments I cannot express it,

67
00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:15.990
you show them this and they'll shut up.

68
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.090
So yeah, check that out as
it's a really useful tool.

69
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.110
Now oftentimes,
it's enough to stop at this point, right?

70
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.870
You've got your design mockups, you've got
a grayscale wireframes you've got evidence

71
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.844
to support both of those, it could
easily move on to presentation time now.

72
00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:37.670
But it might be that you wanna go ahead
and create a high fidelity prototype.

73
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.786
So that's instead of it being
a single mockup of one page,

74
00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:46.157
you're creating an interactive
experience from end to end.

75
00:04:46.157 --> 00:04:49.762
Now this depends on the size of
the project and its complexity and

76
00:04:49.762 --> 00:04:53.140
stuff like that but
it can be a good way of working.

77
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.798
But in my opinion,
there is very little point of creating

78
00:04:56.798 --> 00:05:01.754
a high fidelity prototype of the whole
thing, unless you're gonna use it for

79
00:05:01.754 --> 00:05:03.600
testing purposes, right?

80
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.559
Really, the wireframes should be enough
for a developer to be able to see

81
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.468
all the different functionality that
the mockup is gonna be enough for,

82
00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:17.700
to set the aesthetics and stuff like that.

83
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.110
So I only do a high fidelity prototype
if you wanna do lots of testing.

84
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.732
And if you are gonna be testing,

85
00:05:22.732 --> 00:05:26.893
we're talking about things like remote
usability testing most of the time here.

86
00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:29.028
Testing a prototype with a small number,

87
00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:33.255
probably no more than six people to see
if they can complete critical tasks.

88
00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:35.935
You can normally get away with
carrying that out just over Zoom.

89
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.945
There are specialist
tools if you want them.

90
00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:41.895
And then there's also some
unfacilitated usability testing,

91
00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:45.620
where you're gonna test the prototype
with larger numbers of users.

92
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.149
By asking them to complete critical tasks,
and

93
00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:51.510
then you're gonna watch back
the sessions afterwards right?

94
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.498
They're both valid approaches in the first
approaches when you're one to one and

95
00:05:55.498 --> 00:05:59.900
talking to people, you can ask a lot
of questions, which is really good.

96
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.351
But if you want large numbers of people,

97
00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:07.182
you don't wanna be able to sit in through
every single one of those sessions, so

98
00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:11.020
instead you do unfamiliar,
facilitated usability testing.

99
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.520
Again there's some great tools out
there for doing that kind of thing.

100
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.490
Things like Lookback Maze
will help with that.

101
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.030
So let's just do a quick checklist on your
kind of design and prototyping phase.

102
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.991
What you need to keep in your mind and
then we shall move on and

103
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:28.690
start talking about presenting.

104
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.120
So first of all, identify and
draft your content.

105
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.080
So don't start with the design
start with your content.

106
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.601
Run card sorting to help you
create your site hierarchy and

107
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:44.111
stop your client putting stupid
jargon in navigation and

108
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:48.300
making there too many top level
sections and all that kind of stuff.

109
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.809
Create your wireframes at least for
critical pages and

110
00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:57.682
interlink those pages together into an
interactive experience which you can then

111
00:06:57.682 --> 00:07:00.140
to lightweight testing on.

112
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.003
Then produce your style tiles based
on those agreed keywords and again,

113
00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:06.890
do that very lightweight testing.

114
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.998
And then bring your aesthetics and
wireframing together into a prototype or

115
00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.968
a mockup so
we can see the complete package.

116
00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:19.548
And then just do a little bit of sanity
checking on that final design using that

117
00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:21.390
attention's insight tools.

118
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.430
Or do some last round usability testing,
if you've got the budget to do that.

119
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.817
So that's a little bit about
the process that I personally use for

120
00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:35.124
creating design I'm not saying
it's the only way of doing it but

121
00:07:35.124 --> 00:07:40.180
it's the one that I find manages and
controls the design process the most.
