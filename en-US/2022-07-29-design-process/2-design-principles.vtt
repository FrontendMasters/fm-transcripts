1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.880
So that's what we gonna do.

2
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.910
How do we do all of that stuff?

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.852
Right, so let's actually get
into the process that enables us

4
00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:12.420
to deliver on those
solutions to the pitfalls.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.045
And actually it starts even before
you begin sketching an idea or

6
00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.830
thinking about design.

7
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.929
From the very very outset when you
first talk to your stakeholders,

8
00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.030
I would encourage you to agree on
a set of design principles, okay?

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.436
Now this is gonna work slightly
differently depending on whether you work

10
00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:40.840
in house or
whether you work externally, right?

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.828
So are you a freelancer or
an agency or if you work in house.

12
00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:49.108
So first of all let's explain
what design principles are.

13
00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:53.282
What design principles are a set
of short statements, right?

14
00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.998
That define how you're
gonna go about making

15
00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:01.600
decisions regarding design
during the process.

16
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.957
So for example, a design
statement might be something like,

17
00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:13.100
we make decisions with data not opinion,
right?

18
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.780
That's a great statement that
we can refer back to and go.

19
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.517
Well hang on a minute we're getting
into opinion based territory here,

20
00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:23.040
we said we make decisions with design.

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.260
Another might be,
we make it accessible for all, right?

22
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.618
Well, that's a great
idea you've just had Mr.

23
00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:32.955
Stakeholder but actually it's gonna
make the design accessible and

24
00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:37.030
we did agree upfront, we were gonna
make it accessible for all, right?

25
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.170
We do testing, right?

26
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.797
It might be another one.

27
00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:43.669
Well, well the project's really busy,
we're running out of time,

28
00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:44.845
we need to push on with this.

29
00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:48.690
Well hang on, we agreed upfront
that testing was important to us.

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.381
Do you get the idea of
why you might do this?

31
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:56.198
That design principles help move
the decision process away from

32
00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.676
people's personal opinions
in the moment and

33
00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:04.682
more towards a framework for
making educated decisions as you go.

34
00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:08.280
So they're really really valuable to have.

35
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.122
And if you wanna learn more
about design principles,

36
00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:15.416
there'll be a link in the slide deck that
enables you to get through to a great site

37
00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:19.290
that's got hundreds and hundreds of
examples of these kinds of things.

38
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.200
So this is just one example.

39
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.780
This is an example that was
produced by the UK government.

40
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.485
They've got a set of ten design
principles that dictate how

41
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.751
they go about doing design.

42
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:40.290
So for example, some of them
are about designing with data, right?

43
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.086
So they let data drive decision
making not hunches or guesswork.

44
00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:47.466
They've got things like
start with user needs.

45
00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:51.541
That you start by identifying the user
needs and if you don't know what those

46
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:55.933
user needs are you're not gonna build the
right thing so you need to find out that,

47
00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:59.265
you need to do your research,
you need to talk to users, etc.

48
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:02.610
So whatever your set of
design principles are,

49
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.459
I think they provide you with a decision
making framework that you can

50
00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.910
refer back to in the heat of
the moment when you get into design.

51
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.450
So how do you decide on
your design principles?

52
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.378
Well, there's a couple of approaches that
you can take depending on whether you

53
00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:22.650
work in house or
you work at an agency or a freelancer.

54
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.020
If you work in house and

55
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.920
really I think you need to decide
this organizationally wide, right?

56
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.705
And that obviously
the bigger the organization,

57
00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:33.826
the more complicated that becomes but

58
00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:38.670
essentially what you're looking at doing
is some kind of workshop, all right?

59
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.650
It doesn't need to take very long and
you get effectively stakeholders

60
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.547
from across the organization so
typical stakeholders are involved in

61
00:03:48.547 --> 00:03:53.280
design projects and effectively,
you run a very simple exercise.

62
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.611
So what I normally do when I do this
in-house for organizations is I

63
00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:03.760
go to that website I mentioned
a minute ago called design principles.

64
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.980
And they've got design principles
from hundreds of companies, right?

65
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.800
If your company has got design principles,
they'll be listed on this website.

66
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.887
So I go through and I select say 20 or 30
different design principles from different

67
00:04:16.887 --> 00:04:22.250
companies that I feel like might be
relevant to this particular organization.

68
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.847
And then I put one design principle on
a card so you end up with a stack of 30 to

69
00:04:27.847 --> 00:04:34.590
50 cards with design principles on and
basically we just do some voting, right?

70
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.188
We take the cards and people I give
them say five points to spend or

71
00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:43.970
to mark each card that they think
is good or good design principle.

72
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.797
And they can either spend all their five
points on one card that they think is

73
00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:51.991
really, really important or they could
spread their points around a little bit,

74
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.830
whatever they wanna do.

75
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.230
And we use that to then pick the top
six or so design principles,

76
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.880
have a bit of a discussion around it,
job done, right?

77
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.480
So it doesn't need to be big or
complicated.

78
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.331
If you're a freelancer or
if you run an agency or work at an agency,

79
00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:15.317
then really I would suggest
actually a selling point,

80
00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:18.436
a differentiator for
you as a freelancer or

81
00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:23.530
an agency is to have your own
set of design principles, right?

82
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.073
Because it's very hard to differentiate
yourself as a freelancer or

83
00:05:28.073 --> 00:05:32.631
agencies, I design websites, well,
so do X million other people.

84
00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:37.370
But you can distinguish yourself
from the way you do it, all right?

85
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.985
And your attitudes towards it and

86
00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:42.500
your design principles become
representative of that.

87
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.739
And so if you're in that kind of situation
which of course I am as a freelance

88
00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:51.651
consultant, I will go into a company and
say, look, these are my design principles,

89
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.790
these are how I operate.

90
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.850
Are these in line with your thinking?

91
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.159
And if they wanna tweak and
change them a little bit for

92
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.780
their particular organization,
that's fine.

93
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.895
But as long as it doesn't then completely
conflict with how I see the world and

94
00:06:05.895 --> 00:06:10.264
if it does completely conflict with how I
see the world, then that's a big warning

95
00:06:10.264 --> 00:06:13.520
sign for me that maybe this isn't
a client I wanna work with.

96
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.186
So spending a bit of time agreeing
a set of design principles.

97
00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:24.816
So just to reiterate, design principles
are not the process of how you

98
00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:29.379
build a website but it's about how
you make decisions in the moment.

99
00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.680
Those little microdecisions,
whether you go with blue or red, right?

100
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.112
Well, one might be more
accessible than the other or

101
00:06:38.112 --> 00:06:42.540
if there's no real difference
between them, let's test them.

102
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.520
So that's how your design principles
can make a difference within a project.

103
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.210
But what about the kind of process for
running the project as a whole.
