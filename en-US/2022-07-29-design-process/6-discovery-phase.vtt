00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.290
Okay, discovery, what is it?

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.474
Well, discovery phase is a period of time,

3
00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:09.691
which can be anything from
a single workshop if it's a very

4
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:14.526
cheap project to about eight weeks for
a bigger internal project.

5
00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:20.608
The phase is just dedicated to defining
the problem that needs to be solved,

6
00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:22.803
and the project's scope.

7
00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:28.898
And it's also there to help unearth any
potential issues that might come up,

8
00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:29.567
right?

9
00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:33.375
Is there legacy technology that's gonna
limit us is there compliance issues that

10
00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:34.322
are gonna limit us.

11
00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:38.217
So we clear about who the user or
the audience is,

12
00:00:38.217 --> 00:00:40.980
have we done our user research?

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.776
What are our feelings about accessibility?

14
00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.397
Who's gonna run this site for
the long term?

15
00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:48.127
All of those questions you deal
within discovery up front.

16
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.580
So why should you do this?

17
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.350
So carrying out discovery fails helps to
reduce your scope creep because it will

18
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.479
uncover any constraints to the design and
provide better context for

19
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.774
decision making during the project.

20
00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:05.800
So what do you actually do
in the discovery phase?

21
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.089
How do you run them?

22
00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:09.585
Typically you'll do some user research,

23
00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:13.967
you'll interview any key stakeholders
that are involved in the project.

24
00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:17.954
You might wanna carry out a competitive
analysis, that's something that sometimes

25
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:21.330
I do in discoveries depends
on the size of the project.

26
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.430
You research any constraints
that exist around the project.

27
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.360
And you might review any website or
apps or

28
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.550
anything kind of that is there
already serving a similar purpose.

29
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.783
So that's all the things you could
do in a discovery phase, but

30
00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:43.687
I'm very conscious that there are probably
people watching this that are,

31
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:47.730
working on much smaller projects and
it's like, well, that's quite a lot.

32
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.920
I've only got five grand budget for
the whole thing.

33
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.190
So you don't need to do all of that,

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.400
you can condense your discovery phase into
a kickoff meeting or something similar.

35
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.909
So what is the minimum that I like to do
with the discovery phase when budgets

36
00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.490
are really tight or when I'm advising
agencies with really tight budgets?

37
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.350
Well, I kinda do a couple of things.

38
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.190
First of all, I do something
called an empathy mapping, right?

39
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.271
So I'll sit down with the client and
we'll brainstorm some basic stuff about

40
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:19.420
the audience we're trying to reach,
what tasks do they wanna complete?

41
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.865
What journey are they on what influences
them what their overall goals and

42
00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.000
pain points and feelings are, right?

43
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.565
So basically a persona.

44
00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:30.359
If you want more detail on
creating those empathy maps,

45
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.730
I've linked to an article I wrote
that discusses how to do that.

46
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.340
I'm not gonna get into
the depths of doing that here.

47
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.240
But just basically to
understand your users properly,

48
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.060
only takes about half an hour
to do an exercise like that.

49
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.565
And then the other thing I do is defined
some key performance indicators,

50
00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.030
all right?

51
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.600
So what do I mean by that?

52
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.646
Well, we basically need a measurable
way of knowing whether this site has

53
00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:59.000
succeeded.

54
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.380
So, it typically clients are really
crappy at defining this.

55
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.269
So I tend to have to guide them
through the process and again,

56
00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.264
there's an article about how to do that.

57
00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:12.748
But I'll take their overall
company objectives, right?

58
00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:15.630
What are you trying to do
in the next fiscal year?

59
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.540
Okay, we're trying to increase revenue.

60
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.470
Well, that's too vague for us to use
as a measurable thing on this project.

61
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.010
But okay, what does that translate to?

62
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.790
How does the website help with
that goal of increasing revenue?

63
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.140
Well, it needs to generate more leads.

64
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay, that's great,
that's a bit more tangible.

65
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.870
Okay, what can we do that actually
really we can measure then?

66
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.766
Okay, well,

67
00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:43.544
we can measure maybe the number of online
forms submitted on the website, or

68
00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:48.414
the number of people visiting the contact
us page, really tangible things.

69
00:03:48.414 --> 00:03:53.267
And tying that down upfront is
invaluable to you because it will

70
00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:57.399
mean that if you can prove
that the design is working.

71
00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:02.006
And you can also remind people what their
goals are when they go off on tangents and

72
00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:06.373
go, well, I want the social media
buttons really big on the homepage.

73
00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:10.959
But hang on a minute you said your primary
goal was more leads not more followers,

74
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:11.910
all right?

75
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.990
So it's really good to have
these well defined goals.

76
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.100
So just do that.

77
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.920
If that's all you can do, that's great.

78
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.160
So, how do you decide on the cost of that?

79
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.453
Well, normally you're kinda forced at the
beginning of a project to give a ballpark

80
00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:27.550
for the whole thing.

81
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.534
There's no getting around that everybody
wants to budget, don't commit to it.

82
00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:37.532
But say, previous projects I've worked
on that are not dissimilar to this come

83
00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:40.898
in the ballpark of 30k,
right, or whatever it be.

84
00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:45.525
So, for the discovery phase I
recommend dedicating about 10% of

85
00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:49.680
the that to the discovery phase,
that big ballpark figure.

86
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.567
So if you said the 30K, 3K,

87
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:56.400
how much we're probably gonna spend
doing a discovery phase, right?

88
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.550
And then you tailor your discovery phase
to fit within that approximate budget.

89
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.530
So that's how I price that first bit,
which is a bit kinda neppy lesson.

90
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.647
It's very much dependent on
how big the project is and

91
00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:11.800
how much they've got to spend on it.
