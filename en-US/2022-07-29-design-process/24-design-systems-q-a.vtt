00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:04.823
So I hear that we've got a couple
of questions in, which is good.

2
00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:07.264
What we got?

3
00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:11.054
&gt;&gt; At what scale do you think
about a design system and

4
00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.049
when it begins to matter?

5
00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.913
How many designers before the effort
put in begins to pay off?

6
00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:24.347
&gt;&gt; I can only talk from my
own personal experience.

7
00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:29.953
But I think a design system
is always worth having.

8
00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.815
I don't think you need multiple designers
to get value out of the design system.

9
00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:40.184
I think what you need is a design that you

10
00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:46.377
are going to be returning
to multiple times.

11
00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:51.526
So which, in my opinion,
should be almost all designs, right,

12
00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:58.383
especially what we're about to move on to,
post-launch optimization of a website.

13
00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:03.019
And so if you are going to be evolving and
improving your website over time,

14
00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.815
it really is helpful to
have a design system,

15
00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:11.128
because you can assemble new pages, new
approaches very, very quickly and easily.

16
00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:16.453
So no, it's not about having
multiple designers so much, as I

17
00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:23.198
think it is about having a design that
you're gonna be returning to regularly.

18
00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:27.838
And that could be any size site,
it doesn't need to be a massive

19
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:32.579
multinational, a small e-commerce
site may well justify it.

20
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.460
In fact, it's very rare for
me to work on a site that wouldn't benefit

21
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.443
from a design system, and not all of
my projects are big, by any means.

22
00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:45.767
Sorry, yes,
hopefully that answers the question.

23
00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:49.562
Is there another one?

24
00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:54.170
&gt;&gt; What do you do when you realize you've
made a mistake after the presentation

25
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.198
which could lead to major
problems down the road?

26
00:01:57.198 --> 00:02:01.007
How would you address those mistakes?

27
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:06.549
&gt;&gt; I guess it depends
on the type of mistake.

28
00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.745
I have been forced in the past
to do project resets,

29
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:14.954
it's like the new killer
option if all else fails.

30
00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:19.797
And basically I say, I will sit
down with a client and say, look,

31
00:02:19.797 --> 00:02:21.484
this isn't working.

32
00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:23.183
Something's gone wrong.

33
00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:28.854
The relationship's gone wrong,
the design direction is gone wrong.

34
00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:34.343
Let's circle back and instead of
just trying to patch what we've got,

35
00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:37.463
let's take a step back and reproach it.

36
00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:39.650
So that's a kinda new killer option to it.

37
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.770
I don't like doing that, partly because
you lose a lot of money from doing that,

38
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.829
and also,
I don't like admitting defeat, I think.

39
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.717
But with other scenarios like that where

40
00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:59.317
you feel like you've made a mistake,

41
00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:03.497
often honesty is the best policy.

42
00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:09.469
And a willingness on your part to
recognize you've made a mistake,

43
00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:16.409
even if that mistake is in how you've
handled and interacted with the client.

44
00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.379
So to give you give you a real
example that happened to me,

45
00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.879
I beat myself up for ages over this.

46
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.531
So that happened quite recently where I
was getting really frustrated working with

47
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:31.585
one particular client, because they
were saying all the right things,

48
00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.796
they wanted to do all the right things.

49
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:38.286
Yet every time I suggested any kind
of change to the way that their

50
00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:42.862
website currently worked or
the challenges that we're facing,

51
00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:46.458
there was always a reason
why they couldn't do it.

52
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:50.880
They knew it was a form, there was a form
on their website that wasn't performing.

53
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.554
They knew it wasn't performing.

54
00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:54.648
They knew it was a bad user experience.

55
00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:58.984
They knew it had to be fixed, but every
time I mentioned any change to that form,

56
00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:01.404
there was a reason why
they couldn't do it.

57
00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:05.617
And in one meeting, I just lost my cool.

58
00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:09.269
And I didn't scream or shout or
anything melodramatic like that.

59
00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.971
But I did start to express my frustration
that we're going around in circles and

60
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:15.669
not getting anywhere here.

61
00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.843
And I came away from that going,
I've blown that relationship, right?

62
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:26.277
And so I just dropped the guy an email and
said, that was totally unprofessional,

63
00:04:26.277 --> 00:04:29.452
I completely screwed it up,
I am really sorry.

64
00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:36.906
I just wanna see this succeed, but the way
I talked, my attitude over it sucked.

65
00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:41.253
And of course,
most people are really gracious.

66
00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:45.582
And he turned around and said, [LAUGH]
he said, I appreciate your passion,

67
00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:49.513
which I think was a passive aggressive
way of saying, tone it down.

68
00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.223
But anyway, he was lovely about it.

69
00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:53.742
And you can't ask for more than that.

70
00:04:53.742 --> 00:04:58.837
So yeah, I think a lot of the times,
it is just acknowledging your mistakes.

71
00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:02.041
It's in talking about it with
the client and going from there.

72
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:04.087
I mean, they might have
something specific in mind,

73
00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:05.865
in which case I'm quite
happy to answer that.

74
00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:08.320
But as a general rule of thumb,
that's kind of my thinking.
