WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.300
So the moment comes where we have to
present all of this back to the client.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.386
Now we've been involving them as we go,
so that kinda helps to some degree.

3
00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:17.292
But we need to get sooner or later to a
point where we do a probably a more formal

4
00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:21.836
presentation of some description and
get some more formal feedback.

5
00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:28.661
So first of all, take the time to
prepare before presenting, right?

6
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:33.728
You want everything to be all lined
up before you get to any kind

7
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:38.417
of formal presentation process
when it comes to design.

8
00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:43.724
And the more thoroughly you're prepared,
the better the whole thing is gonna go.

9
00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:50.132
So for a start, it's gonna give you more
confidence when it comes to presenting.

10
00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:53.782
And if you're more confident,
that tends to give the client and

11
00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.360
stakeholders a lot more
confidence as well.

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.636
Preparation will also prevent you from
being surprised by any questions or

13
00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:05.260
objections from stakeholders.

14
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.800
So thinking through what they might come
back with is a key part of preparing.

15
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.630
And having a plan, right, means that
you're gonna remain in control of

16
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.303
the process because very quickly
when it comes to presenting design,

17
00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:21.694
you can really lose control there.

18
00:01:21.694 --> 00:01:25.237
And it kind of, everybody else
starts designing the website and

19
00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:28.714
you become a pixel pusher that
just moves a few things around and

20
00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:30.496
that's a horrible place to be.

21
00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.280
So we're gonna want to avoid that as well.

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.680
So one way of preparing
as we've already said,

23
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.086
is to involve the stakeholder
at multiple times.

24
00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:44.970
With the style tiles, with working out
the content and the objections and

25
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.898
the brand keywords, and the wireframing.

26
00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:51.893
All of those are opportunities to
engage with the stakeholder and

27
00:01:51.893 --> 00:01:55.897
get them involved and by doing that,
they will understand more.

28
00:01:55.897 --> 00:01:59.093
Because the stakeholder is more
involved in the design process,

29
00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:02.593
they'll understand the decisions
that have been made along the line.

30
00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:07.459
And that puts them in a much better place
to make educated and informed decisions.

31
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.890
Secondly, right, it will give them a sense
of ownership over the design, right?

32
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.069
They will feel like they were
a part of creating it and

33
00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.854
if they were a part of creating it,
they're gonna be less likely to reject it.

34
00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:28.353
And finally, if they were involved in
creating it, they're also gonna be more

35
00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:33.869
likely to defend that design and that
approach to other stakeholders, right?

36
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.370
So involving people is really powerful.

37
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.936
Just to briefly remind
you how we're doing that,

38
00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.879
we're gonna get them involved
in defining the content.

39
00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.988
We're gonna get them involved in
prioritizing the content with user

40
00:02:44.988 --> 00:02:46.281
retention point exercise.

41
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:51.220
Creating brand keywords and
in the style guides, right?

42
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.582
Those are our key opportunities but there
are whole other opportunities as well.

43
00:02:55.582 --> 00:03:01.906
For example, I do exercises like the book
jacket exercise where I get them

44
00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:07.312
to imagine that they are representing
their company on a book.

45
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.341
And they have to make decisions
about what goes on the front cover,

46
00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:13.604
what goes on the spine, what goes on
the back cover and the inside flap.

47
00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:18.285
And all of that helps them to
prioritize their messaging and

48
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:23.071
things like their value proposition and
that kind of stuff.

49
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:26.489
Another exercise I sometimes do
is called the six-up exercise.

50
00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.829
One of the big problems when it comes to
websites is that people have a particular

51
00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.863
mental image in their heads of what
the website will do and how it will work.

52
00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:40.193
And one of the things that you need
to do is show them well actually,

53
00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.637
that's not the only way
it could have been done.

54
00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:47.007
So what we do is we take a single sheet of
paper, we fold it in thirds one way, and

55
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:51.850
half the others so you end up with six
boxes basically on your sheet of paper.

56
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.618
And you ask them to sketch out in
the first box how they imagined

57
00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:59.940
a particular page or
function will work on the website.

58
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.016
Once they've done that, you then say okay,
now fill in the other five, right?

59
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:08.177
And that forces them to think in different
ways that you might be able to solve

60
00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:09.228
the same problem.

61
00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.533
That can be a really useful
group exercise as well.

62
00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:17.528
So there's an article there
of a few different exercises

63
00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:21.072
you can do to engage your stakeholders.

64
00:04:21.072 --> 00:04:25.969
So that's fundamentally how you wanna
prepare, is by getting them involved,

65
00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.513
that's a big part of it.

66
00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:30.990
But then, you also need to think
about possible objections.

67
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.805
Now I talked about objections earlier
in the context of user objections,

68
00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:38.249
why users might not act on a website,
might not download your app,

69
00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.270
might not do your call to action,
whatever it be.

70
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.886
But now,

71
00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:47.510
I'm talking about objections about why
people might reject your design, right?

72
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.480
So why stakeholders might go no,
this design isn't right.

73
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.661
So the chances are that you will be
able to make some educated guesses about

74
00:04:56.661 --> 00:05:02.859
problems or changes that your stakeholder
might raise during a presentation, right?

75
00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:07.863
I highly encourage you,
just to spend a couple of minutes

76
00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:12.867
writing down a list of these
things that they might say and

77
00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:20.499
how you might answer them, so that you're
not surprised during the meeting, right?

78
00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:25.988
Because if you have to think on your
feet in the meeting, it can be really

79
00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:31.580
quite hard to do and having those
lined up makes an enormous difference.

80
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.411
So let's look at some common
ones that come up and

81
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:38.920
how I would respond to them, just to give
you a taste of what I've got in mind.

82
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.257
One that comes up all the time is can
we move it above the fold, all right?

83
00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:49.631
Really common thing that comes up so
I have this little patter that whenever

84
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:54.680
that comes up, just flips, it clicks
in and I just say the same thing.

85
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.398
Which is basically, it's actually
an understandable misconception that users

86
00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:03.102
don't scroll and so
you need prominent content above the fold.

87
00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:06.163
And actually,
that misconception is based on some

88
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:11.380
research done in 1994 by Jacob Nielsen
that said, users don't scroll.

89
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.547
So that has stuck and

90
00:06:12.547 --> 00:06:17.225
everybody now believes everything has to
be above the fold, if you want it seen.

91
00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:22.972
However, as early as 1998, Jacob Nielsen
actually updated his study to say well,

92
00:06:22.972 --> 00:06:26.170
that's no longer a problem and
users do scroll.

93
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.628
And as you can see from
the heatmap that we did,

94
00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:33.806
the eye tracking heatmap that
uses a spotting content.

95
00:06:33.806 --> 00:06:38.710
That's how I would deal with
that particular objection.

96
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.767
Another one is well,
it doesn't wow me, right?

97
00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:45.464
Well, it just doesn't wow me,
another one, right?

98
00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:50.356
Sometimes, my response to that is well,
it doesn't particularly wow me either, but

99
00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:52.760
we're not the target audience.

100
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.635
Design tested well with our audience, and
I would advise against designing for us,

101
00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:00.531
rather than the people
we're trying to attract.

102
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.723
So that's how I deal with that one and
again,

103
00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:08.933
I'll refer back to the semantic
differential survey where we said yeah,

104
00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:13.655
it ticks off all our keywords so
we know it appeals to our audience.

105
00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:17.219
I vividly remember working on our
website back in the Myspace days,

106
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.417
do you remember that?

107
00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:21.456
Yeah, probably not, you're all too young.

108
00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:26.487
And I was working on a university
website and I did a design,

109
00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:31.016
ended up looking a bit,
had that Myspace vibe to it and

110
00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:34.558
I utterly despised it, it was horrible.

111
00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:38.518
Picked worst piece of design I've ever
done and the client hated it as well, but

112
00:07:38.518 --> 00:07:42.077
it tested through the roof with
the audience we were trying to attract.

113
00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:43.499
So what do you do, right?

114
00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:47.850
[LAUGH] Do you want a website that we
personally like and makes us feel better?

115
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.526
Or do you want a website that actually
resonates with the users you trying

116
00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:52.074
to reach?

117
00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:54.530
We decided on the latter, you know?

118
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.720
So that tends to be how
I took around that.

119
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.050
And then there is people won't see...,
whatever it is, people will miss this.

120
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.747
And that's where you go back,

121
00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:11.200
it scored very highly when we run it
through the eye tracking algorithm, right?

122
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.309
However, you might be
right in the real world,

123
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:20.160
it might not, people might miss it,
so let's do some more testing.

124
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.130
At which point they go we
don't have time for that,

125
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.367
I'm sure the algorithm is fine and
then everybody moves on.

126
00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.913
So it's about thinking
through in advance how you're

127
00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:34.468
gonna deal with this kind of stuff,
it makes an enormous difference.

128
00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:38.286
There's also another little factor
at play here and I can't remember,

129
00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:42.552
though I touched on this later, I might be
repeating myself but I will say it now.

130
00:08:42.552 --> 00:08:45.460
There's a psychological thing here,
all right?

131
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.482
Because if you go into a meeting, right?

132
00:08:50.482 --> 00:08:55.796
Let's say you're the CEO of the company,
and you turn around to me and

133
00:08:55.796 --> 00:09:00.858
you say, we need that element above
the fold, nobody will see it.

134
00:09:00.858 --> 00:09:06.418
And even if I come back to you with this
great argument that's all well structured

135
00:09:06.418 --> 00:09:11.184
and rest of it, it's become about
authority at this point, right?

136
00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:14.304
I've basically made you look small,
all right?

137
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:18.102
And I've proved to the rest of
the room that you're wrong, okay?

138
00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:22.894
But there's no way, you're the CEO of the
company, there's no way you're gonna roll

139
00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:26.549
over and let me bulldoze you like that so
you're gonna fight back.

140
00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:30.560
However, if I sat down before
that meeting, and identified,

141
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.435
bet the CEO is gonna say that
thing needs to be above the fold.

142
00:09:34.435 --> 00:09:38.777
Then what I can do when I walk into
the presentation is I can lead with that,

143
00:09:38.777 --> 00:09:40.738
I can say well, some people are,

144
00:09:40.738 --> 00:09:44.407
I did play with the idea of moving
this element above the fold.

145
00:09:44.407 --> 00:09:47.367
But actually I found
[SOUND] gave my reasons,

146
00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:50.335
you haven't opened your
mouth as a CEO yet.

147
00:09:50.335 --> 00:09:54.932
So if you're convinced by my reasoning,
you can just keep your mouth shut and

148
00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:56.501
you don't lose any face.

149
00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:57.705
Do you see what I mean?

150
00:09:57.705 --> 00:10:02.155
So you can basically preempt,
it's all very manipulative, isn't it?

151
00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:06.570
But you can preempt people's objections so

152
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:14.800
that they don't feel belittled in that
situation because the moment it becomes,

153
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.188
I really wanna say,
a test of how far one may urinate.

154
00:10:20.188 --> 00:10:24.724
If it comes down to that, then you are
always gonna lose because as a designer,

155
00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:29.353
you're gonna be quite low in the pecking
order so yeah, just bear that in mind.

156
00:10:29.353 --> 00:10:32.161
Anyway, so, common objections.

157
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:37.369
The other thing that I do, is I try and
speak to all the stakeholders

158
00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:42.765
before I do the presentation and
I try to speak to them individually.

159
00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:47.022
This isn't always possible but it really
is worth doing if you possibly can.

160
00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:50.592
So let's say you've got a presentation
where you know you're gonna be presenting

161
00:10:50.592 --> 00:10:52.326
the design to a group of people, I try and

162
00:10:52.326 --> 00:10:55.160
talk to each of those people
individually beforehand.

163
00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.583
And the reason is, is that when I speak
to stakeholders individually, allows

164
00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:06.760
me to tailor my message to the things that
I know will resonate with them, right?

165
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.200
So let's give you some examples.

166
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.695
So if I'm speaking to a marketing person
and I'm talking about the design that I've

167
00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:17.988
produced, I can talk about how
it will improve engagement and

168
00:11:17.988 --> 00:11:22.780
lead generation because that's
the things marketing people care about.

169
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:27.562
If I'm talking to a salesperson,
I can focus on lead quality and

170
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:31.739
quantity so how many leads and
how good those leads are.

171
00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:36.843
If I'm talking to finance people,
I'll talk about how the improved

172
00:11:36.843 --> 00:11:42.123
usability on the website will reduce
the number of customer queries and

173
00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:45.850
that cost savings can come out of that,
right?

174
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.155
So it saves us money.

175
00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:49.664
And then if I'm talking to IT,

176
00:11:49.664 --> 00:11:55.365
I will emphasize how easy the site is
gonna be to build and to maintain.

177
00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:59.708
And actually, these are tips that work not
just for design, but tips that work with

178
00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:03.391
any, whenever you've got sell
something to somebody else, right?

179
00:12:03.391 --> 00:12:07.184
You appeal to their selfish gene, right?

180
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:11.348
We're all selfish when
it comes down to it.

181
00:12:11.348 --> 00:12:15.730
People don't care about the users, right?

182
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.211
So, a lot of designers go well,
the users need this, well,

183
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:20.676
no one think of the users.

184
00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:25.551
And they're all trying to persuade
everyone else to care about user needs but

185
00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:28.181
the truth is, nobody else does, right?

186
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:30.795
Not really, it's not their job to.

187
00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:34.552
If you're a developer, it's not your
job to care about the users primarily.

188
00:12:34.552 --> 00:12:36.510
You've got other things to worry about.

189
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:44.250
If you're a marketing person, we've all
got our own targets, our own problems.

190
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.560
But if you can demonstrate how
the design actually helps that bigger,

191
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.680
helps them reach their selfish aims, it
helps them meet their end of year bonus or

192
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.180
their next promotion, or whatever else.

193
00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.223
Suddenly, they'll sign off on the design,
so

194
00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:03.480
that's why I like to speak
to people individually.

195
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.474
Another little thing that I prepare,
you can either do this before or

196
00:13:10.474 --> 00:13:14.690
after the presentation and
this again, is a beaut, right?

197
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.286
This is a really good trick,
he says modestly.

198
00:13:18.286 --> 00:13:26.246
It's I create a short video
presentation of the design, right?

199
00:13:26.246 --> 00:13:30.530
Why I've done it the way I've done it,
how I approached it,

200
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.803
all the things that led up to it.

201
00:13:32.803 --> 00:13:35.559
The brand key was the wireframes,
the style tiles,

202
00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.575
all the rest of it, all put in a video.

203
00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:41.676
The reason that I do this is
because what happens is I go and

204
00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:45.103
give my presentation,
say to you two, right?

205
00:13:45.103 --> 00:13:49.768
So I've given my presentation to you two
and then what happens is you are not quite

206
00:13:49.768 --> 00:13:54.950
sure about the design or whether, or it's
a big decision and bit out your pay grade.

207
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.850
And I've given you this amazing
presentation with all this information,

208
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.839
that means that you can
make an informed decision.

209
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.936
And then you, because you feel slightly
uncomfortable making a decision,

210
00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:06.888
you walk out the room and
you go and see the CEO, right?

211
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:10.150
And you show them the design,
and what do you say to them?

212
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.440
What do you think?

213
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.910
Now as we've already established, that's
a really bad question to ask, right?

214
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.058
So we don't want them to be able to
just walk out with the design and

215
00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:21.640
show it toward somebody
else with no context.

216
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.920
So I record a video and
that's what I give the stakeholders.

217
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.630
So they have to see the design within
the context of how it's explained.
