1
00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.564
So how do we do that feedback?

2
00:00:02.564 --> 00:00:06.306
Right, so if we ask stakeholders for
feedback when you present,

3
00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.979
it's gonna lead to a conversation
about how to fix the design and

4
00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.647
that's gonna lead into
design by committee.

5
00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:13.779
So we don't want that.

6
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.868
Fortunately, there is a better way, right?

7
00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:21.148
First of all, let's deal with how do we
stop it happening actually in the meeting,

8
00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:24.708
because it's very easy for me to say,
we're not gonna do feedback.

9
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.517
But how do we actually stop it happening?

10
00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:29.175
First of all,
don't leave enough time [LAUGH],

11
00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:31.837
that's always a good way
of getting around it.

12
00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:36.655
Just make sure that you present up until
the deadline, it's naughty but it works.

13
00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:40.172
Second, tell people that you want to
give them time to digest the design.

14
00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:43.615
So make it sound like you're doing it for
them, not for you.

15
00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:48.253
Third, suggest that people go and
consult others, right?

16
00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:50.936
Because the only way they can do that
is with the video you've given them.

17
00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:54.605
So it means all those other people
are gonna get the same presentation

18
00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:56.006
fundamentally, right?

19
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.779
So absolutely fine for them to go and
talk to other people and

20
00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:03.103
that will make them feel better and
more confident.

21
00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:08.603
And third, say that you will send them
specific questions following the meeting.

22
00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:12.806
You'll follow up after the meeting with
some specific questions that you wanna

23
00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:13.377
get into.

24
00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:16.116
And then if you do send those,

25
00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:21.276
if you do allow some space for
questions in the session.

26
00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:26.013
Focus those questions very much on
the process that got us to where we

27
00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:29.848
are not comments about
the design as they stand today.

28
00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:33.782
So how do we then follow up and
actually gather the feedback?

29
00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:38.725
That is gonna be inevitable so
we might as well do it.

30
00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:43.882
So first of all, we're gonna email
the stakeholders post presentation, right?

31
00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.771
And they're welcome to say,

32
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.779
there's somebody else we need
to be copied in on this.

33
00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:51.259
Or it'll be great if you
send it to the CEO as well,

34
00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.518
just get whatever email
addresses you want.

35
00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:55.951
And what you gonna do is
send him an email and

36
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.879
you gonna send a link to the video
that you've prepared, all right?

37
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:04.256
And alongside that, you're gonna ask
some structured questions, right?

38
00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:09.107
And those questions are designed
to focus the stakeholders and

39
00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:13.146
the clients at providing
feedback on what matters.

40
00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:17.953
And it's gonna hopefully help them avoid
getting sucked into expressing their own

41
00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:19.197
personal opinions.

42
00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:24.910
I will say it one more time,
never ask, what do you think?

43
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.443
I cannot overstate that.

44
00:02:27.443 --> 00:02:30.396
So what questions should you be asking?

45
00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:34.066
Here are a few that are my go to
questions, you will obviously have

46
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:38.092
to tailor these to your specific project,
but it'll give you an idea.

47
00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:43.142
First of all, does the design support
the needs of the users it's aimed at?

48
00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:47.162
See what I did there,
focusing immediately on user needs, right?

49
00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:52.048
Second, does the design achieve
the organizational objectives?

50
00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:55.305
Fair comment, needs to so we need to know.

51
00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:59.361
Do you believe users will associate
the brand keywords with the design?

52
00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:04.141
Don't forget you've literally just shown
them some test results that say it does,

53
00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:05.570
so that'll help there.

54
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.492
Does the design incorporate the stylistic
elements designed in the style tiles?

55
00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:14.093
And again, you've literally just
talked them through how it does that.

56
00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:17.203
Does the design reflect the wireframes
you've previously created for

57
00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:17.990
critical pages?

58
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.173
Again, you've just shown
them that it does.

59
00:03:21.173 --> 00:03:25.384
And does the design communicate the value
proposition agreed at the outset of this

60
00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:25.942
project?

61
00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:29.279
And are there any additional
considerations we need to take into

62
00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.397
account as we move into the build phase?

63
00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:33.939
Right, take out that last one just for
a minute.

64
00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.270
Let's look at all the rest.

65
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.997
You have literally just shown them how the
answer to all of those questions is yes,

66
00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:42.827
all right?

67
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:47.142
And if they go through yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

68
00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:50.902
how can they then say I don't
like the design, right?

69
00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.781
You've guided them to
the right decision and

70
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:57.123
educated them by focusing
them on the right things.

71
00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:01.687
As for the last question, that's the only
open ended one that you've put in

72
00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:04.628
that list really,
all of the rest are yes or nos.

73
00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:08.335
Hopefully, you asked that one last knowing
that they'll have got to the end of

74
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:10.426
the list going yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

75
00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:13.128
The last one, notice the wording of that,

76
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:17.192
that we should take into account
as moving into the build phase.

77
00:04:17.192 --> 00:04:20.198
I have not said that we
need to amend the design or

78
00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:23.816
go back in endless circles
around iterating the design.

79
00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:27.952
I've just said, is there anything
additional to take into account?

80
00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:29.999
What I'm doing here is
controlling the narrative.

81
00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:34.324
I'm controlling the conversation that's
happening to focus it on what really

82
00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:35.365
matters the most.

83
00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:40.160
A common mistake I see designers and
project managers making is to ask, for

84
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.360
example, for a single point of
contact with the design, right?

85
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.776
That is the worst possible
thing you can do, right?

86
00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:51.976
Think about it for a minute, a lot of
designers get really frustrated that they

87
00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:55.235
get all these different
conflicting feedback from people.

88
00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.307
That's the best thing in the world,
you definitely want that, right?

89
00:04:58.307 --> 00:05:00.121
That's not a bad thing,
that's a good thing.

90
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:02.681
The reason it's a good thing
is cuz it puts you in control.

91
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:06.599
If everyone's emailing you
directly with their feedback,

92
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.915
that means that you're the only
one that has got all the feedback.

93
00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:13.398
You're the one in control, okay?

94
00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:17.440
So now I can pick and
choose which feedback I listen to and

95
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.166
what I quietly ignore.

96
00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:24.779
Also I can directly
follow up with questions.

97
00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.775
So let's say we were getting
feedback from person B but

98
00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:34.131
all of that feedback had
to go through person A.

99
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:36.339
What if I've got follow up
questions with person B?

100
00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.155
I don't have access to that person
to ask them additional questions.

101
00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:43.417
So if I'm getting feedback directly
then I can go to those people and

102
00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:46.923
I can ask them questions and control
the conversation a little bit more.

103
00:05:46.923 --> 00:05:50.788
We want all feedback to come to us
directly because it allows us to

104
00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:55.095
question the feedback rather than
just blindly have it forced upon us.

105
00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:58.609
We can judge how important and
how strongly that person feels about

106
00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:01.382
the feedback cuz this
happens all the time, right?

107
00:06:01.382 --> 00:06:03.636
The CEO makes a vague comment.

108
00:06:03.636 --> 00:06:09.002
The next person along the chain makes
a strong recommendation based on it.

109
00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:12.617
And the third person that communicates
it to you, it's an absolute must.

110
00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:15.314
The CEO says so, right?

111
00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:20.048
You don't want that scenario,
you wanna be at the source.

112
00:06:20.048 --> 00:06:25.151
And if you control it, you can decide
what's acted upon and what's not.

113
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:28.388
Be the single person with
the whole picture and

114
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.129
take control of that discussion and
that narrative.

115
00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.793
Again, this doesn't just apply to design,

116
00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:37.676
this applies in project
management in general.

117
00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:43.603
So let's talk about the disagreements
that will inevitably come up, right?

118
00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.117
So there are going to be some objections.

119
00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:48.968
There are going to be things.

120
00:06:48.968 --> 00:06:50.851
You can control it as much as you want.

121
00:06:50.851 --> 00:06:54.639
You can be as clever as you want,
but there are always gonna be

122
00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.491
feedback that you get that you don't like,
that you don't feel is correct.

123
00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:00.990
So how do you handle that?

124
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.846
Well, first thing is,
I would suggest, ask why, right?

125
00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:11.249
There is a tactic called the five whys to
drill down to an underlying problem where

126
00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:13.398
you ask why, you ask why, you ask why.

127
00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:18.688
I call it the annoying toddler approach
to project management, where essentially,

128
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:23.035
and when you've got a small kid,
you know they endlessly ask you why?

129
00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:24.602
Why is the sky blue?

130
00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:26.588
And you give an answer and
they go, well, why is that?

131
00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:28.749
And it just goes on and
on and it drives you nuts,

132
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:30.763
but it's actually a really useful tactic.

133
00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:36.820
Say somebody comes back and says,
I think that I want the logo to be bigger.

134
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.320
Well, why?

135
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.538
Because I feel that users
might miss seeing it.

136
00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:44.630
Well, why do you think they'll miss that?

137
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.408
Because I didn't see it.

138
00:07:47.408 --> 00:07:52.986
Okay, and why do you think them
missing it will be a problem?

139
00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:55.055
And you keep asking why?

140
00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:59.155
And oftentimes, A, you get to the root of
the underlying problem which is not always

141
00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:01.082
the problem that they've expressed.

142
00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:04.098
But B,
oftentimes they'll lose steam [LAUGH].

143
00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:07.672
And they'll basically realize there
is kinda no underlying thing.

144
00:08:07.672 --> 00:08:11.751
Now you mustn't do it aggressively or
confrontationally cuz the minute you do

145
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:14.490
that it puts people's backs up and
you get nowhere.

146
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.315
I need to understand
this better to fix it,

147
00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:22.792
can you help me kind of thing,
works really well.

148
00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:25.834
If you've got objections
to their argument,

149
00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:29.584
whatever it is that they said,
don't word it directly.

150
00:08:29.584 --> 00:08:33.402
So a classic example would be,

151
00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:38.381
I wanna change the color of that text,
right?

152
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:42.885
And immediately through your head goes,
well, that's gonna be inaccessible for

153
00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:43.860
a start, right?

154
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.890
If you come back and say,
that's gonna be inaccessible, all right?

155
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.466
You're basically saying,
you thicky, what's wrong with you?

156
00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.183
Why didn't you realize it's gonna
be inaccessible, are you an idiot?

157
00:08:55.183 --> 00:08:57.778
Why would you even suggest such a thing,
all right?

158
00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:00.667
That's the underlying implication.

159
00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:05.135
If however you say, yeah, yeah,
we could definitely do that.

160
00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:07.326
What's your thoughts about
the accessibility issue?

161
00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:10.098
How do you think we ought
to get around that?

162
00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:14.567
A totally different feel to it, a totally
different conversation that then ensues.

163
00:09:14.567 --> 00:09:20.027
Because you're talking about we and
us and how are we going to deal with it.

164
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:23.436
And you're making the presumption they
must have thought of that already,

165
00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:23.974
all right?

166
00:09:23.974 --> 00:09:26.193
They're not thickies.

167
00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:27.775
So that works really well.

168
00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:31.560
Another thing I do is,
this is a great one.

169
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.164
So someone says they wanna change
the navigation or whatever,

170
00:09:35.164 --> 00:09:36.800
it doesn't really matter.

171
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.661
Yeah, yeah, you could be right.

172
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.867
I might have got that wrong, all right?

173
00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:42.511
That always throws them for

174
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:46.671
an instant straightaway because
people are used to confrontation.

175
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:51.236
So yeah, yeah you might be right,
we really ought to test that and

176
00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:52.819
find out, all right?

177
00:09:52.819 --> 00:09:54.573
It'll kill it dead.

178
00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:57.882
Cuz they won't have time,
they won't wanna commit time,

179
00:09:57.882 --> 00:09:59.812
they just wanted you to change it.

180
00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:03.230
But nobody can really disagree
with the idea of testing it.

181
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.056
Especially, as you've been so conciliatory
over it and said, yeah, I might be wrong,

182
00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:08.135
we need to find that out.

183
00:10:08.135 --> 00:10:10.812
You've got a really good point,
let's test it.

184
00:10:10.812 --> 00:10:13.926
Well, they don't have the time or
the money because they wanna move on.

185
00:10:13.926 --> 00:10:17.243
So they go,
I'm sure it'd be all right for now.

186
00:10:17.243 --> 00:10:19.010
That's the answer you'll get back.

187
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.060
Great, we move forward, we launch that
cuz the truth is once it's live you

188
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.970
will get data back that will
prove one way or another.

189
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.948
It's about keeping project momentum going.

190
00:10:28.948 --> 00:10:32.318
And that is exactly the last point,
my last argument for

191
00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:35.483
dealing with disagreement is,
you might be right.

192
00:10:35.483 --> 00:10:38.491
Let's just get it live and
see what happens, right?

193
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.744
Or let's deal with that later.

194
00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:46.171
Great, which brings us nicely on to
handling scope creep cuz we haven't really

195
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:48.230
fully resolved that as an issue yet.
