1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.531
Little bit about how to prepare that
video to get the most out of it.

2
00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:06.944
First of all keep it short no more than
20 minutes ideally nearer 10, right,

3
00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:08.663
it's got to be really short and snappy.

4
00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:13.343
Secondly, cover the same basic
information as your main presentation,

5
00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:15.692
I'll get on to that in just a minute.

6
00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:20.621
And then at the end, we're gonna ask some
really structured questions in the video,

7
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.372
right, to replace that
what do you think of it?

8
00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:25.710
And we're gonna get on to that
in just a second, all right?

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
So that video really, really useful tool,
highly recommend it, definitely,

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.987
definitely do that.

11
00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:34.719
You can just use something
like Loom to record it,

12
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.550
which makes it really easy to do.

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.722
So how do we know the presentation itself?

14
00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.462
How do we get that moment?

15
00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.389
We've got to present this design.

16
00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:48.319
This is a big thing to designers,
getting approval for a design.

17
00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:53.046
So if you follow my advice about speaking
to those stakeholders individually,

18
00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:56.432
and you've engaged stakeholders
through the process,

19
00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:58.704
then really this is just a formality.

20
00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:03.669
Suddenly that big scary presentation,
that most designers dread,

21
00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:08.728
becomes nothing, really it becomes
trivial in comparison, right?

22
00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:11.238
And it's almost a box ticking exercise.

23
00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.920
Everybody will be on board, no problem.

24
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.983
So before showing the design,
cover the following.

25
00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:22.950
The decisions, recap the decisions
that have been made already.

26
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.403
Cover things like your brand key words,
your value proposition,

27
00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:29.920
your success criteria,
decisions that were made around content,

28
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.843
all of that stuff, start with that.

29
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:35.611
Next, talk about how you collaborated,
right?

30
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:38.836
Revisit any design assets that
you produced together with

31
00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:41.796
your other stakeholders such
as your style tiles, or

32
00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:46.290
any user attention point exercise, or
anything like that that you did, right?

33
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.967
And then finally, cover any testing
that you've covered, that you've done,

34
00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:55.530
card sorting exercises, five second test,
first click tests, all of that.

35
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.078
That recap is vitally important, right,

36
00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:00.854
and it's vitally important for
two reasons.

37
00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.790
Number one,
it triggers the commitment bias, right?

38
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.579
So this is a psychological
thing that people have, right?

39
00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.936
Which is if we have agreed to
something previously, if we said,

40
00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:17.306
we think that's good,
we don't like to then change our minds.

41
00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:22.442
We like to remain consistent with what
we've previously committed ourselves to.

42
00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:27.372
So if we've said we agree to these brand
words, if we've said we agree to these

43
00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:31.107
design principles,
if we said we agree to the style tiles,

44
00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:36.056
to go back on that now, people will lose
faith, and they don't wanna do that.

45
00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:38.790
So that's why you need the recap.

46
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.009
And then secondly,

47
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:44.610
the methodology talking through that
methodology provides reassurance.

48
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.120
It shows the process that has led to
the design you're about to present, right?

49
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.160
So now, when we come to presenting
the actual presentation itself.

50
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.460
First of all, we wanna reference
previous work that we've done, right?

51
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.460
Point out so you're showing,
you've put the design on screen now, okay.

52
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.309
For the first time they're seeing it.

53
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.732
The very first thing you do is
you run through how the design

54
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.360
reflects previous work that's been done.

55
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.030
So, you can see here how we've used
these colors from this style tile.

56
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.746
And we've used this typography
from this style tile.

57
00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.878
And the layout represents what
we did in the wire frame.

58
00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:29.674
And the brand keywords are shown
through these elements on the page, and

59
00:03:29.674 --> 00:03:32.044
this is the content that we agreed.

60
00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.493
And here it all is, and
it's all brought together.

61
00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:37.280
Again, this triggers that commitment bias.

62
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.530
Secondly, we're gonna preempt those common
objections, just like I said earlier.

63
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.430
Don't wait for
stakeholders to express their objections.

64
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.797
Once they've objected out loud, they're
gonna unlikely to back down from that.

65
00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:55.534
So instead we're gonna get ahead of those
and cover any objections in advance.

66
00:03:55.534 --> 00:04:01.282
And then finally, we're gonna emphasize
how much we've tested this design,

67
00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:04.045
and what it's gone through, right?

68
00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:05.277
Easy, [LAUGH].

69
00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:11.680
Honestly, I swear to you, you do it like
this, you will not get objections, right?

70
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.490
By this stage,
you will get no pushback over the design.

71
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.874
And I say this,
I've mentored agency, after agency,

72
00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:22.114
and after agency, and
when I first tell people this,

73
00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:26.076
they look at me with utter disbelief
like I've gone mad, right?

74
00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:31.351
And they do it I said, just do it once,
just try it once in the method

75
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:36.266
that I've said, and
you will get design sign off first time.

76
00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:38.420
And they try it, and they do.

77
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.890
It really does work, there is no reason
for you to get stuck in iteration help.

78
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.570
So how do we end our presentation, right?

79
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.297
There's two things I'm gonna suggest,
but the first one is going to

80
00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:57.330
probably everything I say today is
gonna freak the most people out.

81
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.110
Are we ready to be freaked out?

82
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.050
That got everybody's attention right?

83
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.051
Downplay or remove design sign off, okay?

84
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.734
One of the things that we do is
we tell people, right, okay,

85
00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:17.260
now it's time to sign off the design,
are you happy to sign it off?

86
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.190
Why do we do that?

87
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.022
If in print that makes total sense because
you then wanna send it to print, and

88
00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:27.630
hanging stuff after the fact
is a major nightmare, right?

89
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.947
But in designing in digital, it's not, we
could change the colors later it wouldn't

90
00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:34.504
be the end of the world it's
the linings of the CSS.

91
00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:38.570
We could change the typography and
it wouldn't be disastrous, right?

92
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.792
There's a lot that can still be changed
in the design relatively lightweight,

93
00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:44.580
we just need to know we're
in the right direction.

94
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.908
And yeah, it would be vaguely inconvenient
if the client started changing things.

95
00:05:48.908 --> 00:05:53.146
But not as inconvenient is what
happens when we require sign off, and

96
00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:56.030
we make a big deal out of it, right?

97
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.949
The bigger the deal that we make out
of it, the bigger this decision to

98
00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:08.090
sign off becomes in the minds
of our stakeholders and clients.

99
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.962
If I say to you, I need you to
pick which coffee you want today,

100
00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:16.480
what type of coffee would you like, right?

101
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.099
It's no big deal, you can always call
me when I get down to the Starbucks and

102
00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.060
change your order if you want to.

103
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.168
It's super relaxed about it.

104
00:06:24.168 --> 00:06:28.617
But if I turn around and say, I want you
to pick what coffee you're gonna drink for

105
00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:31.956
the rest of your life, right,
then suddenly that becomes so

106
00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:34.220
much more intimidating.

107
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.640
So downplay it, right?

108
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.498
You'll get sign off a lot easier.

109
00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:41.164
Chances are they won't
ever change anything, and

110
00:06:41.164 --> 00:06:45.650
if they do change things is gonna be
relatively superficial things, right?

111
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.180
Because you've taken them
through this process.

112
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.315
So that's one thing.

113
00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:54.340
The other thing is don't ask for
immediate feedback, right?

114
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.432
Another thing that designers often do,
they get to the end of the presentation

115
00:06:58.432 --> 00:07:01.293
and they get to, and
now I want your feedback, right?

116
00:07:01.293 --> 00:07:06.295
And a train crash ensues at that point,
right?

117
00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:09.680
So one person will say, well, I don't like
the green, another person says, well,

118
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.284
I really liked the green but
I wasn't sure about the typography.

119
00:07:12.284 --> 00:07:15.018
And then they start discussing
which color would be best.

120
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.887
And you just lose control
of the whole situation, and

121
00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:23.420
you're pushing pixels around and it just
turns into this major nightmare, right?

122
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.748
So, we don't wanna do that.

123
00:07:24.748 --> 00:07:28.836
Equally, we don't want people to feel
pressured cuz a lot of the time it's like,

124
00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:32.110
if I'm getting sign it off right now,
then I can move on, right?

125
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.214
But actually, just builds pressure again,
and makes everything become a bigger deal.

126
00:07:39.214 --> 00:07:43.316
So there is a better way of handling it,
which is not to ask for

127
00:07:43.316 --> 00:07:46.701
feedback then but
to say I will follow up, right?

128
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.783
I wanna give you time to digest the design
before you provide your feedback.

129
00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:52.793
We're not gonna discuss it today,

130
00:07:52.793 --> 00:07:57.559
because I don't wanna get into design by
committee, but I don't say that last bit.

131
00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:01.202
Instead, I wanna give you
a chance to think it through,

132
00:08:01.202 --> 00:08:06.023
to ask any questions you've got about
the design process and what we did.

133
00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:10.130
And then I will follow up asking feedback
once you've had a bit of time to digest.
