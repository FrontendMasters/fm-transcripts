1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.128
So the prototyping phase, let's look
at what that is and how that fits in.

2
00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:10.152
So you'll get to the end of the discovery
phase and you will have a pretty

3
00:00:10.152 --> 00:00:14.924
clear idea of what's gonna be built,
who it's got to be built for,

4
00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:18.557
any restrictions or
limitations on that, right?

5
00:00:18.557 --> 00:00:22.399
So you're gonna feel well informed and
empowered, which is gonna give you enough

6
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.459
of an idea to go, okay, so
this is gonna be about 20 templates,

7
00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:29.381
it's gonna be this kind of functionality,
you'll have a rough idea in your head.

8
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:34.281
That should be hopefully enough for you
to cost up your prototype phase, right?

9
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:37.876
Not your build, just to prototype phase.

10
00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.759
So you will cost out your prototype phase.

11
00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:41.348
So what goes into that?

12
00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:43.324
Well, first of all,
what is your prototype phase?

13
00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:46.689
It's where you design,
set the design direction, right, and

14
00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:49.650
you establish the scope
of what's gonna be built.

15
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.610
This is by far the biggest design
part of this overall flow, obviously.

16
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.227
So why is it so important to do?

17
00:00:56.227 --> 00:01:01.340
Well, prototyping can not only help brief
the developer as to what's gonna be built,

18
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.703
but it can also be used to
validate the design approach and

19
00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:09.700
avoid costly changes once you've started
the bill, which is a lot more expensive.

20
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.810
Also helps to better define that build so
that the pricing can be more accurate.

21
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.360
What goes into a prototype?

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.820
We can do all kinds of things.

23
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.875
You've got to establish the aesthetics,
if there hasn't already been established.

24
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.626
So brand and that kind of thing.

25
00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:30.812
You might want to do some high fidelity
design mock ups of some key pages.

26
00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:33.525
You wanna get into some
wireframing of the site and

27
00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:36.959
how it all the different templates
interact with one another.

28
00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.012
And you'll probably wanna do some
usability testing to find out whether

29
00:01:41.012 --> 00:01:43.411
people can actually use an interact this.

30
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:46.533
And you might wanna do some
aesthetic testing, and

31
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.588
we're gonna come on more
into what that is later.

32
00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:53.710
So just to kind of give you again,
the minimum you can get away with doing in

33
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.567
that kind of scenario if you can't
afford to do all of those things and

34
00:01:57.567 --> 00:01:59.719
you don't have time for all of those.

35
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.204
Obviously, your high fidelity
mock up is kind of a requirement.

36
00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:07.556
The client needs to know the design
direction, the look and feel.

37
00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:11.234
And you need to be able to demonstrate
the website's aesthetics and

38
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:15.790
how the website works within the site
structure and that kind of thing.

39
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.741
But I would also say as a minimum,
you need to be producing

40
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:25.610
a navigable what,
grayscale wireframe, right?

41
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.418
Which is include some
draft content in there,

42
00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:30.800
mocks up the proposed functionality.

43
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590
What's gonna be involved.

44
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.850
Now you might at this point choke a little
bit on this and go, well, hang on.

45
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.140
I mean, I'm working on really
low end projects here.

46
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.380
A grayscale wireframe that takes
takes time, yeah, it does.

47
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.974
But I think it's time you will get
back through clarity about the project

48
00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:52.100
direction.

49
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.740
You'll get it back to avoid scope
creep later on down the line, etc.

50
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.850
If you're really, really tight,
do what I did only yesterday.

51
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.821
I had a client with a startup idea,

52
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:08.139
they only had a very couple
of few hours of my time.

53
00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.129
They just wanted my thoughts and
my impressions about something and

54
00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.815
I literally created all the pages of this
app as I saw it in notion, right, and

55
00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:24.354
just dumped in what I thought would
go on each page, yeah, bullet points.

56
00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:28.050
That is a type of wireframe,
it's a very basic one but it allowed

57
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.501
this client to navigate around the site
see what would have been on each page,

58
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.502
interlink those pages together.

59
00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:38.791
It only took me a couple of
hours to do the entire site.

60
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:43.555
So you really can scale this to any
size project, obviously on a much

61
00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:48.486
bigger project, the kind of projects
you work on, you're gonna want

62
00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:53.519
a full interactive grayscale or
maybe even a high fidelity wireframe.

63
00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.566
Although sometimes I think
high fidelity wireframes for

64
00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:58.796
an entire application is a bit overkill.

65
00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.799
But sometimes it can be worth doing,

66
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.491
especially if you're going to be
doing very in depth testing on it.

67
00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:06.537
So, yeah that's another minimum thing.

68
00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:10.833
Also there are some other minimum
things that I would do in this stage.

69
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:14.343
And again I know this feels like a lot
of work, but trust me it's worth it.

70
00:04:14.343 --> 00:04:18.068
I would test your aesthetics,
color, typography, image styling,

71
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:22.615
right, all of those things are perceived
differently depending on your experiences

72
00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:24.146
as we talked about earlier.

73
00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:27.998
And if you don't test your aesthetics,
you're gonna get into arguments,

74
00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:29.695
right, with your stakeholder.

75
00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:34.721
Your stakeholders gonna go, people
won't like that color or that image.

76
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.091
And then you get into iteration hell.

77
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:41.528
If you test your aesthetics,
rather than have a discussion about them,

78
00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:43.940
then that makes a world of difference.

79
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.420
You do away with all of
that in this debate, right?

80
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.938
So I test my aesthetics even if it
means I'm gonna run on a loss on

81
00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:54.939
the project because it's predictable.

82
00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.475
It's a predictable loss while
endless iterations and debates and

83
00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:03.220
discussions could cost me way,
way more, right?

84
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.243
I will get into exactly how to
do that in the later section.

85
00:05:08.243 --> 00:05:12.498
And then finally, I would suggest
some form of usability testing.

86
00:05:12.498 --> 00:05:16.907
Again, is equally worthwhile for
exactly the same reason,

87
00:05:16.907 --> 00:05:20.722
that it can get rid of a lot
of debate with the client.

88
00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:24.396
And then of course, from the clients
point of view, if the user can't

89
00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:28.698
find the content on the website, if they
don't understand the functionality and

90
00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:31.530
comprehend the content,
then the websites failed.

91
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.533
So really some form of lightweight
testing is really worthwhile.

92
00:05:35.533 --> 00:05:39.387
And you might be thinking, look,
I don't have Have the time or

93
00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:43.851
money to test well, I would say don't
have the time or money not to test.

94
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:48.003
Carrying out this kind of
testing really isn't a luxury,

95
00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:53.692
it's essential to getting the project
over the line really simply and easily.

96
00:05:53.692 --> 00:05:59.500
And I will show you how to test in
the lightest possible way later on.
