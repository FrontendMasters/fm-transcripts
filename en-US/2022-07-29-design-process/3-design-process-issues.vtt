00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.025
Getting the right process makes an
enormous difference because it reassures

2
00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:12.880
clients and it reduces their feeling or
need to micromanage.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.487
Because when a client starts micromanaging
is almost always a sign that

4
00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:22.019
they're feeling uncomfortable,
they're feeling out of control or

5
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.360
that the process is out
of control in some way.

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.200
And so they feel this need to step in and
fill that gap.

7
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.964
So, essentially we need to help reduce
that kind of desire to micromanage and

8
00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:38.370
a robust process really helps with that.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.160
And actually, that is true whether
you're talking about design project or

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.560
a technical project to be quite honest.

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.819
If a client understands a technical
project from beginning to end and

12
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.375
what will happen in the order things
will happen then, then they feel much

13
00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:58.237
more reassured again than it disappearing
into the black box of techie magic.

14
00:00:58.237 --> 00:01:01.704
When they hear nothing,
they see nothing for months and

15
00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:06.100
then poop outcomes a functional
website at the end of it.

16
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.120
That intervening time can be very scary
if you don't understand what's going on.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.104
So, having a process helps
reduce the micromanage,

18
00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:21.239
it also manages clients expectations
much better educate some, and

19
00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:26.817
it will also help eliminate your scope
creep and your endless iterations,

20
00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:30.890
or more specifically it
will manage those things.

21
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.170
I'm not saying there won't
be iterations of design,

22
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.023
but there'll be iterations for the right
reasons and not the wrong reasons, and

23
00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:43.731
it won't be endless and with scope creep,
people can still suggest things but

24
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.256
it will be managed how we
integrate them into the project.

25
00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:52.193
So let's look at what your current
process probably is, and see where

26
00:01:52.193 --> 00:01:57.475
potentially is creating some problems and
how we can go about fixing that.

27
00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:02.512
All right, so,
I'm gonna make some guesses about what

28
00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:07.130
your current process is,
when it comes to design.

29
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.625
And let me, you might be right,
I might be wrong and

30
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:14.708
be interesting in the chat let
me know if I'm wrong in this.

31
00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:20.056
I suspect your project normally begins
with some form of kickoff meeting, right?

32
00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:23.237
Totally fine,
should have a kickoff meeting,

33
00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:28.174
that's exactly where you should take
things, totally agree with that.

34
00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:31.710
Then you probably move into doing
some initial design concepts.

35
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.789
Now I'm beginning to have
problems already, but

36
00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.050
we'll come back to that in a minute.

37
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.730
So, you're producing some kind of mock up.

38
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.981
Now, normally that's often
a high fidelity mock up,

39
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:46.726
you've done in something like figma,
all looks very pretty,

40
00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:51.210
then you present that back to
the client in some kind of way, right?

41
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.120
And you do this big moment where
you show them the dark times.

42
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.230
I think of this the mad men moment, right?

43
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.065
It's a kinda hangover from the advertising
industry of the 1950s, where they would go

44
00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:07.855
away and they would smoke cigarettes and
be inappropriate with women.

45
00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:11.185
And then produce some kind
of mazing presentation and

46
00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:15.625
they'd go into the client and
the client would question it slightly and

47
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.411
they would go, well,
we don't wanna work with you get out.

48
00:03:19.411 --> 00:03:23.895
It's that kind of error of things
as you can tell I'm not a fan.

49
00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:29.059
[LAUGH] so you kinda go from this
secret thing of producing a concept to

50
00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:35.140
presenting it, and then the client
inevitably has problems with it.

51
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.130
So you end up going through these multiple
rounds of iterations and you've really

52
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.680
no idea how long it's gonna take you
to shut the client up at this point.

53
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.835
How many times am I going to
have to revisit this design and

54
00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:51.340
change it before the client says,
yeah, all right go on then.

55
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.742
And then once they do finally give you the
okay, then you have to do all the other

56
00:03:55.742 --> 00:04:00.081
design templates cuz probably the last
however many iterations has just been

57
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:04.280
arguing about the homepage,
let alone everything else, right?

58
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.910
So then you get into doing
the different design templates.

59
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.946
Normally at this point,
most people have lost the will to live, so

60
00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:13.421
the amount of arguments goes down
dramatically with the other templates but

61
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.190
nonetheless, they all need to be designed.

62
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.090
And then it gets handed
across to the developer or

63
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.540
you end up having to build it your site or
yourself.

64
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.747
If you have to build it yourself, then
you have to stare at design by this stage

65
00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:29.590
you hate for
months at a time while you build it.

66
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.168
If someone else has got to build it,
you're handing across the design to

67
00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:37.275
a developer that's probably never seen
the design and goes, I can't build this,

68
00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:38.232
is not practical.

69
00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:45.517
And then right at the end of all of that,
the content is added in, right?

70
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:50.093
Just kind of poured into this empty
template, at which point half of it

71
00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:54.480
breaks because the titles are too long and
the text is too long.

72
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.740
I'm exaggerating for comic effect,
but you get the idea.

73
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.680
That is what our process
often can feel like.

74
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.459
And maybe you're sitting there feeling
smug and going that you don't do all of

75
00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.263
those things and if not,
then well done, good on you, but

76
00:05:08.263 --> 00:05:11.719
you probably do some of them or
at least can associate with some of them.

77
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.326
So let's briefly look at the problem
with your current process and

78
00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.510
why it becomes so problematic.

79
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.980
First of all, you're forced to
design without content, right?

80
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.730
This is just madness, okay?

81
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.320
Design is the relationship
between content and visuals.

82
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.837
That is in a nutshell,
those two have to go hand in hand.

83
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:42.128
And the idea that you add
the content very last when what

84
00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:47.554
is a website fundamentally
about its content, right?

85
00:05:47.554 --> 00:05:52.208
If you go back to what the web really is,
it's a document management system, or

86
00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:55.752
at least that's what it was
intended to be at the beginning,

87
00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:57.782
is about conveying information.

88
00:05:57.782 --> 00:06:00.790
The design and
the functionality have all come later.

89
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.250
So communicating
the content is fundamental.

90
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.476
If you don't have the content and
you design without that content,

91
00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:11.740
it's gonna to create all kinds of
problems for you later down the line.

92
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.660
Secondly, the design is gonna
come as a surprise, right?

93
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.950
And that is a big thing.

94
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.319
If I come into a meeting with you now and
I was meeting with all you guys and

95
00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.464
you were stakeholders in a project,

96
00:06:25.464 --> 00:06:30.090
we were gonna redesign the front
end masters website, right?

97
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.173
So I'd gone away and

98
00:06:31.173 --> 00:06:35.470
I produce this amazing design concept
that I've worked on for weeks.

99
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.660
And I came to present it to you.

100
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.790
Every single one of you will have
a vague mental picture in your head

101
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.460
of what a redesigned front end masters
website could look like, right?

102
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.502
There'll be things on that website
that annoy you, obviously not many,

103
00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:51.070
I'm sure it's perfect.

104
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.670
But, there will be the occasional
thing on the website that annoys you.

105
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.070
There'll be things that you'd like to see
on the website that I'm currently there.

106
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.990
You might have your personal
preferences about design, etc.

107
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.892
And, I'll go Tada, and I'll show
you my new design, and you'll go,

108
00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:09.608
well that wasn't what I had in my head.

109
00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:11.584
See the fundamental problem,

110
00:07:11.584 --> 00:07:17.134
is actually a moment where understanding
human psychology is incredibly important.

111
00:07:17.134 --> 00:07:21.673
Because that moment you present
the design will be a shock and

112
00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:27.371
we don't like surprises except a Christmas
and even then let's be honest,

113
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:31.305
we don't like the surprise if it's socks,
right?

114
00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:37.790
So, really this idea of having this big
reveal moment is fundamentally flawed.

115
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.860
So, also then what happens, right?

116
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.525
You present the design, and
what's the next words out of your mouth,

117
00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:48.530
what do you think?

118
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.822
Never ask a client what they think or
a stakeholder,

119
00:07:52.822 --> 00:07:57.786
because then no educated to know, they
can't provide quality feedback because

120
00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:01.200
they've not been involved
with the process at all.

121
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.090
They understand very little
of design principles.

122
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.362
They very understand very little of your
design thinking and so if you ask them,

123
00:08:09.362 --> 00:08:10.910
what do you think?

124
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.950
And which means that they have to express
an opinion, what are they gonna do?

125
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.180
What do you think, they're gonna fall
back on their personal opinions?

126
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.710
It's the only thing that
they can realistically do.

127
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.190
And do we actually care about
their personal opinions?

128
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.690
No, we don't.

129
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.219
We care about the end
user's personal opinion.

130
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.940
So during a big presentation with a what
do you think afterwards, kiss of death.

131
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.180
The other problem with that process
is when it gets to the iterations.

132
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.136
Now I'm not saying we're gonna wipe
out iterations because your design,

133
00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:48.487
I'm sorry to break it to you, probably
won't be perfect the first time, right?

134
00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:52.008
I've just done a design for
a pet insurance company.

135
00:08:52.008 --> 00:08:54.346
It went out to usability testing, and

136
00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:58.180
it performed worse than
the design they already had.

137
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.089
That's a humbling moment after 27 years of
designing that you can't do better than

138
00:09:03.089 --> 00:09:04.460
what they already had.

139
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.510
So, but that's the design process,
that happens sometimes.

140
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.090
So I'm gonna have to iterate the design.

141
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:19.770
But here's the thing,
I'm iterating based on hard data, right?

142
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.570
I'm iterating based on user
feedback which is predictable.

143
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.442
I knew that the design was gonna be tested
and I knew that my design wasn't gonna be

144
00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:31.680
perfect and
I would have to make adjustments.

145
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.339
That was predictable, I could cost
that in, in my both my time and

146
00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:38.819
what I charge the client, right?

147
00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:44.084
Now, but with traditional with endless
iteration where it's the clients opinions,

148
00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.833
you don't know whether they're
gonna go yes the first time or

149
00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:51.965
whether it's gonna take you 20
iterations to get to the sign off.

150
00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:54.676
Now if you're a freelancer or an agency,

151
00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:57.852
that is the kiss of death
to your profitability,

152
00:09:57.852 --> 00:10:02.660
because you've no idea how many
iterations you might have to do, right?

153
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.761
If you work in house is
still a fundamental problem,

154
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:08.377
because that draws out the whole timeline.

155
00:10:08.377 --> 00:10:13.200
And what gets squeezed development, right?

156
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.907
And that's why you have so many angry
developers, because they never left with

157
00:10:17.907 --> 00:10:21.576
enough time because the design
gets stuck in iteration hell.

158
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.486
And then the other thing with doing
it in this way is that the final

159
00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:32.775
site often looks very different
from the design, right?

160
00:10:32.775 --> 00:10:36.391
And then the client complains that the
final site doesn't look like the design

161
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:37.228
they signed off.

162
00:10:37.228 --> 00:10:41.701
And the reason it doesn't look like the
design they signed off is because nobody

163
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:45.185
consulted the developer during
the design process, right?

164
00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:48.569
And nobody put any real content into it.

165
00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:55.191
And then finally,
running a project in this way includes

166
00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:59.268
a whole load of risks associated with it,
right.

167
00:10:59.268 --> 00:11:02.292
So risks around how long it's gonna take,

168
00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:07.670
how many iterations are going to be,
how alienated a client is going to be and

169
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.643
frustrated by the design,
how demoralized the design is going to be?

170
00:11:12.643 --> 00:11:16.835
How long it's gonna, whether users even
accept it at the end of it because you're

171
00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:18.429
not doing any kind of testing.

172
00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:21.344
There are all kinds of risks with
this kind of approach and so

173
00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:22.465
we need to correct it.
