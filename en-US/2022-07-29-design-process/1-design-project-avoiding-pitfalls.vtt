1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.843
Let's start with the fundamentals,
how to go about running a design project.

2
00:00:05.843 --> 00:00:09.189
Because if you run the design
project in the right way,

3
00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.629
all of those other things we're gonna
touch on like presenting design,

4
00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.550
getting feedback on the design,
ensuring the design flourishes.

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.846
Things like how to produce
a design an effective way.

6
00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.310
If you're running the project
in the right way,

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.700
all of those things kinda naturally
fall into place much, much easier.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.161
So that's why I wanna start by looking
at the fundamentals of actually running

9
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:36.469
a design project and what's involved.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.413
So I think a good starting point in that
conversation is to kinda step back and

11
00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:47.498
say, why is it that design
projects often struggle?

12
00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:49.835
Why do they fail to deliver?

13
00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:54.596
Well, in my mind there are kind
of three typical pitfalls,

14
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:59.183
if you like,
that design projects naturally fall into.

15
00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:02.170
The first one is scope creep, right?

16
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.121
So once somebody can start
seeing design concepts,

17
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.699
once they begin to see the shape
of what you're producing for

18
00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:14.220
them, then they start having ideas, right?

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.409
It's a completely natural thing,
a project is very nebulous and

20
00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.890
quite hard for
people to picture in their heads.

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.170
But once you start creating something,
once you start showing them something

22
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.210
visual, then that sparks ideas,
and actually that's a good thing.

23
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.186
It's good that people can begin
to get invested in the project,

24
00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:39.130
can begin to have ideas.

25
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.897
But, if you're working on a fixed price,
fixed deadline,

26
00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:48.769
your fixed scoped project,
scope creep is the enemy, okay?

27
00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.994
And it creates all kinds of problems,
it slows down the design process, etc.

28
00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:56.516
So we need to be able to
deal with scope creep,

29
00:01:56.516 --> 00:02:01.164
not to eradicate people's
ability to have ideas, right?

30
00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:05.004
But to manage it in a way that
is appropriate, not just for

31
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:09.040
the design process, but for
the build as well, right?

32
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.729
Because obviously having a great idea
halfway through the build is much more

33
00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.500
expensive to implement than it is right
at the very beginning of the project.

34
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.967
So, scope creep, that is one big
problem I see all the time with design

35
00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:27.666
projects because that's what design does,
is it hopefully inspires and

36
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.654
makes people think of things.

37
00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:35.044
The second big problem with
design is subjectiveness, right?

38
00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:38.993
Design is utterly subjective, code isn't.

39
00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:41.304
Code either works or it doesn't.

40
00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:47.261
Okay, there are endless debates
about what coding framework you use.

41
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:51.556
There's endless debates about whether
you've done it in the most efficient way,

42
00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:54.392
but at the end of the day it
either works or it doesn't.

43
00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:57.609
Design on the other hand is
a totally different ballgame.

44
00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.907
What I like as design will be completely
different to what you like as design.

45
00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:10.377
Our view of design is heavily shaped
by our life experiences, right?

46
00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:15.752
For example,
[LAUGH] I realized that I had a particular

47
00:03:15.752 --> 00:03:20.541
dislike to a particular shade of blue,
right?

48
00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:24.655
And when I thought about
where does this come from,

49
00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:30.108
I realized that that shade of blue
was the shade of blue that my auntie

50
00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:36.770
had on her curtains at her house, and
I really didn't like my auntie, right?

51
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.498
That is a classic example of,
we have all of these things,

52
00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:45.599
reasons we don't like certain design,
certain color, certain typography,

53
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.910
because of weird associations that
we can't always even identify.

54
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.713
This causes problems because what
happens is in this situation is,

55
00:03:55.713 --> 00:04:00.178
let's say we in this room,
we're trying to agree on a design,

56
00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:05.200
now we've all got different likes and
dislikes about design.

57
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.242
And so what we'll try and
do is, we will try and

58
00:04:08.242 --> 00:04:13.090
come to a compromise between something
that we can all tolerate, right?

59
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.805
And you end up with bland
design as a result.

60
00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:21.152
If you don't design for somebody you
end up designing for nobody, right,

61
00:04:21.152 --> 00:04:23.646
something that doesn't please anybody.

62
00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:29.039
And that's why design by committee is so
bad, and creates so many problems, okay?

63
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.357
And worse still,
what often happens is you try and

64
00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:35.991
take all the different
people's likes into account,

65
00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:41.450
maybe you produce multiple design concepts
in order to try and find the right way.

66
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.984
And then people start picking and choosing
from these different design concepts, and

67
00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:47.982
you end up with Frankenstein design.

68
00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:52.866
Where you've got different bits from
different bodies kind of smushed together

69
00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.812
into this horrendous monster.

70
00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:59.332
And then obviously the big
problem when it comes to

71
00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:03.215
subjectiveness is it leads to iteration.

72
00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:07.565
It leads to, wow, okay, I don't like
that blue because of my auntie,

73
00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:09.098
can we try it with green?

74
00:05:09.098 --> 00:05:13.266
And now the green means that
the images don't work and so on, so

75
00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:16.030
you get stuck in iteration hell, right?

76
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.394
Which has already been
mentioned in the chat.

77
00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:22.057
And it will be the subject
that comes up again, and

78
00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:26.953
again, where you literally cannot
get out of this loop of design.

79
00:05:26.953 --> 00:05:31.756
And it goes something like this,
right, a stakeholder feels like

80
00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:36.903
something is wrong with the design,
they're not entirely sure what,

81
00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:41.732
it just doesn't pop for them, or
wow them, or whatever, right?

82
00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:46.682
So what they do is they request a change
to the design that they hope will fix that

83
00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:47.365
problem.

84
00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:54.199
So it might be, can you change the blue
to red or something like that?

85
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.302
So you as a designer, because at this
point you've had the life beaten out

86
00:05:59.302 --> 00:06:04.484
of you and you've lost the will to live,
you just give them what they want,

87
00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:07.640
right, in an attempt to
kind of shut them up.

88
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.574
But when you make that change, then that
doesn't actually fix the problem, okay?

89
00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:17.876
But that stakeholder isn't going to
admit that, they're not gonna say, no,

90
00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:22.390
I was terribly wrong, go back to the blue,
no, cuz that's not human nature.

91
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.745
So what they'll do is, they'll try and
find something else that might

92
00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:30.028
fix the problem, and
you go round and round in a loop.

93
00:06:30.028 --> 00:06:34.721
Endlessly tweaking the design,
it progressively getting worse, and worse,

94
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:35.919
and worse, right?

95
00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.046
So that is a big problem, and

96
00:06:38.046 --> 00:06:42.222
that is one of the most
fundamental problems of design.

97
00:06:42.222 --> 00:06:47.483
And why if you are sitting there as a pure
coder, and you don't get to currently

98
00:06:47.483 --> 00:06:52.588
touch the design, if you're just design
curious, you can feel really smug

99
00:06:52.588 --> 00:06:57.957
at this point because you don't have to
deal with this kind of horrendousness.

100
00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:01.263
I nearly use a swear word there,
probably better not to.

101
00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:05.935
So, that is iteration hell.

102
00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:08.653
But what about those of us
that have to deal with that?

103
00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:11.843
Well, how do we go about
avoiding some of these pitfalls?

104
00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:15.698
Well, there's kind of three areas
that we need to start touching on.

105
00:07:15.698 --> 00:07:21.566
Area number one is introducing some kind
of objectivity to the process, right?

106
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:25.054
So, instead of it being subjective,

107
00:07:25.054 --> 00:07:29.525
I don't like blue because of my auntie,
right?

108
00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:34.580
There needs to be some more kind of
objective way of measuring the success or

109
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.952
failure of design.

110
00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:40.896
It's the only way you're gonna get away
from this process of kind of endless

111
00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:46.321
iteration, and everybody having different
opinions, and design by committee.

112
00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:49.194
So, that's one thing
that we need to achieve.

113
00:07:49.194 --> 00:07:55.375
The second thing is we actually need
to involve the client more often,

114
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:59.684
now this might seem counterintuitive,
right?

115
00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:02.964
One of the things that happened to me, and

116
00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:07.090
I've seen it happen to
pretty much every designer,

117
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.893
is that early on in their career
they produce their designs.

118
00:08:11.893 --> 00:08:16.443
And the client and the stakeholders
start to have opinions on those designs,

119
00:08:16.443 --> 00:08:19.174
it gets demoralizing, it gets frustrating.

120
00:08:19.174 --> 00:08:24.320
So what we tend to do is try and
shut out the stakeholders, right?

121
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.142
We don't show the developer for

122
00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:29.797
example the design cuz they might
have an opinion on it, right?

123
00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:37.020
[LAUGH] Or we don't show whoever because
we fear the feedback we're gonna get.

124
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.456
Now the problem with doing that,

125
00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:44.676
the problem with having that kind of
mindset, is that if someone isn't

126
00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:49.991
actively involved in something they
don't feel any ownership over it.

127
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:55.170
They feel excluded from the process,
they feel frustrated and ignored,

128
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.362
and actually that makes them more
aggressive in their feedback, right?

129
00:09:00.362 --> 00:09:02.138
They wanna be heard.

130
00:09:02.138 --> 00:09:04.510
And also because they've
got no sense of ownership,

131
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.520
they weren't involved in creating it they
can pick it apart all they want, right?

132
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.232
No skin off their nose.

133
00:09:10.232 --> 00:09:14.706
So actually the big mistake that we make
of excluding the client from the process

134
00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:17.555
actually makes it worse, not better.

135
00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:23.153
So we need to look at how to involve the
client in the process to get them a sense

136
00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:29.203
of ownership, and also use the process to
educate them about what good design is.

137
00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:34.600
And then the final thing we need to do is
we need to reassure our clients, right?

138
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.456
Design feels dangerously close
to being art [LAUGH], right?

139
00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:44.349
And art feels all a bit
kind of airy fairy, and

140
00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:49.280
all a bit kind of ill considered
too many people, right?

141
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.466
They don't get art.

142
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:55.910
And design feels like this
mysterious thing, right?

143
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.062
So you give the brief to the designer,
the designer goes away and,

144
00:10:00.062 --> 00:10:03.325
I don't know,
sprinkles unicorn dust over it, and

145
00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:07.500
miraculously out of the end,
the design appears.

146
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.398
And because it's like this black box
of magic that they don't understand,

147
00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:13.708
they're nervous.

148
00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:16.159
We get nervous at anything
we aren't controlling or

149
00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:19.940
anything we don't understand,
it's a natural human behavior.

150
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:25.778
So, a lot of the times where the client or
stakeholder is interfering in the design,

151
00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:30.220
it's because they don't really
trust you as the designer, and

152
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.920
that can be really frustrating.

153
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.613
And I've seen a lot of designers get
almost petulant children of going, well,

154
00:10:37.613 --> 00:10:40.833
I went to art college,
you've got to listen to me, and

155
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:44.590
that is not the way to get
people to trust you, right?

156
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:51.170
Instead, we need a robust process
that instills trust in people, okay?

157
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.958
So we wanna introduce some objectivity,
we wanna involve the client, and

158
00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.000
we wanna build trust
through a robust process.
