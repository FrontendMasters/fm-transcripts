WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:06.188
So with that, let's actually kind of jump
in to the initial project that we have.

2
00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:09.522
Let's talk about how to
actually write a story, right?

3
00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:17.166
Cool, So

4
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.897
we've got this repo,
it's based on a design system

5
00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:23.199
called anthology because I looked for
synonyms for the story.

6
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.915
I tried to come up with a cute name.

7
00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:29.291
So we can pnpm,
if you haven't already done that,

8
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.208
I already have that in place or
npm install.

9
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:40.645
Cool, and
you'll see it opens up on 6006 as well.

10
00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:45.205
And my biggest issue other than the fact
that we still have the URL from the old

11
00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:49.068
Storybook is I don't have any
stories in my Storybook, right?

12
00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:55.048
So we should fix that, and so
we can go ahead and do that.

13
00:00:55.048 --> 00:01:00.010
I feel like the initial
first piece of any given

14
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.471
component system is the button, right?

15
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:08.013
And buttons are interesting,
because on one hand, you're like a button.

16
00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:09.651
That's easy, I can make a button.

17
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:14.478
On the other hand, this isn't even
all of the buttons that we have in

18
00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:19.064
our design system in our app,
there's also gradient buttons.

19
00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:21.701
There's extra round deep buttons.

20
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:24.167
There's buttons that have
menus that poke out of them.

21
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.418
There's buttons at
the end of input fields.

22
00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:34.888
The number of buttons that you find in
a design system is kind of insane, right?

23
00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:39.347
And then you add in dark mode, and next
we're gonna work on high contrast mode and

24
00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:43.624
all of those things, and then you start
to multiply that several times over.

25
00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:46.858
The hardest one, the worst one
is an input field, by the way.

26
00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:50.469
You think buttons have
too many permutations,

27
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.092
input fields are another fun one.

28
00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:57.464
We have some of those in this little
mini design system as well, but

29
00:01:57.464 --> 00:02:02.634
I think the button is a really, really
great case study to start out with here.

30
00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:09.171
So let's go take a look, and I have some
boilerplate things that we'll use later.

31
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.334
But right now this is my button, right?

32
00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.045
There's no stories for this button.

33
00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.414
This is presently my button.

34
00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:20.480
It takes some props,
which are currently set to any, and

35
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.301
it spreads those props over
the HTML button, right?

36
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:28.873
And so we have two missions here that
we need to kinda do at the same time,

37
00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.709
which is one, actually make a real button.

38
00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.282
And two, we are going to start
writing some stories around it.

39
00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:40.595
We'll do number two first, because that's
the kinda theme we're working on today.

40
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.092
So the first thing we can do
is we can create a new file.

41
00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:49.043
We can call it button.stories.tsx.

42
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:53.753
Obviously, if you are using Svelte,
it's not .tsx, or

43
00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:58.669
jsx, or what have you,
that point is actually just ts or js.

44
00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.365
For vue, it is a .vue, so on and so forth.

45
00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:05.578
The dot stories is the part
that theoretically matters.

46
00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:10.832
One of the things that gets created
when you run the npx storybook@latest

47
00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:14.995
net is it adds package.json,
puts the scripts in there.

48
00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:20.691
It puts some initial stories that annoy me
every time in there, so on and so forth.

49
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:25.205
But it also creates some files in
this .storybook directory as well,

50
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.891
and these are your configuration files.

51
00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:31.893
Out of the box, it will also
see if you're using Webpack or

52
00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:36.809
Vite, it's pretty smart about setting
everything up for you as well.

53
00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:41.570
So that .stories, right, theoretically,
if you need a different extension or

54
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.648
something along those lines,
you can tweak and customize anything.

55
00:03:45.648 --> 00:03:49.799
This is just what it gives you by
default starting out, which I mean,

56
00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.314
it's reasonable to me.

57
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:55.686
But if you are migrating from some other
system or something along those lines,

58
00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:58.179
you can tweak this to
your heart's content.

59
00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.564
So it's gonna look for
any MDX files anywhere in our repository.

60
00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:05.110
And then anything that ends
with .stories.pick your

61
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.820
favorite file extension as you go along.

62
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.676
So if you needed cjs in here for some
reason, you could theoretically add that.

63
00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:14.299
It also adds a few add-ons.

64
00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.597
So these come for free, theoretically.

65
00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:20.610
One or two of them,
I think I added along the way.

66
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.653
But add on onboarding, you can mostly
get rid of once you start out.

67
00:04:24.653 --> 00:04:28.528
It's a helpful little
tour as you go through.

68
00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:30.945
Essentials, that seems important.

69
00:04:30.945 --> 00:04:35.076
Chromatic is the visual
regression testing.

70
00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:37.541
The kind of relationship
between chromatic and

71
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:41.800
Storybook is Storybook is a completely
open source, community-driven thing.

72
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.689
Chromatic is a company that will
definitely either on a free tier,

73
00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.897
which we'll use today or for
money which I use, it work.

74
00:04:50.897 --> 00:04:55.075
Let you run the visual regression tests
in the cloud and stuff along those lines.

75
00:04:55.075 --> 00:05:00.795
They run effectively by
the Storybook team, right?

76
00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:03.834
And so that's kind of
symbiotic relationship, and so

77
00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:05.888
you get in that initial set for free.

78
00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:11.348
Interactions is where you saw that
clicks and stuff along those lines.

79
00:05:11.348 --> 00:05:16.304
Themes and this accessibility are stuff
that we're gonna kinda play around with as

80
00:05:16.304 --> 00:05:20.360
we go through, cuz we're good people,
as well as contractually.

81
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.355
Need to have a high level of
accessibility compliance,

82
00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:29.370
because of contracts and negotiations and
stuff along those lines and

83
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.376
themes so we can support dark
mode along the way as well.

84
00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:36.699
Again, this framework thing will be
different depending on how you set it up.

85
00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.052
If you run Webpack,
you will get a Webpack version.

86
00:05:40.052 --> 00:05:45.942
If you're using Ember, you'll see Ember,
so on and so forth as we kinda go through.

87
00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:50.806
I turned off telemetry only
because if somebody's watching

88
00:05:50.806 --> 00:05:55.761
this course later,
I don't want them constantly nagged by,

89
00:05:55.761 --> 00:06:00.553
the update is available cuz
they're on 8.09, right?

90
00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:03.395
I would leave this on normally,
cuz updates are good, and

91
00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:04.795
you should know about them.

92
00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:08.958
But that's just a little tweak that I have
that I won't recommend that you follow,

93
00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.886
but just for the longevity of
this course I've chosen to.

94
00:06:11.886 --> 00:06:15.159
Next, we have the preview.ts.

95
00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:21.911
The preview is that kind of UI that we've
seen, that little kind of Canvas area.

96
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:27.879
Any anything we put in this preview.ts,
if you need to add scripts for

97
00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.749
Google fonts to the kinda head tag,
you can do it in here.

98
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:36.680
For whatever unique things that
you need for your application,

99
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.262
we will make some tweaks in here, but
this is kind of for any dependencies,

100
00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:46.026
any look and feel, and stuff along
those lines happens in this preview.ts.

101
00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:48.835
Also anything that you
want to kinda pass to

102
00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:52.751
every single story throughout
your entire design system.

103
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:56.531
You can put in, here's kinda
the global dependency injection place.

104
00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:59.580
There are other levels on the way down
that we'll see as we begin to implement

105
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.208
some stories.

106
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:04.018
But this is kind of, hey,
we need to inject the URL for

107
00:07:04.018 --> 00:07:08.766
the mock server in test or
development and then have an environment

108
00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:14.056
variable switches to production for
our production Storybook, right?

109
00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:18.985
Any kind of that stuff that needs
to happen globally throughout

110
00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:22.149
your Storybook happens in here as well.

111
00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:23.525
Sorry, we got all that set up.

112
00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:27.990
So then we've got this
.stories file here as well.

113
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.011
And we, like I said before,
are gonna support TypeScript.

114
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:36.675
So there's a little extra ceremony
that we need to do, but for

115
00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:41.627
great advantage, right, and
we'll kinda see that in a second.

116
00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:45.181
And so we will import some type as
one of the first things that we do.

117
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:50.640
So we'll put import type, and we're gonna
import two of them, Meta and is a StoryOb.

118
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:57.778
These are types that are kind of unique to
just getting us effectively IntelliSense.

119
00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.505
We're doing the typescript in this case,
because IntelliSense is great, and

120
00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:04.951
it will let us know if we pass the wrong
argument in one of these stories, so

121
00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.365
on and so forth, and
that isn't Storybook React.

122
00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:09.998
If you are using a different framework,
obviously,

123
00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:11.938
it's gonna be a little bit different.

124
00:08:11.938 --> 00:08:16.607
Bbut then what we can do next is
there is the individual stories,

125
00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:21.453
and then for the collection of stories,
the kind of meta, right?

126
00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:22.952
What is the name of this story?

127
00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:26.428
What component are we using,
so on and so forth?

128
00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:28.860
And those are shared
across all the stories,

129
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.107
you can override them at any given point.

130
00:08:31.107 --> 00:08:36.083
So we'll also import our
very cool button component,

131
00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:41.178
which is totally useful at
this point from./button.

132
00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:42.849
Cool, and so we've got that in place.

133
00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:47.302
So now, we have this Idea of
the meta that we wanna have.

134
00:08:47.302 --> 00:08:53.182
So we have this const meta, and
that's going to then take a title,

135
00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:56.758
which we're gonna start out as button.

136
00:08:56.758 --> 00:09:00.536
One of the things that I will talk
about later is there are ways

137
00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:03.202
that you can name
the titles of your stories

138
00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:08.189
that influence kind of the organization
hierarchy of your Storybook, right?

139
00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:13.227
And so much like something like Figma,
using a slash or

140
00:09:13.227 --> 00:09:20.578
something along those lines will also kind
of create a hierarchy as we go along.

141
00:09:20.578 --> 00:09:25.420
But we're gonna start out real simple and
not have too much of a hierarchy for

142
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.352
starters, and we'll say component is,
in this case, the button, right?

143
00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:33.011
This is kind of the bare
minimum that you need.

144
00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:37.940
I'm gonna say that it satisfies the type
of meta to make sure that I've actually

145
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.203
hit all the things.

146
00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:42.811
And what this will do is,
as you add stuff to the meta for

147
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:44.773
this collection of stories,

148
00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:50.274
it will make sure that you're actually
passing it in the correct options, right?

149
00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:52.736
Especially, this is helpful.

150
00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:57.541
If either A, mostly, you're coming from
a previous version of Storybook, and

151
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.651
you're like it used to be like this,
and you copy and

152
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:03.781
paste old code you're in
the process of migration.

153
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:07.338
This will help you see like,
that's not actually valid anymore and

154
00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:08.691
tweak stuff along the way.

155
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.771
But we're not gonna do
any options just yet.

156
00:10:11.771 --> 00:10:16.716
The other thing we need to do is we
export that meta as the default, right?

157
00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.234
And if you're using just JavaScript,

158
00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:20.534
you could theoretically do
export default in this object.

159
00:10:20.534 --> 00:10:23.561
The only thing we need access to it for

160
00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:27.671
is to make one more type,
which is the type Story.

161
00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:32.213
And that's going to be
this StoryObject and

162
00:10:32.213 --> 00:10:35.537
the type of button in this case.

163
00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:41.576
Cool, All right, so
we've got all of this in place.

164
00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:44.498
And so now, we've got our initial story.

165
00:10:44.498 --> 00:10:47.957
One of the cool things about Storybook 7,
and

166
00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:52.404
now 8 is that it uses effectively
just ES modules, right?

167
00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.961
And so the ES modules that you
export that are not the default

168
00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:57.538
export are your stories.

169
00:10:57.538 --> 00:11:02.598
So the world's simplest story
in this case is we can do this

170
00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:07.577
export const Primary,
we'll keep that the type Story.

171
00:11:07.577 --> 00:11:12.256
And the reason we did this up
here is that it actually helps us

172
00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:16.949
with making sure that we've
got the right objects in here.

173
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:20.431
So we've got that in place, and
let's just start with this.

174
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:24.815
And we're gonna have a slight problem that
we'll deal with in a moment, but this

175
00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:29.472
is the world's simplest story, and we'll
see that it shows up now in our Storybook.

176
00:11:29.472 --> 00:11:33.921
We no longer have the problem
of no stories in our Storybook,

177
00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:35.675
cuz we have one of them.

178
00:11:35.675 --> 00:11:40.301
And you can see the implicit hierarchy
here is, we've got this meta idea of

179
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:43.837
buttons, right, and
then we've got this primary button.

180
00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:49.319
And if you export one called secondary,
right, default with a capital D, because

181
00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:54.505
default with a lowercase d means things,
those will also show up here as well.

182
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:58.940
If you use camel case,
you'll get spaces for free as you kinda go

183
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.310
along here as well, and
we can close this pane for a little bit.

184
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.311
My big problem with the button
right now is that there's a button,

185
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.091
it's got nothing in it, all right?

186
00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:16.971
And so just to verify our own sanity here,
if I went into this buttont.tsx and

187
00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:23.821
said, Instead of self-closing,
we'll say /button.

188
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:32.015
Cool, and now you can see
that it is a button, right?

189
00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:34.352
And that's all it takes to write a story.

190
00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:37.712
Now, obviously, there's some nuance and
some things that we can add in here.

191
00:12:37.712 --> 00:12:42.059
You'll notice that other
than passing meta,

192
00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:48.977
the reference to the button, right,
there's not a lot of React in here.

193
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:56.080
And so one of the things I think
Storybook, it was beta and Storybook 6.

194
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.968
And then it was really reels and
Storybook 7 and really, really,

195
00:13:00.968 --> 00:13:06.306
really reels in Storybook 8 is what's
called component story format.

196
00:13:06.306 --> 00:13:11.690
What I'm writing in React looks almost
exactly the same im Svelte with

197
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:18.093
very tiny differences in so far that's
Svelte uses slots and React uses children.

198
00:13:18.093 --> 00:13:22.425
I mean, just a very minuscule differences
between the framework show up in here, but

199
00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:25.986
generally speaking, I don't actually
have to write the component.

200
00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:31.304
This becomes theoretically
the props that I might pass

201
00:13:31.304 --> 00:13:36.850
them will be args and
if I took a prop, a variant primary,

202
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.495
that is a prop that would get passed in,
right?

203
00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:47.109
If I did, let's say,
such as I do style is,

204
00:13:53.131 --> 00:13:58.753
Sure, once the object is it,
that part is it is passing it to React,

205
00:13:58.753 --> 00:14:01.426
so you have to keep that in mind.

206
00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:08.121
So backgroundColor blue, and that becomes
a prop that gets passed in, right?

207
00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:10.198
And so like I said, completely agnostic.

208
00:14:10.198 --> 00:14:14.773
And the powerful thing about it being
an object is you get a certain amount

209
00:14:14.773 --> 00:14:16.575
of composability, right?

210
00:14:16.575 --> 00:14:19.868
If you have one set of default
props that you wanna use and

211
00:14:19.868 --> 00:14:23.456
you wanna use the spread operator,
it's just JavaScript.

212
00:14:23.456 --> 00:14:27.830
You can use a spread operator,
you can do whatever you want.

213
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:32.562
If you need an escape hatch for some
reason, though, right, where you're like,

214
00:14:32.562 --> 00:14:34.994
this is great, I wanna use this mozadime,

215
00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:39.007
I have a reason that I actually wanna
write some JSX, or what have you.

216
00:14:39.007 --> 00:14:45.374
You can use the component story format, or
you can use another option called render,

217
00:14:45.374 --> 00:14:50.426
and render will actually just let
you kind of give it a function and,

218
00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:55.114
It'll actually render that instead.

219
00:14:55.114 --> 00:14:56.438
Why are you angry?

220
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.657
So then we have our button once again.

221
00:14:59.657 --> 00:15:01.636
And so yeah,
all of that is kind of in place.

222
00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:04.334
You can render,
you can use your work predominantly, and

223
00:15:04.334 --> 00:15:07.155
especially in the spirit of
staying framework-agnostic.

224
00:15:07.155 --> 00:15:12.183
We're gonna stick mostly with
the component story format, except for

225
00:15:12.183 --> 00:15:17.646
the one or two unique cases where we
choose to render something as we go along.

226
00:15:17.646 --> 00:15:19.356
So yeah, that is our kind of first story.

227
00:15:19.356 --> 00:15:24.329
And again, if we wanted to write
a second story, right, export const,

228
00:15:24.329 --> 00:15:27.192
a secondary button comes another story.

229
00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:32.494
And let's say, for instance,
we wanted to use the, it's args children.

230
00:15:32.494 --> 00:15:33.976
See, this is why
the TypeScript is helpful.

231
00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:36.146
It's like, that's not how this works.

232
00:15:36.146 --> 00:15:40.960
How you talk and
type at the same time, neat.

233
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.958
And so now, if you look,
we've got two stories.

234
00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.697
I overwrote it in mind, so let's go back
and change that to the way that it was.

235
00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:59.197
So that once got the child prop passed in,
this one doesn't, right?

236
00:15:59.197 --> 00:16:01.885
And that is kind of the beginning steps.

237
00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:05.935
The other thing that you'll see
as I open the sidebar here,

238
00:16:05.935 --> 00:16:10.147
it has figured out that this does
take a prop called children.

239
00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:12.848
One of the cool things for React and Vue,

240
00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:16.518
I think the other ones you
don't get as much help here.

241
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:20.783
It'll definitely know about
any prop that you use, but

242
00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:25.242
if you are using TypeScript or
JSDoc, either one is fine.

243
00:16:25.242 --> 00:16:28.467
And you're using React or Vue,
it will either use React.gen,

244
00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:30.568
or I think the Vue one is called Vue.gen.

245
00:16:30.568 --> 00:16:32.904
I don't use Vue, so
I'm doing that from memory.

246
00:16:32.904 --> 00:16:36.852
And it will do a static analysis of
the code that you're importing and

247
00:16:36.852 --> 00:16:39.449
try to acquiesce what the props are,
right?

248
00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:41.347
And so even if you're not using the props,

249
00:16:41.347 --> 00:16:44.984
it'd be like, I saw the types that you
use for the props React component, and

250
00:16:44.984 --> 00:16:48.874
it'll automatically fill this out and make
some best guesses on what controls to use.

251
00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:54.637
In a little bit, we'll see how we can
customize those controls, everything along

252
00:16:54.637 --> 00:17:00.088
those lines, but we do kind of wanna begin
to style this button up a little bit.

253
00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:04.729
Cool, so you know what might be really
annoying that I don't wanna do?

254
00:17:04.729 --> 00:17:10.235
You notice how my primary button still has
no content and my secondary button does,

255
00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:14.560
right, it would be great if I didn't
have to type this for each and

256
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.384
every one of them, right?

257
00:17:16.384 --> 00:17:21.097
So we can do that, and we'll do this a lot
more to great effect in a little bit.

258
00:17:21.097 --> 00:17:25.421
But I think this begins to
set up the understanding of

259
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:28.968
the hierarchy of how
a lot of the settings.

260
00:17:28.968 --> 00:17:32.016
So anything in that preview.ts
that we saw earlier,

261
00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:36.229
that is across every story in throughout
your entire Storybook, right?

262
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:39.930
Anything I put in an individual story is
unique to that individual story, right?

263
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.738
This is great for if you wanna have
different props to different stories.

264
00:17:42.738 --> 00:17:47.591
But for the things of, hey, I wanna pass
in just the same prop to all of these,

265
00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:51.268
right, that's where this
meta comes into play, right?

266
00:17:51.268 --> 00:17:56.503
So this will be shared across
every story in this .stories file.

267
00:17:56.503 --> 00:17:58.602
Cool, so let's go ahead and we'll do that.

268
00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:02.409
And so here we'll say args,
and we'll say that children,

269
00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:04.861
button seems like a good enough name.

270
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:07.382
If somebody wants to change
their mind on this, they can.

271
00:18:07.382 --> 00:18:11.156
That's why you have your
own copy of the repo.

272
00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:15.157
Cool, and so now,
you'll notice this one I left empty.

273
00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:19.518
This one has children, so it's gonna
work the way we think it's gonna work,

274
00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:22.618
which is this one then goes
back up to the meta default.

275
00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:28.624
This one, you can override that prop with
whatever you wanted along the way and

276
00:18:28.624 --> 00:18:33.447
both work just as well, and
you start to get a sense of the kind of

277
00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:37.562
the way that inheritance
works in Storybook as well.
