WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.767
Let's look at this top bar and
see some of the options we have.

2
00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:05.535
We've got a refresh button that
does what you think it does.

3
00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:11.112
I'm not gonna waste our
time on zooming in and out.

4
00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:14.373
We've got these light and dark mode,
you can kind of see here as well,

5
00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:16.100
there's nothing that supports it.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.027
This is just the background though, so you
have different backgrounds if you want to

7
00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:22.148
see how it contrasts
with different things.

8
00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:26.526
We've got the ability to have a grid, I've
never used that on purpose in my life,

9
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.484
but it's there.

10
00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.618
This is super important
different viewports, and

11
00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:36.084
we'll talk a little bit like how to force,
a given story into a viewport because,

12
00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:38.175
this button doesn't really matter.

13
00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.966
But when I get to, if I was doing more
like, above and beyond the design system

14
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:48.057
portion when we're doing kind of like,
molecules, organisms, parts of design

15
00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:53.294
systems, like if I did whole pages in here
or like larger responsive like elements,

16
00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:57.689
you can actually one, easily go see
that thing in isolation, right?

17
00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:02.536
Two, you can force like a story to be in
a various viewport, which is great for

18
00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:05.083
your visual regression tests, right?

19
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:10.295
Because nobody likes that world where
they make a tweak for a hotfix for

20
00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:15.521
a bug and they end up breaking something
on mobile, so on and so forth.

21
00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:19.826
Because I definitely didn't get bitten by
that bug where the CEO tried to pull up

22
00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.218
our UI on his Android
phone last week at all.

23
00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:26.813
So, and you can actually change
some of the, you can rotate it, so

24
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.548
on and so forth, right?

25
00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:33.429
You've got this measurement,
which is kind of like the Chrome DevTools,

26
00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:34.908
which is pretty cool.

27
00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:39.347
And you've got this outline around it,
again,

28
00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:45.423
I'd love to tell you that I've used
that more than once in my life.

29
00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:49.101
This is an add on for the accessibility,
so we'll talk about that later.

30
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:52.586
You can also have links and fullscreen it
and all that kind of fun stuff as well.

31
00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:57.918
So what we wanna do is we wanna
add the themes plugin, right?

32
00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:03.594
And we also, I need to do a little bit
of which amounts to structure dark mode.

33
00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:08.420
There are two ish, three technically,
let's go with two,

34
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.310
philosophical ways of
implementing dark mode.

35
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.143
One is you would like to provide a toggle,
right?

36
00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:19.484
That lets people turn dark mode on or
off, right?

37
00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:23.101
That sounds very,
it doesn't even sound complicated.

38
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:28.417
That is basically you just put
a CSS class or a data attribute

39
00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:34.283
on the body of your document and
then either, toggling on or off.

40
00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:38.389
The other one is, media queries, right?

41
00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:43.876
Like the idea of their whole OS is set to
dark mode, then you can do that as well.

42
00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:48.356
We chose to have a toggle mostly because

43
00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:53.257
ours is still in beta and
I wanted a toggle.

44
00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.647
[LAUGH] Right, so
that one could toggle it on and

45
00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:59.587
off because I'm not totally confident
that we got every edge case just yet.

46
00:02:59.587 --> 00:03:02.151
I really definitely like,
where you started but for

47
00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:05.355
all that dark mode stuff and
it definitely, was invaluable, but

48
00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:08.337
then also exposed that,
it's a lot harder than we thought.

49
00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.713
But we'll talk about some of
the strategies around that in a second.

50
00:03:10.713 --> 00:03:13.768
So we do need to do a little bit of both,

51
00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:19.609
both a little bit of tailwind tweaks,
as well as some storybook tweaks.

52
00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.046
And so we'll cover those both together.

53
00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.189
Again, if you just want
to use the media query,

54
00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.129
there's nothing to do on the tail inside.

55
00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.126
And if you write your own bespoke CSS,

56
00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:34.379
there's both nothing to do and
everything to do simultaneously.

57
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.958
So we'll just talk about the little piece
of a tail and tweak that we need to do.

58
00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.542
Here, which is to say how dark mode works,
so

59
00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:46.291
by default they use the media query.

60
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:51.055
And so
what we wanna say is that it's a class.

61
00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:55.941
And then for reasons I don't understand,
I chose to use a data attribute.

62
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:57.919
I know why you chose to
use a data attribute.

63
00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:03.437
So instead of using dark mode class,
we use a data attribute of like data,

64
00:04:03.437 --> 00:04:06.556
mode is dark or
you can data theme is dark.

65
00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:12.121
The reason we did that is because when
we started, I found out that we used

66
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:17.502
the class dark on various elements
to insinuate, this is a card,

67
00:04:17.502 --> 00:04:22.726
this is a dark card even in light mode,
and all sorts of stuff broke.

68
00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:27.606
So I did this as a data attribute, because
I was transitioning a code base from

69
00:04:27.606 --> 00:04:30.324
existing with only one mode to having two.

70
00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:33.556
You could choose to just use a CSS class,
it doesn't really matter.

71
00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:39.051
But so I'm gonna say, this has got
to be a string, I'll say data.

72
00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:44.251
This is just, it's any selector that we
would want here and mine is set to mode.

73
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.869
So any selector goes here.

74
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.232
So we're gonna say, hey,

75
00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:51.044
tailwind you're gonna do dark mode with
a class really means CSS selector.

76
00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:55.967
And this is the CSS selector that you're
gonna use when using that functionality.

77
00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:59.679
If you have your own CSS then, you don't
need to do the darkMode tweak here,

78
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.604
and we'll show how to do it in a second.

79
00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:06.307
This is the only tailwind specific part
that we're gonna cover right now, sweet.

80
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:12.011
And we've got that in place,
so then we're gonna do this.

81
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.040
We're gonna add in this
idea of the themes.

82
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.083
And so I'll just make a new tab here real
quick and there's two ways to do this.

83
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:25.626
You could do an npm install, and
then add it in yourself into that main.ts.

84
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:31.506
Or you could do this mpx
storybook at latest,

85
00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:35.234
and we say add @storybook.

86
00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:39.450
Lots of opportunities for typos here.

87
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.011
Add storybook/addon-themes.

88
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:44.705
All this does is it does two things.

89
00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:48.109
It installs it, and
then it adds it to that main.ts.

90
00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:56.809
It's already installed on my end,
so we've got that here.

91
00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:03.757
Let's go into main.ts, we've got
the add on themes, cool, cool, cool.

92
00:06:03.757 --> 00:06:07.804
There are some options that it will give
you if it's the very first time you're

93
00:06:07.804 --> 00:06:10.764
installing it,
we can say like how you want this to work.

94
00:06:10.764 --> 00:06:15.085
A concept that we're gonna talk about
a little bit later is this idea of

95
00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:16.488
decorators, right?

96
00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.802
But we'll see it a little
bit in this global file.

97
00:06:18.802 --> 00:06:23.977
Which is a decorator is something
that you wanna wrap that story in.

98
00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:28.671
Reasons that you would use decorators,
and we'll see the first one later,

99
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:33.512
is let's say that thing needs the context
API because you're using a motion or

100
00:06:33.512 --> 00:06:36.591
some CSS and
JS framework that uses a React theme or

101
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:40.429
a self theme context for
the theming, then you would need it.

102
00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:44.321
If you want to just surround something in,

103
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.959
A list items in a larger list or
anything you want to do,

104
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.969
anything you want to surround every story
with, you could use a decorator for.

105
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.371
And all it does is it just gives you
the ability to put a parent over

106
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:57.197
a given story.

107
00:06:57.197 --> 00:07:01.223
You would put it in preview.ts
if you wanted it to be,

108
00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:06.144
either main or preview.ts if you
wanted it to be for every story,

109
00:07:06.144 --> 00:07:10.004
you can put on the meta for
just that set of stories.

110
00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:14.725
You can do an individual story,
it doesn't really matter.

111
00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:17.492
So we've got the add-on themes in here.

112
00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:21.744
And next we are going to go ahead and

113
00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:25.710
add a decorator in here as well.

114
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.228
I'm actually gonna import
what I need first, and

115
00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:34.593
there's just the @storybook/ add-on
themes has some utility methods,

116
00:07:34.593 --> 00:07:37.637
and you can take a lucky
guess what they do.

117
00:07:37.637 --> 00:07:43.365
So I'm gonna do import and I'm gonna do

118
00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:49.968
the trick of @storybook/addon-themes.

119
00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:53.260
And the reason I do that first is so
that I get intellisense in here.

120
00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.618
And so you can see there's three
helpers in here with ThemeByClass.

121
00:08:00.618 --> 00:08:02.812
Anyone wanna take a lucky
guess what that one does?

122
00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:08.721
WithThemeByData attribute, and
withThemeFromJSXProvider for

123
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:12.631
those of you who love your CSS and
JS, cool.

124
00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:18.668
And then all we're gonna say here is,
decorators.

125
00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:23.002
And you can pass it in by itself, but I
need to give it some options in this case.

126
00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:29.422
So I'm gonna say that my defaultTheme,
Is light.

127
00:08:29.422 --> 00:08:34.422
Now clearly for a set of stories,
you can take this down one level and

128
00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:36.367
do dark so on and so forth.

129
00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:38.222
And I'm gonna say I have two themes.

130
00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:44.047
Light and what that ought to be.

131
00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:47.775
In this case, light is light and
dark is dark.

132
00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:52.289
But in my actual code base, it's day and
night because we were clever and

133
00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:55.846
we thought it was cute at the time,
and now I live with it.

134
00:08:55.846 --> 00:09:01.715
And then what the attribute actually
is in this case, so in this case,

135
00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:08.287
I think, TypeScript is gonna get angry
with me if I remember correctly but no.

136
00:09:08.287 --> 00:09:10.761
So we've got the attribute
name in there as well.

137
00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:17.375
And I think that should be what I need
to get that running, so I've got it.

138
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:20.934
The things I need to do was make
sure it's in this array here and

139
00:09:20.934 --> 00:09:25.384
then actually have the decorator go
around every single story saying, hey,

140
00:09:25.384 --> 00:09:27.725
I've got themes, these are my themes.

141
00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:31.404
Here's the default, here's the data
attribute that you need to swap the theme,

142
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.909
and everything you need to know.

143
00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:36.771
And then that will be inherited
by every single story.

144
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:38.780
There it is, light theme.

145
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:43.185
Turn it off and
turn it back on was the answer to the,

146
00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:45.855
what went wrong there, cool.

147
00:09:47.468 --> 00:09:50.126
So now we have dark mode and
we have light mode.

148
00:09:50.126 --> 00:09:55.107
Again, there's not necessarily a lot
of tailwind need to know that you

149
00:09:55.107 --> 00:09:56.109
need to know.

150
00:09:56.109 --> 00:10:00.801
The only where that dark mode is currently
defining anything is tailwind comes,

151
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:05.774
we actually mostly replace our tailwind
themes, I'm not using a lot from tailwind.

152
00:10:05.774 --> 00:10:09.554
One of the things I like it for is for
both responsive breakpoints and themes,

153
00:10:09.554 --> 00:10:13.179
I can just do dark colon, small colon,
and I have to write media queries.

154
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:16.633
And the idea that it calls out
any CSS class we're not using,

155
00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:19.833
that's the kind of large
reason we're using it today.

156
00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:24.948
But yeah, so dark modes just changes right
now the text and the background color.

157
00:10:24.948 --> 00:10:25.517
Mark.

158
00:10:25.517 --> 00:10:27.954
&gt;&gt; Have you ever needed
more than two themes?

159
00:10:27.954 --> 00:10:29.154
&gt;&gt; We will.

160
00:10:29.154 --> 00:10:31.044
Right now we have light and dark mode, and

161
00:10:31.044 --> 00:10:34.771
I'll show you a strategy that we're using
for that right after in a little bit, so

162
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:37.710
we plan on adding high contrast mode for
accessibility issues.

163
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:43.811
And then, possibly, our design language
happens to be predominantly black and

164
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:46.425
white with a little bit of indigo.

165
00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:50.686
So high contrast mode is a few places
where we need to do some tweaks.

166
00:10:50.686 --> 00:10:55.748
But for color blindness,
we don't have a really big surface area

167
00:10:55.748 --> 00:11:00.916
because our designers happen to
like black and white as the theme.

168
00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:04.019
So yeah, for us it's like,
I used to work on a product where

169
00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.998
the theming was a thing that we
provided to the end user and

170
00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:09.754
they could put it whatever
theme they want in there.

171
00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:13.086
I will never mention that to our current
customers cuz they'll ask for it and

172
00:11:13.086 --> 00:11:14.500
then I will have to live with it.

173
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.380
So, for us, light, dark,
high contrast are the ones.

174
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.548
But like we said before, if you are a
company that's made lots of acquisitions

175
00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:24.894
and you need to have a theme for
every different brand, so on and

176
00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:27.377
so forth,
you might end up with more than one.

177
00:11:27.377 --> 00:11:31.459
&gt;&gt; Using the toggle that was in there
already, not the one we just created.

178
00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:32.126
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

179
00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:35.558
&gt;&gt; Overrode our light
dark theme in the top.

180
00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:37.245
So the one that comes for default?

181
00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:37.862
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

182
00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:40.959
&gt;&gt; On the top, if that's set,
you have to hit clear-

183
00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:41.752
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

184
00:11:41.752 --> 00:11:43.062
&gt;&gt; Selection.
&gt;&gt; Maybe that was my issue to too.

185
00:11:43.062 --> 00:11:45.465
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] To that and then,
yeah, otherwise that didn't-

186
00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:46.626
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the background was set.

187
00:11:46.626 --> 00:11:49.329
I was probably messing around with
that before and there's no, yeah,

188
00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:51.638
I didn't clear it out and
then turn it off and turn it back on.

189
00:11:51.638 --> 00:11:55.937
Fix that because it's stored in the URL,
but yeah, that's an interesting point.

190
00:11:55.937 --> 00:12:00.226
Because I was like just showing off that
you can change the background as the tour,

191
00:12:00.226 --> 00:12:04.142
I set a background and then you do need
to make sure you clear that background

192
00:12:04.142 --> 00:12:08.209
especially when my dark mode presently
only includes a background, right?
