1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.772
One of the really cool things is that
Storybook is framework agnostic.

2
00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:06.195
It will work with React, obviously.

3
00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:11.657
It is written in React, and that's
probably just like jQuery before it,

4
00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:14.575
usually the first and primary target.

5
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:18.259
We use Svelte at Temporal and so
we use Storybook with Svelte.

6
00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:25.717
It has support for Vue, Web Components,
Angular, I think even Ember, right?

7
00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:28.506
So for whatever you use,
Storybook will apply for it.

8
00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:33.043
Like I said, I chose React
cuz it was the lingua franca.

9
00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:37.774
But again, we're not really doing all
that much specifics along the way.

10
00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:42.003
And so
what's really cool is at any given point,

11
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:47.072
you can run this npc
storybook@latest init in your repo.

12
00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:51.492
And what Storybook will do is it will go
in and basically it has some heuristics

13
00:00:51.492 --> 00:00:56.124
also known as looking at your package.json
to figure out what framework using.

14
00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:59.489
And it will install the kind
of different pieces that,

15
00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.368
whether it's at Storybook/Svelte,
at Storybook/React,

16
00:01:03.368 --> 00:01:08.137
at Storybook/Lit, what have you,
Web Components, all of that will work.

17
00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:11.815
And so you don't necessarily need to think
about do much configuration differently.

18
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.788
It will put a default
thing in there as well.

19
00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:19.278
But one of the other things that we can do
as well is there's this idea of Storybook

20
00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:22.793
sandboxes which basically very
quickly creates a Storybook.

21
00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:26.637
Which is a lot of times if I'm trying out
something new or something along those

22
00:01:26.637 --> 00:01:29.619
lines and I wanna pull it into a repo,
that will work as well.

23
00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.905
And that will give you a little bit
of sense of a brand new storybook.

24
00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:35.976
So let's just go take a look at that for
a second.

25
00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:39.423
And we'll kinda just see
what we start out with and

26
00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:44.773
get a sense of default stuff that I
might otherwise, blow away very quickly.

27
00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:49.008
So I can run this npx @latest.

28
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.538
Now, if you need a particular version,
choose the particular version.

29
00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:55.644
In our case, we are going to do @latest.

30
00:01:55.644 --> 00:02:00.223
At the time of this recording,
8.08 is the latest version.

31
00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:03.443
Storybook 8 came out last month.

32
00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:07.051
So we will discuss some things that
are kinda brand new to Storybook and

33
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.877
have the latest and
greatest versions in here as well.

34
00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:12.964
So we'll go ahead and
run this @storybooklatest, and

35
00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:16.573
one of the great things and
the reason I kinda bring this up early is

36
00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.479
we are gonna just start with
a very simple React app.

37
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.733
But if one wanted to see what it might
look like across all of the different

38
00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:27.711
supported frameworks, you can also
go ahead and pick something and

39
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.687
just see the general structure.

40
00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:32.627
And one of the things I
encourage you to do kind of in

41
00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:36.197
between various parts is look
at a few different versions and

42
00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.077
notice that it doesn't really matter,
right?

43
00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:43.582
The idea of a server,
there's slightly different flavours,

44
00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:46.990
right, based on the unique
characteristics.

45
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.906
But genuinely speaking, one could
stare at the Storybooks story and

46
00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.785
forget which framework
they are looking at.

47
00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:00.051
We'll be using transcript today as well.

48
00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:04.015
The logic there being, if one is
gonna try to build a reusable and

49
00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:08.938
consistent design system, having some of
the type safety and hints to make sure

50
00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:13.209
people are using it the way that it
should be used is probably useful.

51
00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.202
And also if one does not use Typescript,

52
00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:20.968
untypescripting stuff is just
don't put the types in, right?

53
00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:24.536
It's easier to look at Typescript and
reverse engineer JavaScript,

54
00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:27.982
then go the other way,
cuz there are some unique characteristics,

55
00:03:27.982 --> 00:03:30.839
some ceremony that we have
to do to support TypeScript.

56
00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.802
I wanna make sure that if you
use TypeScript, that is a thing.

57
00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:35.777
I'll go ahead and

58
00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:40.401
just use the Svelte one real quick just to
show you that it's all basically the same.

59
00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:44.334
It will go ahead and install the sandbox.

60
00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:48.492
And this will give us a nice tour of some
of the stuff we are gonna implement along

61
00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:49.374
the way as well.

62
00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:51.544
So Storybook has a few
component pieces to it.

63
00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:53.998
It's got the idea of a story, right,

64
00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:59.369
which is just basically a version of your
component with some amount of arguments,

65
00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:02.610
parameters, props,
settings, what have you.

66
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.092
Also supports MDX,
which is Markdown plus React.

67
00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:11.187
The reason I mention this is even if you
use Svelte, or Ember, or Angular, or

68
00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:12.006
what have you,

69
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:16.175
MDX, there's still a little bit of React
that kinds creeps in no matter what.

70
00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:18.685
You don't necessarily need to React.

71
00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:19.693
As a Storybook 8,

72
00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:23.037
it's not even a dependency gets
added to your package.json.

73
00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:28.460
It's actually through the build process
just kinda baked into Storybook.

74
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.690
But we can go ahead and, You

75
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.571
can see that I've got
the versions here as well.

76
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:42.104
And then we'll go ahead and do it.

77
00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:48.925
They use yarn, I use pnpm, you can use
npm, whatever makes you happiest, cool.

78
00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:57.401
He says, As yarn doesn't work for
me, but it's fine.

79
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.272
You can use npm install as well,
it doesn't matter.

80
00:05:06.913 --> 00:05:12.241
So by default, it will go ahead and
create you some NPM scripts,

81
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:18.657
run NPM, run Storybook, or PNPM Storybook,
whatever makes you happiest,

82
00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:22.820
and it will go ahead and
start up in port 6006.

83
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.129
And you can create a bunch of
things in a Storybook file.

84
00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.768
This is an MDX file, which is, again,
Markdown plus React, which lets you embed

85
00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:37.266
components or have some amount of logic
and Javascript in your Markdown files.

86
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:40.529
You can embed like, okay,
I wanna talk about this component and

87
00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.110
how it should be used, right?

88
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.176
These are all really important
parts of the design system.

89
00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:48.566
Nobody wants to watch me write
documentation live, trust me.

90
00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:54.127
But we'll kinda discuss how to do that and
some of the best practices around that,

91
00:05:54.127 --> 00:05:59.214
as well as we have this idea of various
different permutations of a button.

92
00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:01.635
This is kind of the default setup.

93
00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:05.832
And so you can see, you can actually
include documentation about how

94
00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:08.375
to actually use this component, right?

95
00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:10.243
What are the props that it takes?

96
00:06:10.243 --> 00:06:14.346
And tweak all of these things live,
which is both great for

97
00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:18.718
the documentation and
proliferation of your design system.

98
00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:26.226
Also, I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm gonna
start taking all the component pieces,

99
00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:30.245
start with a story and
develop that various,

100
00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:35.429
all the different permutations
on one monitor in my editor

101
00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:41.495
on the other monitor is an incredibly
productivr workflow as well.

102
00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:44.984
We will kind of pay some homage to more of
the kind of philosophy of design systems

103
00:06:44.984 --> 00:06:46.876
as we talk about the stuff as well, right?

104
00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:52.727
You can start with buttons, you can put
entire pages into Storybook, right?

105
00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:55.388
And we'll show at the end how to do stuff.

106
00:06:55.388 --> 00:06:59.752
Yeah, but this thing, it automatically
does a fetch call to something, cool.

107
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.278
We can actually load that data.

108
00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:03.515
No, but this needed the context API or
what have you,

109
00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:06.552
or some surrounding ceremony, right,
whether it's Svelte context or

110
00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.814
React context,
it doesn't really matter, right?

111
00:07:08.814 --> 00:07:11.259
We'll show you how to do that.

112
00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.310
I have some written pieces to
even include mock server, so

113
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.446
you can actually have like real deal
data as you're developing, right?

114
00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:22.958
In ours,
it's kind of our open source project.

115
00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.528
We have basically stored
simulated API calls.

116
00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:32.078
We can actually see with real data how
all of these components compare with our

117
00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:32.711
website.

118
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:35.018
We use Contentful as our CMS, right?

119
00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:39.048
So our Storybook is hooked up to
Contentful so we can actually see, okay,

120
00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:42.493
just the blog card component with
the latest blog post before we

121
00:07:42.493 --> 00:07:45.232
actually hit Publish and
see all of these things.

122
00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:48.804
So for us, we use it not only for
our design system pieces, but

123
00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:51.982
as a integral part of our
deployment process, right?

124
00:07:51.982 --> 00:07:54.811
Every time we open up a PR,
it not only builds a version of

125
00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:58.860
the website that we can go visit, but
it also builds a version of the Storybook.

126
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.750
So I can send just those pieces
to designers on my team and

127
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.267
see just those unique pieces and
get feedback on just these things.

128
00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:09.161
And we can actually like, okay, maybe in
the application today on a new design

129
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:12.764
system component, it's a button that
has a very short string, right?

130
00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:15.870
But we can write stories that have
a button with a very long string, right?

131
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.782
We can actually have all these pieces and
play see it all, right,

132
00:08:19.782 --> 00:08:22.997
which stops a lot of the churn
in our code base as well.

133
00:08:22.997 --> 00:08:28.883
So in a story,
we've got either the documentation page or

134
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:33.818
these kinds of individual
stories here as well.

135
00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:36.778
You've got the various controls you can
like, is this a primary button or not?

136
00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:37.756
You can change the label.

137
00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:42.445
So if you wanted to see what does this
look, it gets really long, right?

138
00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:44.385
You can do that as well and
kinda manipulate and

139
00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:45.878
play around with all these things,

140
00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:49.294
changing the background color of the
button, in this case, changing the size.

141
00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:52.888
And we'll look at how to set up these
controls, how to customize them, and

142
00:08:52.888 --> 00:08:54.268
all of those things as well.

143
00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:59.770
The other thing you'll notice is that you
can actually keep track of the actions and

144
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.398
look at all those things you
can actually put in stuff.

145
00:09:03.398 --> 00:09:08.794
If you've used something like jest for
kinda having spies and

146
00:09:08.794 --> 00:09:12.539
subs, you can actually run those as well.

147
00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:15.963
Be like, did the at click function
actually get called with the things that I

148
00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:17.314
expected them to get called?

149
00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:20.098
You can actually check and
validate those things,

150
00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:24.631
right, outside the context of your app and
also run automated tests around that and

151
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:28.924
all of these permutations to make sure
you didn't break some subtle use case.

152
00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:32.834
That wasn't maybe the page you
were staring at at the time.

153
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:36.167
And kinda make sure that you don't
accidentally cause regressions

154
00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:37.578
throughout your code base.

155
00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:40.230
You can also have different presets and

156
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.613
these are kind of different
stories plural file.

157
00:09:43.613 --> 00:09:47.529
You can have different individual stories
that have these components set up

158
00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:50.343
different ways so
that you don't have to go through and

159
00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:53.849
necessarily tweak everything every
time you wanna see something.

160
00:09:53.849 --> 00:09:57.366
Here are all the common use cases,
I can take a look at them.

161
00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:01.304
So the other things we'll talk about
today are visual aggression testing,

162
00:10:01.304 --> 00:10:04.209
which is saying like, hey,
I'm changing some stuff.

163
00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:08.919
Usually, there's some things
you expect to change, right?

164
00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:13.385
But for me, I joked the other
day when we were teaching

165
00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:18.448
workshop that the code base that
was a great Greenfield brand

166
00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:23.431
new project three years ago is
now three years old, right?

167
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:28.746
Which means there are all sorts of little
edge cases and stuff along those lines,

168
00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:32.433
and there's a lot of need and
opportunity to refactor.

169
00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:36.120
There's parts of the code base where
this was a good idea when we did it and

170
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.998
then the product changed directions and
there's archaeological layers.

171
00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:45.013
And so we were implementing dark
mode of last six weeks, right?

172
00:10:45.013 --> 00:10:49.012
And there's a lot of pieces that we're
refactoring a lot, the ability to

173
00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:52.902
have a visual regression test to make
sure did the things that I change.

174
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.959
The things I don't wanna change,
they shouldn't change, right, and

175
00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.033
it's impossible to check all
those things one by one.

176
00:11:00.033 --> 00:11:04.228
And so with our Storybook integration,
we can actually roll that all together,

177
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:08.187
make sure that nothing's changing that
we don't expect to change as well.

178
00:11:08.187 --> 00:11:11.957
Okay, so this is kind of what
a beginning Storybook looks like.

179
00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:15.313
You can see we've got the nav bar,
we've got buttons,

180
00:11:15.313 --> 00:11:18.107
you can create even full
pages in here as well.

181
00:11:18.107 --> 00:11:21.149
This is like with the logged in and
logged out experience,

182
00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:24.952
which is really great kind of to work
with design on these things as well.
