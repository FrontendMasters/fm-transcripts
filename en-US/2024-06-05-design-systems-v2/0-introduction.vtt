00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.273
My name is Steve, I am the head of
FrontEnd Engineering at Tempero, and

2
00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:08.061
we are gonna talk about building
design systems in StoryBook.

3
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:12.672
And Design Systems is like
a little bit of a spectrum, right?

4
00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:17.818
I used to work at a company called Twilio,
where, that's a big company,

5
00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:22.884
we had a full design systems team with
designers and engineers dedicated

6
00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:27.634
to that and contributions from
all over the organization, right?

7
00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:31.201
And now we're at a much
smaller startup and

8
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:35.065
k one of the jokes we kid around or
in stand up and

9
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:40.734
our team was that whether or
not you set out to build a design system.

10
00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.922
At one point or another,
you almost end up with one, right?

11
00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:47.883
It starts out with like, what if we have
a few shared components that we reuse,

12
00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:49.993
which is a reasonably good idea, right?

13
00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:54.025
Then all of a sudden, like you get like,
this other like repo over here or

14
00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:58.333
something along those lines, and you end
up with more and more of a design system.

15
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.720
So then you end up with the situation
of like, a design system that

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.170
you intentionally decided to build, or one
that organically kind of just happened.

17
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.224
And there's a lot of reasons why you
would build a design system, right?

18
00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.313
And a lot of ink has been spilled.

19
00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:17.753
Every, like, book that I've ever bought
on a design system is predominantly about

20
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.643
how do you pitch it to your boss to get
them to let you build a design system.

21
00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:26.014
And not a lot about actually how you go
about thinking about it and building one,

22
00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:29.291
because there's also just
having the shared components.

23
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:31.723
I think the value prop is there.

24
00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:36.561
But then also, when we sit down and
actually think about it, there's all

25
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:41.334
a bunch of other pieces that benefit
us in a wide variety of ways, right?

26
00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:45.381
Like, StoryBook is a great way
to showcase your components.

27
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.403
So like for instance, we have one for our
website and then one for our application,

28
00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:52.274
where we can have every given
piece that we can kind of see and

29
00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:54.248
review with different kind of content.

30
00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:57.081
And manipulate outside
the context of our application.

31
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:01.455
But the other really cool thing is with
StoryBook you can hook up effectively

32
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.914
component testing, accessibility testing,
visual regression testing.

33
00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:10.439
A lot of stuff that in the larger context
of your app and all of its API calls and

34
00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.356
the bootstrapping of everything
could be relatively hard to do.

35
00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:18.786
The ability to break stuff into all of the
component pieces and be able to view them

36
00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:22.043
be able to kind of tweak all
the different settings to see and

37
00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:25.190
every permutation makes it way easier for
development.

38
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.542
But what I'm gonna try to argue with you
today is also it makes it way easier to

39
00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.619
maintain reliability of your application,
right?

40
00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.692
The ability to see each piece, to be
able to put it in different contexts.

41
00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:38.995
You're able to run those visual
regression tests and component tests and

42
00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:42.510
even we can like use playwriting to drive
the browser to actually interact with

43
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.352
the components to make sure they
behave the way that they want.

44
00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:49.814
Because all little demo apps
are very simple, right?

45
00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:51.311
But at a certain point of time,

46
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.535
your code base grows to such a point
that you always get worried that

47
00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:58.184
touching one piece of code breaks
something over on the other end, right?

48
00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:01.850
And so the same strategies that we use for
thinking about building up

49
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.096
those shared components, actually also
add in a layer of maintainability and

50
00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:07.981
reliability to our application.

51
00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:10.130
And make sure that we have
consistency across everything.

52
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.092
So when we need to do a refactor,

53
00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:17.128
when we need to change some of the amount
of styling, it becomes a lot easier to do.

54
00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:21.545
So we're gonna build out a few components
today in the context of a StoryBook.

55
00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.968
We are gonna use React,
but honestly, like,

56
00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:27.154
you don't even need to know React
to be able to follow along.

57
00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:30.005
It's predominantly the styling and
structure and

58
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:33.589
the integration of all the tooling and
stuff along those lines.

59
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:38.318
We're gonna start out with just some
regular CSS and CSS modules, later on,

60
00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.008
we will just use Tailwind.

61
00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:42.997
Mostly so we can focus on
the key parts of StoryBook and

62
00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:46.392
the design system without
handwriting a whole bunch of CSS.

63
00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:50.781
So I'll make some references to
like tailwind specific stuff, but

64
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:55.401
in a lot of cases, if you have some
other styling system that is easily as

65
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.715
applicable as anything
we're doing in tailwind.

66
00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:04.510
It's just a little bit easier for us to
focus on the main event here as well.

67
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.006
So we do have a repository,

68
00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:10.366
we also have this course website where
everything that I talked about at various

69
00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.702
points is also kind of written
out with all the code samples.

70
00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:15.920
So you're like, hey,
he switched to a different file,

71
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.549
I really want to know what he typed there.

72
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.329
Like, you can also pretty much find out
play by play of everything I'm gonna

73
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:21.992
talk about.

74
00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:25.956
And even some of the jokes that I'm
going to tell are all in there.

75
00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:28.454
I wrote up the notes might
as well share them with you.

76
00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:30.098
So that's the here at the course website.

77
00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:37.534
And then on that front page, we have a
repository that has just some boilerplate.

78
00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:41.788
We will kind of just look at a like tabula
rasa StoryBook implementation one point,

79
00:04:41.788 --> 00:04:45.761
and I'm kind of jumping to using this
repo and just kind of adding some stuff.

80
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:50.682
It's just basic got some of the setup so
we don't have to work through all of that.

81
00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:55.072
For a lot of this,
I kind of ported over some concepts from

82
00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:59.661
our design system in kind of
a smaller fashion here as well.

83
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.742
So some of the stuff
that we will implement

84
00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:05.833
are found here as well in this Figma file.

85
00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:11.223
But everything we do,
we can follow along with the code as well.

86
00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.450
So you guys kinda see that integration.

87
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.418
So that's the high-level
setup that we have here.

88
00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:22.843
And like I said, most of these things are
things you can add, whether it's a brand

89
00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:27.012
new application, or in our case,
like we started out with, like you build,

90
00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:30.887
like a lot of times like we would all
love to Greenfield a design system.

91
00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:33.317
I don't think I've ever been in
a situation where that has happened.

92
00:05:33.317 --> 00:05:37.707
A lot of times you start building the app,
you find the need for reusability, right?

93
00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:41.640
And then you kind of have to back
yourself into having to design system and

94
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.222
begin to refactor and
stuff along those lines.

95
00:05:44.222 --> 00:05:47.083
So kind of definitely pay respect to that

96
00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:52.058
more common situation at the same
time as we jump through everything.
