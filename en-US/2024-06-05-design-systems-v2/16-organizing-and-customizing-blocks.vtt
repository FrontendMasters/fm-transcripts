00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.848
Just one last thing, and
we kinda mentioned this earlier, but

2
00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:04.620
I kinda wanna do it a little bit better,

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.134
is organization 'cause you could see
this could get outta control, right?

4
00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:13.753
And so if I call these tokens colors and

5
00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:21.128
I go back to my button and
I say, buttons stories,

6
00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:27.114
I'll say this is components/button.

7
00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.159
Because that page is no longer exists.

8
00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.363
But now these are organized
under components.

9
00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:34.714
These are organized under tokens, right?

10
00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:37.594
You can begin to bring some
amount of organization and

11
00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:40.220
sanity to the way that
you display these things.

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.608
So I only had one thing, it wasn't totally
useful, but as you add in more components,

13
00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:47.149
you could have those
primitive base components.

14
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.901
If you think about things in
the atomic design thing of like atoms,

15
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:55.127
molecules, organisms, you might choose
to add that level of hierarchy.

16
00:00:55.127 --> 00:00:59.015
It's whatever works for you,
everyone's got a little bit

17
00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:03.928
of a different opinion on that, so
you can do whatever in this case as well.

18
00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:08.823
And there are little things that you can
do here where you can choose to customize

19
00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:09.635
this table.

20
00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:14.275
So if one wanted to kind of annotate
their arg types a little bit more in

21
00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:18.686
the stories, you get the net gains
of that in the documentation.

22
00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:20.609
So what do I mean by that?

23
00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.312
So for instance, let's say children.

24
00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:28.333
That's that kind of thing
that we had before.

25
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.350
We could say that size
should be a select two.

26
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.145
Why not?

27
00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:36.731
And so
I actually wanna call it the button label.

28
00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:38.414
In this case,
I can give it a different name.

29
00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:39.540
I can say the control is text.

30
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.707
I can give it a description.

31
00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:44.507
If I don't wanna include it in that table
because no one should have to explain what

32
00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:47.824
React children are to you, you can
choose to disable it from the table.

33
00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:51.354
This is not gonna disable it in the
stories, but in that documentation piece,

34
00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:55.097
things that you don't, maybe there are
private props or something like that, you

35
00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:58.649
have the ability to choose what you show
and do not show in your documentation.

36
00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.940
So I'm gonna turn this off for one second.

37
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.856
This commented out and you can see this
is now called label with a capital L.

38
00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:10.808
We can give it a description
of why it is used, right?

39
00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:15.603
And then in the table we
can choose to disable it.

40
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:22.848
I forget if it's the way you put the
default value of isn't the table or not.

41
00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:25.129
Luckily IntelliSence will yell at
me if I put in the wrong place.

42
00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.757
So we'll find out together.

43
00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:27.968
So now it's gone.

44
00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:29.145
You could change variant.

45
00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:30.804
If you wanna capitalize stuff, go for it.

46
00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:32.970
You can label these whatever you want.

47
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.865
There's also little tweaks,
you could show the various options so

48
00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.863
you can show what's required, what's not.

49
00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:39.503
You can get more specific in here.

50
00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:42.653
It's just like little tweaks
that are not super useful, but

51
00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:46.870
this is all kind of like, documented both
in the course website and here as well.

52
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.155
But you can begin to tweak this stuff
based on what you want, Dustin?

53
00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:54.164
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to pull in the options
of a variant from a CVA instead of making

54
00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:54.889
it a string?

55
00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.832
&gt;&gt; All right, so clearly, in this case,
it does know what the options are, and

56
00:02:58.832 --> 00:03:00.663
it's figured it out from the type.

57
00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:06.211
So the problem is like
the TypeScript is done.

58
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:11.160
Most is, I'm trying to come up
with an example for it, but

59
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.406
I'm pretty sure if I think it's options,
yeah.

60
00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:20.573
I'm gonna take out large just to show,
because it already came up with one,

61
00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.690
so I can't, like,
if I rewrite what it already generated,

62
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.297
it's hard to see that it's me [LAUGH].

63
00:03:27.297 --> 00:03:33.280
But let's take out large and now you
can see it's just small and medium.

64
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.607
And so
you can do that if you wanna take the,

65
00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:39.942
let's do that with the child in this case.

66
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:41.115
So that's a string.

67
00:03:41.115 --> 00:03:48.213
Label will now be a select,
just slightly weird, and

68
00:03:48.213 --> 00:03:53.277
we'll give it the options of button.

69
00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:55.760
Sure, I like these options.

70
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.735
And now instead of a string, they can pick
one of a curated set of what it should be,

71
00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:04.954
so you can have like
complete control of it.

72
00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:06.418
Complete control over the controls.

73
00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:07.595
I'll just go with it.

74
00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:10.723
And all the things and
tweak stuff, and this is again,

75
00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:14.327
usually best practice in
collaboration with your partners and

76
00:04:14.327 --> 00:04:18.553
design about how they wanna communicate
the intent of the design system.
