00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.424
Like I said in the very beginning of
our time together, there are a bunch

2
00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:09.095
of stuff with storybook that is really
great for building a design system.

3
00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:12.474
And I think really great like
a don't think enough is spilled

4
00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:16.993
on the implementation of a design system
and how to go about thinking about that.

5
00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:21.505
If one hypothetically signed on to
do this workshop and said, hey,

6
00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.464
I'm gonna buy a bunch of books
on design systems just to read

7
00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:28.334
up on the topic outside my own experience.

8
00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:33.326
One will find out that every book written
on design systems as far as I can tell

9
00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:37.850
from my Amazon orders are written
by designers, for designers, and

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.849
potentially mostly like pitching the value
prop of why you should have one.

11
00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:46.301
There's like some of these books
are literally how to convince upper

12
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.857
management to let you do this.

13
00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:53.923
&gt;&gt; And then when it comes time to be an
engineer on the receiving end, good luck.

14
00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:54.784
Right.

15
00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:58.999
And one of the things that I
think a lot about is like one,

16
00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.083
some of these things like.

17
00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.870
You have a design system whether
you know it or not, right?

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.889
You have components in the modern era that
you've broken down to some level maybe not

19
00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:14.973
enough, but some right and part of it
is like building out the tooling so

20
00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:18.822
you can work well with your
design partners, right?

21
00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:23.823
Also so that it's so easy to like jam
everything into one component and

22
00:01:23.823 --> 00:01:26.888
not separate out your
you know what I mean?

23
00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:30.862
Like the act of these things are we
do it in the name of a design system.

24
00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:35.376
And then I think what you find
out is like your just general

25
00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:39.988
day-to-day engineering is
also benefited by isolating

26
00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:44.898
stuff into individual components
that take a bunch of props.

27
00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:49.222
And having the ability to run tests on
every given variation because you broke

28
00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:53.610
it out into stories, like you end up doing
good things for your code that like,

29
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.629
on our best days, we all should do.

30
00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:00.009
But like having that kind of process and
having it be an official thing,

31
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.543
I think in a lot of ways makes it easier
for a whole bunch of best practices.

32
00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:08.201
Like, yeah, do we start using a storybook
because we said to ourselves,

33
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.915
we're going to build
a component library because we,

34
00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:14.341
it's like we had like,
we have this folder full of components.

35
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:15.690
It's a component library now.

36
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.049
We gave it a cute name.

37
00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.017
And that's when we were like, let's put
in the storybook and all of those things.

38
00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:22.672
And then it's like,
we're going to build a component well,

39
00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:23.750
we can run component tests.

40
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.535
We just finished another accessibility
audit, we can run the accessibility tests.

41
00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:29.369
That's cool.

42
00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:36.526
We can do all these other
checks on stuff as well.

43
00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:37.284
That's really good.

44
00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:41.938
Even some of those things of pulling in
stuff from our CMS because we had some of

45
00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:46.739
the foundations in there and it becomes
useful whether or not, because again,

46
00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.052
you have the components,
you break them all the time.

47
00:02:50.052 --> 00:02:53.953
One CSS change can cause chaos.

48
00:02:53.953 --> 00:02:56.989
That there are parts of your code base
that you are terrified of being factor.

49
00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.748
Now that I've got some sanity,

50
00:02:58.748 --> 00:03:01.755
I need to go deal with my
own button component, right?

51
00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.078
But I will do that in storybook.

52
00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.662
I will do it with a visual origin and
testing.

53
00:03:05.662 --> 00:03:10.359
I will do that like with all these tools
cuz they make it easier than the way

54
00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.515
that I would have done it before.

55
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:16.457
And I think a lot of those patterns
become incredibly powerful as well.

56
00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:21.440
And then also you get the other
piece of the consistency there,

57
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.284
which is when you have a design system,
it makes you make better choices?

58
00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:31.107
Also helps your buddy on the design team,
like not just, it's very easy for

59
00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:34.293
them to draw a different rank,
rectangle and call it a button.

60
00:03:34.293 --> 00:03:37.029
It's a lot easier than it is for
us to write it in code and

61
00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.897
kind of having an organized catalog of
all the components you have access to,

62
00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:42.581
because nobody means to do that.

63
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.437
They just didn't even know you had that
component because there was no organized

64
00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:46.406
system for it whatsoever.

65
00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:50.483
The act of creating it makes you more
productive, makes your testing easier,

66
00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:51.609
makes development.

67
00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.313
I love me that second monitor
with some storybook in it.

68
00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:59.248
But then it also like, the designs that
made one new button table are going to

69
00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:03.307
put, that's slightly different than
the one you had to do that on purpose that

70
00:04:03.307 --> 00:04:07.214
didn't know that seven files over you
had this thing from three years ago.

71
00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:07.932
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:07.932 --> 00:04:09.860
You didn't even know either, right?

73
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.643
And so the idea of cataloging it and like
being honest with yourself that you have

74
00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:17.821
a design system, even if you don't have a
design system team, your company, I think,

75
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:20.269
encourages best day a better
day to day practices.

76
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.994
Testing all the other like
less glamorous stuff as well.

77
00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.477
Thank you all so much.

78
00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:27.203
Woo.

79
00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:28.419
Thank.

80
00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.547
