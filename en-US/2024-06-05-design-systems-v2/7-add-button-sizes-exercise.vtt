00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.162
So I'm gonna cut you loose for a minute,

2
00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:09.072
I made different button variants,
good on me.

3
00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:13.662
There is also the concept of sizes
of buttons, I made some arbitrary

4
00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:18.264
decisions on how I want my button
sizes to be if you hate these sizes.

5
00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.287
And you wanna make a giant button,
you do whatever you want.

6
00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.842
If you want some free CSS,
take my CSS, do whatever you want.

7
00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:28.402
Your job over the next few
minutes is to go ahead and

8
00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:35.688
then add in this idea of button sizes,
along with all the variants that we have.

9
00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:43.474
Awesome, so
our job was to add a new prop to help

10
00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:47.395
determine the size of our component.

11
00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:52.927
And so let's go ahead and let's do that.

12
00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:57.255
So I think we have way
more than three sizes.

13
00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:02.073
But you get as much of the point
implementing three sizes as

14
00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:05.621
you do the five or
six that we end up having.

15
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:10.403
So we can say size and
it will all depend a little bit,

16
00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:16.615
a weird thing about me is I don't
like shortened words or acronyms.

17
00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:21.755
Even stuff like dev tool ironically I
call it developer it's really obnoxious,

18
00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:24.409
so I will call it small, medium, large.

19
00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.188
Your design system might be different cuz
I don't know what to tell you about it

20
00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.233
with xxl or extra, extra large,
you decide what you wanna do.

21
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.237
So we've got the sizes here and

22
00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:38.185
I do need to add those to the CSS cuz I
don't think they're included in here.

23
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:42.743
Let's actually grab those classes
from where I gave them to you.

24
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:48.923
And we can basically use a lot
of these same techniques here.

25
00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:52.754
And so we've got that in place,
we've got the styles, and

26
00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:54.602
those are in the module now.

27
00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:57.186
So we can actually add it in here.

28
00:01:57.186 --> 00:02:02.198
So we can say that we're gonna pull
off the size, no, no, not sizes, size.

29
00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:07.542
The size as well, so we'll say size,

30
00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:15.736
and you can decide if you wanna
have a default in this case.

31
00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:20.322
I'm gonna assume that since I've got
three buttons, small, medium, large,

32
00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:23.368
I'm going to decide that
medium is the default size.

33
00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:24.951
You could also make those things required.

34
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:31.685
It all depends on like the use
cases of your design system for

35
00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:35.871
me /us, medium is our default one.

36
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:40.664
Cool, and then all you really need to do
here is, now that we're using this you can

37
00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:44.020
imagine if we had to do three
more of those if statements.

38
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.269
And concatenate stuff on that would
get obnoxious, we might start playing

39
00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.449
around with array.join space, all sorts of
stuff, but I don't have to do any of that.

40
00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.007
I can just say styles, size, and

41
00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.801
that is going to get the key off
of that value as well in here.

42
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.876
And out of curiosity before I add
any stories, I'm gonna peek over,

43
00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:06.907
it's not really curiosity,
but we'll go ahead.

44
00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:10.291
The hot module reload is great for
the components, but for

45
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:13.686
that kind of generation of refresh,
we'll do the trick.

46
00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:18.118
We have small, medium,
large, disabled, enabled.

47
00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:20.718
So the question we got earlier is,
would you make a story for

48
00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:21.967
every single combination.

49
00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.929
We'd already be at what,
like three times three times three?

50
00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:27.777
Three times two times whatever,

51
00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:30.884
so I don't know if I would
necessarily do that, right?

52
00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:35.282
I might have one for a disabled
button if I wanted to verify that it

53
00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:38.962
was in fact disabled or
something along those lines.

54
00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:42.312
And then I wouldn't do a primary large,
secondary large,

55
00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:44.598
destructive large, so on and so forth.

56
00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:48.163
I would probably have these three and
then maybe a small and

57
00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:51.969
a large since mediums default,
maybe I'll include medium.

58
00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.753
It's kind of like,
it doesn't really matter, but

59
00:03:55.753 --> 00:04:00.226
if I wanted to verify something,
then I could do that as well.

60
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.308
So let's go ahead and add that.

61
00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:07.225
And again, this becomes export
cons small and are small.

62
00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:12.324
And we'll do the large and
we'll see one thing that,

63
00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:18.117
no, I don't want medium,
I'm trying to make a point here.

64
00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:24.290
I export cons, large, story, story,

65
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.737
story with the arges of size large,

66
00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:34.656
thank you IntelliSense great.

67
00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:39.246
So one thing that you will notice
is that one if we go to small,

68
00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:43.026
you see that the small radio
button is selected and

69
00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:47.901
if we go to large, we can see
the large radio button is selected.

70
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:51.538
In the event where
theoretically we are passing in

71
00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:54.662
undefined then it's not selected at all.

72
00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:58.471
For most, that is technically
meaningful cuz it is undefined and

73
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.209
there might be a difference.

74
00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:03.954
You might not necessarily have a medium,
but the default for me that bothers me.

75
00:05:03.954 --> 00:05:07.731
And if it bothers you,
we can fix it very easily.

76
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:10.932
If you are a much more of
a just well rounded person,

77
00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:13.617
then you have to worry about these things.

78
00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:17.874
So I can go ahead and
say that by default unless I override it,

79
00:05:17.874 --> 00:05:22.982
then we'll say yeah, sure the variant
is primary and the sizes medium.

80
00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:29.337
And now in all of our stories, we will see
the selections are in place there, right?

81
00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:32.290
Again, if undefined is meaningful,
don't set it.

82
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.594
If you want a default in there because
it bugs you that it's not there,

83
00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:36.554
go ahead and set it.

84
00:05:36.554 --> 00:05:37.886
Is it important either way?

85
00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:42.422
Cuz our code still then programmatically
defaults to primary medium,

86
00:05:42.422 --> 00:05:43.789
sure do that as well.

87
00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.870
Whatever makes you happiest
will work in this case.
