WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.216
And so we can go ahead and add some of
that dark mode to the button as well.

2
00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:12.156
And so we can do that, but
first I'm going to kind of tweak a few

3
00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:17.003
things cuz we're not using any
Tailwind at all in the present

4
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.919
version of the button,
that's the CSS module.

5
00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.570
So I can go tweak Tailwind to my heart's
content and nothing really matters.

6
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.520
So we need to at least do that
quick migration in this case.

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.763
So there's a few options here,
one is that,

8
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:45.229
We could theoretically go in here and
use some of the default

9
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.535
Tailwind stuff, we can hit Apply and
some of these things.

10
00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:55.842
But you can imagine that even,
have you ever seen a large Tailwind file,

11
00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:59.992
it's like a bunch of tiny utility classes.

12
00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:04.197
And you can imagine that even my tools for
turning on and

13
00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:08.585
off classes about CLSX has
a certain threshold that I have

14
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:12.625
seen in reality of how many
we choose to add, right?

15
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:18.952
So we could do something like,
Even to make it real simple, we could

16
00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:23.454
do something like, I need to pull in a
color theme before anything really works.

17
00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:25.487
I've got the default
Tailwind colors in here.

18
00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:27.046
But let's just do an example real quick.

19
00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:30.688
So I'm gonna take out
the background color.

20
00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:35.790
And this is a little bit of a sales pitch
for Tailwind and one of the reasons why

21
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.343
even when I think I don't need it,
I eventually break and end up using it.

22
00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:46.398
So I could do something like apply,
and I can say bg-indigo.

23
00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:51.296
This is if you have an existing CSS file,
we'll see how to do it in a second.

24
00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:55.006
And first of all,
the IntelliSense is wonderful.

25
00:01:55.006 --> 00:02:00.097
But then you can do stuff like hover colon

26
00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:06.449
bg-indigo-, 400, and not have

27
00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:10.803
that extra pseudo class, and under the
hood, it will do all those things for you.

28
00:02:10.803 --> 00:02:16.358
And then what you can eventually do is
get rid of the CSS file altogether,

29
00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:22.115
right, and do something where you just
have them inline in the component.

30
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:28.099
For instance we, And so
you can just keep them all in here,

31
00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.507
which is kind of a nice ergonomic
thing as well, and now it's indigo.

32
00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:36.437
It's a little bit different cuz I
changed some of the colors around,

33
00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:38.903
so it does get darker in this case.

34
00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:42.212
Actually, I think the hover
still overrides it.

35
00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:43.541
But you can put them like this.

36
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:48.303
But I'm not gonna necessarily go and
refactor the CSS module because I'm gonna

37
00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:53.422
show you a different strategy for creating
variants with different colors in a second

38
00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:58.561
that will be better than whatever it takes
me 35, 40 minutes to refactor by hand.

39
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:03.884
So we're just gonna do the better thing
in a little bit, because I think for

40
00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:08.617
building a design system,
there are better tooling than even just

41
00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:13.626
a long string of Tailwind classes and
stuff along those lines, cool.

42
00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:19.934
There are a few kinda little things
that we want to talk about here,

43
00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:26.369
which is, if we wanted to theoretically
force a dark mode, right?

44
00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:30.080
We talked about decorators, there's
also this idea of parameters, right?

45
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.798
And we've accidentally seen some

46
00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:37.301
of the initial parameters in
this query params, right?

47
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:42.887
And these are settings that you
want to pass into a story, right?

48
00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:49.159
So one of the things that we can do
is if we wanted to force dark mode,

49
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.757
for instance, on a given story,
we can do that.

50
00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:56.469
And so let's say we wanted to make,
and this goes into,

51
00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.067
especially if we wanna do visual
regression testing and stuff like that.

52
00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:03.832
We would wanna have a dedicated story for
that button in dark mode,

53
00:04:03.832 --> 00:04:06.809
all the different things
in dark mode as well.

54
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.823
And going in there and tweaking the theme
is great while we're playing around and

55
00:04:10.823 --> 00:04:12.049
testing stuff.

56
00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.231
Not great for running a test suite
against and doing visual regression and

57
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:18.199
running the accessibility test.

58
00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.149
Just cuz you have color contrast in light
mode does not mean you have it in dark

59
00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:23.952
mode, so on and so forth, right?

60
00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:28.047
And so sometimes we wanna have a story
that forces either something in

61
00:04:28.047 --> 00:04:31.632
the responsive design mode or
forces it in dark mode.

62
00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:35.037
And we can do that for an entire suite
of stories by putting the meta, or

63
00:04:35.037 --> 00:04:37.252
we can do it for one individual story.

64
00:04:37.252 --> 00:04:42.824
And it all depends, you might have two
files with roughly the same level stories,

65
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:48.938
but one completely dark, one completely in
light, or you can mix and match per story.

66
00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:50.442
It's just whether or
not you put in the meta or

67
00:04:50.442 --> 00:04:52.948
whether you put out individual stories,
it's the same syntax.

68
00:04:52.948 --> 00:04:56.668
But let's take a look at that syntax and
to see what it's like.

69
00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:02.087
So let's say,
I'll say export const Dark, right?

70
00:05:02.087 --> 00:05:04.201
And now that we've got this
plugin installed, and again,

71
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:06.706
we haven't fully implemented dark
mode yet, but we will in a second.

72
00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.652
We'll do it as part of
a larger narrative arc.

73
00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:12.439
And so here I can say that this story,
the parameters,

74
00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.346
I don't actually want backgrounds,
I want this point,

75
00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:18.376
backgrounds is that other one
we saw before with the light,

76
00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:21.190
the dark background,
messed me up for a second there.

77
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.351
We want themes,
which is one added by that plugin.

78
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:31.762
This one we're gonna say themeOverrides,

79
00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:34.885
plural, override.

80
00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.638
How many r's is in override,
as we'll have to remember.

81
00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:42.020
And we'll say dark, and yeah,
let's actually look at it.

82
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.636
On point, I'll make my point in a second.

83
00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:46.576
So we'll go dark and you can see this one,

84
00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:51.322
no matter what we choose to do,
this one is set to dark mode.

85
00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:54.962
So now, we had visual regression tests,
we had accessibility tests.

86
00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:59.845
They would see this story always in dark
mode and also nice if you're developing,

87
00:05:59.845 --> 00:06:03.687
but the query params will
mostly work in that case.

88
00:06:03.687 --> 00:06:07.519
This actually, if you look at parameters,

89
00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:12.389
themes: themeOverride and
you go to preview, right,

90
00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:19.087
you can kinda see that we can actually
do that for the entire suite as well.

91
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:23.137
You can have different settings in here,
but yeah, for me mostly,

92
00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:25.424
we're just doing it on a story level.

93
00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:30.779
I might eventually graduate it up to its
own files that are uniquely that but

94
00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.160
it's not worth it at this point.

95
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.584
But either one of them depends
on what your use case is.

96
00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:41.252
While we're in here, though, I will just
show you one more thing that's I think

97
00:06:41.252 --> 00:06:45.596
super helpful cuz I don't really have
a good excuse to talk about it later.

98
00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:48.826
Which is,
you can also force the viewport, right?

99
00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:51.368
So this one is parameters viewport, and

100
00:06:51.368 --> 00:06:54.369
you can actually set
the viewport to mobile1.

101
00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:59.062
Now, mobile1 is one of the current
defaults in Storybook.

102
00:06:59.062 --> 00:07:02.491
You can actually, what did I mess up?

103
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:06.890
Extra closing brace.

104
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.526
mobile1 is one of those
built into Storybook.

105
00:07:10.526 --> 00:07:15.374
You can say, hey, actually these
are the breakpoints that we support, and

106
00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:16.526
customize that.

107
00:07:16.526 --> 00:07:18.610
How do you know what they are?

108
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.517
Here's a hack, well,
this is gonna be a different story.

109
00:07:24.517 --> 00:07:27.840
You go set it to large mobile, and
you look at the query param and

110
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.929
see those mobile, too, [LAUGH] right?

111
00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.499
You can define whatever you want but
generally speaking,

112
00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.654
if you're looking at one and
you're like, I wonder which one this is?

113
00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:37.965
Just look at the query param, there it is.

114
00:07:37.965 --> 00:07:42.965
And so you can force stories in dark mode,
you can force stories at every responsive

115
00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:47.894
break point, and again, when we get into
the whole, like, I want to make changes

116
00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:52.422
to my design system and
I don't want to get paged, right, by the.

117
00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:57.706
These are all incredibly
helpful tools around that
