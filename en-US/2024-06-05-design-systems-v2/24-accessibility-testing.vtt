1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.737
Let's talk about some various ways.

2
00:00:01.737 --> 00:00:05.010
There is an add-on, it's not in there
by default, which seems criminal.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.462
But there is an addon
that will both show you

4
00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:17.279
actually how these look with
either blurred vision or

5
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.987
various different color, things.

6
00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:27.171
I'm not entirely sure what the right
word is, so I'm just gonna be vague.

7
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:29.571
And so you can kinda see what it
looks like, which is super useful.

8
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:34.457
But then if you have this on the bottom
bar as well, which you would argue

9
00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:39.061
that I would have shown earlier,
you can move this to the bottom.

10
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.034
You've got interactions
that are accessibility.

11
00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:45.934
And for running X-Core,
will show you some of the basic,

12
00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:49.574
does it have the right ARIA attributes?

13
00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:51.024
Does it pass color contrast?

14
00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:54.454
That is the one,
who thinks my text area was good enough?

15
00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:54.954
I don't think.

16
00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.814
Dark mode, though, wasn't right in dark.

17
00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:00.391
Yeah, violation.

18
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.783
Right, a violation,
it was fine in light mode.

19
00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:09.562
In dark mode, there's not enough
contrast on that character count, right?

20
00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:15.023
So let's pretend that I did
that on purpose and fix it.

21
00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:16.982
So we can go in now.

22
00:01:16.982 --> 00:01:18.793
I totally did it on purpose.

23
00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:22.738
So go in here.

24
00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:26.503
So slate-600 is probably not enough.

25
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:31.655
One can literally, Still not enough.

26
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:42.747
400 did the trick, right?

27
00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:46.913
And this is great on a component level
because when we did the accessibility,

28
00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.297
Death March, right, just fix the issues.

29
00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:53.927
You have a lot of other things like h1,
h2, h3 headings in the right order.

30
00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:57.764
In a world where you're not
writing a web page, and

31
00:01:57.764 --> 00:02:01.738
everything's broken up into columns,
might be the end of me at some point.

32
00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:02.987
And that's the thing, but

33
00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:05.928
actually being able to see it on
an individual component level.

34
00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:10.592
And then theoretically, if you run it
through Playwright, every page fails for

35
00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:12.108
the same reason, right?

36
00:02:12.108 --> 00:02:16.635
And so we checked at the very end and we
did a manual audit with the design team,

37
00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:20.885
but checked at the very end, but
it was untenable to take the overall site

38
00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:24.319
ones because yeah,
that's a component layout in an app.

39
00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.989
The same header failed
on every single page.

40
00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.389
It is easier to have the header and
storybook in your design system.

41
00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.099
Go triage it there, get that one working,
move on to the next component.

42
00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.435
Again, the fun of being both a manager and
an engineer is you go into

43
00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:46.791
your component library, you do ls,
right, to get all the files.

44
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:52.107
And then you use multi-cursor and create
the title for the JIRA ticket called

45
00:02:52.107 --> 00:02:57.093
fix Excel issues in this file in your
design system, and then you put them

46
00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:01.958
into a sprint and you all regret
choices you made in your life, right?

47
00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.971
And but having as an individual component
one by one in a way that we could check

48
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.869
off, and not just having to
stare at a page and go for it,

49
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.745
is probably the only reason we were
able to get it done super fast, right?

50
00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:16.597
And so some of these structures,
yes, for design system, for

51
00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:21.469
sharing design consistency, all of the
things that every designer who has ever

52
00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.471
talked about design system
tries to sell you on.

53
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:27.142
As an engineer who has to do stuff,

54
00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:32.593
also these same tools make my
productivity as an engineer way better.

55
00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:36.645
All right, the other thing that we can
do with the accessibility testing,

56
00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.663
I'll kinda show you this real quick.

57
00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:44.996
Is turns out there is a magical third
file in that .storybook directory

58
00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:50.377
that you can create, and
that is called test-runner.ts,

59
00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:56.251
which are some configuration options for
your test-runner.

60
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:57.811
I am not gonna type this in by hand.

61
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:01.382
So if you need to add it,
that is the addon,

62
00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:04.869
it was already included in there for you.

63
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:09.499
Let's look at this, which is basically you
can configure the test-runner, which is,

64
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.944
again, playwright effectively.

65
00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:17.354
So we've got axe-playwright, axe,
which is the accessibility auditing tool,

66
00:04:17.354 --> 00:04:20.534
playwright, which drives
the Chrome browser.

67
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:27.641
Side comment is on the paid
versions of Chromatic,

68
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.616
the free, you run Chrome.

69
00:04:31.726 --> 00:04:36.046
But Chrome's not the problem,
you were using Chrome when you developed.

70
00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:37.326
What browser broke?

71
00:04:37.326 --> 00:04:38.963
&gt;&gt; Safari.
&gt;&gt; Safari, right?

72
00:04:38.963 --> 00:04:41.126
You can also have it run Safari.

73
00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:46.076
And that is, for me, as a person
who has access to my own budget,

74
00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:51.491
[LAUGH] that's why I opened the first
strings, because three people at

75
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:57.031
my company, I have the stats of how
many people visit my site in Safari.

76
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:01.065
It's not a lot, but
people I work with who are loud,

77
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:05.673
one uses Firefox, one uses Safari,
don't wanna hear it.

78
00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:10.661
Also, a certain company that makes Safari
might use the open source version of

79
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:13.090
a product, anyway, so I've heard.

80
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.610
Can't confirm or deny that.

81
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.330
So, yeah, those things are important.

82
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.135
And so you can run with Safari.

83
00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:24.678
But anyway, as I was saying,
you injectAxe, this is really effectively

84
00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:29.728
Playwright code that's running
through the Storybook configuration.

85
00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:34.337
And to say,
as you leave each story, all right,

86
00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:38.848
go ahead and
run the accessibility audit test.

87
00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:42.071
I don't have a lot of components.

88
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:46.608
If when we were to load in the badges,
the dark mode danger badge,

89
00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:52.136
maybe that one was intentionally low
contrast until I realized I differently,

90
00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:55.192
intentionally made a mistake.

91
00:05:55.192 --> 00:05:59.652
Not a mistake, an intentional choice
as well but it will also run through.

92
00:05:59.652 --> 00:06:04.844
So again, the fear is always that,
it's always the little things.

93
00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:08.104
Nobody intentionally,
doesn't do these things.

94
00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:14.144
What happens is one well meaning change
at one point causes a regression.

95
00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:19.043
If you don't have automated tests,
they build up until the next time

96
00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:24.279
someone goes through and does an
accessibility audit and realize that all

97
00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.820
systems decay into entropy, right,
including your best of intentions.

98
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.590
And so if it's not an automated in
your CI/CD, it ain't happening.

99
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.744
So cool, I don't know if anything will
fail at this point since we did fix

100
00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:39.845
the issue we had, but
we'll find out together.

101
00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:52.143
We did have one accessibility
violation found in LengthTooLong,

102
00:06:52.143 --> 00:06:57.186
so let's go take a look at that one and
see what our issue is.

103
00:07:05.322 --> 00:07:08.905
Possibly my red, but
something, again, is not,

104
00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:13.787
the cool thing that you can do, I think
it's just my window a little bit too,

105
00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:17.661
yeah, my window is
a little bit too crammed.

106
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.681
Show me, there it is.

107
00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:23.011
This checkbox,
it's worth the price entry right here.

108
00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:27.141
Where it says highlight results,
I check that box.

109
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:31.121
It shows me exactly where the issue is,
right?

110
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:33.836
Again, it's my count that I
added at the last minute,

111
00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.923
because I thought it'd be fun.

112
00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:39.411
That is, again, not meeting
the accessibility contract, but

113
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.683
that ability to highlight the change and
actually see it is huge.

114
00:07:43.683 --> 00:07:45.763
Do I wish I had that a long time ago, and

115
00:07:45.763 --> 00:07:49.208
it's one of the reasons that I
think developing in Storybook is

116
00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:54.033
also incredibly powerful on top of all the
design system, accoutrements that you get.

117
00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:58.360
That is worth the price
of entry right there.

118
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.590
Let's be good people and fix it.

119
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.885
So we've got that.

120
00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:05.088
Cool, cool, cool.

121
00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:08.768
And so let's brighterize that one, too.

122
00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:10.480
400 did the trick last time.

123
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.830
I'm hoping 400 does the trick this time.

124
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.639
Zero violations.

125
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:17.883
We're good.

126
00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:21.639
So yeah, but super helpful because it did
catch something I wasn't even aware of.

127
00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:24.549
I can hand-wave you, tell you, and
it'll catch things you're not aware of.

128
00:08:24.549 --> 00:08:26.875
It's really great when it catches
something it was not aware of.
