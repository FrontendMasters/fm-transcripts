00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.145
One of the things that we've been a little
handwavy about, is we wrote a CSS

2
00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:10.556
module for our button, and we imported
it and our button is styled correctly.

3
00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:14.102
And that's a good practice that
you should do almost all the time.

4
00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:22.003
But we all know that there
are global style sheets, right?

5
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.294
Even if it's just a CSS reset, right,

6
00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:27.285
you probably have some
kind of global stylesheet.

7
00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:31.451
You cannot import everything per file,
right?

8
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:36.877
And so right now if we had
something like a background

9
00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:42.686
color in index.css,
then we wouldn't see anything.

10
00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:46.699
And so we missed all of our CSS reset,
all of our kind of default styling.

11
00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.450
We wanna pull that into storybook.

12
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.139
But some of the topics we're covering
now when we talk about pulling

13
00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.936
a style sheet and having global styles,

14
00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:04.888
I'm gonna show it along with adding
in Tailwind cuz that's a pattern.

15
00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:06.818
But everything I'm gonna talk about for

16
00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:09.041
the next little bit is
not Tailwind specific.

17
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.960
You can do it with Tailwind,
you can do it without Tailwind.

18
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.002
I'm gonna do it with Tailwind so
I don't have to do it twice.

19
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.084
But it's true of your CSS reset.

20
00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:18.054
It's true whatever style
sheets that you have.

21
00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:22.347
It's true Google Font scripts,

22
00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:26.647
it's true of whatever you want.

23
00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:28.628
No matter what the situation is,

24
00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:32.036
I'm just gonna use setting
up Tailwind as the exemplar.

25
00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:35.206
Now I have Tailwind
installed as a dependency.

26
00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:40.110
If you're working your own repo,
npm install tailwind and

27
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.059
then you do tailwind init, right?

28
00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:45.390
There's a whole course on Tailwind,
you should probably watch it.

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.552
So we won't get into the details there.

30
00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:52.713
But let's talk about the kind of pattern
of pulling in that initial style sheet.

31
00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:56.760
Where your style sheet lives, might be on
a public file, it might be somewhere else.

32
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.784
I have this index.css
in my source directory

33
00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:07.547
mostly cuz that's where we put it.

34
00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:10.298
So I'll kid,
it'll be slightly different, whatever.

35
00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:14.650
I have Tailwind kinda
setup in here as well.

36
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.201
Vite out of the box supports CSS,
you get that for free, and

37
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:24.322
also supports importing CSS files
as we saw with the module.css.

38
00:02:24.322 --> 00:02:29.130
That's all Vite stuff, that's not story
but specific, it's not React specific,

39
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.290
Webpack has basically the same
functionality as well.

40
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.755
So I've got this file,
and all I really need

41
00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:43.072
to do here is go into that preview.ts, and

42
00:02:43.072 --> 00:02:49.889
I can just say, import '../src/index.css'.

43
00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.503
And just to do a sanity check,

44
00:02:53.503 --> 00:02:59.575
I'm gonna just add some
ridiculous CSS in there so

45
00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:06.240
I can make sure that it is,
background-color is red.

46
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.083
Cool, and so you can see that my CSS,
two things to note.

47
00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:11.303
Hey, it's here.

48
00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.102
Yay, thumbs up, great.

49
00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:18.091
And two, it is scoped only to
the actual preview, right?

50
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:21.061
That's why we're importing here so

51
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:25.572
that everything's set up
the way that we would want it.

52
00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.315
In this case as well,
this could be any style sheet.

53
00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:30.964
It's not have to be a Tail,
all I did was import a CSS file.

54
00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:34.463
And I'm getting Tailwind's reset,
basically.

55
00:03:34.463 --> 00:03:36.766
That's all I'm getting at this moment.
