WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.667
We're gonna take a little bit of a side
quest because this is great and wonderful,

2
00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:09.082
but the more you can document your design
system, and how you use it, right?

3
00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:13.127
And what the appropriate thing and
this is a shared thing too, yeah,

4
00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.917
there's rules and
if you look at Twilio paste,

5
00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:20.059
a lot of these design systems will be,
this is when you use this thing.

6
00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.287
And that is definitely meant for
the designers as the audience, right?

7
00:00:23.287 --> 00:00:28.053
My job is to then take those segments and
make them a website thing, but again,

8
00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:30.739
it becomes a collaboration piece, right?

9
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.660
Because for most of these things,
it could be the designers deciding what

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.912
the rules and when you should use this
kind of button versus that kind of button.

11
00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:43.372
But when we saw Microsoft's design system,
Atlassian design system,

12
00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:47.327
Twilio designs, all the designs
as they're all in storybook.

13
00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:51.225
So it becomes again, that collaboration
between development and design.

14
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:52.283
And there's some really,

15
00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:54.629
really powerful features that
also help you as a developer.

16
00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.934
So we will look at those real quick, and
then we'll kinda go and look at that call

17
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:02.881
out component when we have a full picture
of all the things that we can do.

18
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:08.482
So, predominantly, most of our work
today has been in a stories.tsx file,

19
00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:10.388
and that's pretty cool.

20
00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:14.168
But what happens, I keep going
to badge cuz it starts with a b,

21
00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:17.093
let's close that,
there we go, much better.

22
00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:22.227
All right, so let's go here and
say, button.mdx,

23
00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:26.231
and I'm just gonna write some mark down.

24
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:29.742
Hello world!

25
00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:32.593
I am a button, sure.

26
00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:36.045
I'm just gonna say that, so
mark down, nothing special.

27
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:40.982
Let's go back into my story book,
cool, over here,

28
00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:44.729
I have a button and here's my markdown.

29
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.305
Okay, great, that's fine.

30
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:53.575
We're all nodding but
it's not that impressive.

31
00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:59.255
What we wanna do is actually then make
this the documentation for our button.

32
00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:03.681
And so storybook has these
things called docs blocks.

33
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:08.716
I'm just gonna say blocks from this
point forward because there's no

34
00:02:08.716 --> 00:02:14.107
way I'm gonna repeatedly say docs blocks,
and not stumble over my words.

35
00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:18.747
mdx is basically a variant,
overloaded word,

36
00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:23.619
pun unintended,
marked down syntax over there,

37
00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:29.305
that also supports a certain
amount of JavaScript/JSX.

38
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:34.534
I mentioned this at the beginning of
the workshop, but I'll mention it now

39
00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:39.600
cuz it's important, which is MDX you
can write JSX also known as React.

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.340
You can do this even if you are Svelte,
Vue, whatever, right?

41
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.618
It's not important, but
it is React, right?

42
00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:52.149
You don't need to have React installed
as a dependency as a version eight,

43
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.672
if you have seven yet and you do.

44
00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:58.002
But version eight, they bundle it
in there, but it is React syntax.

45
00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:01.687
So if you try to then just write Svelte or

46
00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:06.724
Vue you will be sad but
it's pretty easy to deal with.

47
00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:11.012
I will mention just real quick, the MDX
file got picked up because that is in

48
00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:15.527
the settings and that is by default unless
you went out of your way to change it.

49
00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:19.697
You're like, I don't know what this is and
removed it then it won't work, but

50
00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:22.933
if you didn't change that,
it will totally work as well, and

51
00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:25.131
that's how it got picked up in that case.

52
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:31.467
So at the very simple level, I can do
something like this inside of markdown,

53
00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:35.657
which is I could say import
button from button, and

54
00:03:35.657 --> 00:03:40.648
then anywhere I want in here,
I can do button, I am a button.

55
00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:48.699
And if we go back to that page,
look, we have a button in

56
00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.721
our markdown file, and
you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

57
00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:56.506
My website where we have
the core stuff is spelt but

58
00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.770
directly I use a Svelte variant of this.

59
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.107
Again, and it's kinda cool to be
able to embed components in there,

60
00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:08.525
but then what becomes a lot more
powerful is there are a lot

61
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:12.873
of these components that
Storybook gives you for free.

62
00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:13.834
So let's pull in some of them.

63
00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:18.970
We're gonna pull in import,
and we're gonna say Meta,

64
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.083
which is just like, what is this?

65
00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:24.402
We'll start with just that one,
what is this?

66
00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:30.360
Storybook, I think it's just blocks, yeah.

67
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.889
And we'll pull in
the import ButtonStories,

68
00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:43.411
you know how in this stories,
I'll just look at it real quick.

69
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:48.149
We exported as default the meta
about this set of stories and

70
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:52.506
everything you need to know,
which is the title of it,

71
00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:57.647
what the args are,
what component we're describing, right?

72
00:04:57.647 --> 00:05:00.791
That is the default export
from button.stories.

73
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.181
So we'll pull that in from,

74
00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:10.450
Button.stories as well,
and now we'll watch as,

75
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.287
I'll show you real quick just for
compare and contrast.

76
00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:19.311
They're kinda not connected
to each other right now.

77
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:24.017
What we can do instead of saying will say,

78
00:05:24.017 --> 00:05:29.127
Meta of ButtonStories,
which is just saying

79
00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:34.379
like this document is
describing the button.

80
00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.308
Which did move it over here, and so

81
00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:43.268
now it is docs along with all of my
button stories in this case, right?

82
00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:44.869
And so this is where you might, again,

83
00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:47.642
nobody wants to watch me write
a bunch of prose describing a button.

84
00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:50.358
But theoretically,
let's look at an example,

85
00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:53.815
this is kind of like it in practice,
from Twilio's, right?

86
00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:56.610
Here's the guidelines,
here's about the account switcher.

87
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.639
Let's go look at their button just for
context, right?

88
00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.565
And we'll do some of this momentarily.

89
00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:07.219
But it's the guidelines, when to use a
button, a button versus an anchor link, so

90
00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:08.161
on and so forth.

91
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:13.145
So we've got that and there's just
some other little helpful ones

92
00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:16.797
in here as well, so
we could do stuff like Title.

93
00:06:18.214 --> 00:06:25.424
Where we'll say Title is most of that
is just some helpful styling as well.

94
00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:31.180
But where this becomes a little bit
more interesting is we could say,

95
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.533
let's go with the primary, is not
necessarily the one you called primary,

96
00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:42.708
it is the first story that is
exported cuz ESM keeps the order.

97
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:46.445
So if you called it default or
whatever, it is whatever the first

98
00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:51.171
story that you had in that export of the
stories is considered the primary story.

99
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:55.904
So now what I can do is I can say primary,

100
00:06:55.904 --> 00:07:00.066
and I could write a bunch of prose,

101
00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:05.518
like (Here is notes on
how to use a button),

102
00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:08.403
put it in parentheses.

103
00:07:08.403 --> 00:07:12.936
Cool, so we've got that here as well.

104
00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:19.471
And it's a JSX, so
you gonna have the closing tag.

105
00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:21.253
Wrong tab, there we go.

106
00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:25.337
And now you can see there is my
primary story in here as well,

107
00:07:25.337 --> 00:07:28.618
along with the prose on
how to like use a button.

108
00:07:28.618 --> 00:07:33.282
And this is just one of the stories,
there's also stories plural.

109
00:07:33.282 --> 00:07:35.807
And if you just like the default
components, and you're like,

110
00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:37.272
I don't need this, then ignore it.

111
00:07:37.272 --> 00:07:40.798
But there are some powerful pieces around,
so we can just use stories.

112
00:07:44.237 --> 00:07:48.163
And we can say, show me all the stories
here, I gotta put that slash,

113
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:53.074
and that's like here's primary, here's
secondary, so they're all in one page.

114
00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:57.233
So you can see all of the buttons in this
case, and you can write your own code and

115
00:07:57.233 --> 00:07:58.758
all of those things as well.

116
00:07:58.758 --> 00:08:02.927
The other cool thing is, on just a usage
level and documentation, it shows you

117
00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:07.244
the syntax for this component like,
you want a button that looks like this.

118
00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:08.680
And these are simple, but

119
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.015
you can see a world where on
a more complicated case, right?

120
00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:15.029
We can see all the pieces in here.

121
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.759
And there's a whole bunch
of other ones in here for

122
00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:20.692
various different uses you
show a particular story.

123
00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:25.759
The other one that I think is
useful in a lot of cases is this

124
00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:30.735
controls which are those
controls that we saw earlier.

125
00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:35.741
So I can say, let's put the, will say,

126
00:08:35.741 --> 00:08:42.089
Other variations here,
and we'll put controls.

127
00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.861
And that meta is what's hooking it all up,

128
00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:47.308
if you don't have this it's could be like
I don't know what you want controls up and

129
00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:49.392
what you wanna story off,
so, it gets confused.

130
00:08:49.392 --> 00:08:56.666
But now, you can say, okay, cool,
these are all the props that it takes,

131
00:08:56.666 --> 00:09:02.112
this is what type it takes,
here's the default value.

132
00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:05.957
And a lot of that it acquiesced
from the typescript types.

133
00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:10.244
And what's even kinda cooler is,
we didn't write our own types anymore.

134
00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:10.873
You know what I mean?

135
00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:16.553
We use that class variance authority to
generate our types, which then generated

136
00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:22.329
annotations on our controls, which then
also showed us how to use this component.

137
00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:26.497
Which I think is super useful as well,
and again, you change anything here and

138
00:09:26.497 --> 00:09:29.606
changes that primary story,
like the way we have up here.

139
00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:34.519
So if you like the default layout, you
can use that if you find yourself wanting

140
00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:38.698
to have different opinions and
you can use the docs blocks in here.

141
00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:42.578
You can also write your
own presentational things.

142
00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:46.876
You can do all JavaScript works in here,
any component you have works.

143
00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:50.979
If you have strong opinions on how
you wanna communicate and standardize

144
00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:55.498
on communicating your design system,
all of that is fair game in here, right?

145
00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:58.253
And that's obviously
of course going to be,

146
00:09:58.253 --> 00:10:01.813
unique to what you're doing,
and it's in there as well.

147
00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:05.331
There are one or
two special use cases I do wanna show you,

148
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:08.935
you can choose to use them,
you can choose to not use them.

149
00:10:08.935 --> 00:10:12.823
These are some of the ones I
think are super helpful, and

150
00:10:12.823 --> 00:10:16.977
they are kind of somewhat
agnostic to any given component.

151
00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:18.891
So I can put him in tokens,

152
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:24.198
I'm gonna put them in the top level
because I don't know what else to do.

153
00:10:24.198 --> 00:10:31.179
So I can do colors.mdx, and
this is kinda a useful one.

154
00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:38.571
That is definitely I think, helpful,
yeah, in that collaboration with design.

155
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:43.933
So we can do something like,
will do import, let's do,

156
00:10:43.933 --> 00:10:48.628
we'll grab Meta, and
we'll say ColorPalette,

157
00:10:48.628 --> 00:10:52.651
you can guess where we're going here, and

158
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.259
ColorItem from storybook/blocks.

159
00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:57.627
Great, great, great, and

160
00:10:57.627 --> 00:11:01.347
we'll say in this case we're not actually
tying it to a given set of stories.

161
00:11:01.347 --> 00:11:05.709
So we'll just say
the Meta title is Colors.

162
00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:08.171
Awesome, and now we can take
that ColorPalette component and

163
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:10.410
you could write this yourself
if you wanted to, right?

164
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.086
This is just one they gave you for free.

165
00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:17.419
If you need something special,

166
00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:24.534
it's just JSX, you can totally write it.

167
00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:29.749
I don't even know how to
spell palette anymore.

168
00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:32.794
You'd think I'd got good at
this at some point, but no.

169
00:11:32.794 --> 00:11:38.158
Cool, and then what we'll do is
we could say something like,

170
00:11:38.158 --> 00:11:41.357
we'll start with something basic,

171
00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:46.011
we'll say ColorItem, and
we'll say title is Blue.

172
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:47.038
We'll switch this out in a second.

173
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.925
Our brand because every brand is blue.

174
00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:58.798
Sweet, and we'll say that the colors are,

175
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.639
I'll just start with the,

176
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.675
Xcode, if we flip over.

177
00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:18.854
All right, what did I waste time?

178
00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:23.860
All right, when am I gonna close
myself closing tags nobody knows.

179
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.649
Can I spell ColorPalette right?

180
00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:28.834
ColorPalette has one l and two ts,
for those keeping track at home.

181
00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:33.830
The only bad part about MDX is the
IntelliSense is not nearly as good as if

182
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.424
you're writing a JavaScript file.

183
00:12:36.424 --> 00:12:39.801
And you can see how much
I rely on IntelliSense,

184
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:43.273
by the fact that I don't
know how to spell at all.

185
00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:46.947
And so here's a color swatch and
that's cool or whatever, but

186
00:12:46.947 --> 00:12:49.592
let's take this to its natural conclusion.

187
00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:57.563
We can import those colors
from ./tokens/colors,

188
00:12:57.563 --> 00:13:02.587
and here we can just do map over that

189
00:13:02.587 --> 00:13:08.997
where we've entries called name, value,

190
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:14.032
I'm not sure that totally works.

191
00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:19.895
Yes, name and value,
what's angry about value for?

192
00:13:19.895 --> 00:13:24.952
Colors, ColourItem, it's title, it's name,

193
00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:29.195
title, colors is, what you angry about?

194
00:13:29.195 --> 00:13:30.488
Probably not closing this.

195
00:13:30.488 --> 00:13:35.002
So I imported that JSON file with
the object of colors and this is why in my

196
00:13:35.002 --> 00:13:39.442
code base you saw that I had an object
of colors because I am very lazy and

197
00:13:39.442 --> 00:13:42.017
I don't want to implement this by hand.

198
00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:46.892
So the workflow is we've got those CSS
variables and Figma, you can export that

199
00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:51.495
as either CSS variables or the Tailwind
theme is just a JavaScript object.

200
00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:56.261
So even if you don't use Tailwind you use
that, and that is all our key values.

201
00:13:56.261 --> 00:14:01.034
So now we have our ColorPalette by name,
and if I wanted to I could include

202
00:14:01.034 --> 00:14:06.532
additional things about when to use what
color, I'm just mapping over an object.

203
00:14:06.532 --> 00:14:11.212
It's just a regular object you can
kinda generate a ColorPalette.

204
00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:15.500
I will save this as an exercise to the
reader because we're not using them too

205
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.245
much today.

206
00:14:16.245 --> 00:14:21.018
There is one for our typeset which is
useful for typography, and one for an icon

207
00:14:21.018 --> 00:14:25.813
set which is incredibly useful, cuz then
you can just have a page of the icons.

208
00:14:25.813 --> 00:14:29.644
They're basically just pretty ways to
display these things, if you'd hate this

209
00:14:29.644 --> 00:14:33.820
ColorPalette, then you don't have to use
Storybooks, there's just helpful blocks.

210
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.883
You can write your own ColorPalette,
and you can use that instead, and

211
00:14:36.883 --> 00:14:39.144
you can feel productive for
the day cuz you did that.

212
00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.559
But these are available to
kind of begin to build out and

213
00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:44.764
document that design system and
communicate, which is both helpful for

214
00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:46.727
designers communicating with each other.

215
00:14:46.727 --> 00:14:51.017
And then also for you just to be able on
a second screen stare at all the icons so

216
00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:54.571
you don't necessarily need to
remember what icons are there,

217
00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:56.266
what their names are as well.

218
00:14:56.266 --> 00:14:58.747
And so those are all there,
I've got those in the course website.

219
00:14:58.747 --> 00:15:04.042
Those are document on how to do those,
because it's not the most pertinent

220
00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:09.167
thing for what we're doing right now,
I will kind of leave that as kind of

221
00:15:09.167 --> 00:15:14.908
an extension if you're interested in this
is something that speaks to you as well
