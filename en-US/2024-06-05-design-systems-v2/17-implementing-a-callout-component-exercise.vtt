1
00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:07.397
So your job is to kinda like play around
with this from the first principles.

2
00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:14.905
And so if you look, this is linking
to the Figma which has view access.

3
00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:20.065
What would it be like to kind of either,
if you wanna use the CSS module and

4
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:26.085
the variables, go for it, if you wanna use
CVA and the Tailwind classes, go for it.

5
00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.927
Whatever kinda makes you the happiest,
right?

6
00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:32.433
But can we take this, and
don't worry about the icons, we can

7
00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:37.223
deal with that separately if we choose to,
but the general idea of the variations and

8
00:00:37.223 --> 00:00:40.745
the colors and the support for
dark mode across these things.

9
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:45.850
You can click here and
it'll jump you into the Figma.

10
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.421
And again,
should you attempt to get pixel perfect?

11
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:50.454
Go for it.

12
00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:52.418
Do I really care if you get pixel perfect?

13
00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.305
I don't.

14
00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:55.710
But like kinda gaining a sense.

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.819
But these do use the practices
that we kinda came up together,

16
00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.041
a theme portal,
to see what it would be like for us,

17
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:09.288
but just getting a sense of,
I did a lot of talking.

18
00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:13.633
Let's get our hands dirty,
let's try it out,

19
00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.334
and then we'll do it together as a team.

20
00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:21.384
All right, so
our job is implement these components.

21
00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:24.902
This is all using stuff that we've seen
before, but the idea is, it's one thing

22
00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:27.926
for me to say, it's one thing to get
the blood flowing and try it out.

23
00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:32.470
I did make a cheat sheet here of
the colors, which is why I'm glad I didn't

24
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.181
go rogue and implement that other color
system cuz that would have been bad.

25
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:39.134
But I didn't do that, so here we are.

26
00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:40.784
And mostly, [LAUGH] really,

27
00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:44.496
once you realize the values are all
the same across all of these,

28
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:49.127
it is somewhat straightforward, and
the variants are named after the colors.

29
00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:53.629
It's almost like there's
a unifying theory going on here.

30
00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:57.478
And this is why those
semantic colors are helpful.

31
00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:02.095
And so, we've got some shades for
light mode, we got some shades for

32
00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:06.485
dark mode, and now it's really on
us to begin to implement this.

33
00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:09.763
So, how do I wanna do this?

34
00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.810
Part of me just kinda wanna start.

35
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.191
I'm gonna start with the class variant

36
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:20.975
stuff in this case and
kinda go from there.

37
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:27.660
All right, this is my callout presently.

38
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.577
Not a lot to work with here.

39
00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:32.499
Let's go ahead and

40
00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:38.350
we'll make the call variants .tsx.

41
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.874
I guess it could technically be .ts,
but whatever, I typed tsx, and

42
00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:44.878
so that's what we're doing.

43
00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:47.854
Okay, so we can import cva and

44
00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:53.462
the VariantProps from
class-variance-authority.

45
00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:59.037
And then really it's const.

46
00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:03.607
Did I call it just variants in the other
one, or did I call button_variants?

47
00:03:03.607 --> 00:03:05.203
If only I could check and see.

48
00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:05.703
&gt;&gt; Yeah, variance.
&gt;&gt; All right.

49
00:03:05.703 --> 00:03:06.905
&gt;&gt; Oops, with the s.

50
00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:07.446
&gt;&gt; All right,

51
00:03:07.446 --> 00:03:09.729
my whole thing is that
consistency is important.

52
00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.632
I should follow my own principles, right?

53
00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.430
There's argument for

54
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.351
why you should call it CalloutVariants and
ButtonVariants,

55
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:25.444
which is the auto import that VS Code has.
The more specific you get with

56
00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:30.698
naming things is helpful, but you're never
gonna really do this outside of that file,

57
00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:31.718
so whatever.
But

58
00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:34.905
that thing where you can just start
typing, I think you have to import and

59
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:38.264
hit tab, it's great.
All right, so you can see it takes two

60
00:03:38.264 --> 00:03:42.650
things, the base classes and
then hopefully eventually the config,

61
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.430
which has my variants, default variants.
There's this idea of compound variants

62
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.968
where you can say like,
if it's this variant,

63
00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:51.928
it should be these other three of them.

64
00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:53.909
Seems cool, never used it.

65
00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.295
One day I hope to have a reason to use it,
but presently I don't.

66
00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:02.937
Cool, and so if I go to the design,

67
00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:10.749
Figma.

68
00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:15.244
Roughly, I get to cheat because I
built the thing and I know that these

69
00:04:15.244 --> 00:04:20.685
are probably a border array is about 16,
a border of about 1, so on and so forth.

70
00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.025
I'm not sure how much you
can see in view mode,

71
00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:26.045
which is why I said don't worry
about being pixel perfect.

72
00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:30.900
If you do have Devmod and Figma,
some of that helps a little bit as well.

73
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.879
And you can see what
the various pieces are in here.

74
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.286
But yeah, so I've got a gap of
about 1 RAM, so on and so forth.

75
00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:48.417
Cool, so let's kinda get to some
of those base properties in there.

76
00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:52.154
Again, the pixel property is not the
important part that we're aiming for here.

77
00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:55.102
So we're gonna say that,

78
00:04:55.102 --> 00:05:00.328
generally speaking,
we want a padding of 4.

79
00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:02.908
And then we'll say that it's rounded.

80
00:05:02.908 --> 00:05:03.988
I think of that's LG.

81
00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:09.848
The nice part about, again,
where I get very lazy with Tailwind.

82
00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:14.689
There might be a tweak that I need to do
to actually get this work in the class

83
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.282
variants authority, but
if you use it in a component,

84
00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:22.210
you can usually hover over and
see what the value is as well.

85
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.350
But there's four to get
in match with this.

86
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.455
There's one tweak you need to do in
the project settings in VS Code.

87
00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:32.653
But theoretically,
if it wasn't a class name,

88
00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:35.777
I'll show you real quick
just to make my point.

89
00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:42.444
One, the autocomplete is great, and
then two, see that's only 8 pixels.

90
00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:47.028
I think I need 16,12.

91
00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:53.660
There's no way that is 2xl, whatever.

92
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.522
Again, I don't really use Tailwind that
much because it gives me a bunch of

93
00:05:57.522 --> 00:05:58.503
classes for free,

94
00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:02.568
cuz we do replace all that in our theme,
but that tooling is just nice, right?

95
00:06:02.568 --> 00:06:04.190
And again,
you don't have to use any of this.

96
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.355
I'm just using it because
it's convenient for me.

97
00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:10.281
I think that 16 is a little bit too much,
but

98
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:14.267
no one wants to see me squint at a Figma,
all that much.

99
00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:21.267
Give it a border, I think it's just
a border of 1 if I remember correctly.

100
00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:26.731
And I think it had a little shadow.

101
00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:30.886
Cool, cool, cool.

102
00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:35.676
And then we say that our variants are,

103
00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:42.568
let's start with the primary one and
then let's see.

104
00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:47.058
We'll say,
it's gonna have a few classes to it.

105
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:53.988
And so if I looked at cheat
sheet that I made earlier,

106
00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:59.815
we would say bg-primary, it was 200 for

107
00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:06.288
the background, and
it was use a closing quote.

108
00:07:06.288 --> 00:07:11.674
It was border, primary was 500,

109
00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:17.232
it looks like, and then for the text,

110
00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:25.635
it was text-primary, 900, cool.

111
00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:28.372
Cool, so we got that in place.

112
00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:31.395
What is the red squiggly line so
angry about?

113
00:07:31.395 --> 00:07:31.899
Variants.

114
00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.265
We have to put it under key.

115
00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:36.014
So you could've done appearance.

116
00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:38.977
You could've done kind,
whichever one made you happiest.

117
00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:43.640
I, for some reason, because we use
variant cuz it was used everywhere,

118
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.328
have, chosen to do that.

119
00:07:45.328 --> 00:07:46.861
So we've got one in place.

120
00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:50.245
Let's start there and see if it works
at all and then we'll kinda implement

121
00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:54.166
the rest, because, especially when things,
particularly when I'm teaching, but

122
00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:56.956
in general in life, I hate when I
do a bunch of tedious stuff and

123
00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:59.455
then found out I made a booboo
in the very early phases.

124
00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:01.679
So we will find that booboo out now.

125
00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:05.740
So we're gonna export variants,
as well as our CalloutVariants.

126
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:13.280
Great, we do need to pull this in here.

127
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.884
Sure, we'll keep that one and
we'll say import

128
00:08:18.884 --> 00:08:23.675
{variants, type CalloutVariants}.

129
00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:25.936
And here we're gonna say that,

130
00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:29.886
the only prop I really care
about is children right now.

131
00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:33.837
It's because for buttons and input fields.

132
00:08:33.837 --> 00:08:38.130
Yeah, no one wants to re-implement type,
text, type number, type, all these things.

133
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:44.320
I don't tend to do that for these kind
of one step up components, right?

134
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.810
No, you shouldn't be able
to do everything on a div.

135
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.066
I might make at one point
a type that is like, okay,

136
00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:59.410
test data, test ID for
test selectors and stuff like that.

137
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.620
And those things that we allow and choose
to do, but I won't say like anything a div

138
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.909
can take, this can take because people
will put terrible things in there, right?

139
00:09:07.909 --> 00:09:12.160
Somebody in a pinch will always,
and sometimes it's me, honestly.

140
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.188
The nice part about, it's very humbling
to be the leader of a team and

141
00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:20.856
then occasionally have people on your
team going, Steve, what are you doing?

142
00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:24.665
Right, so yeah, when I say people
on your team, sometimes it's me,

143
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.677
sometimes it's a junior engineer.

144
00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:28.946
Sometimes it's a very
lazy senior engineer.

145
00:09:28.946 --> 00:09:33.140
We all get a little sloppy sometimes.

146
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:39.178
Cool, and so here we'll say that really
we just want the children, right?

147
00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:42.733
Cuz I'm gonna say that
the body is the children,

148
00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:46.730
we'll say type CalloutProps
= PropsWithChildren.

149
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.974
This is a React one that is just
basically wherever the props are in here,

150
00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:54.260
plus children,
because it's not what you think it is.

151
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.945
It's like React node and/or text and/or

152
00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:02.459
something like that one
could see hypothetically.

153
00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.534
And so we'll do that color variants.

154
00:10:04.534 --> 00:10:07.984
And the other thing that I know that I
want is a title which I'm gonna make

155
00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:08.874
mandatory.

156
00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:09.794
That should be a string.

157
00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:17.112
Great, so we got children, we got title,

158
00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:23.098
and we got, variant,

159
00:10:23.098 --> 00:10:28.544
and that's gonna be my CalloutProps.

160
00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:30.439
What you angry about?

161
00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:32.341
Yeah, I haven't used them yet,
don't worry about it.

162
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:39.211
All right, so in here we're gonna
say that the class name is,

163
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.720
.variant, it goes in there.

164
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.346
And IntelliSense knows that right
now we only support primary.

165
00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:54.918
If I look at this class, you can
see that it is abstracted away, but

166
00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:59.587
clearly it knew in this case that
primary is the only one supported.

167
00:10:59.587 --> 00:11:06.250
Honestly, we can probably
get away with like a title.

168
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.070
And I'm gonna wrap the children
in a paragraph tag.

169
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.640
You can argue that they should
be able to pass in the markup.

170
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.786
I don't wanna argue right now.

171
00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:21.437
Yeah, again,
the the long tail of all the weird

172
00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:26.331
edge cases that you need
to support is a lot of fun.

173
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:31.057
Cool, so that should basically
be my base classes plus

174
00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:35.385
as long as I pass in primary,
the initial colors.

175
00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:36.587
I am not concerned.

176
00:11:36.587 --> 00:11:38.329
I'm not totally convinced
I did this right yet.

177
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.053
So I want to create a story.

178
00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:42.608
This kinda shows you my development flow.

179
00:11:42.608 --> 00:11:44.092
I might try to simulate,

180
00:11:44.092 --> 00:11:48.207
can I get the both windows side by
side on my little 14 inch MacBook?

181
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:51.890
Normally there are two monitors involved
and each of them are 27 inches.

182
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.240
I got a vertical one, highly
recommended for working on a website.
