WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.153 --> 00:00:04.256
And so now we can go ahead and

2
00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:09.433
say callout.stories.tsx, and

3
00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:14.251
then we'll aim for type Meta and

4
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:20.497
story from react from the callout file and

5
00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:24.796
then we'll say const Meta.

6
00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:30.071
I'll say title is try
not to cheat too much.

7
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:34.742
Callout and we'll say the component
is that call out component.

8
00:00:34.742 --> 00:00:37.032
That's enough to get us started.

9
00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:43.195
We'll say that that satisfies that type,

10
00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:50.050
cool and
then we'll export default that Meta.

11
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.049
And then we will say the export
type story is a story

12
00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.630
object from that type of a callout.

13
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.862
And that's basically adding intellisense
to that component store format, right?

14
00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.142
And so now, yeah, so we can say,

15
00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:10.358
what's interesting is you notice if I
didn't make the variant a default and

16
00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:16.245
so I'm pretty sure, it's not yelling at
me too much, but we've got title primary.

17
00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:18.340
Let's go put that back in.

18
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.359
So if I go back to my,
look, there's a callout.

19
00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:30.356
And because it's component slash callout,
it's in that heading,

20
00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.900
you can argue that button
input is a lower level.

21
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.786
You could choose to call it like
molecules versus whatever, right?

22
00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:39.338
Your base components on up.

23
00:01:39.338 --> 00:01:42.465
If you look at like when we looked at
fluid and some of these other ones,

24
00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:45.393
you can see that there were like
different ways to organize that.

25
00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:52.693
That's a very personal or
team decision to make, cool.

26
00:01:52.693 --> 00:01:56.926
So, there's some little things
that we can do in here.

27
00:01:56.926 --> 00:02:03.331
So for instance, I'm thinking, ClassName

28
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:10.377
is font-semibold, And I don't know.

29
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.501
That seems good, those corners too roundy?

30
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.343
I think those corners are too roundy.

31
00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:21.238
I'm both the designer and
the implementers.

32
00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:25.209
I get to decide if I don't like them.

33
00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:29.526
Cool.

34
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:32.970
So we've got the primary in there,
you could argue that should be a Flexbox.

35
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.873
Then tailwind also has this class called
space y and space x which is just

36
00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:42.462
everything thing but the last one
a margin bottom or margin right.

37
00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:49.963
So if you don't wanna go the full
Flexbox route this will work.

38
00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:53.383
Let's go with it's eight,
that should be about 32 pixels,

39
00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:55.586
that might be a bit much we'll say four.

40
00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:59.965
It's only I could look at my
own design and figure this out.

41
00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:01.478
Let's go take a look at that.

42
00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:06.328
Okay, like we're ready for
the children in this

43
00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:10.715
case which we could put
in the story as well.

44
00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:16.314
I'm gonna make that one of the defaults
cuz I don't wanna put that in every story.

45
00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:20.734
Children can we get some free lormet.

46
00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.728
Yes.

47
00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:25.646
Cool.

48
00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:29.980
And then I'm gonna show you
what makes me a 10x developer.

49
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.607
Are you ready?

50
00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:50.334
Multicursor, that's the only thing
makes me 10x developer Danger.

51
00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.342
Why did I choose all these variants?

52
00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:57.835
I was trying to make
some kinda point warning.

53
00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.072
And then what was success and
I got success information.

54
00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.427
No, it didn't.

55
00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:03.137
How many did I have?

56
00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:07.019
There's only five cool.

57
00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.571
&gt;&gt; Default.
&gt;&gt; I had a default one for bass one.

58
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:11.547
I was like, what am I doing with my life?

59
00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:15.299
And I removed it from the design cuz
if five is too much six was not no one

60
00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.433
learned an extra thing by making
a six to one in this case.

61
00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:22.536
All right, so we've got that in place and

62
00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:28.399
now it really becomes a game
of making the various stories,

63
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:35.807
I'm gonna hope that a certain amount
of VS Code magic is gonna help me here.

64
00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:39.834
Got a little carried away there.

65
00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:40.371
Danger.

66
00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.872
GitHub Copilot not great for
writing code for you really great for

67
00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:51.273
looking at the code you just wrote and
figuring out what you're gonna do next.

68
00:04:51.273 --> 00:04:53.507
So I don't trust the code
of the generates.

69
00:04:53.507 --> 00:04:58.025
I do trust that if you've watched me type
things I'm doing something repetitive is

70
00:04:58.025 --> 00:05:00.421
mostly figured out what I'm gonna do next.

71
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:00.973
Cool.

72
00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:02.205
So there we have them.

73
00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:06.958
What we didn't add is any kinda
support for dark mode, right?

74
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.565
And so
that becomes a very easy game as well,

75
00:05:10.565 --> 00:05:16.427
one could watch me get real crazy with
multicursors in order to do this.

76
00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:25.284
So we got the dark bg.

77
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:26.197
What was it supposed to be?

78
00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:32.421
It was supposed to be 800
on the background dark

79
00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:38.455
Border or border was what?

80
00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:39.688
900.

81
00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:40.512
900?

82
00:05:40.512 --> 00:05:42.212
That seems a bit much.

83
00:05:42.212 --> 00:05:43.826
Who's the designer on this thing?

84
00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:44.371
It's me.

85
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.302
900.

86
00:05:50.302 --> 00:05:56.832
I think that my next workshop should
be secrets of multicursor editing.

87
00:05:56.832 --> 00:06:03.748
And then we've got text is probably 50,
cool.

88
00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:09.221
What did I hear, too much talking
there not enough paying attention.

89
00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:10.648
Whereas I make a boo boo.

90
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:17.049
Extra.

91
00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:21.007
Cool and so we've got all those in place.

92
00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:26.962
And so now if I go to my storybook,
I can light theme, I can dark theme.

93
00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:29.818
I've got kinda these initial
ones kinda in place.

94
00:06:29.818 --> 00:06:33.368
I didn't do the thing where I
have two panes open but again,

95
00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:38.054
seeing them change as you go to implement
them is pretty great as well cuz that,

96
00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:41.540
yeah, hot model,
especially staring at one component.

97
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.518
Do you need a larger page is like
especially like with all the accoutrements

98
00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:47.650
of like, there's actually fetch
the current user and all those things.

99
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.860
It's like a really great workflow and
experience here as well.

100
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.394
Awesome.

101
00:06:54.394 --> 00:06:57.295
So we've got that.

102
00:06:57.295 --> 00:07:00.855
This variant being a string,
don't care for that.

103
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:07.548
So let's go fix that real
quick in our stories and

104
00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:12.936
let's say that we have an archetype and

105
00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:19.955
that variant is a select can
make it a radio button if

106
00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:27.000
you want it Control is select and
then options.

107
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.752
Yeah.

108
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.073
Cool.

109
00:07:35.073 --> 00:07:38.019
So, that's kinda like the initial
kinda pulling it all together.

110
00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:41.311
It seems like a lot of build up, but
you start to get into the rhythm of this.
