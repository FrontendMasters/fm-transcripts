00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
&gt;&gt; Brian: When I was very,
very first learning React,

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.123
actually the very first time I saw React,
I thought it was gross.

3
00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:08.695
I thought it was gross because why would
I wanna put HTML inside my JavaScript?

4
00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:11.643
Why would I wanna have this
extra transpiled language?

5
00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:15.273
There was a bunch of really weird
feelings that I got about it, and

6
00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:19.634
I just pushed all the feelings down,
which was what my therapist told me to do.

7
00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:23.219
That's not, I'm kidding, don't do that.

8
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.741
But I'm going to explain to you why
I think those things are okay, but

9
00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:29.802
we're going to start with no
transpolation step, no JSX.

10
00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:32.433
No babble, no web pack, no parcel.

11
00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:33.095
Nothing like that.

12
00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:37.351
We're going to be writing raw JavaScript
React just to show you that it's possible.

13
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:42.230
And I wish someone would have taught it to
me like this because you'll see that JSX

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.115
and React are not doing
any sort of black magic.

15
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:48.924
It's just regular old
JavaScript function calls, and

16
00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:52.975
it's my opinion that you want
to understand your tooling,

17
00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:57.690
cuz if you don't understand your tools and
you resent them, right?

18
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.651
Because they just seem to add complexity.

19
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.881
But if you understand the problem
that the tools are solving,

20
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.749
then you embrace the complexity because
it gives you ease of use, right?

21
00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:11.903
So that was kinda my problem with JSX is
I resented it cuz I didn't understand it.

22
00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:15.692
So hopefully here I can teach you what it
does and then you can understand why it

23
00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.973
exists, because it's really
annoying to write React like this.

24
00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:21.033
But you can.

25
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:26.404
Okay, so what I want you to do,
I'm just gonna go to my desktop,

26
00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:29.193
and I'm gonna make a directory.

27
00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:34.334
Actually, even just do it this way,
I'll just say,

28
00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:41.673
New folder right there, and this is
going to be called the adopt me project.

29
00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:42.620
Choose a different name.

30
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.497
Well, I'm just gonna delete that one then.

31
00:01:47.944 --> 00:01:49.440
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right, move to Trash.

32
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.622
All right.

33
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:52.643
This one is going to be called adopt-me,

34
00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:55.197
cuz that's going to be
what we're building today.

35
00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:58.731
A pet adoption application.

36
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:03.164
Okay, and then I'm going to open
this with Visual Studio Code.

37
00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:10.486
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right.

38
00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:18.360
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now I'm inside of
this adopt-me folder with nothing in it.

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.584
I'm gonna create a new
directory inside of here.

40
00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:26.317
So it's gonna be, SRC is the name of
the directory that I just created.

41
00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:29.263
There's no reason you have to
structure a React project this way.

42
00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:31.999
This is just a way that I'm
habituated to writing code.

43
00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.715
So okay, inside of here I'm
gonna create a new file, and

44
00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.776
it's gonna be called index.html.

45
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.471
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now the first trick
here that I'm gonna show you

46
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.905
with Visual Studio Code is
a little thing called Emmet.

47
00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:54.157
So if I put html:5, and you can see that I
have this auto completion coming out, and

48
00:02:54.157 --> 00:03:00.167
if I hit Tab, it's going to autocomplete
out to like a scaffold of the HTML file.

49
00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:04.087
Because I can't remember everything that
needs to go into an HTML file, right?

50
00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:08.805
I literally have to Google this
every single time that I do it,

51
00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:10.906
so that's what that does.

52
00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:14.434
And I'll be using Emmet a little bit more
as we go on, and I'll call it out so

53
00:03:14.434 --> 00:03:17.860
you can see it, but you can see that
the entire cheat sheet @emmet.io.

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.740
It's not something that VS code invented,
so you can put Emmet into Sublime and

55
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.506
JetBrains and stuff like that,
but it is built-in off the bat.

56
00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:30.756
Okay, and I'm gonna,
this is gonna be called ADOPTme, so

57
00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:32.287
that's what I'm gonna call the title.

58
00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:39.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so here inside the body,
I'm gonna put a couple of tags.

59
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.833
The first one is I'm gonna
put one called root.

60
00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.916
So you can there I just wrote
the css selector for root,

61
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.868
which I wanted to be a div, right?

62
00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:53.035
So I do #root, and then I hit Tab, and
it's gonna complete that out to a div.

63
00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:55.674
Now just so you know Emmet is
way more complicated that,

64
00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:57.311
you can do crazy stuff with Emmet.

65
00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:02.329
I just use like the lazy abbreviations,
that's mostly it.

66
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.097
Okay, so I have div as an idea of route,
I'm gonna put not rendered inside of that.

67
00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:12.830
Reason why I do that is because if I
see not rendered I know that the React

68
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.424
application didn't start.

69
00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.585
But if it did start, then it's going to
replace everything inside of this div.

70
00:04:21.953 --> 00:04:26.249
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, underneath this,
I'm gonna put two script tags, so

71
00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.211
I'm gonna put script:src, like that.

72
00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.020
&gt;&gt; Brian: It autocomplete
out to a script tag.

73
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.957
And we're gonna put two URLs here.

74
00:04:37.957 --> 00:04:45.707
So one of them is gonna
be https://unpkg.com.

75
00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:51.929
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is a CDN for NPM packages,
which is just a fancy way of saying

76
00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:56.042
that there's a bunch of JavaScript
files that I'll unpackage and

77
00:04:56.042 --> 00:04:58.697
it'll pull these off of the mpm registry.

78
00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:03.796
So I'm gonna pull off of the registry,
React, and

79
00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:09.369
I'm gonna grab a specific version,
so 16.8.4,

80
00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:15.074
I think 6 is the latest version
as of the filming of this.

81
00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:18.525
But we're gonna stick with 4 because
all my notes are using 4, so

82
00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:20.076
let's just stick with that.

83
00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:25.559
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and React to

84
00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:33.000
16.8.4/umd/react.development.js.

85
00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:39.984
&gt;&gt; Brian: So what this is gonna do,
this is gonna go out to the CDN,

86
00:05:39.984 --> 00:05:44.192
grab this file which is
a compiled React file, and

87
00:05:44.192 --> 00:05:50.621
it's going to load this as a top level
React variable, so you can use React.

88
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.729
Okay, we're gonna need
another one of this.

89
00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.340
So I'm going to copy this and
paste it underneath it again, and

90
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.778
then I need to change two things.

91
00:05:59.778 --> 00:06:03.067
One of them here the React
when put this react-dom,

92
00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:07.927
like that,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then I'm also where it says

93
00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:13.021
react.development.js, I'm gonna put
react-dom.development.js, right?

94
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:14.855
So I changed this in two places.

95
00:06:21.553 --> 00:06:22.110
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?
And

96
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.305
this is going to load a second library,
which is going to be the react-dom

97
00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.048
library, which allows you to render and
react to the browser.

98
00:06:28.048 --> 00:06:29.586
Now why is there two packages?

99
00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:31.995
That seems a little confusing, right?

100
00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:35.483
Well, some of you may be familiar
with the project called React Native.

101
00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:38.660
So React Native and
ReactDOM both share the React package.

102
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.581
This React is just like,

103
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:45.894
it's a very small 2 kilobyte package
of how to interact with React.

104
00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:49.314
So it has all of the top level
methods that you're going to call, and

105
00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:53.334
then ReactDOM is actually the large one
that takes all that stuff out of the React

106
00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:55.321
package and renders it to the browser.

107
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:57.633
By the same token you would load React,
and

108
00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:01.433
then React Native would actually load
it into your Android or iOS app.

109
00:07:01.433 --> 00:07:02.491
Does it make sense?

110
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:03.364
Okay.

111
00:07:03.364 --> 00:07:05.385
So that's why there's two
different packages there.

112
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.189
&gt;&gt; Brian: Underneath that we're
gonna put a third script tag, and

113
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.902
we're gonna do what you should never do,

114
00:07:13.902 --> 00:07:18.105
which is we're going to write
JavaScript directly in our HTML.

115
00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:22.720
Now the reason why I showed you how to do
this is because I wanted to show you that

116
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.138
this can be super bare-bones, right?

117
00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:29.471
We're gonna fix this in a little bit but
for now I just want you to write this,

118
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:31.187
your code is going to go here.

119
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.472
&gt;&gt; Brian: For now.

120
00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:38.203
Oops, stop that.

121
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:44.333
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now that I've done this,
save this file, right?

122
00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:51.216
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I want you to go
over to your favorite browser,

123
00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:53.665
mine happens to be Firefox.

124
00:07:53.665 --> 00:07:58.754
And I'm gonna go here and
say File &gt; Open &gt; Open File, right there.

125
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:05.202
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's see this
in a new directory here.

126
00:08:05.202 --> 00:08:06.593
File &gt; Open File, and

127
00:08:06.593 --> 00:08:10.561
then I'm gonna navigate to my
directory which is on my desktop.

128
00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:16.986
I'm going to find ADOPTme,
source, and index.html.

129
00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:18.606
And I opened this in my browser.

130
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.654
&gt;&gt; Brian: And you should see something
that says not rendered, right?

131
00:08:24.654 --> 00:08:26.054
Because we haven't actually
done anything yet.

132
00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:27.764
We've just loaded the libraries.

133
00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:35.555
&gt;&gt; Brian: But
I'm gonna open my console here.

134
00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:36.379
This a bit bigger.

135
00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:38.530
You don't have to do this,
I'm just showing you.

136
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.670
If I go in here in my console,
and I say React,

137
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.333
now this is defined because
we loaded that, right?

138
00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:46.624
With one of the script tags.

139
00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:49.352
Same thing here with ReactDOM,

140
00:08:49.352 --> 00:08:53.704
also defined because we
loaded this off of the CDN.

141
00:08:53.704 --> 00:08:57.821
Makes sense of how all that's
is plumbed together, cool.

142
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.863
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right.

143
00:09:04.863 --> 00:09:09.117
The next thing I want you to do
is we're gonna go grab the CSS.

144
00:09:09.117 --> 00:09:13.763
This is definitely not a course about CSS,
so we prewrote all the CSS for

145
00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:16.328
you, so that you don't have to write.

146
00:09:16.328 --> 00:09:19.513
So if you just follow our conventions and
naming patterns,

147
00:09:19.513 --> 00:09:21.881
you're gonna get all the styling for free.

148
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:24.762
And I'm not telling any of
you to look at the CSS or

149
00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:27.517
think it's the way that
you should write CSS.

150
00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:33.876
There's no commentary
intended from the CSS.

151
00:09:33.876 --> 00:09:39.027
So if you go here into the class notes,
you're gonna see here

152
00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:44.482
about a third of the way down,
you'll need to grab the CSS file.

153
00:09:44.482 --> 00:09:47.214
We wrote it so
you don't have to download it here.

154
00:09:47.214 --> 00:09:50.762
And actually, Tanner wrote it so
thank you, Tanner.

155
00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:54.722
So if you click Download it here,
it should take you to this file,

156
00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:57.540
you can see here it's
actually on the GitHub.

157
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:06.604
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I'm just gonna hit command
A, select everything, and copy it.

158
00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:12.118
And then I'm going to go back
over to my project here,

159
00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:16.532
create a new file in the source directory,

160
00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:22.674
called style.css, and
paste all that business in there.

161
00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:24.848
And Save it.

162
00:10:24.848 --> 00:10:29.194
Okay, here inside of the head
tag I'm gonna put link,

163
00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:34.881
which is going to complete out to this,
and I'm gonna put /style.css

164
00:10:41.717 --> 00:10:43.528
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

165
00:10:43.528 --> 00:10:47.570
So now, we should be able
to go back to our ADOPTme,

166
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.336
refresh the page, and
now it looks a lot nicer.

167
00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:55.198
It's got little chickens and beetles
in the background, it's very pleasant.
