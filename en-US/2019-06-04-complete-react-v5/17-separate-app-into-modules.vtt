00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we have a bundler,
we can do whatever we want, right?

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.980
Now we have more leeway to do things.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.770
So the first thing I want to do
here is I want to split pet and

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.700
app into two different files, right?

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.790
I can't think of a reason why you would
not have one component, one file.

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.860
It's always that way.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.020
You don't ever have two
components in a file.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.550
I've not really seen a good
reason to do that before.

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.520
So one component, one file.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.300
So I'm gonna show you a pretty cool
trick that VS Code can do for you.

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.540
So I'm gonna highlight this and
then I get this little light bulb here.

12
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.450
This light bulb is called a code action.

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.330
So I'm gonna click that and
there's a couple things here.

14
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.840
The one that I want is move,

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.030
you might not see all of these because
I have other extensions installed.

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.520
But the one that you wanna
do is move to a new file,

17
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.660
which all of you should see, right?

18
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.940
So click move to a new file.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.660
And all the sudden I
have a new Pet.js file

20
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.610
which has an export in it, and
app is importing from that file.

21
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.620
It's pretty cool, right,
you like this, cool?

22
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.150
Okay, cool.

23
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.060
So what's really cool about it is,

24
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640
it's actually TypeScript
that does that for you.

25
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.576
It's not VS Code.

26
00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:22.520
TypeScript is actually
running on your code,

27
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.680
even though we're not writing
any TypeScript right now.

28
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.777
VS Code is constantly running
TypeScript against your code,

29
00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:29.572
to understand how your code works.

30
00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:32.990
And so
that's what's actually able to do that.

31
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.850
Now, I prefer default exports, so

32
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.190
I'm gonna change this to get rid of
those curly braces, and save that.

33
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.390
And then here, instead of saying,

34
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.150
export const Pet = blah, I'm gonna say

35
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.050
export default function blah like that.

36
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.143
And let's give this a name like so.

37
00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.339
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now why do I do that?

38
00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.358
It's just kind of a pattern that
I had that the default export for

39
00:02:12.358 --> 00:02:14.752
components is always the component.

40
00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:17.156
I would say it's a decently
common pattern, but

41
00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.217
I'll leave you to judge it for yourself.

42
00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:24.083
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As far as changing it to
a named component, this is useful for

43
00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.780
when you're debugging things.

44
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.170
Because if there's a stack trace,

45
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.690
you'll see pet has the error, which makes
that a little bit easier to debug later.

46
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840
So now,
we have two different files, right?

47
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.030
We're importing pet from pet.

48
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.810
This should still work the way it should.

49
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.440
It does.

50
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.070
But now they're a little bit better
organized now that we have an app

51
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.730
component and

52
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.050
a pet component, and they're in separate
files and we can maintain them separately.

53
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.997
There's another commit point here, that if
you've fallen behind, you can go ahead and

54
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:55.639
come up to I think this commit.

55
00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.533
Let's just take a look and
see what it's called.

56
00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.744
It's right there.

57
00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:14.273
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this one is the add
Parcel, build process and extract out Pet

58
00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:18.890
components so this is the one that
you'd want to move up to right now.

59
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.210
Okay and so we used Parcel.

60
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.070
I told you could use Webpack this
would 100% work with Webpack as well.

61
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.330
You could also use Browserify, which is
another great project for bundling code.

62
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.950
It still works really well despite
what other people might say.

63
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.260
It's a bit older, but
it still works great.

64
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.090
Or you could use Rollup as well.

65
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.920
Roll up is a bit more unwieldy
sometimes a little bit harder to use,

66
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.080
but works well, as well.

67
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.730
At this point,
now we've introduced a package.json so

68
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.420
if you're moving forward and
commit points in the course, make sure you

69
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.830
move forward in the commit, and then
you run npm install afterwards, right?

70
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.620
So if I come to my terminal here,
not this one, this one.

71
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.041
And I say,
if I moved forward in the commit,

72
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.493
I would have to say,
npm install, just like that.

73
00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:20.757
And it's gonna go run and install
everything off of the npm registry.

74
00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:23.731
You don't have to do this if you've been
following along, but just so you know,

75
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.710
make sure that you're always keeping
up with the npm installs as well.

76
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.560
Otherwise, things won't work.
