00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna go
through some other tools right now.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.346
The first one that we're going to
install here is going to help us

3
00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:06.770
keep high code quality.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.045
One of them is going to be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Prettier, okay?

5
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:17.284
So the first thing I'm gonna say down
here is I'm gonna say MPM install -D,

6
00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:20.740
which is gonna mean it's
a developer dependencies, right?

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.860
So when I'm deploying
my code to production

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.280
I don't need to have Prettier go with it.

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.730
This is just for
me on my local environment, and

10
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm gonna put prettier like that.

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.964
Now you can say npm install like this,
again, I'm a lazy person, so

12
00:00:36.964 --> 00:00:41.050
I like to type less, so
I'm gonna put npm i -D, like that.

13
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.032
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now if you look back at my package.json

14
00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:55.025
you'll see here that I
have devDependencies and

15
00:00:55.025 --> 00:01:00.016
it has now pegged prettier 1.17
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yours might

16
00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:01.876
be different if you're
doing this in the future,

17
00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:05.440
but it's a relatively stable project so
you can go ahead and do that.

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.050
So now I have Prettier installed, and

19
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.090
Prettier is going to do things where I can
format my project consistently, right?

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.740
I'm sure many of you have worked on
projects where some files have tabs,

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.960
some of them have spaces,
some of them have trailing comments,

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.490
some of them don't, so on and so forth.

23
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.670
So Prettier is a project that kind of just
takes all the conversation out of that and

24
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.180
just standardizes on a format.

25
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.900
Now, I recognize, for some people,
they don't wanna let go of their format,

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.570
because it's the best one, and
they thought of it first, and

27
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.120
we should all use their format because
they're much smarter than us, right?

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.246
We all know that person,
and none of us like them.

29
00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:41.480
So what Prettier does is it takes away
the whole conversation, it's like,

30
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.450
no, everyone's gonna use the exact same
formatting, and we're all stuck with it.

31
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.884
And it's all slightly different
than we would have chosen it, but

32
00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:50.492
we're all on the same format.

33
00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:53.429
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's actually
one of my favorite tools,

34
00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.081
because I actually really don't care what
my code looks like as long as it's well

35
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.070
formatted, right?

36
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.400
As long as it has a format
that's consistent, I don't care.

37
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.950
And the great thing about Prettier
is it just does it for you.

38
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.040
So you've probably noticed that I've just
been messing around with all this code and

39
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.720
doing stuff like this,
where it's like super gross, and

40
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.110
everything's on the wrong line,
and stuff like that, right?

41
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.660
Reading this kind of code makes
you a little sick, doesn't it?

42
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.590
But with Prettier, if I just do this,
it just fixes everything for me, and

43
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.660
I'd never have to think about this, right?

44
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.671
I've now introduced it at every
company that I've worked at, and

45
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.429
I will continue doing it to every
company that I will work at.
