00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, that we've
done all of this, let's go make this,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.410
let's do the render now, right?

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.650
So what I'm gonna do,
the first thing we're gonna

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.587
say is if (this.state.loading)
then return an &lt;h1&gt; of loading.

5
00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:26.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, we could make this all
pretty and have like a nice spinner and

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.060
everything like that, right?

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.200
But I'll leave that to your imagination,
right?

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.466
For now, we're just gonna show
a loading indicator, right?

9
00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:37.967
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If that's not true,

10
00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.312
then what we're gonna do,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is I'm gonna do

11
00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.884
some destructuring in here,
because this is how I prefer to do it.

12
00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:50.248
But this is just my preference here,
I'm gonna say const {animal,

13
00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:55.859
breed, location, description,
name} = this.state.

14
00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:04.703
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, now, that I've
pulled all of those out of this.state,

15
00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:08.700
I'm gonna say return inside of a &lt;div&gt;,
and

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.840
&lt;h1&gt; with the {name,
I have to have two divs here.

17
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.091
Two divs,
&lt;div className="details"&gt; that to the end.

18
00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:36.509
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Up right there,
I got that curly brace, okay.

19
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.520
So, yeah,
make sure you have two divs here.

20
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
I think I had to do that for styling
purposes, so none of you have ever done

21
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.340
that before, just put a random div,
just so you could style it better?

22
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.545
Okay, good, it's just me.

23
00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:50.277
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, instead of that,

24
00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:54.542
put an h2, and
then I'm gonna put these curly braces, and

25
00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:58.061
I'm gonna do same sort of ritual here,
animal.

26
00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:07.239
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [breed]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [location].

27
00:02:11.717 --> 00:02:12.477
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

28
00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:22.743
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Under that we're gonna
put a button that says Adopt [name].

29
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna &lt;p&gt;,
and then inside of that,

30
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.660
we'll put the description.

31
00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:39.857
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again, no hooks in here,
you have to use this.state and set state.

32
00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:43.814
Instead of using update state or
set state or set location,

33
00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:45.880
like we do with hooks, right?

34
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.590
We have one function that
corresponds to one piece of state,

35
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.380
you just use this .setState everywhere.

36
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.340
So you'll get very familiar
with this type of set state.

37
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.170
Now, I'm trying really hard to refrain
from calling this the old way of doing

38
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.440
things, because I think this
is going to be around forever.

39
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.900
I think that hooks and
classes are around to stay.

40
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.490
We have no indication that
classes are gonna get deprecated.

41
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.263
I'm of the personal opinion, this actually
a really great API and this is still

42
00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:21.997
a valid way to write react and definitely
a tool that should be in your toolbox.

43
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
I will say that it is definitely easier

44
00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.260
to start with hooks, right?

45
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.720
It's just functions and use state,
so let's go see if this works now.

46
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.297
This won't work,
because details one is not a real place,

47
00:03:44.297 --> 00:03:47.930
so let's go click on Fat Boy Slim here.

48
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.449
There you go, Fat Boy Slim is
a rottweiler in Stanwood, Washington.

49
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.818
And his sweet nature and
and has playful ways.

50
00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:02.918
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we'll make
a button here in just a second that you

51
00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:04.564
actually be able to go
to the adoption page,

52
00:04:04.564 --> 00:04:06.130
if you do want to adopt
the animal as well.
