00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
far we've been talking about JustReact,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.340
and you'll never see anyone
using JustReact, right?

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.410
Like we've been doing so far,
that's just not a very common pattern for

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.190
writing React,
there's always tools involve, right?

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.255
And that again, my methodology, and I come
from front end infrastructure as well.

6
00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.719
So I'm going to subject to my madness,
is that you need to

7
00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:23.740
understand your tools in addition to
just understanding the framework.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.770
So, I'm gonna keep as light as possible,
but I'm going to still help you

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.440
understand some of the better ways
to write React in my opinion.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.407
So, here we're gonna introduce you
to like, three or four tools, and

11
00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:38.150
then we'll get back to writing React.

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.750
So the first one I wanna introduce you to,
you may already be familiar with is NPM.

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.375
Which does not stand for node package
manager, but sort of stands for

14
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.633
node package manager.

15
00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:55.536
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is going to allow us
to, rather than just loading node off of

16
00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:59.960
the CDN, we're gonna actually install it
off of the registry and build our project.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.850
So that it's actually included
with the package, and

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.290
we don't have to rely on
unpackage to be up, right?

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.470
Unpackage is really good for
just like testing things out.

20
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.212
But do not rely on it for
production traffic,

21
00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:12.677
cuz then you're at their mercy, okay?

22
00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, what I want you to do,
is I want you to open your terminal.

23
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.840
This is built-in the VS code,
if you are using that.

24
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.614
You can open up with command, or sorry,
control, back tick, slash tilde,

25
00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:30.305
the one that's next to
the one on your keyboard.

26
00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:36.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's plenty of
buttons somewhere for as well but

27
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.848
that's how I was open itself, okay?

28
00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:38.860
And then the first thing,

29
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.400
you're gonna have to make sure
that you have node installed.

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.380
So I do, I have 10, 15, as long as
you're over like, let's say eight,

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.370
cuz six just got deprecated.

32
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.300
Or end of life, rather,
is the correct term.

33
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.638
So as long as you're above eight,
you should be fine.

34
00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:57.920
I'm on 10.15, which should be
pretty close to the LTS right now.

35
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.170
Which is the one that you wanna use.

36
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.400
You should use the LTS which stands for
long-term support, I think.

37
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.609
Or I'm making that up and
you can believe me.

38
00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.457
Okay, so with node comes mpm,

39
00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:15.290
if you don't have these
tools installed right now.

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.947
Just go to nodejs.org, and you can just
install it right after there as well.

41
00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:29.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
notice that I'm in Desktop/adopt-me, so

42
00:02:29.318 --> 00:02:31.144
I'm inside of my project directory.

43
00:02:31.144 --> 00:02:35.362
And the first thing that I wanna
do is I'm gonna say npm init,

44
00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:38.520
which is going to create a new project for
me.

45
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240
Now, I'm super lazy and
I don't wanna answer any of the questions.

46
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.330
So pro tip, if you put -y,
it won't ask you any questions and

47
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.550
it just generates a file for you.

48
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.250
Otherwise you get this interactive prompt.

49
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.360
Like what's the name of your project?

50
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.260
Who are you, blah blah blah,
and I just can't be bothered.

51
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.086
So, now if you look at my project, you
can see here that I have a package.json.

52
00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:06.610
Now, this is common with
JavaScript projects.

53
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.670
Again, this may not be the first
time you've been exposed to this.

54
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.840
Inside of here, close this.

55
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.480
It's just a JSON file full
of what the license is,

56
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.460
what the name of the project is,
what version it is, so on and so forth.

57
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.100
We don't actually really
care what's going on here.

58
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.210
You can mess with it if you want to.

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.776
I'm not going to.

60
00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:29.010
But there's a couple of things that
we're gonna be concerned with here.

61
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.940
First one,
we're gonna have dependencies and

62
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.890
those dependencies are gonna
be track in here, right?

63
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.490
So then,

64
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.190
whenever I say npm install, it's going
to grab the same dependencies, right?

65
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.430
So if me and Start working on a project
together, I can show this with her.

66
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.820
And we could work together
on that project, right?

67
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.782
Something like that.
