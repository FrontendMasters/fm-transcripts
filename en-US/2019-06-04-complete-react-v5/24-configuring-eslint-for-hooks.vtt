00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Open your console for
just a second.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm gonna stop my server, but you could
just open a new terminal as well.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.112
I'm gonna say npm install -D

4
00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:16.236
eslint-plugin-react-hooks.

5
00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:22.743
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is official rules
from the React team about writing hooks.

6
00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.153
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I want to
introduce you to a couple of these.

7
00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:35.382
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
open your ESLint config really quick, and

8
00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:41.713
here inside of the rules,
we're going to add a couple of them,

9
00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:48.183
react-hooks/rules-of-hooks, and
we want that 2 error.

10
00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:54.397
So 2 will make it error on that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:57.479
we also I need to add
it to plugins as well.

12
00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.546
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: react-hooks, like that.

13
00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:13.262
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
I am missing one of them here in my notes,

14
00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:15.275
let's just go find it.

15
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:22.267
ESLint React,
plug-in React hooks, this one.

16
00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:30.799
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I have another one
here that we should have in there.

17
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.888
These ones, exhaustive depths.

18
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:37.377
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So put in that one as well.

19
00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.399
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll do 1.

20
00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:48.018
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this one is going to force you to,

21
00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:52.850
we'll actually about later, but
it has to do with the facts.

22
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.586
So again, just to remind you,
0 is turn off, 1 is worn, and

23
00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.320
2 is make it an error, right?

24
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.625
So anytime that you mess up
rule of hooks through an error,

25
00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:07.546
anytime that you have an exhaustive
depths thing, it's just worn.

26
00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:12.375
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's take a look
at what that actually does for us.

27
00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:17.013
If I say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: if {false}, or

28
00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:21.899
something like that, I don't know,
and then I put this in there,

29
00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:26.721
it's gonna say, hey look, or
this one right here, where is it?

30
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:33.518
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

31
00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.172
React hook is called conditionally.

32
00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:39.740
React hooks must be called in the exact
same order in component renders.

33
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.416
And you can see that
comes from rule of hooks.

34
00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:47.228
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rules of hooks,
that makes sense?

35
00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.764
So it's gonna prevent you
from doing stuff like that.

36
00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.476
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now honestly,
once you get used to doing that, and

37
00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:57.780
you just know never to do it,
it's not really that helpful.

38
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.523
But as you may imagine, if you ship this
to your coworker that doesn't know about

39
00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:05.231
that, this will prevent them from doing
things that you don't want them to do.
