00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.660
&gt;&gt; Brian: Getting closer.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.300
We have one problem here,
that setBreed's not defined.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.420
So what we're gonna do is,
if you remember, we did pass that here and

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.060
use drop down at the end,
the setState function, right?

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.540
So we're just gonna grab that too.

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.562
So setBreed, and
now that'll be defined, right,

7
00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.750
cuz that's coming from the use drop down.

8
00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:30.065
&gt;&gt; Brian: Not using breed yet,
that's okay, but

9
00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:34.349
the thing that we're getting here is hey,
just so you know,

10
00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:39.070
it contains a call to to setBreeds
without a list of dependencies.

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.330
This can lead to an infinite
chain of updates.

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.736
So the problem here is with useEffect,
you have to declare your dependencies,

13
00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:49.831
which is kind of an odd phrasing this,
but stick with me for just a second.

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.597
&gt;&gt; Brian: useEffect is going to run,
as of right now,

15
00:00:57.597 --> 00:01:02.270
after every single time that render gets
called, which is too frequently, right?

16
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.020
So right now,

17
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.920
every time I typed into location here,
it would request a new set of breeds.

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.620
That's obviously incorrect,
it's not what we wanna do, right?

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.858
We only wanna request breeds when animal
updates, as well as on the first time.

20
00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.952
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
what you can do here with useEffect,

21
00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.221
&gt;&gt; Brian: Rather than have this

22
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:31.580
run after every single render, we can
say only run when these things change.

23
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.200
So what you do is you declare
the things that it depends on.

24
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.840
So here it depends on what?

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.460
It depends on animal, right?

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.120
Cuz if that changes then
we need to change it.

27
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.819
So we'll put animal there,
&gt;&gt; Brian: But

28
00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.770
it also technically depends
on setBreed and setBreeds.

29
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.679
Now, you and I both know that
that's never gonna change,

30
00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.212
but,
&gt;&gt; Brian: ESLint demands that they still

31
00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:01.650
be there because it still
technically depends on them.

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.680
So setBreeds as well.

33
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.902
&gt;&gt; Brian: It doesn't matter
what order these come in,

34
00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:11.230
it's just a list of dependencies
that React will check.

35
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.582
Cuz if any one of these things changed,
rerun this effect after it renders,

36
00:02:15.582 --> 00:02:18.034
otherwise, don't run it again, right?

37
00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:20.974
So now if location changes,
because location's not in here,

38
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.645
it's not gonna rerun this effect.

39
00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:30.950
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
let's go make sure this actually works.

40
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.807
If I refresh this,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now,

41
00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:38.660
notice that breed is no longer grayed out.

42
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.790
If I click on here,

43
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.930
you can see that it actually has
a lot of new dogs in it, right?

44
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.110
And notice that if I start typing in
here it doesn't request new breeds.

45
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.832
However, if I changed the dog to be cat,

46
00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:59.606
notice that it's gonna gray out here for
just a second.

47
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.143
&gt;&gt; Brian: That was very fast, but now
notice here that it has American bobtail,

48
00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:10.050
and Calico, and Cornish Rex,
and things like that.

49
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.160
Same thing with small furry.

50
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.303
I guess you can adopt a skunk.
