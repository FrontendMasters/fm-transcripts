00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So right now, we have this
pet component, it's pretty much empty.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.110
I deleted all the content inside of it so
you and

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.760
I are gonna rewrite this a little bit so
it looks a little bit nicer.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.363
So this is the pet component's gonna
show in the search results page,

5
00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:16.881
which is gonna be used here
in the results component.

6
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.982
So at name, animal, breed, and

7
00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:24.795
do media, location, and id.

8
00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.520
We'll pull those out of the props,
so they're gonna be passed down.

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.312
First thing we wanna have is a placeholder
image just in case, cuz some of these

10
00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:36.840
animals don't actually have
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Images.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.120
So we're going to use place corgi
which is my favorite place to grab

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.690
placeholder images, and
we'll grab a 300 by 300 pixel image, and

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.050
then we'll say if(media.length).

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.610
So if media,
which is the photos coming in here,

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.520
has any length to it, and we'll say, yeah.

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.430
If media.length,
then we'll say hero = media,

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.410
0 is the first image in here and
the small image inside of it.

18
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.063
So that'll give us either the first
image that we can find or

19
00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:19.365
look at the place corgi.

20
00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:22.224
And then here,
we're going to return, a href, so

21
00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:24.751
this is going to be a link
to the details page,

22
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.695
which will I think will be the next
thing that we'll code up together.

23
00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:37.303
So /details/$ {id} and

24
00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:44.480
className="pet".

25
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.820
Inside of that, we'll put a div
with className="image-container".

26
00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And inside of that,
an image where the source is equal to hero

27
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.612
and the alt is equal to
the name of the pet.

28
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:06.724
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, beneath that
we'll have div className="info".

29
00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:12.816
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And inside of that,
we'll have an h1 with a name.

30
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:19.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And h2, and
here I'm gonna use a template string.

31
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.430
You also can do this
without template strings.

32
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.240
It's kinda up to you, I found this
easier to do with template strings.

33
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:33.531
So we're gonna put animal
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

34
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:39.081
then dash and then breed
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

35
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:43.799
a dash and location, okay?

36
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.564
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
a lot of React program looks like this,

37
00:02:47.564 --> 00:02:50.270
where it's just constructing markup,
right?

38
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.451
A lot of just front end development
in general kinda looks like this.

39
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.051
But now, if we go back over and
look at our pet component,

40
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.451
this should look a lot more pleasant.

41
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:02.931
Let's go take a look at the Adopt Me.

42
00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:05.708
We'll search for something,
and you can see here,

43
00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:07.806
we're getting back all sorts of pets.

44
00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:13.379
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
you can see here that these corgi ones,

45
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.640
these are the ones that don't have images.

46
00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So go ahead and
jump up to the commit here.

47
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.198
If you're behind, this commit was,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one here,

48
00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:32.630
async calls to Petfinder API,
update Pet component.

49
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.830
So if you can jump forward to that commit,
you'll be caught up with me.
