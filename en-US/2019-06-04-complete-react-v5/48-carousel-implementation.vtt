00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.041
&gt;&gt; Brian: So go to your Details page,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

2
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:10.949
we're gonna import
Carousel from ./Carousel.

3
00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:24.810
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we're going to
put this on the detail page.

4
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.375
It's going to go, it's the first component
inside of .details, so right here.

5
00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:38.621
Carousel, and just pass in media,
so media=media.

6
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.593
And we have to grab
that out of this.state.

7
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.179
&gt;&gt; Brian: So import Carousel at the top,
on line 27 grab media out of this.state.

8
00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:59.313
And then, again, this is coming
from the API, if you remember.

9
00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:01.400
And then here, on line 31,

10
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.758
be out of the Carousel component with
media=media that we got from the API.

11
00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:10.812
&gt;&gt; Brian: And that should be enough,

12
00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:14.950
now you should see a nice looking
Carousel when you go to your page.

13
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.069
So let's go take a look,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Aw, look at that pup.

14
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.597
And so now you can click on both of these,
right?

15
00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:23.214
And it'll change which
image you're looking at.

16
00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:31.282
&gt;&gt; Brian: I just wanna pet that dog,
that's all I wanna do right now.

17
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:39.253
&gt;&gt; Brian: Well, we have gotten
up to another Commit point here.

18
00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:47.250
So we now have done add Details route, add
custom Babel config, and add the Carousel.

19
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.390
So if you're behind,
feel free to jump up to this Commit point.
