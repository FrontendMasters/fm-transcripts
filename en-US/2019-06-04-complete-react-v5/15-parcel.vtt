WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the first thing I wanna
say about Parcel is that I have taught,

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.890
historically in this class, I have taught
Webpack and Webpack is a phenomenal tool.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.840
It is part of
the OpenJS Foundation as well.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.876
There is a great course in
Frontend Masters about it.

5
00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:20.660
If you wanna learn Webpack and
React together I teach it with React V3.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.830
And that's still totally valid
if you wanna check that out.

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.260
But I'm gonna use a different
packager today that is called Parcel.

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.730
The reason why I chose to teach with
Parcel is it's extremely hands-off.

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.030
You just point it at a file and

10
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.720
it just kind of figures it
everything out by itself.

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.300
There's no configuration to it.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.930
Webpack is phenomenal.

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.470
It's super powerful.

14
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.050
If you have crazy things
you need to do with it,

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.420
Webpack is your friend in
doing crazy stuff like that.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.410
But it's kinda difficult to set up.

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.970
It's inevitable that with
power comes complexity, right?

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.780
So suffice to say I love both tools.

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.670
I'm just choosing Parcel today so
that we can focus on React and

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.700
not necessarily focus on the bundler.

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.420
What we're gonna do now is we're gonna say
npm install D parcel- bundler like that.

22
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.897
That one takes a second cuz there's
a lot of stuff that comes with it.

23
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.196
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the actual tool
that will bundle every code together, and

24
00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.192
get it ready.

25
00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:41.280
1 for your development environment,
and 2 for production.

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.620
And it's really smart.

27
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.720
You just point it at
your index html file and

28
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.880
it discovers all the paths just
by figuring everything out.

29
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.650
And it figures out like this is
a TypeScript file, or this is a JavaScript

30
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.940
file, or this is a CSS file and it just
neatly packages everything for you.

31
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.706
It's a pretty impressive tool.

32
00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.415
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's one I
actually I use quite frequently.

33
00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:11.017
And both Webpack and
Parcel definitely worth supporting.

34
00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:15.010
They both have open collectors, so
that's something you feel inclined to do.

35
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.190
You can see that they actually
drop a link in there for you.

36
00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:23.671
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Frontend Masters does,
thanks Frontend Masters.

37
00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:29.647
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now that we've done that,

38
00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:33.320
I want you to go into your package.json.

39
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.762
And we're going to add another script
in here that's going to be dev.

40
00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:48.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is gonna say parcel src/index.html.

41
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.885
So again, all you have to do with Parcel
is you just point it at the index.html

42
00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:54.392
file and
it just figures everything else for you.

43
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:04.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now I can go into my adopt me.

44
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.790
Well, so first thing I wanna mention here.

45
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.485
This was confusing to me for a long
time until someone pointed it out to me.

46
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:13.120
As I was like,
how does it know what parcel is, right?

47
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.230
I don't think I have parcel
available here, right,

48
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.590
it says parcel command not found.

49
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.630
So like how does it know that?

50
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.290
Well if you go inside of your node modules
here, which is where all of your node,

51
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.900
when I say npm install bundle there,
that's where it goes into node modules.

52
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.160
And there is a secret.bin directory her.

53
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.269
Of all the various different
binary tools I can use, right?

54
00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.900
And one of them in here is called parcel,
which is connected to parcel-bundler.

55
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.786
So that's how it finds it.

56
00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:54.292
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Echo's not in here right,
for example, Echo's just part of like Mac.

57
00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:58.490
But it is able to find parcel and
prettier in here.

58
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.157
So, just so you know that that's
how that gets connected together.

59
00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:06.366
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now I can say, npm run dev.

60
00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:10.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's gonna build all the stuff together.

61
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.740
And it's ready in 1.76 seconds.

62
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.300
You can see here that there's now
a dist and a .cache director.

63
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.640
That is something that Parcel creates for
you.

64
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.135
You can just basically ignore it,
and I can open now.

65
00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:26.520
So if I Cmd + click this,
it'll open in my browser.

66
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.049
And you can see, magically,
I'm running on localhost:1234, but

67
00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:32.825
now this is being packaged by Parcel.

68
00:04:36.638 --> 00:04:38.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now there's some
pretty cool stuff about this.

69
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.941
If I go into app.js and

70
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:44.168
I change this to be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know,

71
00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:47.059
maybe add another Adopt Me in here,
and I save this.

72
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.240
It automatically refreshes my page for
you.

73
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.155
So it does a hot model refresh for
you out of the box for free.

74
00:04:53.155 --> 00:04:55.479
You don't have to do anything about it,
it just works.

75
00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:02.335
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's really it,

76
00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.595
we're not gonna configure
parcel anymore than that.

77
00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.038
It's smart enough to figure
everything else out.
