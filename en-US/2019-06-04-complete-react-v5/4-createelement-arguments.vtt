00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.744
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions so far?

2
00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:01.893
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so

3
00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:07.343
I believe on line 12 you still have
that div id root not rendered?

4
00:00:07.343 --> 00:00:08.457
On line 11, sorry.

5
00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:09.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

6
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.486
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where did that go?

7
00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:11.741
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where did
the not rendered go?

8
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:12.444
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

9
00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:14.784
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When you say render,
like here,

10
00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:17.967
it blows away anything
that's inside of it.

11
00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:18.764
So it just overrides it.

12
00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:23.137
So for example, like if I put in here,

13
00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:29.723
throw new Error,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

14
00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:34.414
then I go back over here,
you'll see it actually just blue it away.

15
00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:36.706
It's still blued away.

16
00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:42.657
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because it did
try to render it, but let's,

17
00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:46.566
actually if you put it outside of that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

18
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.990
it'll say not rendered, right?

19
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.585
Because it didn't get cleared out.

20
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:55.058
So this just kind of helps to see
that your JavaScript is loading.

21
00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:57.793
Not, it's just something I do, it's not
necessarily like a best practice or

22
00:00:57.793 --> 00:00:58.546
anything like that.

23
00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.331
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the best
error right here, by the way.

24
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:08.939
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, other questions?

25
00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.396
Yeah.

26
00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:15.585
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In your app declaration
you have it returns something which I'm

27
00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:21.941
assuming is whatever magic React is doing
when you run that in the background.

28
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.681
But then we're passing at
another React.create element?

29
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:27.864
What's up with that?

30
00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:29.793
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, good question.

31
00:01:29.793 --> 00:01:34.570
So let's talk about the three parameters
that React.create element gets

32
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.538
the first one is what kind of tag is it,
right?

33
00:01:37.538 --> 00:01:41.260
So you can see here, I've called it
three times, react.createElement.

34
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.425
I've called it here, I've called
it here and I've called it here.

35
00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first one
is what kind of element it is.

36
00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:52.822
This is a div, this is an h1, and this is
what you would call a composite component,

37
00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:56.874
which is a fancy way of saying a component
that you and I created, right?

38
00:01:56.874 --> 00:02:01.776
The second, which right now is
an empty object, empty object, and

39
00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:06.076
undefined, cuz we're just
not defining it here, right?

40
00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:09.644
Is all of the attributes that
you want to give the component.

41
00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:14.105
So if I wanted this to
have ID of something

42
00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:20.642
important,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now

43
00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:24.202
this ID is going to be
passed into this div.

44
00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:28.385
So just to prove my point,
if I refresh and come over here, and

45
00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:30.235
I look at Inspect Element,

46
00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:35.317
you can see here that this now actually
has an idea of something important.

47
00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:38.766
All right, so this is the attributes that
are gonna be put on the DOM element.

48
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:43.669
Or if I gave it to app,
this is going to be the attributes that

49
00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.410
are going to pass down
into app that I can use.

50
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.232
We'll talk about that in a second.

51
00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:55.413
But suffice to say this is whatever you
want to pass into the child element,

52
00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:57.068
in this case, the div.

53
00:02:57.068 --> 00:03:01.265
The third one is the children.

54
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:06.230
So inside of div here is an h1, all right?

55
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.130
And so that's what this third one is,
it's whatever children you

56
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.342
want to be passed into this
particular element, right?

57
00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:20.396
So in this case, the children of the h1
is just to text Adopt Me, right?

58
00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:23.345
But I totally could have
pulled a span in here, right?

59
00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:24.950
Or something like that.

60
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.758
Now, this can be either singular,
or this can also be an array.

61
00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:34.393
Cuz a DIV can have 15 children, right?

62
00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:38.371
So here I could also have,
let's just do it for

63
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:44.009
fun,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

64
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.932
Now I have two h1s with Adopt Me,

65
00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:50.421
so if I go back over here, you can see
that there are two h1s passed into this.

66
00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:54.364
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So technically
this doesn't have to be an array,

67
00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:57.066
you can actually just pass these in
all the parameters, it still works.

68
00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:02.414
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's called variable
verity, which is a stupid computer science

69
00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:05.176
word that I learned and
I wanted to impress you with.

70
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.446
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It just means that it
can accept as many extra perimeters and

71
00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:12.908
it'll use all of those as children.

72
00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:17.129
Now I would say in your brain model this
as an array because it'll make it simpler

73
00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.419
in your brain, because we will not be
writing React like this for very long, so.

74
00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.249
Just wanted to point that out, before
someone online points it out for me.

75
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.106
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
we're gonna go back to this.
