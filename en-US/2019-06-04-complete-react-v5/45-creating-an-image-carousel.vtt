00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.678
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I want you to go make
a new file now called carousel.js.

2
00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:13.911
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you want to make like a nice Carousel so

3
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.330
that people can like see the various
different pictures of the animals, right?.

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.847
So first thing we're gonna do here is
we're gonna say import React from 'react'.

5
00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:34.876
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna say
class Carousel extends React.Component.

6
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:41.241
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
this is gonna have two things we're gonna

7
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.290
have an array of all the various
different images, and

8
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.416
we're gonna have which one we're currently
showing, the active one, the active index.

9
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:55.072
So we're gonna say state =, and
the photos is gonna be an active array,

10
00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:57.780
and active is going to be a number.

11
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.736
So we're gonna by default
select the first one.

12
00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:11.947
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then let's go ahead and

13
00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:18.218
make the render,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

14
00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:22.803
when I say const photos and

15
00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:27.805
active = the stats state and

16
00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:32.390
we are going to return a div

17
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.776
class name = carousel.

18
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.703
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Carousel is a word that
the more I type the more it looks strange,

19
00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:49.757
I just can't,
don't know I don't understand it.

20
00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:53.096
Then we are gonna put and image and

21
00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:58.828
the source is gonna be equal to photos,
active, right?

22
00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:07.109
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, photos active,
this is gonna be an array of photos and

23
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.048
stuff I select the second one,
that will be two, right?

24
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:11.980
And I'll select that one.

25
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.809
And then, the alt text here will put for
it is animal or something like that.

26
00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:30.383
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we are gonna
put do class name = carousel- smaller.

27
00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:39.317
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then here inside of that we are gonna put

28
00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:44.097
photos.map,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

29
00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:47.760
then map has two parameters
that it provides.

30
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.360
One of them is the photo, right?

31
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.660
But it also gives you a second
one that is the index.

32
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.746
So when you grab that index as well,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

33
00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:01.239
then we're gonna do
an implicit return here.

34
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.398
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If we were
being more attentive to better

35
00:03:11.398 --> 00:03:14.660
accessibility practice is here.

36
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.930
Probably what we'll do is to
make this little button, right?

37
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.770
Like to see we'll click on
the smaller buttons and

38
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.800
that would cause an interaction over here.

39
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.316
Cuz buttons handle focus a lot better for

40
00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:26.572
just the sake of time don't
do this in production but

41
00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:31.090
I'm gonna show you just to put the event
listener directly on the image.

42
00:03:32.698 --> 00:03:34.159
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the key is gonna be the photo.

43
00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:38.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then onClick where
gonna have to do something with that.

44
00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:43.478
So we're gonna say this.handleIndexClick,

45
00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:47.445
which we will build here momentarily.

46
00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:53.512
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When you give it the data-
index, and what we're gonna do with

47
00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:58.034
this is here instead of the handle index
click if someone clicks on the button,

48
00:03:58.034 --> 00:04:01.350
then we're going to pull
the index off of the image here.

49
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.457
This is source equals photo className =.

50
00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:16.700
So, if the index is triple = to the active
then we want to give it an active class.

51
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.719
Otherwise we don't wanna
give it a class okay,

52
00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.872
and then the alt is going
to be animal thumbnail.

53
00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:33.997
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and this is gonna say
you did a really bad thing just belong

54
00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:38.015
interact developments with quick handle
must have at least one keyboard listener.

55
00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.112
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
here you can do something like on.

56
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.308
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: On key op or
something like that,

57
00:04:50.308 --> 00:04:55.650
equals handle something like that.

58
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.360
We're not gonna do that right now.

59
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.624
For now, we're just going to ignore this.

60
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:12.224
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I like hesitate to
teach people that you can do this,

61
00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:14.200
it's like you can ignore anything,

62
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.553
cuz one of these is eventually gonna be my
core work and am gonna be so upset at you.

63
00:05:22.128 --> 00:05:24.324
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I went through and
did this correctly and

64
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:28.263
it takes a lot of time to get the
accessibility correct on this, so for now

65
00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:32.606
I'm admonishing you to do it correctly,
but we're just gonna move on for now.

66
00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now we have
to go make this handle indexClick.

67
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.856
Let's go ahead and just do the export at
the bottom because I always forget this.

68
00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:47.334
So export, default, carousel, like so

69
00:05:47.334 --> 00:05:54.880
and then now we're gonna go
make the handle indexClick.

70
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.230
Well, let's do the derive state
first this is kind of a fun one.

71
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.100
So the photos are gonna be passed in from
the parent component into the carousel

72
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.320
ride, so it's not gonna get request in the
details page, it's gonna request that, and

73
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.960
then we're going to set that
here in carousel, right?

74
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.190
But the pair is gonna give us a large
object full of lots of photos in

75
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.710
various different sizes and
they actually just want to weed out.

76
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.419
So just the sizes that we need.

77
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.396
So, I'm gonna show you how to use
static getDerivedStateFromProps,

78
00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:31.905
I'm gonna grab media out of this, so

79
00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:37.694
this is a special react method
that it must be static, okay.

80
00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.086
And what it's gonna do is,
it's gonna take in a set of props and

81
00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:42.889
give you back a new set of states.

82
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.330
So I'm gonna say let photos

83
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.590
equals new array full of another
place correlate picture.

84
00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.890
Place corgey.com/600x600 like that.

85
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.763
So this would be the default image
if it doesn't have any images, okay?

86
00:07:05.763 --> 00:07:09.507
Otherwise, if media.length,

87
00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:14.587
then I want you to say
photos = media.map and

88
00:07:14.587 --> 00:07:19.813
I'm just gonna pull out
all the large photos.

89
00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:26.121
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Large and return that.

90
00:07:29.335 --> 00:07:32.683
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so these photo
objects will have small, medium, large and

91
00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:36.270
full, and we're just grabbing
the large photos out of them.

92
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:42.190
So now photos will just be
an array of strings of URLs, okay?

93
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.710
Then down here we're going to return
whatever object that we want to be merged

94
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.460
into the state.

95
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.449
So we're gonna say return photos.

96
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.723
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, again,
getDerivedStateFromProps takes in a set

97
00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:09.050
of properties, does some filtering on them
and then passes that on to the component.

98
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.480
So this component's actually
never gonna see the media props.

99
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.090
It's never really gonna use them, right?

100
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.470
It's gonna use this photos
which is gonna keep in state.

101
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:23.240
So if you have any derived state, this is
a good way to handle those situations.

102
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.790
You don't have to do it this way.

103
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.650
I totally could have come down here and
said, instead of photos dot map,

104
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.370
I would have said this
stop props.media.map.

105
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:41.046
And then here I'll set photo.large and
photo.large.

106
00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:45.398
I'll leave it to you decide if you
think this is a good idea or not,

107
00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:50.545
I like it because it abstracts out some
of the logic into this kind of handler,

108
00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:53.310
but
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Up to you.
