00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna do
the same thing but for breed.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.323
So breed and setBreed and

3
00:00:04.323 --> 00:00:08.664
we're just gonna make this initial
state to be an empty object.

4
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then it's gonna
look really similar to animal.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.739
So underneath this label here,
above the submit button,

6
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.728
I'm gonna say label, htmlFor equals breed.

7
00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:30.045
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna say,

8
00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:33.939
breed and another select.

9
00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:44.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here we're gonna
have inside of that id equals breed.

10
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.946
Value = breed,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From they're,

11
00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:58.914
we're gonna have onChanged =
e returned e.target.value and

12
00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:02.572
we have to put that inside of setBreed.

13
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.797
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then same thing for
onBlur, onBlur.

14
00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:18.159
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's one
more thing we wanna do,

15
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:26.100
if I switch from,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like cats to dogs, right?

16
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.740
They have different breeds so I have to
be constantly refreshing that list of

17
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.850
breeds to reflective to of whatever
the current animal is, right?

18
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.680
So I can't have a poodle cat and
I can't have a tabby dog.

19
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.460
That sounds weird but you can't, right?

20
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.360
So sometimes it'll be switching between
these things because I'm gonna have to be

21
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.370
constantly getting that from the API.

22
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.117
So what we're gonna do is
when I give it a disabled,

23
00:01:51.117 --> 00:01:54.736
so disabled = breed.length.

24
00:01:54.736 --> 00:02:00.707
So if breed.length is zero,
then disable it, right?

25
00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:04.780
Then you want that to be true.

26
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.006
You could also do this,
breeds.length === 0,

27
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:14.204
or,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

28
00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:22.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll define breeds here in
just a second, cuz that doesn't exist yet.

29
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.370
But does this make sense, and

30
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.210
the other thing this is another
ligature that was talking about.

31
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.113
It's three different equal signs,
but it's put together.

32
00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:37.658
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now this will
always be disabled, like people will

33
00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:42.278
not be able to click on
it if breed.length is 0.

34
00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:45.706
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then we're gonna do another thing where

35
00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:46.543
you can select all of them.

36
00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:52.712
So I'm gonna say option,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All and

37
00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:59.122
then underneath that, we're going
to have another one of these for

38
00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:03.640
loops or
maps up there which is gonna be breeds.

39
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.150
Again, which we'll define here in
just a second, .map(breed, and

40
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.193
then return for that an option.

41
00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:16.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
inside of that option we'll have breed.

42
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.470
Let's actually call this something
different than breed cuz that's confusing.

43
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.437
This would be like,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Breed string or

44
00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.875
something like that.

45
00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:32.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So breed string,
breed string like that.

46
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.780
And we have to get that as well the key

47
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.326
of breed string and value of breedString.

48
00:03:52.672 --> 00:03:54.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's
pretty similar to above.

49
00:03:56.644 --> 00:04:02.000
Again, we'll define breed in just
a second, but I'll let you catch that up.

50
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.120
Okay, so come back up here to the top.

51
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.564
Also underneath breed and breedString,

52
00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:11.207
we're also gonna have to keep
track of breeds and setBreeds.

53
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:17.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then it's initial
state is gonna be an empty array, right?

54
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.560
Because we're gonna be requesting
against the APIs like I have a dog,

55
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.250
give me back all of the dog breeds.

56
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.496
So this is gonna be constantly changing
depending on what the user is selecting.

57
00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:34.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

58
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.465
So for now,
breeds is just gonna be an empty array.

59
00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:41.635
So no matter what,
if you go look over here,

60
00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:44.994
you'll just see that it's always disabled.

61
00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:47.212
And set to all because
we're never changing that.
