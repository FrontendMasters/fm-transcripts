00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.708
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So Reach Router, there's
there's two major routers for React.

2
00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:07.553
And actually now there's probably three
there's another one called NaVi that just

3
00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:09.245
came out that I don't
really know too much about.

4
00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:13.110
I just know that it's up and
coming and people like it.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.611
But historically there's been
React router and Reach router,

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.957
which are authored by similar people,
Ryan Florence wrote.

7
00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:25.266
Reach router and
he also helps with React router as well.

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.705
So we're gonna use Reach router today.

9
00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:32.887
I'm a big fan of Reach router because
it's very accessibility focused, right?

10
00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:36.409
So if you have like a page change
it'll focus on the right page,

11
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.138
and managing focus is
a really difficult thing.

12
00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:42.058
And if you don't know that it's
a difficult thing that means you need to

13
00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.883
work harder on accessibility probably,
because it is difficult and

14
00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:47.237
it's also worthwhile,
something you should be doing.

15
00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:51.055
So React router, it's not that it's
bad at accessibility, it's not, but

16
00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.828
it just makes you handle a lot
of accessibility things.

17
00:00:53.828 --> 00:00:58.666
Reach router handles much of that for
you and they're smart about it, so

18
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.823
it's a good project to look at.

19
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.823
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that being said,

20
00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:07.135
they work relatively similar
they're both great projects.

21
00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:12.065
If you're very interested in
learning React router version three

22
00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:15.067
of this course, use this React router.

23
00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:17.796
It's still totally valid,
they're still on the same major version.

24
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:18.804
So yeah, go ahead and

25
00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:21.785
check out version three if you
wanna learn about React router.

26
00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:26.369
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, what we wanna
do is, we wanna add a second page,

27
00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.471
a details page, right?

28
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.979
So we're gonna have
a single page application.

29
00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.895
Now, just a second to talk
about single page applications,

30
00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.425
not every app needs to be
a single page application.

31
00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:41.454
It's okay to have multiple different
pages that load different things, right?

32
00:01:41.454 --> 00:01:45.203
So I'm just gonna show how to do this,
so this is another tool in your toolbox.

33
00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:48.220
But don't feel like you always have to
have a single page application, right?

34
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.886
I think a good example of that is
the Frontend Masters website, right?

35
00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:54.577
It's not a single page application and
they did it really well.

36
00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:59.491
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But something like
Netflix is a single page application and

37
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:00.686
that makes sense, right?

38
00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.021
It's a very app like feel.

39
00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:07.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so what I want you to
do is I want you to go back to your code

40
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.947
editor here and I want you to create
a new file and call this details.js.

41
00:02:14.582 --> 00:02:21.037
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, instead of details.js
we're gonna say import React from react.

42
00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:23.033
You're probably sick of writing that now.

43
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.757
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you'll say const
Details equals arrows function, and for

44
00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:31.916
now we're just gonna
return something dumb.

45
00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:36.629
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just something like that.

46
00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.483
And then we'll say export default Details.

47
00:02:43.107 --> 00:02:45.072
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,
obviously we're gonna fix this later,

48
00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:47.587
this is not what this is gonna
end up looking like, but yeah.

49
00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:52.896
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, at this point
we need to go install Reach router.

50
00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:54.843
I'm just gonna let parcel do it for me,

51
00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:57.686
cuz I have parcel running right
here in the command line.

52
00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:03.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
at the top here in app.js,

53
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:09.976
I'm gonna say import Router
like that with curly

54
00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:17.033
braces around it from @reach/router,
like that.

55
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.025
And again remember, that parcel if I do
this and you can watch it down here let's

56
00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:29.178
install that for me
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

57
00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:31.923
if not you then you have to go
do npm install reach router.

58
00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:44.411
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
looks like it's rebuilding.

59
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.583
So now, I wanna do instead of just always
rendering search press which is what we're

60
00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:49.894
doing right now, right?

61
00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:55.253
I want to switch between rendering
either the search page or

62
00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:57.729
the details page, right?

63
00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.907
So what I'm gonna do here
is I'm gonna put router.

64
00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:07.677
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then oops, I'm gonna
put SearchParams inside of the router.

65
00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:14.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then underneath
that I'm gonna put Details.

66
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.114
Now, notice I haven't I haven't
imported details as well but

67
00:04:18.114 --> 00:04:20.176
with Visual Studio code it says hey,

68
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.383
you're trying to use the details component
and you have a file called details.

69
00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:26.335
I'm pretty sure you're trying
to use the same thing here.

70
00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:30.163
So I'll just click this, and
you'll notice up here that

71
00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:34.653
are important details up here for
me, which is convenient right?

72
00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:38.912
But again I have to do this line 5 there,
import details from details like that.

73
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.423
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then you have to give them paths, so

74
00:04:45.423 --> 00:04:51.782
I'm gonna say path=
/details/:id like that.

75
00:04:51.782 --> 00:04:56.034
And I have to give SearchParams
the path as well, I mean the path of /.

76
00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:03.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is another way that
React router differs from Reach router.

77
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.881
React router will render everything that
matches, whereas Reach router is only

78
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.580
going to render the the thing
that matches the most.

79
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.245
Which is I realize a very
subjective thing to say,

80
00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:17.066
because you can have two things that
technically match the same thing.

81
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.168
Like this, if I said,
you don't have to follow with me here,

82
00:05:20.168 --> 00:05:22.983
I'm just gonna give you an example,
some other route.

83
00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:27.265
And I said path = /details/1.

84
00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:31.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about
ID here for just a second.

85
00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.448
This is a variable, right?

86
00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:35.741
This is a very common way of doing
variables with paths, right?

87
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:39.436
So if I put in,
just ignore a 14 for a second.

88
00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:44.440
If I put in this, and
I put in /details/15 into my URL,

89
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.152
it's gonna pass that ID
into that component, right?

90
00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:51.694
So it'll match this, right?

91
00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:52.832
Does that make sense?

92
00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:55.898
Okay, now,
if I have these two routes here,

93
00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:58.655
which of these routes is more specific?

94
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.646
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Obviously some other route,
like as a human, we look at that and

95
00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:05.487
that's very intuitive to us, right?

96
00:06:05.487 --> 00:06:09.903
But they've actually put like a scoring
algorithm behind this that it'll choose

97
00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:13.039
the most specific route for
you, and it's good, right?

98
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.337
So if I put in /detail/1, React router
would render both of these, right?

99
00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:20.789
And Reach router will just
render some other route,

100
00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.086
which I think is the intuitive
behavior that we would expect, right?

101
00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:26.475
But that's how that works.

102
00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:27.461
Make sense?

103
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:29.075
Okay, cool.

104
00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:31.936
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
does the order of declaration here matter?

105
00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:32.529
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It does not.

106
00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:33.295
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

107
00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:35.772
Good question, it does not.

108
00:06:35.772 --> 00:06:39.062
So with React router they
use a thing called Switch.

109
00:06:39.062 --> 00:06:42.556
If you wanna do just one
particular route in that one,

110
00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:45.441
it will do the first one it matches,
right?

111
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.696
So in that one it does matter, but
this one it does a scoring system and

112
00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:54.144
then it picks the highest score at the end
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe I

113
00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:57.272
should probably be a little
bit less bullish on that.

114
00:06:57.272 --> 00:07:01.981
It might matter at some point it might add
like one point in their scoring algorithm,

115
00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:04.985
but in theory,
I don't think it shouldn't matter.

116
00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:07.808
That was one of their claims to
fame was scoring system in it.

117
00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:13.837
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool so
now we have a router.

118
00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:16.738
Something else that's worth mentioning
about Reach router is you can have

119
00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:17.944
multiple routers on the page.

120
00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:23.128
So you can probably imagine I have like
a main page and I use a router for that.

121
00:07:23.128 --> 00:07:25.663
But I could also have
a contextual site now, right?

122
00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:29.703
That like depending on which page
amend the side nav changes as well.

123
00:07:29.703 --> 00:07:33.010
And you can also have a router over
there that has different rules and

124
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.588
different matching patterns.

125
00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:37.122
And those can work independently
of each other as well.

126
00:07:37.122 --> 00:07:42.464
So it's quite flexible, it's a really
powerful piece of technology.

127
00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:44.024
And we are just gonna scratch the surface,

128
00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:46.331
I don't think it's gonna do very
much more than this, right?

129
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.974
We're gonna use this and links and
that's about it from Reach router.

130
00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:51.768
So just so you know,
this is not a course on Reach router,

131
00:07:51.768 --> 00:07:53.529
I'm just choosing one to show you.

132
00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:58.272
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so,
now that I have that,

133
00:07:58.272 --> 00:08:00.734
let's go take a look at our page, again.

134
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:08.111
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have this,
notice that on the slash, the home page,

135
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:13.184
it's going to the params page,
but if I go to /details/1.

136
00:08:13.184 --> 00:08:14.935
Look what it says, hi lol, right?

137
00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:17.344
So this is working the way that we expect.

138
00:08:17.344 --> 00:08:18.954
We can go backwards and forwards.
