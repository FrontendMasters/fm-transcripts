00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Congratulations.

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.819
You have learned React.

3
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:09.237
I would say I taught you
probably 95% of what's

4
00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:15.301
useful about React and
probably 80% of all of React.

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.899
And this is actually one of
the things that I like about it is

6
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.190
that you can keep all of
React in your head, right?

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.800
It's a fairly small library,
in terms of just raw concepts to learn.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.050
Whereas this was my criticism with
Angular when I was working with it,

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.520
you can't know all of Angular.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.620
It's just too big.

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.550
There's just too much that it does and
you can't keep that all in your head.

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.580
That's fine, it does a lot of really
cool stuff, and same with Ember, right?

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.171
People that know how to write Ember
are able to scath out really incredible

14
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:43.920
projects.

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.717
I admire them for
how productive they can be.

16
00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:51.483
But I don't really look at the React aux
very much because it's something that if

17
00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:54.520
you do enough,
it just kinda all sits in your head.

18
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.420
So I've written React for a long time.

19
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.210
I'm a big fan.

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.765
Even when I'm not writing React,
I'm usually writing Preact.

21
00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:06.440
[LAUGH] So, previous versions of this
course, I taught what Preact,js is.

22
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.536
It's something probably
worth checking out.

23
00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:11.840
I'm not gonna teach it today because
Preact always lags behind React a little

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.270
bit, and so they're still not ready
with hooks, last time I checked.

25
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.300
They might be now, but.

26
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.300
If you wanna write React but

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.440
have it only use 3 kilobytes instead
of 35 kilobytes, Preact will do that.

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.690
So it's a smaller,
typically slower library,

29
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.030
once it's executing, but
it's also faster to download.

30
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.890
So this is really useful if you're trying
to target 2G networks and stuff like that.

31
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.318
And the good news is it works
almost exactly the same way.

32
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's actually
to the point where oftentimes,

33
00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:53.415
you can actually just drop in Preact,
which is pretty cool, and it'll just work.

34
00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:07.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah great, so
that is the end of the intro to React.

35
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.740
This was so fun to teach this again.

36
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.430
It's one of my favorite workshop to teach,
hence, why I've done this five and

37
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.850
a half times, [LAUGH].

38
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.899
And I probably will be back again,
if they don't throw me out.

39
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.740
It's also pretty slow to update as well.

40
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.708
In the sense of like,

41
00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:29.830
the React of five years ago is still
pretty similar to what we write today.

42
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.670
And yeah, I think it's a good
way to write a project.

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.870
So there's a lot of good places
where you can go from here.

44
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.240
There's intermediate React, which we'll
be building on this same project.

45
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.330
But we're gonna go ahead and introduce
kind of optional things like emotion,

46
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.970
or server-side rendering, or
Redux, or things like that.

47
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.640
You can go take Kent's testing course.

48
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.340
So I have a testing module in
the intermediate React, but it's this big,

49
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.151
intense, and
Kent's course is very in-depth on testing.

50
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.527
There's advanced state
management with Steve.

51
00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:09.720
And he does a great job of going
over things like Redux and MobX and

52
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.000
some of those other very
heavy state containers.

53
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.540
And then there's just a lot of other
really cool stuff on FrontendMasters.

54
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.500
So, yeah, thanks for watching.

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.435
Thanks for sticking with me.

56
00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:26.957
