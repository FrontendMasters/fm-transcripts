00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.288
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go put it in details.js.

2
00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:08.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So details is what?

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.670
A class, so I can't use any hooks in here,
which is unfun.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.365
So what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna say

5
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:24.833
import ThemeContext from./ThemeContext.

6
00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:36.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And unfortunately, it's
a lot weirder to use context with classes.

7
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.203
So, what I'm gonna do
here where the button is,

8
00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:47.195
we have to do ThemeContext.Consumer.

9
00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:53.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then inside of this,
you're provided a function.

10
00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:59.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So inside of this,
I get a function here with the theme back.

11
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.330
And then here I can use this theme to,
I can read from the theme.

12
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.081
So let's put themeHook.

13
00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:20.689
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here I can
just move my button up into this.

14
00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.212
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I can say style=backgroundColour

15
00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:41.920
themeHook(0), right?

16
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.624
Because it provides you both the set,
or the theme and the set theme.

17
00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:06.072
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So keep in mind,

18
00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:09.960
any function that just returns
markup is a React component, right?

19
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.910
So we're just basically creating
a smaller React component inside of

20
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.815
the theme provider.

21
00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:17.959
Or sorry the theme consumer,
which is reading that off of the context.

22
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.241
So it's kind of an odd pattern,
but that's how it works.

23
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.908
Does that make sense?

24
00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:29.250
Now, it's weird to read this
themeHook(0) like this.

25
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.855
So we could actually make this
even simpler if we just did this,

26
00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:40.712
so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what did I do here?

27
00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:42.570
I destructured this right.

28
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.377
Now I'm pulling the theme
out of the array.

29
00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.241
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you could leave it with
the themeHook(0), I'm fine with that.

30
00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:06.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

31
00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:11.397
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if we go over
here now to the details page.

32
00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:17.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So notice that
they're on different pages now but

33
00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.635
they're both dark blue backgrounds right
and they're both reading from context.

34
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.463
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if you go change that.

35
00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:32.440
So if I go into the app.js and say.

36
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.733
Yeah, this shouldn't be dark blue anymore,

37
00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:41.919
this should be peru,
it's my favorite CSS name color.

38
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.387
That's the color of Peru.

39
00:03:43.387 --> 00:03:45.373
I don't know if you knew that but
that's what it is.

40
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.123
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
notice it updates the entire application.

41
00:04:00.723 --> 00:04:01.809
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

42
00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:02.560
Yeah, Mark?

43
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could we pass
multiple hooks to the context?

44
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: At that point,

45
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.177
you wouldn't wanna use a
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You would just give it

46
00:04:13.177 --> 00:04:14.350
an object, right?

47
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.705
You wouldn't give it multiple hooks,
you would give it just an object, right?

48
00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:22.080
So rather than here,
this is just a string right now.

49
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.269
And probably what I would do
is I would just say object.

50
00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:33.117
And I would have buttonColor darkblue and

51
00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:39.850
maybe like, I don't know, modalColor.

52
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.990
Do modals have colors?

53
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.490
I don't know.

54
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.360
And they're pink, because this
is a well-designed application.

55
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.959
Okay, and then now I would have this and
so I would come into the details here.

56
00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:59.677
And that would be theme.buttonColor,
right?

57
00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:02.050
So you would use an object
instead of just a string.

58
00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:09.285
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But again,

59
00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:15.010
just remember that I can give
anything to use context, right?

60
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.297
So if I go back to app.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Instead

61
00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:24.918
of having themeHook be a hook here,
I can actually just give it an object and

62
00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:27.519
that object would have a bunch
of stuff in it, right?

63
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.310
So it doesn't have to be a hook.

64
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.730
Hooks in context are not
[LAUGH] hooked together, right?

65
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.920
They're totally separate concepts.

66
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.030
I happen to be using them here together
because they work together nicely.
