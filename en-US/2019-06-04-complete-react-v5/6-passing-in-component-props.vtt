00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I wanna make this more flexible so

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.610
that I can have a different name, I can
have a difference type of animal, and

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.692
I can have a different breed, right?

4
00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:13.515
So what I wanna do is I wanna pass
attributes into the pet component which we

5
00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.660
kinda already saw a little bit
earlier with this ID thing, right?

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.908
This is how you pass
it into like a div and

7
00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:22.800
we can use the same methodology to pass
information into the pet component.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.238
So what I'm gonna do here, I'm gonna
use multiple cursors with a VS code.

9
00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:36.960
So I'm gonna click and then hold alt,
and click again underneath it like that.

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.920
And now I can write in three
different places at once.

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.738
So I'm gonna hit comma, and

12
00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:47.850
then I'm gonna pass in a name which for
now is going to be Luna.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.620
A animal which is gonna be a dog and

14
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.250
the breed, which is gonna be lavanese.

15
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.391
And then I'm gonna had that reorganized so
it's little bit easier to

16
00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:11.128
read
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

17
00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:13.140
so now this information
is being passed down.

18
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.950
Now I'm gonna change this so
they're not all Luna.

19
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.790
Let's make this one my bird from growing
up, which who's name was Pepper, and

20
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.110
Pepper was a cockatiel.

21
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.080
And we're gonna name this after
my friend's cat which is the most

22
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.740
amusing name I've ever heard for
a cat which is Doink.

23
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.420
Doink is mostly blind, so

24
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.300
Doink just kind of runs into walls and
Doinks the wall, hence the name.

25
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.548
Doink is a cat and
the breeds like stray or mixed or

26
00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:50.184
something like that we'll go with mixed.

27
00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:55.682
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now all this
information is being passed into the pet

28
00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:01.829
component, but we have to use it,
we're not using it yet anywhere.

29
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.877
So what this does is it
takes this information and

30
00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:08.255
it passes it in as a parameter
here called props.

31
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:13.926
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
instead of saying Luna here,

32
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:18.081
I'm gonna say props.whatever I called
this here, which is props.name.

33
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:21.467
So instead of saying dog here,
I'm gonna say props

34
00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:26.922
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Instead of saying dog here,

35
00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:31.787
I'm gonna say props.animal
is what I called it, okay?

36
00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:36.550
And then here, I'm gonna say props.breed.

37
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.240
So now what do I expect to see
when I go look at the browser?

38
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.941
It's gonna look relatively the same,

39
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.236
except I'm gonna have three different
pets instead of Luna three times, right?

40
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.682
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I refresh the page,
you can see here that I have Luna, Pepper,

41
00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:52.513
and Doink.
