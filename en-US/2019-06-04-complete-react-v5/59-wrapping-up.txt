>> Brian Holt: Congratulations. You have learned React. I would say I taught you probably 95% of what's useful about React and probably 80% of all of React. And this is actually one of the things that I like about it is that you can keep all of React in your head, right?

[00:00:20]
It's a fairly small library, in terms of just raw concepts to learn. Whereas this was my criticism with Angular when I was working with it, you can't know all of Angular. It's just too big. There's just too much that it does and you can't keep that all in your head.

[00:00:35]
That's fine, it does a lot of really cool stuff, and same with Ember, right? People that know how to write Ember are able to scath out really incredible projects. I admire them for how productive they can be. But I don't really look at the React docs very much because it's something that if you do enough, it just kinda all sits in your head.

[00:00:54]
So I've written React for a long time. I'm a big fan. Even when I'm not writing React, I'm usually writing Preact. [LAUGH] So, previous versions of this course, I taught what Preact,js is. It's something probably worth checking out. I'm not gonna teach it today because Preact always lags behind React a little bit, and so they're still not ready with hooks, last time I checked.

[00:01:15]
They might be now, but. If you wanna write React but have it only use 3 kilobytes instead of 35 kilobytes, Preact will do that. So it's a smaller, typically slower library, once it's executing, but it's also faster to download. So this is really useful if you're trying to target 2G networks and stuff like that.

[00:01:38]
And the good news is it works almost exactly the same way.
>> Brian Holt: It's actually to the point where oftentimes, you can actually just drop in Preact, which is pretty cool, and it'll just work.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah great, so that is the end of the intro to React. This was so fun to teach this again.

[00:02:09]
It's one of my favorite workshop to teach, hence, why I've done this five and a half times, [LAUGH]. And I probably will be back again, if they don't throw me out. It's also pretty slow to update as well. In the sense of like, the React of five years ago is still pretty similar to what we write today.

[00:02:31]
And yeah, I think it's a good way to write a project. So there's a lot of good places where you can go from here. There's intermediate React, which we'll be building on this same project. But we're gonna go ahead and introduce kind of optional things like emotion, or server-side rendering, or Redux, or things like that.

[00:02:52]
You can go take Kent's testing course. So I have a testing module in the intermediate React, but it's this big, intense, and Kent's course is very in-depth on testing. There's advanced state management with Steve. And he does a great job of going over things like Redux and MobX and some of those other very heavy state containers.

[00:03:13]
And then there's just a lot of other really cool stuff on FrontendMasters. So, yeah, thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking with me.
