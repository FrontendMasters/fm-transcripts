00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.146
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, I'm gonna show you how
to make this email a little bit easier.

2
00:00:02.146 --> 00:00:06.950
So writing props dot gets very old very
quickly when you're writing React, so

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.170
there's a thing that you can
do called destructuring.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.920
So what I can do here
is I can replace props,

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.560
I know that the thing is gonna be
called animal, breed, and name, right?

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.080
So I can actually just pull this out,
so I'm gonna delete props here,

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.580
put the parentheses back.

8
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.700
And then inside of that,
I'm gonna put curly brackets, like that.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.831
And then I'm gonna say name,

10
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.135
animal, and breed like that.

11
00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:37.400
And this is going to pull out these
particularly named properties within these

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.030
objects and make them available
as those variable names, right?

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.182
So instead of saying props.name,
I'm just gonna say name.

14
00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:50.338
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same
thing here with animal,

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.033
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And breed.

16
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:58.662
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

17
00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:03.603
It's called destructuring,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

18
00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.539
everything should work the same way,
which it does.

19
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:14.931
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

20
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:15.982
that's the first section.

21
00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:18.730
So congratulations,
you know a little bit of React now.

22
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.587
And the good news is this
is kind of most of it.

23
00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:23.802
I'm going to show you a bunch
of other stuff, right?

24
00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:27.145
I have to earn what they're
paying me [LAUGH] but

25
00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:30.669
this is kinda like the core
idea of what React is.

26
00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:37.137
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a commit point
here, so if you're falling behind and

27
00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:40.651
you wanna come up to this point, you can
actually just move to the first commit in

28
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.440
the repo, and this will take you
to this point in the workshop.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.150
The next thing we're gonna do is we're
going to start introducing some tooling to

30
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.680
help us out.

31
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.290
Because you don't wanna
write React like this,

32
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.570
you can actually make React
much easier to write.

33
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.300
But again, this is still the core
concepts of what React is.
