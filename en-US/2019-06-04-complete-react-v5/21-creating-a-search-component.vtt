00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hooks is
a really new feature to React.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.020
It's probably something that if you're
on the Twitterspheres that you've heard

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.640
of, right?

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.425
And this got introduced maybe about,
November is when they announced it.

5
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:12.366
And it's been rolling out.

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.763
And so now it's generally
available as of React 16.8.

7
00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:19.995
So the first thing I'm gonna tell you
right now is, that's totally optional.

8
00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.640
You do not have to use Hooks right now.

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.420
But I am going to teach them to you first,

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
because I think they're an easier way to
think about writing React components.

11
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.293
And then we're also going to the other
syntax as well which is class syntax,

12
00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:35.519
cuz you need to know both of them, okay?

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.192
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For those of you that
are watching the video, if you're watching

14
00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:47.110
this just to learn Hooks, there is
a section here called Hooks in Depth.

15
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.733
It's probably a good sport to jump in,
right?

16
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.086
Because that section is totally
isolated from the other ones and

17
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.650
it goes over all of the hooks.

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.061
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That will be in
the Intermediate React course.

19
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, that will be
in the Intermediate React course.

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.347
I think it is the first section
of the Intermediate React course.

21
00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:08.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, but
you could also start from here as well.

22
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.927
So, let's talk about what hooks do for us.

23
00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:21.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go back to our
code, let's make a new component here.

24
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.607
And we're gonna call it SearchParams.js.

25
00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:28.319
It's gonna be inside
the source directory as well.

26
00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:37.226
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here we're going
to import React from 'react'.

27
00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:41.921
Say const SearchParams is gonna
be equal to an arrow function.

28
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:47.317
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna
give it some location.

29
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:52.639
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is gonna
be something like Seattle, WA.

30
00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.663
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure that
this is an American location.

31
00:01:56.663 --> 00:02:00.075
The API that we're gonna be
using is limited to the US.

32
00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:04.660
And actually I've limited the API to just
Seattle and San Fransisco right now.

33
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.483
So maybe choose one of those.

34
00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:14.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'll explain why here in a second.

35
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.652
So make a div here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

36
00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:22.878
so one thing I haven't explained to you so

37
00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:26.644
far that is pretty important is I
wanna give this a class name, right?

38
00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:34.150
So typically, I'll just say class
equals search-params, like this.

39
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.369
But notice it's gonna say,
I don't know what class is.

40
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.010
There's problem with using class.

41
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.790
And the issue is that class is
a reserved word in JavaScript.

42
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.210
So if I say something like class Pet or
something like that.

43
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.399
Class here has a meaning in JavaScript,
right?

44
00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.627
Just like I can't say, const class = blah,

45
00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:02.260
is because this is a reserved word, right?

46
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.140
Unexpected keyword means it's a word that
you cannot use as a variable name, right?

47
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.630
Same thing,
I can't have this called const,

48
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.210
I can't have this called let, right?

49
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.900
Class is another one of those.

50
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.590
So how do we get around that with JSX?

51
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.529
Well, we use the name of
the JavaScript API, which is a className.

52
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.060
They didn't invent this, but this was
not a limitation that React invented.

53
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.190
And actually,
it's the name of the DOM API as well, so

54
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.640
it's consistent with
what the DOM calls it.

55
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.550
So that's why this is className
instead of just class, right?

56
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.632
I understand that people find that
annoying, but it is what it is.

57
00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:41.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
inside of that we're gonna put a form.

58
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.480
Inside of that we're gonna have a label
and same thing here with for, right?

59
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.908
For is another reserve word,
as in for loop, right?

60
00:03:51.908 --> 00:03:54.172
So htmlFor.

61
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.953
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is for the location.

62
00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:07.615
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside of that,
I want to give it location with an input

63
00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:13.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Id = "location".

64
00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:17.872
Location =, and
then we're gonna put curly braces here

65
00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:21.970
because we want this location
here to be put there.

66
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.220
Sorry, and this isn't gonna be location,
this is gonna be value.

67
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.156
Value = {location}.

68
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:35.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
placeholder = "Location".

69
00:04:40.743 --> 00:04:45.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And underneath that
we're gonna have outside of that,

70
00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.766
inside of the Form button,
Submit, like that.

71
00:04:55.808 --> 00:04:58.778
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
lesson down here, export default.

72
00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:02.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchParams.

73
00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:06.848
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Last line there.

74
00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:11.406
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we've made this new component,

75
00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:14.247
that's gonna be a little like search box.

76
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.665
So we can search for
various different facets of pets, right,

77
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.220
against the Pet Finder API.

78
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.030
And it has a div with a form inside of it.

79
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.150
And we have a input with a label for it.

80
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.550
Some of you might find this like
a little strange way to nest it.

81
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.980
This is one way that you can do

82
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.160
labels that you put the input
inside of the label.

83
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.290
There's other ways of doing it as well.

84
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.510
But in the end,
it's just good for accessibility.

85
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.220
So that if someone clicks
on the location that it

86
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.820
highlights the correct input, right?

87
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.310
That's ultimately what
we're going here for.

88
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.740
And it's gonna have a value of Seattle,
Washington, right?

89
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.040
So let's go ahead and
go render that out to app.js.

90
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.949
So instead of app.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure you get

91
00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.570
this right.

92
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.216
Yep, we can delete all this
stuff that we commented out.

93
00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:13.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here,
we're not gonna import from Pet anymore.

94
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.762
We cannot use Pet right now.

95
00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:20.544
We'll say,
import SearchParams from ./SearchParams.

96
00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.313
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to
delete all these pets, and

97
00:06:25.313 --> 00:06:27.306
just put SearchParams like that.

98
00:06:35.338 --> 00:06:38.881
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, open SearchParams one
more time, in case you missed something.

99
00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now I need to make
sure that my server is running.

100
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.510
Mine is still running, but
make sure yours is running.

101
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.411
And then make sure you
open localhost 1234 here.

102
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:57.530
Something I kind of danced around but
didn't explicitly mention was that.

103
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.360
You can't do that file open thing
that I was showing you before,

104
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.250
that no longer works.

105
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.740
You have to be loading this
off of Parcel's server, right?

106
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.871
Which is why you have to open
it off of the localhost: 1234.

107
00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:15.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna open
that again, which I have up here.

108
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.584
And you can see,
I have a location here, with Seattle,

109
00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:21.483
Washington, with the Submit button there,
right?
