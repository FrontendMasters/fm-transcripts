00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now as you can see here,
I haven't been using that.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.065
I actually have it runs
prettier every time I run save.

3
00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:09.180
So I'm gonna show you how to do that.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.860
So inside of VS Code,
go to the Extensions,

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.090
which is this one here, and
I have one called prettier.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960
Which I'm pretty sure
is this top one here.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.260
Yep, this one.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.790
It's the one that has a lot of downloads.

9
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:37.029
So over eight million and just say install
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

10
00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:42.756
once you have that installed,
then I want you to go to your Settings.

11
00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:50.421
So you can either do that through Code
Preferences Settings or Command Comma.

12
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:52.563
And then you need to turn
on two things for me.

13
00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:58.678
One of them you wanna turn
on is Format on Save.

14
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.405
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the editor format on Save, check that one,

15
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:06.900
that's probably off for you.

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.570
The second one that I want you
to check is require config.

17
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630
So prettier down here,
you can see, mine's not checked.

18
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.353
So prettier, require config.

19
00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:22.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So check that one.

20
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.580
So you want prettier to run but

21
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.110
you only want it to run on projects that
prettier's actually installed on, right?

22
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.770
You don't wanna go on to some other
project and have prettier run on it

23
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.640
because then you're going to modify
literally every line of code and then

24
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.550
the get blame is gonna be on you for every
line of code which is unfun, I will say.

25
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.260
So now that I've done that,
this project doesn't have a config yet,

26
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.950
we haven't made one.

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
So if I go and do this, I'm saving it,
and notice that it's not fixing it.

28
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.310
That's what we want right now, right?

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.816
We only want it to run on
projects where it has prettier.

30
00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.960
So the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to create a config file.

31
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.941
So create a new file save it to the root

32
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:14.084
directory here adopt me and you have to

33
00:02:14.084 --> 00:02:19.079
call this call it dot.prettierRC.

34
00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.648
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't even
know what RC stands for, but

35
00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:28.245
that what all the bash
config files are called.

36
00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:35.532
We're gonna create one called the ES
lint RC, prettier RC, MVM RC, MPM RC.

37
00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:36.530
Does anyone know what that stands for?

38
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.480
Me neither.

39
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.850
Okay, prettierRC make that file.

40
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.363
Yes I know it's a reserve file,
that's on purpose.

41
00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:52.240
And then I need you to put two magical
characters in here, empty objects.

42
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.110
Now there are a few things you can
configure about prettier, you know,

43
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.240
if you want to be tabs or spaces,
do you wanted to have spaces here, or

44
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.420
not have spaces there?

45
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.120
There's a few things.

46
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.530
I told you, I don't actually care,
I just want it to work.

47
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.950
So this is just saying,
give me the default config.

48
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.958
But if you want it to have
some sort of config in here,

49
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:23.023
you could say, "singleQuote": false.

50
00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:26.800
I only wanna have double quotes or
single quotes, true.

51
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
I only wanna have single quotes, right?

52
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860
It'll be things like that,
but, again, I don't care,

53
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.400
so I'm just gonna put empty object here.

54
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.200
So now if I go back over two app.js and
I save, now it'll actually use.

55
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.932
It'll run prettier on every single time
that I save which is what I wanted.

56
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This can
be done with sublime.

57
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.380
This can be done with
other editors as well.

58
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.730
Just read it off of prettier's website.

59
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.764
They'll tell you how to do it.

60
00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:58.822
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

61
00:03:58.822 --> 00:03:59.720
Is that working for people?

62
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.910
Cool.

63
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.133
Again I love this because it means I get
to shut down like a part of my brain that

64
00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:08.825
thinks about formatting things.

65
00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:12.120
Like typically when you paste something
and it's like, okay well this has to go

66
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.883
here and I have to convert these
spaces to tabs and stuff like that.

67
00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:18.215
You just get to shut down that thread
of your brain and focus more on code.

68
00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:22.370
There aren't really very many alternatives
for prettier so if you want to have a code

69
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.252
format or if that's something that you
want prettier's by far the standard.

70
00:04:26.252 --> 00:04:32.340
There may be others but
it’s either this or nothing.

71
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.472
ESLint has a thing called fix
which you can use that as well but

72
00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:36.830
it’s not the same thing.
