00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:02.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right this is really
feeling gross to write this inside of

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.470
a script tag, does everyone
feel sufficiently gross inside?

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.440
Good, thatâ€™s what I wanted
you to feel this morning.

4
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.014
So what I want you to do is I want
you to open a file called App.js,

5
00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:18.162
just put it in the same source directory.

6
00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:20.334
One thing I wanted to point
out at this point as well.

7
00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.730
React is extremely flexible.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.380
It's not very prescriptive at
all about pretty much anything.

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.750
I like this because it allows me
to make technical decisions for

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.660
myself and not rely on
the technical decisions of others,

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.770
but that's a philosophy that I have,
right?

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.110
And you don't necessarily
have to share that.

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.230
Which means we can organize our project
however we want, React doesn't care,

14
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.024
React has zero opinions on the matter
of how you organize your project.

15
00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:52.990
I have organized this project just for
simplicity, it's not a very big project.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.120
So, I'm not saying that this repo
that we're gonna end up with is

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.310
incredibly well organized,
I'm just gonna say it's simple.

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.020
So that's one thing I
wanted to throw out there,

19
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.510
that's not something I'm intending
to teach you with this workshop.

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.740
Okay, so take everything from your
script tag here, cut that out, and

21
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.780
put this inside of your app.

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.460
Delete that comment as well.

23
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.630
Say that.

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.128
Go back over to your index.html and
put your src ="./App.js".

25
00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:38.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so all I did was cut
that entire script out of the source here

26
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.007
and I put that inside of app.JS.

27
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:49.503
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next thing we're
gonna do is we're going to create

28
00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:50.232
another component.

29
00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:56.083
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna
say const Pet = another arrow

30
00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.726
function
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm going

31
00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:03.591
to return React.createElement.

32
00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:07.297
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another div.

33
00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:13.511
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another empty object,
and inside of that another array and

34
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.015
we're going to describe
a pet very quickly.

35
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.403
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna say react.createElement.

36
00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:28.673
Gonna make this an h2, lets make it
an h1 actually cuz that's my notes have,

37
00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:34.621
empty object and you can put
whatever your pet's name is there,

38
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.394
mine's name is Luna, okay?

39
00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.201
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then I'm gonna put
three different lines in here, and

40
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:45.220
this is gonna be an h1 and two h2's.

41
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.727
And Luna is a Dog, and
her breed is Havanese.

42
00:02:56.993 --> 00:02:59.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I've created another stamp here, right?

43
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.107
I have not used the stamp but I've gone
to the store and I've purchased one and

44
00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:06.311
I'm just kinda holding it,
not doing anything with it yet.

45
00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:16.111
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so here, inside of
App, I'm gonna make this into an array so

46
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.603
I can put multiple children in it.

47
00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here,
let's make this look nice.

48
00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:42.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna put
three instances of the pet item.

49
00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:46.984
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna put React.createElement Pet,

50
00:03:46.984 --> 00:03:49.245
then I'm gonna put this three times.

51
00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:02.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now notice I'm not putting
the rest of the stuff in there as well.

52
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.870
You can if you want to.

53
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.920
You can put empty object and
empty array or something like that.

54
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.770
You don't have to.

55
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.610
It's optional.

56
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.557
If you don't give it anything, it just
assumes that it has no attributes and

57
00:04:11.557 --> 00:04:12.256
has no children.

58
00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:22.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I made a rubber stamp,
and I stamped it three times, right?

59
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.050
So now, what do you expect
to see when we render this?

60
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.140
Well, I expect to see a div, right?

61
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.710
Inside of that div, the first thing we see
is an h1, and then I'm gonna stamp Pet,

62
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.160
okay, so I'm gonna go inside of Pet here
and I'm going to inspect a div, an h1 and

63
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.310
two h2s here, right?

64
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:50.710
And I'm gonna see that this pattern
repeated three times, make sense?

65
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.465
It's now on 3, if we go in here,
you should see Adopt Me,

66
00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:58.391
Luna Dog Havanese, Luna Dog Havanese,
Luna Dog Havanese.

67
00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:05.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is what's cool
about components is they are inherently

68
00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:06.560
reusable, right?

69
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.968
I made one pet component and
I stamped it three times.

70
00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:14.721
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is pretty cool,
except for

71
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:18.150
the fact that this is not
very flexible at all, right?

72
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.490
It's not flexible.

73
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.130
There are other dogs besides Luna,
I'm told, so

74
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.081
we probably need to make this
a little bit more flexible.
