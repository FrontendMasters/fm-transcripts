1
00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:03.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go to details.js,
and we want to make it so

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.610
whenever you click on this nice button
here, that it pops open a module.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.602
So what we're gonna do here
is we're going to import

4
00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:21.203
navigate from @reach/router
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

5
00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:25.583
we're going to import our modal as well.

6
00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:28.495
Modal from ./modal.

7
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.978
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry, @reach,
not react, @reach/router.

8
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:43.254
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

9
00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:47.965
We'll add a new piece of state here,
and it's gonna be called showModal and

10
00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.257
we're not gonna initially show it.

11
00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:02.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, we need one
more piece of state from animal now.

12
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.800
I mean, its URL, so I'm gonna say URL and
get to grab that off of animal type URL.

13
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.390
This is actually the URL that
you will go to to adopt the pet.

14
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.648
Okay, above the render here, we're going
to put a new method called toggle modal.

15
00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:33.658
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll just make this
a very quick this.setState of showModal,

16
00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:38.365
and you just want to be
the opposite of whatever

17
00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:43.430
showModal was, so this.state.showModal.

18
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.580
So if it's false, make it true,
and if it's true, make it false.

19
00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.511
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then underneath that,

20
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:51.840
we're gonna make an adopt
function as well.

21
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960
It's just gonna be an arrow function.

22
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.300
And all it's gonna do is
navigate to this.state.url.

23
00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:09.222
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We could have done this
with the redirect component as well,

24
00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:10.249
I wanted to show you both.

25
00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't think
there is really an advantage.

26
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.225
The React router and the Reach router
people encourage you to use a redirect

27
00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:21.490
component, that's what
they say they prefer.

28
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.951
But I think it's a perfectly good
decision to decide either way.

29
00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:33.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, down here,
here, inside of media,

30
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.979
we're gonna put showModal as well,
cuz we're gonna grab that out.

31
00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I just add 41 there.

32
00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:51.025
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then below
the description, we're gonna put this.

33
00:02:54.092 --> 00:02:55.739
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
pick up your curly braces here, and

34
00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.135
then we're gonna do a ternary.

35
00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:02.460
So if I should showModal,

36
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.575
then display this,

37
00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:10.938
I'm sorry, modal.

38
00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:15.825
And inside of that,
we're going to put our own mark

39
00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:20.381
up of like &lt;h1&gt; Would
you like to adopt name?

40
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.377
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then put a div and
className="buttons".

41
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.841
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then here, we're gonna say,

42
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.295
button onClick= this.adopt.

43
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:45.971
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you say, yes.

44
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:53.474
And then you're gonna say, no, I'm
a monster, and you just toggle the model.

45
00:03:57.015 --> 00:04:00.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My goal is to
shame someone into buying a pet.

46
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.616
Just kidding,
only buy a pet if you are ready for

47
00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:09.451
one, but please adopt all the pets.

48
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.172
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then afterwards,
after this parenthesis right here,

49
00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:21.450
I put :null, right?

50
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.020
So if you tell React to render null,
as you may guess, it renders nothing.

51
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.320
So if you're showing the modal,
then show the modal.

52
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.399
If not, show modal then show nothing.

53
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.852
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why don't you like that?

54
00:04:47.301 --> 00:04:50.407
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Fine, I am a monster.

55
00:04:50.407 --> 00:04:51.860
I don't know why it's doing that.

56
00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.400
Then we have to put it so that when you
click on Adopt, here, on this button.

57
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.120
So the onClick here,
you're gonna say this.toggleModal, right?

58
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.729
So whenever someone clicks on
the Adopt button, it shows the modal.

59
00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.936
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So line 53 here,
it's what I added.

60
00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:21.105
Let's go take a look at
what looks like now.

61
00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:24.296
So we got the goodest boy here,
Fat Boy Slim.

62
00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:29.182
If I click on Adopt Fat Boy Slim,
Would you like to adopt Fatboy Slim?

63
00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:32.534
And you say Yes or No, I'm a monster.

64
00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:37.297
[LAUGH] So if you clicked yes,
it'll navigate to

65
00:05:37.297 --> 00:05:42.172
Fat Boy Slim's
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Page.

66
00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:51.194
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if you click on No,
I'm a monster, it closes the modal.

67
00:05:57.508 --> 00:05:59.585
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty cool, right?

68
00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:03.082
So just to remphasize what
I think is cool about this,

69
00:06:03.082 --> 00:06:05.580
this modal is now 100% flexible.

70
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.680
Any time that I need to show a modal,
I just pull this in and it just works.

71
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.673
And just to prove my point to you,

72
00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:16.862
if I inspect element here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice

73
00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:21.860
that I have modal and root, and
these are two totally different places.

74
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.350
But this is all happening in here
outside of root, which is really cool.

75
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.000
But because this is on React, like I'm
using functions from this component,

76
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.170
I'm using the name,
which is coming out as components,

77
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.090
I'm using all this stuff inside of it but
it's rendering somewhere else.

78
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.500
It's actually really cool because
if you're doing event listeners, so

79
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.558
let's say I have an event listener
here on div, which is above the modal,

80
00:06:49.558 --> 00:06:54.820
and say onClick.

81
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.313
And all it does is console.log it.

82
00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:08.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, it should still work
where, let's make sure I'm not crazy here.

83
00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
the click listener is working.

84
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.100
Anywhere I click on the div,
it's gonna show these events.

85
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.810
But if I click into this,
let me just trash this so you can see.

86
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.812
I'm clicking on DOM elements
outside of this div, but

87
00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:32.120
it's still getting dispatched correctly.

88
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.040
So the event delegation actually will
still go through the same React tree.

89
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.120
Cuz React has its own event system.

90
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.930
It looks exactly and it acts exactly the
same but it has nice features like this

91
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.610
where I can actually handle event
delegation outside of that DOM.

92
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.990
That's really cool too.

93
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.545
I don't know why this should be useful,
I'm just fascinated by it.

94
00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:56.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great,
any questions about portals?

95
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.410
So this is useful for things like
modals but it also could be useful for

96
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.530
like, maybe you have, again,
like a contextual navigation or

97
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.250
something like that,
you could handle that with a portal.

98
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.820
You could handle a special header or

99
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.740
a special footer or
lots of things like that.

100
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.130
At Netflix, we used portals to render
into the player because the player was

101
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.206
a separate thing, so there's a bunch
of cool stuff you could do with them.

102
00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.274
This used to be impossible,

103
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.415
it used to be impossible to
handle these kinds of things.

104
00:08:29.415 --> 00:08:33.228
We actually had to build this crazy
special render that Netflix only used for

105
00:08:33.228 --> 00:08:34.606
a long time to handle that.
