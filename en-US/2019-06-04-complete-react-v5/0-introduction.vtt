00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Welcome to
the Complete Intro to React V5,

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.050
I am stoked to be back
here teaching this again.

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.480
This is my favorite course.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.374
I'll probably repeat that like
17 times today, it's prophetic.

5
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the complete Intro to React,

6
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.370
this is gonna go over the entirety
of like how to write React.

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.259
And we go over all the latest features,
which is gonna be things like hooks.

8
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.279
And it's gonna be all the new fun that
comes with that such as context and

9
00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.760
portals and
all sorts of really cool stuff.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.890
And updating some of those things
from the version four of this course.

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.682
As well it's gonna be going over some
of the other APIs like classes and

12
00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.051
life cycles and things like that.

13
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:45.134
So you get a handle on
all that kind of stuff.

14
00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:49.863
The first thing I want you to do is,
I want you to head to this bit.ly so

15
00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:53.638
B I T L Y /react-v5 and
should land on this page here.

16
00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:56.071
Just so you know,
these are my course notes,

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:58.258
this is what we're gonna be going over.

18
00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:02.436
So I have another Surface right here,
that's all I have up here.

19
00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:05.843
So if you fall behind or
you need to come up to date or

20
00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:09.429
anything like that,
you can just read this as well.

21
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.068
Okay?

22
00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:16.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

23
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:20.810
do not have to have taken the previous
versions of this course to watch V5,

24
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.860
right this is actually it's V5 in
the sense that it's the fifth iteration.

25
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.580
So you start from zero, you don't have to
watch any of the other ones to get here.

26
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.480
That being said, V3 actually is still
useful if you need to talk about web pack.

27
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.430
If you need to talk about react router, or

28
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.350
any of those things, everything in
V3 is still very much up to date.

29
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.758
So that's out there if you need
some of those things as well.

30
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:50.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is meant
to be mostly modular, right?

31
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.600
So that you can kinda skip
from lesson to lesson,

32
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.680
but the way that you have to do
that is moving between git commits.

33
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.150
So if I go to
github.com/BTholt/complete-intro-to-react-

34
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.991
-V5, there's a link to it as
well in the course notes.

35
00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:14.794
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Repo.

36
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The repo is here,
right there.

37
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.570
So if you go to this page and you scroll
down to where it says the repo is here and

38
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.009
you click on that it will take you to
here, which is the repo for the course.

39
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.000
And inside of here,
you can click on the commits.

40
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.350
And you can see all of the commits for
this project, right.

41
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.750
So each section of this course
moves forward in one commit.

42
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.230
So you can see if you
click on one of these,

43
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.020
you can see what's been added right?

44
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.830
Or if you click on one of these,
you can see that this got deleted or

45
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.750
this got updated or something like that.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.921
So this will actually be really helpful
to show you the divs between each part of

47
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.652
the course if you need to
walk through that as well.

48
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:03.845
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to start in the
middle of one of these, you can actually

49
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:08.310
just say I want to start with useState and
custom hooks and things like that.

50
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.060
There's actually a program
out here called Sourcetree,

51
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.010
that I'm going to suggest that you get.

52
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.930
You can get the Sourcetreeapp.com.

53
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.050
I already have it installed.

54
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.030
And if you clone the repo and
point Sourcetree to it, no,

55
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.260
why would I update this.

56
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.315
Skip version.

57
00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:27.340
[LAUGH] Just kidding.

58
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.700
Update all of your things.

59
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.440
But, so you can see here I have
this open here in Sourcetree.

60
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.410
So if I wanna go back
to this commit in time,

61
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.040
I can actually just say right-click
on here and say Checkout.

62
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.830
It's gonna say,
are you sure you want to do this?

63
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.920
Right, so first of all, this will blow
away any changes that you have made.

64
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.241
So be be careful of that, right?

65
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:48.850
But I'm gonna say okay.

66
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.320
And this will actually move me
back to that commit, right?

67
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.640
So now my repo will be in that state,
and I can keep going forward, right?

68
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.185
But if wanna move forward again,

69
00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.623
I can just say I wanna go to
where we add React router.

70
00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:02.315
We can see all the divs down here as well.

71
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.426
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I can just right-click
on this and say checkout.

72
00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.044
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now I will be up here.

73
00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:16.826
And then ultimately the last commit
in here that's you're interested

74
00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:20.580
in is that theme context
that's the end of this course.

75
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.110
So that's like the what the state of
the master branch is in right now.

76
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.690
All of these other branches are for
intermediate React

77
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.025
which you can also watch that later
after you're done with this course.

78
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.557
So that's really helpful as well.

79
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:37.351
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

80
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.732
Going back to the page here.

81
00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:45.940
You'll also see these,
branches things with that.

82
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.700
Those will tell you where
there are commit points right.

83
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.390
But I'll be very forthcoming and

84
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.480
calling out this is the commit
that you need to go forward.

85
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.247
I'll tell you which commit
message you wanna go forward to.

86
00:04:58.135 --> 00:04:59.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
Sourcetree is really great.

87
00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.070
If you know how to use git on
the commandline, you can also use that.

88
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.450
You can also use GitHub Desktop.

89
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.106
I just showed you Source Tree,

90
00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:07.979
because I think that's
the easiest one to start using.

91
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.712
I'd also suggest Git In-depth,

92
00:05:10.712 --> 00:05:13.740
which is a course from
Nino Zacharenko on Frontend Masters.

93
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.889
It's a fantastic course that you should
take that'll teach you everything you need

94
00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:17.607
to know about Git.

95
00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:23.538
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where to file issues,
this course is obviously gonna have some

96
00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:26.460
mistakes and it's gonna have spelling
errors and things like that.

97
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.305
I would,
if you could open a pull request or

98
00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:30.470
file an issue that would
be super helpful as well.

99
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.010
This lovely forehead is mine.

100
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.960
Who am I?

101
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.680
So my name is Brian Holt.

102
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.440
I am a Senior Program Manager
at Microsoft.

103
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.088
I work on JavaScript on Azure and Visual
Studio Code, but for the most part my

104
00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:56.312
job is to make Azure a place that you
want to deploy your node.js code.

105
00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:59.420
I'm frequently here in Frontend Masters,
I love it here.

106
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.723
I'll never teach on probably
any other platform again.

107
00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:07.113
And I'm really grateful for
them to keep inviting me back and for

108
00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:09.157
everything they do for that.

109
00:06:09.157 --> 00:06:13.588
I'm also sometimes on Frontend Happy Hour,
which is a podcast where it's descriptive,

110
00:06:13.588 --> 00:06:15.700
we get drunk and we talk about JavaScript.

111
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.039
Previously I was a staff
engineer at LinkedIn,

112
00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.053
I've been a senior engineer at Netflix and
Reddit.

113
00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:27.910
I also worked at these smaller Salt Lake
City based companies Needle and KSL and

114
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.580
New Skin.

115
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.830
I'm also on the board of Vets Who Code,

116
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.620
which I think is a fantastic organization
worth your time and donations.

117
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.206
And I also co-founded
with another friend and

118
00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:41.388
master Sarah Dresner
a conference called Concatenate,

119
00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:45.313
which is the biggest JavaScript
conference that we know of in Africa.

120
00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:50.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just some more about me.

121
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.750
I live in Seattle with my wife and my dog.

122
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.750
As you'll see throughout this
course I absolutely love dogs.

123
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.690
I have a little Havanese and
she's adorable.

124
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.090
And I love to travel.

125
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.000
I've been to 40 or
50 countries at this point.

126
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.060
I took 97 flights last year.

127
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.100
That's an interesting fact.

128
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.702
Took the flu almost 300,000 miles.

129
00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:12.070
I will never do that again.

130
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.170
And please catch up with me on Twitter,
Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn.

131
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.720
If you add me to LinkedIn I'll
definitely add you back.

132
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.310
So no worries there.

133
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.120
Why was this course created?

134
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.350
I just want to give a huge shout to
the crew here at Frontend Masters.

135
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.720
They've been amazing to work with, and

136
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.950
one of my favorite things about that is
that this course is actually open source.

137
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.770
So this website that you're looking at
here, please share it with everyone.

138
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.230
I love that they allow me to come in and
do these courses and

139
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.430
have these trainings and pay me to do it.

140
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.500
And at the same time,

141
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.370
allow me to open source these so
that they're available to everyone.

142
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.380
I think the videos are great.

143
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.690
That's why I put a lot
of time into these and

144
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.060
that's why I think we can charge for them.

145
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.991
But I think that that knowledge
should be freely shared.

146
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:01.442
And I'm really grateful that
Frontend Masters encourages me to do these

147
00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:02.010
kind of things.

148
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.300
And last thing here, if you wanna start
the repo on GitHub that would be great.

149
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.680
It strokes my ego and that's
the important part, [LAUGH] just kidding.

150
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.834
It does help it get farther reach
which is always a good thing as well.

151
00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:22.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And with that, yeah, we'll
start getting into learning some React.
