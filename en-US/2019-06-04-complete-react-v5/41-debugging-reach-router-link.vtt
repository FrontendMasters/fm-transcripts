00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.198
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now, what's cool here,
if I go into details,

2
00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:06.021
I'm gonna show you just
kinda a fun trick here.

3
00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:08.190
So we're gonna take in the props here.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.750
And I wanna see what's actually
coming in from the props.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.530
One, probably just use the dev tools,
cuz that's the easiest way to do it.

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.320
But I'm gonna show you
another kind of fun trick

7
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.259
that I did actually learn
from Ryan Florence.

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.496
So, I'm gonna say JSON.stringify(prop,

9
00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:36.870
snull, 4)
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, I used pre and code.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
So, pre as in preformatted and code and
this is going to be code, right?

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.800
And I put JSON stringify, so
this is gonna take props and

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.640
put it into like a nice
pretty printed kinda way.

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.230
So now if I go in here and I go to
/details/ something like that, right?

14
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.750
Now this might be a little hard for

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.480
you to see but I can see everything
that's coming in from the routers.

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.610
The routers actually giving
a pretty substantial amount of

17
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.610
information to you, right?

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.230
So, it's giving you the path,
the ID, right?

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.730
Notice the ID matches this ID up here,

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.940
as in if I change it here,
notice it will change down here as well.

21
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.840
The URI and then a bunch of stuff location
like but the port is the hash ,the

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.310
state that's all coming in from
the history package, if you're curious.

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.670
So, if you do this,

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.150
the pre formatted in code with JSON string
if I would with obviously any object in

25
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.030
here, this will give you a nice
pretty printed view of the props.

26
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.670
And this is also useful for
doing with state as well,

27
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.400
if you wanna see how state and
props are changing over time.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.340
It's just a nice little
debugging technique to

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.470
dump something out to the dom.

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.820
Largely I could also just go,
if I just did Inspect element and

31
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.340
looked at the React devtools here.

32
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.110
I could see the exact same information.

33
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.927
So here in Details, that same information
is available on the right of my screen.

34
00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:04.900
You don't need to read it, but
just know that it's there.

35
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.940
Also, look how many components reach
their outputs in there, it's quite a lot.

36
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.840
You'll see this a lot with libraries
because they have to have multiple

37
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.610
different layers to capture different
parts of it, and that's pretty typical.

38
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.379
I don't write code like this
where you separate it out into

39
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.548
various different behaviors, like this one
has like a location, location provider,

40
00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:33.241
right or implementation, focus handler,
focus handled implementation.

41
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.191
There's a lot going on here.

42
00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:40.646
&gt;&gt; Brian: But
you'll see that a lot in libraries,

43
00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:44.353
which is when this search
functionality becomes useful.

44
00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:46.929
So I can just search for
details and I can find it.

45
00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:52.309
&gt;&gt; Brian: Good, any questions?

46
00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:00.573
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, let's make it so

47
00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:05.516
that when you click this Adopt Me that
it will take you back to the home page,

48
00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:10.236
cuz most people expect that rise, so
I want to show you how to use a link.

49
00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:13.668
So we'll leave this like this for
now and we'll fix it in just a second.

50
00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:18.077
We're gonna go back to app.js and

51
00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:23.101
we're going to wrap this h1 in a link.

52
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:29.441
So I'm going to put link, and again
I'm going to use the auto import here.

53
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:35.636
Notice that imported that up
here at reach router on line 3.

54
00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:37.877
And I'll just close that.

55
00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:42.167
And I'm gonna say Link to =/, and

56
00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:48.317
then inside of that link,
I'm gonna put this h1.

57
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:00.440
&gt;&gt; Brian: And actually let's go ahead and
do it this way.

58
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.451
Let's just,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Get rid of all

59
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:08.104
the step around link, I'm gonna
actually put this inside of the header.

60
00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:17.327
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like that.

61
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.861
&gt;&gt; Brian: So all I did here is
I deleted the h1 totally, and

62
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:29.734
then I put header, and
then inside of that I put a link.

63
00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:32.559
This link is ultimately
gonna end up being an A tag,

64
00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:36.831
but the nice thing about using a link
instead of A is that, reach-router will

65
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:41.324
handle all of the various different
routing mechanisms for you automatically.

66
00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:44.760
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.821
So just line 11 through 13, there.

68
00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:55.516
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?
So let's go take a look at this, so

69
00:04:55.516 --> 00:04:58.747
now you can see here
that if I click on it,

70
00:04:58.747 --> 00:05:02.377
it'll take me back to the homepage, right?

71
00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:13.845
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right, this is mostly what
I wanted to show you about reach-router.

72
00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:16.443
There's a couple other things that
we'll kinda sprinkle in here for

73
00:05:16.443 --> 00:05:18.830
the rest of the course, but
this is like the crux of it.

74
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.050
The routers in and of itself
doesn't have to be very complicated

75
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.090
&gt;&gt; Brian: So there's a commit point here.

76
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.250
The commit that you wanna roll up to
if you wanna get to this point is,

77
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.010
github btholt complete v5, Commits.

78
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.499
We are at Add reach router, right?

79
00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:45.892
So we just did that one,
