00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.285
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's address
'React' is undefined but never used.

2
00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:08.360
Well, that's not actually true
if you think about it, right?

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.533
What is div being transpiled to?

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.897
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, it's being
transpiled to React.createElement, right?

5
00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:19.245
Which means that React is being used.

6
00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.966
So anywhere that you have jsx,
you actually have to have React in scope,

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.501
that's a hard requirement.

8
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:29.634
And the reason being is everything's
being transpiled to React.createElement.

9
00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:33.197
But eslint doesn't know that.

10
00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:38.363
So it's saying you're importing this and
never using it, so what the hell?

11
00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:40.886
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go actually fix that.

12
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.231
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll just do
that right now, really quick.

13
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:51.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So come back to your,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Desktop right here,

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.578
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And say npm install -D

15
00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:07.698
babel-eslint eslint-plugin-import

16
00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:13.962
eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

17
00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:19.298
eslint-plugin-react.

18
00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:23.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's a few things, but

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.790
we need all of these tools to make sure
that it understands React correctly.

20
00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:30.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll give you
a second to type that out.

21
00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:38.332
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's talk about what these packages are.

22
00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:45.205
babel-eslint allows eslint to be augmented
by Babel, which is the transpiler, right?

23
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:50.625
So out-of-the-box, typically,
it doesn't understand React super well.

24
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.906
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's what babel-eslint does.

25
00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:59.199
esIint-plugin-import gives you some
new rules around importing and

26
00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:04.593
exporting things, just so you have
good habits with that kind of stuff.

27
00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:10.697
eslint-plugin-jsx-accessibility, which
is what a11y stands for,

28
00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:17.005
is just a bunch of kind of no-brainer
things to do for accessibility, right?

29
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:22.847
Like, don't make divs clickable,
right, for example.

30
00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:25.666
This will just kind of help
you catch those really

31
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.676
easy accessibility things to do.

32
00:02:27.676 --> 00:02:32.483
And eslint-plugin-react is going to
actually help us with some other

33
00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:35.536
additional React rules that we need, okay?

34
00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:36.805
So install all that stuff.

35
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.952
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And while it's installing,
we're gonna go to our package.json.

36
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:51.472
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or not package.json,
rather, but our eslint plugin,

37
00:02:51.472 --> 00:02:52.478
this one here.

38
00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:57.426
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's put this on multiple lines, so

39
00:02:57.426 --> 00:02:59.259
it'll be a little bit easier to read.

40
00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:06.404
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

41
00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:12.772
underneath eslint:recommended,
the order of these is not super important.

42
00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:16.695
The only thing is the two prettier
ones have to come at the end, right?

43
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.692
So everything above it can be
in whatever order we want.

44
00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:22.613
These one just have to come at the end
because all these two rules do is turn

45
00:03:22.613 --> 00:03:23.781
things off, right?

46
00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:26.373
And you need them to be last so
that they're off, right?

47
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:30.239
Whereas if I put eslint:recommended first,
the last thing that will happen will be

48
00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.807
turning things on that
prettier's trying to turn off.

49
00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:41.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the first one's
gonna be plugin:import/errors.

50
00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:47.772
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: plugin:react/recommended.

51
00:03:50.169 --> 00:04:00.115
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
plugin:jsx- a11y/recommended, like that.

52
00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:08.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so this is just gonna
be a bunch of rules that are gonna coming

53
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.599
in from those plugins that we installed.

54
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.771
We're gonna install
a couple of plugins here.

55
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:19.177
One of them is gonna be react,
one of them is gonna be import,

56
00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:23.003
and one of them is going to be jsx-a11y.

57
00:04:28.328 --> 00:04:31.487
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
extends our sets of rules, right, and

58
00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:35.108
plugins are new abilities for
eslint, right?

59
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:39.809
So import, this is going to allow
it to associate that if this file

60
00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.575
exports something,
this other file can import it.

61
00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.995
And if it doesn't export, then it can't
be imported somewhere else, right?

62
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.787
That's kind of what import does.

63
00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:53.418
This is going to do some more abilities
with understanding accessibility.

64
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.959
And react is going to fix a lot
of our React problems, okay?

65
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:03.871
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then we're gonna
have another one here called rules.

66
00:05:07.503 --> 00:05:09.887
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is where we can
actually turn on and off specific rules.

67
00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:12.672
We're not gonna be doing prop-types today.

68
00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:20.047
So go ahead and turn off react/prop-types,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is what 0 does,

69
00:05:20.047 --> 00:05:20.792
it turns it off.

70
00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:28.172
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: prop-types
are like a very weak type

71
00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:30.866
checking that React can do for you.

72
00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:37.072
We're gonna get to TypeScript later
in the intermediate React workshop.

73
00:05:37.072 --> 00:05:41.745
So prop-types are a useful
when you're using TypeScript.

74
00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:48.174
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then another one,
we're gonna say, no-console, that one,

75
00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:49.920
just turn that one on 1.

76
00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:52.287
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whoops.

77
00:05:54.503 --> 00:05:59.055
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I frequently use
console.log to debug things, right?

78
00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:03.951
And so if you have no-console enabled,
it will not let you, and

79
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.954
it will error out on that.

80
00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:08.797
Whereas 1 will be a warning, right, so

81
00:06:08.797 --> 00:06:12.739
it'll be green underlined
instead of red underlined.

82
00:06:14.544 --> 00:06:19.057
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so those are the two
that we're gonna turn on right now.

83
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then down here we
gotta do one more thing, one of them is

84
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:31.404
underneath env, here, settings,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And react.

85
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:39.538
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you have to
tell eslint which version of React

86
00:06:39.538 --> 00:06:40.954
you're using.

87
00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:45.018
But you can also just say,
can you just figure it out yourself?

88
00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:46.991
So that's what detect does.

89
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which means it'll
figure it out from your package.json.

90
00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:56.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
at this point I'll tell you,

91
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.025
this is my React config that I
use on almost all my projects.

92
00:07:01.457 --> 00:07:05.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's pretty good.

93
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:09.750
The one thing I'll say here is eslint
react/recommended has some rules that I

94
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.582
don't necessarily agree with.

95
00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:14.669
And I think we'll actually end up
turning a few more of them off later.

96
00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.058
So just because react/recommended
says something is a rule,

97
00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:21.389
you can question it a little bit.

98
00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.214
Whereas don't question anything
in eslint:recommended,

99
00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:26.231
that's gospel truth right there, right?

100
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:29.107
That one you can just,
everything it says is great.

101
00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:32.299
react/recommended, you can
question what's in there.

102
00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:34.529
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

103
00:07:36.906 --> 00:07:38.989
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, if I save that,

104
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:43.280
you'll notice now that
this is not red anymore.

105
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.938
And actually if I comment it, it's gonna
say, hey, React has to be in scope or

106
00:07:47.938 --> 00:07:49.927
this isn't gonna work, right?

107
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.020
So it's actually gonna help you
out with more React stuff now.
