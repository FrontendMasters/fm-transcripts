00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are going
to create one more file here.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.700
This is going to be a gitignore file.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.556
So inside of your source directory,
create a file called .gitignore.

4
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:18.427
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

5
00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:20.075
Not inside your source one,

6
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:23.996
this is going to go inside of your
root directory inside of adopt me.

7
00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:31.297
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
here if you are not familiar with get,

8
00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.436
this is just telling get is like,
here is a bunch of stuff,

9
00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:37.279
I don't want you to keep
a track of inside of my repo.

10
00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:40.711
Okay, so .getignore yes use dot.

11
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.687
So the first thing you never
want to track is node modules,

12
00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:47.411
because that's why you can npm
install them wherever you want, right?

13
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:54.765
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then also if you're on
Mac you should always ignore DS_Store,

14
00:00:54.765 --> 00:01:01.610
which is a file that Mac creates for
dumb reasons, let's not talk about it.

15
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.550
Let's just say that they're dumb reasons.

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.190
And then for later parts of the course,
you're going to ignore your cache.

17
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.390
You're going to ignore dist.

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.910
You're going to ignore coverage.

19
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.940
You can ignore the dot VS Code
directory or not, that one's up to you.

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.020
It's just where VS Code keeps track of all
your personal preferences for the project,

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.460
and then you're also going
to ignore the .emv file.

22
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.660
So this is just telling VS Code, ignore
all this stuff, never commit this stuff.

23
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.411
This is stuff that I just have for
me and not to be put in my get

24
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:46.071
repo
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

25
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.450
so there's another commit point here.

26
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.530
So if you fell people behind the tooling
you can feel free to just jump up to

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.060
this commit.

28
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.750
It's something called like add npm
scripts and ES Lint and prettier and

29
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.990
things like that.
