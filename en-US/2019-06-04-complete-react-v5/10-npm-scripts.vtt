00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: First thing here that we
wanna do is we're gonna install Prettier,

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.490
and I'm gonna show you how to
run it from the command line.

3
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.280
So inside of your package.json,
there's a thing called scripts.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.580
Here we have one called test, which we
don't have any tests for this project yet,

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.500
so we don't have anything like that.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.740
But you can see here that it'll run echo,
no test specified.

7
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.870
So if I say npm run test, right?

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.751
It's gonna run whatever is in here, and

9
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:30.260
it's gonna echo error no test specified,
right?

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.450
So you can see right there error,
no test specified.

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.427
So that's what this script is for,
it allows you to put some sort of Bash, or

12
00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:41.300
ZSH, or PowerShell command in here.

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.650
And then it'll run that whenever
you say npm run test, or format, or

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.330
whatever you put inside of here.

15
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.160
So we can put anything in here.

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.652
I'm gonna put one called format.

17
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:59.841
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what format is going
to do is it's gonna say prettier, so

18
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:05.117
it's gonna run this prettier,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

19
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:09.099
we're gonna run it on everything
inside of our source directory.

20
00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:14.174
So src/, and then we'll say

21
00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:19.250
*., what do I have in here?

22
00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:29.807
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, *./*.,

23
00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:34.592
and then we'll put

24
00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:39.976
here {js.html},

25
00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:42.975
like that.

26
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.763
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then you
actually might have to put,

27
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:51.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Backslash, like this,

28
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.078
like this, okay.

29
00:01:56.383 --> 00:02:01.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what this is gonna do is
this is going to run Prettier on any file

30
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.548
and any directory,
that's what this **/* means,

31
00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:11.110
inside of the source directory that
has either a JS or an HTML extension.

32
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.050
You need the backslashes here because
this'll pass it into Prettier and

33
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.050
it allows Prettier to resolve this rather
than having Bash resolve it for you.

34
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.094
And then you come here at the end.

35
00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.254
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so if I run this,
it's actually not gonna write to it, so

36
00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.299
I should be able to say npm run format.

37
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you see that
it's actually printing it out,

38
00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:41.312
which is not what I want,
I want it to actually write.

39
00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:44.606
So what we're gonna do here
is we're gonna say --write.

40
00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:55.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see there now
I have src/app.js and src/index.html.

41
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:00.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is helpful because
there's gonna be someone on your team that

42
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.066
doesn't want to integrate
with your work flow.

43
00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.975
So this allows them to just run this
command right before they commit and

44
00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:05.993
then push it up, right,

45
00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:08.529
because you want everyone reading
this command on your team.
