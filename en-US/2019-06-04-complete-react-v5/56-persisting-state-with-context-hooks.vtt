00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I got one more
thing I wanna show you here.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.120
And I wanna show you how to
update the the theme, right?

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.680
So far, I've just shown you how
to read from the theme, but

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.260
we also wanna be able to update the theme.

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.013
So I want you to go back to
SearchParams as well, SearchParams.

6
00:00:19.013 --> 00:00:24.863
We're going to make another Dropdown,
underneath BreedDropdown here.

7
00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:30.861
We're gonna say label htmlFor= location.

8
00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:36.747
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry,
not location but theme rather.

9
00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:43.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna have a Theme there, and

10
00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:45.680
we're gonna have a select.

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.020
And the value is going to equal theme.

12
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.974
And onChange,
we're going to set the theme,

13
00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:07.458
so setTheme to be e.target.value,
and same thing for onBlur.

14
00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:20.081
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go grab
setTheme here, cuz up here at the top,

15
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.238
we have theme, and
we're not grabbing setTheme.

16
00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:28.550
So all I have to put here is setTheme
to grab that out of the ThemeContext.

17
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.120
Cuz again, this is just a hook, right?

18
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.110
It's a normal hook, but
the hook lives in-app.

19
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.398
It doesn't actually live in SearchParams.

20
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:43.398
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then we have the select here.

21
00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:48.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,
we're just gonna give a couple of options.

22
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.819
So here's ones that I gave, peru,
cuz that's such a lovely color,

23
00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:03.511
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: darkblue,

24
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.328
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: darkblue,

25
00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:11.788
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: mediumorchid,

26
00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:13.294
cuz that's a color.

27
00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:20.618
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or what's another good one?

28
00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:21.880
What do I have here?

29
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.457
chartreuse, that's a color.

30
00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:33.831
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, a lot people will
probably wonder why don't we just use

31
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.960
Dropdown again,
this looks like a Dropdown.

32
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.650
The reason why we're not using Dropdown is
cuz Dropdown creates its own hooks, right?

33
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.880
And we're actually using
someone else's hook.

34
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.510
We're using apps hooks,
we're not using SearchParams hooks.

35
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.504
So that's why we're not gonna
use our use Dropdown hook here.

36
00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.008
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, is that working?

37
00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:10.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That should be good.

38
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.290
Let's go take a look and see if it works.

39
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.400
So now I have a new
Dropdown here with Theme.

40
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.033
If I change this to be Medium Orchid,
right,

41
00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:27.403
that's a nice Medium Orchid I suppose,
or Chartreuse, or Peru.

42
00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:29.510
But here is the interesting part of this.

43
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.680
If this was just a normal hook, as soon
as I navigated to the details page,

44
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.770
I'll leave the code up here
while I'm explaining this.

45
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.030
As soon as I navigated to the details
page, right, it would drop that, right?

46
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.240
Because the component would get unmounted
and all of its hooks would be destroyed.

47
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.040
So it would go back to its default state
next time you went back to it, right?

48
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.280
By the same token,

49
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.990
it would not update necessarily
the details page either, right?

50
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.205
But because now this lives in-app, right,
and in-app is always rendered, right?

51
00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.370
In-app never unrenders.

52
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.583
So the advantage of this is now the state
will live beyond page navigations.

53
00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let me demonstrate
my point to you here, right?

54
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.740
Let's change this to be Medium Orchid,
right?

55
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.523
And if I go to the details page here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's blue, why is it blue?

56
00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:21.507
It should stay.

57
00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,
that's not what's supposed to happen.

58
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.107
That ruins my point.

59
00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:35.209
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SetTheme,

60
00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:20.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: darkblue,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then you go back to

61
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.618
the homepage.

62
00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:34.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Peru, and then navigate.

63
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.610
It's fully unmounting the page,
that's really interesting.

64
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.789
So I'm not sure why it's
fully unmounting the page.

65
00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.181
I have to go look.

66
00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:47.270
But you can see it's actually clearing the
console every single time that I navigate.

67
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.125
So that's fine.

68
00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:55.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What is the link there?

69
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.510
That's the link coming from Pet.

70
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.582
This is why.

71
00:06:01.582 --> 00:06:04.450
I don't know why we didn't
ever end up updating this.

72
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.780
Let's go ahead and update it now.

73
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.181
So here inside of pet.js
we want to import Link

74
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:20.720
from @reach/router,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

75
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're gonna change this a right

76
00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:31.108
here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Instead of being an a,

77
00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:33.040
we're gonna make it a link.

78
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.105
Instead of an href,
we're gonna make this to.

79
00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.826
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, and

80
00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:43.790
we just change this from being a normal
anchor tag to being a link tag.

81
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.690
And now, whereas before it was actually
doing a full page navigation was changing

82
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.300
the page, right?

83
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.910
So it was destroying the dom and
then rebuilding it again.

84
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.675
Now, it's actually going to use
HTML history to navigate the pages.

85
00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.365
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now if I just change this to Orchid, and

86
00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:09.393
then I go to Fat Boy Slim here,
notice that it's still Orchid.

87
00:07:14.668 --> 00:07:15.649
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

88
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.396
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did it also make
sense the error that I had?

89
00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:23.503
It's probably good that you saw that error
because that's what you'll see if you

90
00:07:23.503 --> 00:07:26.496
accidentally forget to use a link tag,
instead of an a tag.

91
00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:29.246
It's another thing that
[INAUDIBLE] is doing for you.

92
00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:33.832
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This error wouldn't present
itself if we use the navigate though,

93
00:07:33.832 --> 00:07:34.401
right?

94
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, yeah,
navigate would also use history as well.

95
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.730
This is purely if you use a, right?

96
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.790
So redirect would handle it correctly,
navigate would work correctly.

97
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.752
It's just purely if you use a.

98
00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:50.844
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question,
other questions?

99
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: With the hooks kind of
utilizing the array destructuring,

100
00:07:57.619 --> 00:08:01.590
if you for some reason wanted
to pull out the updater, but

101
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.420
not use the current state somewhere,
is there a convention for doing that?

102
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.845
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Typically,
you just put an underscore,

103
00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:13.030
eslint is still gonna yell at you.

104
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.430
And the way that you just
disable the line, right?

105
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:21.090
So what he's asking if I have a hook here,
let's just say const

106
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.725
blah equal, or blah and setBlah, right,

107
00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:33.510
= useState with blah, obviously.

108
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.490
Like this, what happens if I don't
actually care what blah is right now,

109
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.940
I just wanna update blah, right?

110
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.669
How would I do that?

111
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.090
This is what I would do, I would put an
underscore there just to signify to myself

112
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.160
that I'm not using this,
this is worthless.

113
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.107
It's the same thing I'll
do with parameters as well.

114
00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:54.644
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But eslint is gonna
say this is unused variable and

115
00:08:54.644 --> 00:09:02.942
I don't like that, so the way you can just
do that is just say eslint-disable line.

116
00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:08.951
And you can actually tell it to
disable specifically no unused vars,

117
00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:11.550
no-unused-vars, right?

118
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.141
And then it will specifically
disable that for that line.

119
00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:17.208
