00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:03.419
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now we're gonna write some code in here.

2
00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.430
Instead of our script tag,
I'm gonna say const.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.640
App.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.452
Equals an arrow function.

5
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:19.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So some of you might be
mystified by this hieroglyphic here.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
This is what's called a font ligature.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.480
So, I have a special font to make
it beautiful that I've installed

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.060
that when I have certain characters that
are next to each other, it combines them.

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.770
It's pretty, so that's why I do it.

10
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.370
It also supposedly less cognitive overhead
parts one character instead of two.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.330
Blah, blah, blah.

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.280
I do it because I think it looks nice.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.936
So if I put space here, you'll see
that it's actually in equal signs and

14
00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:48.390
an angle bracket, but
if you put them together it's get that.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.970
So I'm just gonna show you very quickly
how to do that cuz I frequently get asked

16
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.220
on how do I get that for myself.

17
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.907
The name of this font that I'm
using is called Dank Mono.

18
00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:00.086
I didn't name it,
that's exactly what it's called.

19
00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:06.100
At Dank.sh, these wonderful people
actually sponsored concatenate or

20
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.110
our conference so shout out to them.

21
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.206
This is a $50 font for
the sake it's 40 pounds now,

22
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.744
which is I guess more than $50.

23
00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:20.285
So you can get that if you want to.

24
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:21.967
You spent a lot of time looking at font,
so

25
00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:24.965
that might be something to consider I
get no kick back from this by the way.

26
00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:26.014
I'm just a fan.

27
00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:28.774
But, if you don't wanna pay for one,

28
00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:32.579
there's another one called
FIRA Code that is free.

29
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.758
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this very nice
person has done that for you.

30
00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:41.560
And there are ways to install it.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.180
So how to install,
you can get that down here.

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.860
I got it off which is
the easy way to do it.

33
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.330
So, FiraCode would be the other one.

34
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.420
Okay, so once you have one of those
installed, the way that you put that into

35
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.590
VS code is, I'm gonna open my settings so,
preferences,

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.209
settings here, or you can hit command
comma, whatever that would be for windows.

37
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.400
Okay, so you have to change two things.

38
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.770
One of them you have to
change is your front.

39
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.960
So here, I have Dank Mono first and
FiraCode second,

40
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.930
it works just like a CSS right, so it'll
get the first one that I can find, okay.

41
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.150
And then you can see here
Editor Font Ligatures,

42
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.970
you have to enable that as well.

43
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.580
Right, so that'll allow the actual
combining of characters.

44
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.621
So if I go back to, don't save

45
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:42.136
over my,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So like

46
00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:47.181
if I were to turn off ligatures right now,
you can see here that I have this arrow.

47
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:51.199
But if I turned it off,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You'll see that it gets

48
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.872
separated again.

49
00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.330
So, cool.

50
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.810
So that's how you enable ligatures.
