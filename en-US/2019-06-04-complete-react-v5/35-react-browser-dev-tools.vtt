00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Last thing I wanna
talk about here is dev tools,

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.298
which are absolutely essential.

3
00:00:05.813 --> 00:00:12.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I would just invite
you to google React dev tools and

4
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:16.170
then just put Chrome or Firefox.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm on Firefox, obviously, so.

6
00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.426
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here it
says React Dev Tools, and

7
00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:26.806
I'm sure there's one for,
Google Chrome's right there anyway.

8
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.747
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you just come in
here and you say I already have them,

9
00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:33.930
you can see them right up here for
me, right?

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.931
But Chrome as well, you just click that,
and you'll install that on Chrome.

11
00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think these
are the only two that exist right now.

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
Edge doesn't have them, and Safari,
I think they got rid of them.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.540
So you either have to be on Firefox or
Chrome to have them.

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.410
The new Edge will have it,
the Edgium, as it were.

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.500
Okay, and let me show you
a little bit how to use this.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380
So this is a React application.

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.162
You can see up there that it has React
in developer mode because it's in red.

18
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.412
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I can open my dev tools here, and

19
00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:12.690
I have a new React tab right there.

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.806
So I'll click on that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now I have

21
00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:24.020
a DOM explorer, and I can explore as
if I was exploring a DOM tree, right?

22
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.096
So you can see StrictMode there, an app,

23
00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:32.298
then I can see my searchParams thing and
I can highlight it, right?

24
00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:34.690
And it will show me that
component on the page.

25
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.830
Inside of that I can see the drop downs.

26
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.150
And what's cool is here,
do I have anything passing params around?

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.840
I don't really.

28
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.540
But you can see here,
you can see some of the props here.

29
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.140
I can see all the children that it has,
it's

30
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.510
a useful kind of DOM explorer for
a React application, right?

31
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.140
Let's say I have a big application
I need to find drop down, so

32
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.190
I can just type in here, drop down,

33
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.100
and it'll actually search for
drop down there, which is useful as well.

34
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.820
I can click this thing right here, and I
can figure out where this is coming from,

35
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.360
so I can find this input and
click on that.

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.310
And it's like, okay,
this is the input you're looking for.

37
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.200
I can see the properties that
it's getting, the change handler,

38
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.290
the placeholder value,
and so on and so forth.

39
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.460
Something else cool you can do,
let's say I'm just on the page here and

40
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.540
I want to find this
Submit button right here.

41
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.230
So you can right-click on it,

42
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.634
say Inspect Element,
just like you normally would, right?

43
00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:42.930
This will take you to the inspector, but

44
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.330
if I click on the React dev tools,
it will still be highlighted, right?

45
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.740
And then last thing here,
I can actually go into the console, and

46
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.190
if I wanna mess around with it,
I can put $R, and

47
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.230
whatever is selected in the React dev
tools will be $R inside of my console.

48
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.504
So I can programmatically
manipulate it there as well.

49
00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:12.894
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And just so you know,

50
00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:15.240
you can actually do that
with the inspector as well.

51
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.518
So if I click on that and I put $0,

52
00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:24.560
you can do that with just
the normal inspector as well.

53
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.403
And I think you can do $1,
that might be a Chrome-only thing, but

54
00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:31.870
that'll grab the previous thing
that you have grabbed, right?

55
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.810
So the dev tools are very very
helpful in doing React applications,

56
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.030
something you wanna have installed for
sure.

57
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.283
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we're voting
the production version of the site,

58
00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:50.439
I get a warning when I click
on the icon for the tools,

59
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.225
warning that we're using the production
belt or the development belt.

60
00:03:56.225 --> 00:04:00.340
Is that the development belt of
the tools or development belt of React?

61
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.238
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where are you seeing that?

62
00:04:03.238 --> 00:04:07.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In your extensions,
clicking on that.

63
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so what's it?

64
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.471
If I go to Netflix.com,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

65
00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:23.737
homepage is built using
the production build of React, right?

66
00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:26.270
So it's just letting you know hey,

67
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.210
you're in development mode, you should
not be shipping this to production.

68
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.610
It's okay to have in your developing
environment, as you should,

69
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.700
but this is what you should see
when you go into production.

70
00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:39.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Isn't Parcel transpiling and
munifying everything, and then what

71
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.790
we're rendering here, what we have
opened is the production version or no?

72
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.404
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's still the development
version, which is what you want, right?

73
00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:51.100
Cuz if I didn't have
the development environment,

74
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.430
then I wouldn't get all the useful
error messages that React has for you.

75
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.911
It would just say an error happened,
and good luck, right?

76
00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:02.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Instead of saying
this broke at this line in this way.

77
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.289
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.520
So even though we're running it out of
the dist folder, it's not production.

79
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

80
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I'll show you
how to build it for production later.

81
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thanks.
