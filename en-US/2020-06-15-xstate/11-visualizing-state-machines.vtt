00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.170
One of the benefits of xstate is that you
could actually visualize these machines.

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.784
And so if we click xstate.js.org/viz,

3
00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:14.507
you'll see an example over here.

4
00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:17.398
This is the default
machine that's created and

5
00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:22.790
you'll see a representation of this
machine right here in the visualizer.

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.260
So in fact, let's take a look at this
service machine and invisualize it.

7
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.583
I'm just gonna copy, well, everything
except the creates over here just

8
00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:39.750
because that's newer syntax, and
I'm gonna put that right over here.

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.512
So now when we click Update it
will show us our feedback form.

10
00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.088
Now what's great about this is is you
could actually play around with this

11
00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:50.490
visualization.

12
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.050
So if I click that, we can see visually
that it goes to the form states.

13
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.759
If I click Submit over here,
we could see that it goes to thanks, and

14
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.356
then once I click Close,
it goes to closed which is a final state.

15
00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:07.032
Which you might remember means
nothing happens in this state,

16
00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.880
so we can't really exit from the state.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.630
If you click Reset,
the entire service resets.

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.969
Now there's two panels here besides
the definition on the machine where

19
00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.264
you could copy paste
the machine's definition.

20
00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:26.721
There's this date over here which shows
you which state you're currently on.

21
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:32.980
So if I click Good, it takes you to
the value thanks and changes to closed.

22
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.700
There's also the events tab over here too,
so

23
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.695
you could record what events happened
to get to your current state.

24
00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:46.478
Additionally, if you do want to
add payload to your events you

25
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:47.950
could do so here.

26
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.960
You could click the Events Type that
you want and then you could add any

27
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.140
sort of payload over here and
go ahead and send that event.

28
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.907
So you'll see that this clicked
events with hello world and

29
00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:06.990
the payload was sent, and
it took you right to the thanks state.

30
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.360
So remember right now when you're
copying machines over to the visualizer,

31
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.350
don't put create machine just put machine.

32
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.936
Once the visualizer is updated you'll
be able to use the latest xstate

33
00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:20.799
features in it.
