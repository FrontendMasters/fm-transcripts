00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.590
In exercise 6, we have our exact
same drag-drop machine that we made.

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.380
But, let's say that we have a very
special drag and drop application.

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.953
It's a software as a service, and

4
00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:19.847
we only want people to be able to
drag a maximum of five times or so.

5
00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:24.447
What I want you to do is I want you
to keep track of how many times

6
00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:25.720
it was dragged.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.450
And we want to disable this dragging
once it reaches more than five.

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160
So in the JavaScript,
we have our exact same code as before.

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.000
But now, when we're in the idle state,
we want to add a condition

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.224
to this transition which makes
it a guarded transition,

11
00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:54.420
in order to disallow it from happening
once we have five or more drags.

12
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.124
And in order to keep track of the drags,
we could do that whenever we

13
00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:01.510
enter the state,
increment the drag counts by using a sign.
