00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.850
Exercise four is going
to be a simple exercise.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.290
We're going to be taking the machine that
we created before, but now we wants to

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.360
know what points in the box we
actually put our mouse down on.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.678
So again, if you see this box once we.

5
00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:21.506
Oops.

6
00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:28.834
Once we click the box, we know that
it goes from inactive to active, but

7
00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.077
we're going to be making
a drag drop machine and

8
00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:36.230
we want to know where exactly
in the box we actually clicked.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.245
So if we go to exercise four,
we'll see a couple of different things.

10
00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:51.170
So,most of the machine is already done for
you.

11
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.810
And this is going to be very close
to the same machine that you made

12
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.860
in exercise number three.

13
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.910
Instead of going from inactive to active,
now we're going from idle to dragging.

14
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.868
Because you could sort of envision this
as something that once you put your mouse

15
00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:09.175
down, you're in dragging, and
then once you lift your mouse up,

16
00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:11.563
you're no longer dragging, you're in idle.

17
00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:19.753
But we do wants to see what's
the point on the box was clicked.

18
00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:26.530
So, that would be events.clientx,
and events.clienty.

19
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.070
And so in order to do this,
you could do this in any way you want.

20
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.340
But we're going to be setting the data
points attribute of the box elements

21
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.080
to display both of those points.

22
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.470
So just to show you real quick,
if this had a data

23
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.980
points of Hello, which obviously isn't
the points, it will show up over here.

24
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.250
And so instead of Hello, we actually
wants to show what point was clicked.

25
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.687
And so the set points is going to be an
action Inside this mouse down transition.

26
00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:05.260
So, are there any questions
before we start this exercise?
