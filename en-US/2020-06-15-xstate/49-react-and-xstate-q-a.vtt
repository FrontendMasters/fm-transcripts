Alright, so Anwar asks a React specific
question, if you use the use machine hook

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.250
and you want to avoid passing down
the props to the descendants,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.490
is it okay to put them in context?

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.694
So you could put a service in context and
it's never gonna cause any updates.

5
00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:21.370
And it's gonna do so for one reason and
that's because the service never changes.

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.862
You could subscribe to a service
to get its data updates, but

7
00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:27.679
the service instance
itself will never change.

8
00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.443
So, there is an example over
here if you go to recipes and

9
00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:40.350
react, actually we have to go to Packages,
xstate/react.

10
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.406
And if you go to Services, There is

11
00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:50.710
this well I guess it's not here,
useService, there it is.

12
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.166
There is a useService hook, so you could
grab that service from context, and

13
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.404
then use that service just
like you would use a machine.

14
00:00:58.404 --> 00:01:04.455
And because that service never changes,
even as state is updated multiple times,

15
00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:09.037
it's completely performance to
use that service in context,

16
00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:12.076
grab it, and then call this use service.

17
00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:16.340
So to get both the state,
and the Send method
