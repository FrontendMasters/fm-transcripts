00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.566
In case you wanna do exercise two,
in order to get more of a feel for

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:11.035
Xstate, you could take your object
syntax that you had over here

3
00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:16.113
in exercise one,
copy that over inside of createMachine.

4
00:00:16.113 --> 00:00:20.833
And so, if you recall,
it's the exact same syntax and

5
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:27.204
then we're going to be setting our
currentStates to machine.initial.

6
00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:31.096
And then our send is just going to be

7
00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:36.200
currentState is the machine.transition,

8
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.104
the currentState and the events.

9
00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:45.196
And so this is going to be
how we use XState in order

10
00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:50.797
to do the exact same thing
that we did in exercise one.

11
00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:58.526
So exercise three encompasses both
exercise two and using an interpreter.

12
00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:01.630
So we're just mushing
those into one exercise.
