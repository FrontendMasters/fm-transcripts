00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.434
What we're going to do is,
we're going to use history states in

2
00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:09.219
order to remember the last
state that we were in.

3
00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.398
So, just to show you a little preview.

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.720
The way that we define a history state is,

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.244
let's say that we have
a machine over here,

6
00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:31.360
const someMachine = createMachine and
initial something.hist.

7
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.746
And so, we could say states,
say something.

8
00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:40.012
And let's have another somethingElse
state, so somethingElse.

9
00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:45.282
So, imagine that this something state

10
00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:50.231
has nested states, so initial one,

11
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:56.790
states one, two, and
also we have a hist state.

12
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.200
In order to define this hist
state as a history state,

13
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.060
we give it a type of history.

14
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.999
And this is going to tell x state, this is
a special, what's called a pseudo state

15
00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:13.384
that says go to the last visited state or
by default, the initial state.

16
00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:17.459
So, somethingElse, so on, TOGGLE, and

17
00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.886
then we'll just go back to something.hist.

18
00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:26.743
And so we could go to something here,
and TOGGLE between these two.

19
00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:32.971
So, your goal in this is to
use history states, over here,

20
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:40.660
and we are going to go to the last
visible states when we turn back on.

21
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:48.570
So you're going to change this TURN_ON to
go directly to a history state, visible.

22
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.870
And we also want to add the hierarchical
states for light mode and

23
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.330
dark mode over here.

24
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.440
If you check the docs, then I highly

25
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.235
recommend you go to the History section.

26
00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:06.526
So, History.

27
00:02:09.268 --> 00:02:13.094
And look at the examples over there
because it's going to be exactly what

28
00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:13.667
you need.
