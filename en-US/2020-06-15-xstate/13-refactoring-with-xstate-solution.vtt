00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.745
Finishing up this exercise, we have
the send, where we have currentState.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.163
So whenever we have a click events,
we're going to send: 'CLICK'.

3
00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:19.420
And so inside of our send, we're updating
the current state with machine.transition.

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.623
And this is going to use Xstate
instead of our own transition

5
00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:26.995
function in order to
determine the next state.

6
00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.634
Then we're setting the data state

7
00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:33.560
attribute of eLBox to
the currentState's value.

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.107
And so if we go to Exercise 02,
we're gonna see that it works the exact

9
00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:44.394
same way, with the difference that
if we log out the currentState,

10
00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:53.926
We actually see an Xstate state object
instead of just our string over here.
