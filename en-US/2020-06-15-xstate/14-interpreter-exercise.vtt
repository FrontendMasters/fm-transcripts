00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.540
In exercise number three,
we're going to be using an interpreter.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.270
And so we're going to be using
the interpreter in order to interpret

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.420
that a very similar machine to
what we had in the first exercise

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.080
and so our first step is going to
be actually creating that machine.

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.110
Then we're going to be creating
a service using interpret and

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.940
passing that machine into that service.

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.890
So we listen for state transitions by
doing service dot on transition and

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.260
adding a state listener into there.

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.020
And what we want to do is instead
of just console logging the states,

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.860
we actually wants to do the same thing
where we're setting the data state

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.360
attribute of L box to either active or
inactive.

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.620
Now we want to do this
a little bit differently.

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.900
Instead of clicking to go
from active to inactive,

14
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.970
we want those to be two separate events.

15
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.280
We want it to be the mouse down event and
the mouse up event so

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.620
when you click mouse down, it's active but
as soon as you release your mouse and

17
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.060
you haven't mouse up events,
it goes to inactive.
