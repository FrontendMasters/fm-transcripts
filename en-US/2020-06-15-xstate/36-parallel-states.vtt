00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.800
So parallel states are interesting because

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.240
it at first seems to be paradoxical
to what finite state machines are.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.600
In the parallel states,

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.860
we're basically saying we should be able
to be in more than one state at the same

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.200
time, even though this isn't
exactly what parallel states mean.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.730
Another thing for
parallel states is orthogonal states.

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.740
By the way, so if you hear them
referred to as orthogonal.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.730
It's the exact same thing.

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.780
So let's say that in our visible state for

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.610
displays we have a mode and
the brightness.

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.250
And these, for the most part,
are independent from each other,

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.040
where in the mode we could switch back and
forth between light and

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.200
dark, and the brightness is just
something that goes from bright to dim.

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.430
After 5 seconds, so if you remember
how to do a delayed transition,

15
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.740
using the after property,
then that's exactly how you would do it.

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.010
And on any sort of focus,
we go back from dim to bright.

17
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.050
For the exercise we're going to do,
we're just going to use that same.

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.780
That seems switch events
in order to do that.

19
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.420
Now, a parallel states referred to being
in both of these states at the same time.

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.440
However, you shouldn't consider this
sort of a non deterministic finite

21
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.490
state machine or something that sort
of deviates away from a state machine.

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.390
Instead you could refer to this as
simplifying the common editorial explosion

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
of states which are otherwise
orthogonal to each other.

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.460
So, in the visible states,
we could be in the lights mode,

25
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.400
and the bright brightness, or we could be
in the light mode in the dim brightness,

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.290
or we could be in the dark mode and
the bright brightness or

27
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.280
the dark mode in the dim brightness.

28
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.750
So in reality,
there's four combinations of states.

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.000
If you add another region so
mode and brightens our region and

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.900
if you add something else Then it
becomes eight possible states.

31
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.940
If you add another one, it becomes 16,
32, 64 and so on and so forth.

32
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.430
You get that combinatorially explosion
which we're trying to avoid.

33
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.500
And this is why we use state charts.

34
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.750
So by representing them
as orthogonal regions,

35
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.810
we don't have that method of
defining combinations of states.

36
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.180
So in other words,

37
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.330
don't think of it as being in more
than in one state at the same time,

38
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.197
think of it as representing a combination
of the states in a much simpler way.
