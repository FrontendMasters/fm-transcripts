00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.890
So in exercise 12,
we're saying that instead of a fire and

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.270
forget action, which cannot communicate
back directly to a machine,

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.510
we wants to instead invoke an actor.

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.390
Because remember, actors can send
messages back to their parents.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.490
And so to do that, we're going to be
using the invoke property in x date,

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.170
and so that's going to invoke a promise
that eventually resolves with a value or

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.840
it could reject with a value.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.760
And based on what happens
with events we get,

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.090
we could transition to
the appropriate states.
