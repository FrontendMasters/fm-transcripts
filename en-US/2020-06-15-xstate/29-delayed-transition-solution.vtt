00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.550
Let's go ahead and make sure that we
cannot drag for more than five seconds.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.110
That's what the read me said.

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.080
Two seconds.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.860
Yeah, we're gonna make it two seconds,
okay.

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.490
So we're gonna set our timeout
here to two seconds, and

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.940
we're going to use that
in a delayed transition.

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.310
So in dragging, we could say after,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.510
and then we could specify that timeout
that we defined in the delays over here.

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.940
And we could say,
after that timeout, go to idle.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.280
And actually,
we also want to reset that position too.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.480
So we wanna make this
the longer objects form and

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.737
say actions reset position.

13
00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:53.750
That way,
after two seconds of me dragging,

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.940
it's gonna go right back to idle.

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.080
And so it's an interesting behavior but

16
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.660
that demonstrates just how you could
easily add on behavior to something.

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.160
Which might be a more advanced use case or

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.980
extra business requirements that you need
to do, without having to dig through all

19
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.450
the places in your code that might be
affected by this two second timer.

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.310
And so one interesting thing about
this is that we are doing this

21
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.580
reset position on the actions which is
gonna set it to its original position, but

22
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.560
because we are dragging it,
if we drag it for less than two seconds,

23
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.020
it's going to stay in that place because
remember, it's going to cancel that timer.

24
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.640
And none of these are implicit
events because these are still

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.390
very real events being
sent to the machine.

26
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.312
So again, you could consider this
after timeout, the same as a special,

27
00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:52.960
x date.after, and

28
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.130
then timeout and
then some other metadata over here.

29
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.090
This is the exact same thing.

30
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.470
And so this is just a nicer
way of specifying this.
