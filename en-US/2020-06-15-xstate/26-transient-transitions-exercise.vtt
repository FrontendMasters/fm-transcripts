00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.350
All right, so in this exercise,

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.050
yeah, you're gonna be starting
with an initial state.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.707
And just like we showed in the slides,
it's going to immediately move to idle if

4
00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:15.520
we're unauthorized, otherwise it's going
to move to the unauthorized state.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.571
And so the idea is that when you go to,

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.875
let's do Exercise 07.

7
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.450
When the user is undefined,
you should not be able to drag this.

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.134
And right now, the user is undefined, so

9
00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:36.136
we don't want this to
actually be draggable.

10
00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:41.065
So you could see here
the user is undefined.

11
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.923
So make it so
that when our user is undefined,

12
00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:46.721
nothing should be able
to happen over here.
