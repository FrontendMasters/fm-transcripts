00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:05.372
So, in this exercise,
We are going to add one more

2
00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:11.190
thing to our drag drop machine, and
then we're going to call it done.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.870
So in this drag drop machine,
what we want to do is we want,

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.526
pressing the Shift key to restrict
the x-axis of the of the dragging.

5
00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:24.419
So right now, when you move this around,

6
00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.064
nothing happens cuz
resetPosition is not defined.

7
00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:32.482
So let's actually grab that from,

8
00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:38.971
the 09indexfinal,
resetPosition, here we go.

9
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:42.090
So if you run into the same error,
just go ahead and

10
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.479
grab resetPosition from final.js.

11
00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.060
So right now when you drag,
you could drag in any direction.

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.170
But what I want to happen is when you
press the Shift key while you're dragging,

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.080
we only want it to move on the x-axis,
which it doesn't do right now.

14
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.130
So your goal is to make
dragging a nested state,

15
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.270
or a parent state with nested states.

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.970
We want a normal state and
we want a locked state.

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350
The normal state is going to have
the same normal dragging behavior, so

18
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.416
you don't really have to
do anything in there.

19
00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:22.430
The locked state is going to make it so
that when you move your mouse,

20
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.427
so when you handle this mousemove event,
you're no longer just assigning the delta.

21
00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:32.220
You are assigning only the x value of
the delta because we only care about

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.033
how far it moved on the x-axis.
