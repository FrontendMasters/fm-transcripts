00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.265
We have a small problem with the with
the machine that we talked about in

2
00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:05.660
hierarchical states.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.570
So this works fine when we
have a hidden state and

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.626
we go to visible then we
switch between light and dark.

5
00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:17.920
And so we're setting our preference
inside the visible state,

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.600
whether we want light mode or dark mode.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.593
But the problem that you could see
in this chart is that when you turn

8
00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:28.445
off the display, it goes to hidden and

9
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.389
when you turn on,
it goes directly to the light one.

10
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:35.978
So if you prefer dark mode, this gets
pretty annoying because you're gonna have

11
00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:38.145
to keep switching back to dark mode.

12
00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.004
And this isn't really favorable.

13
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.940
So what we could do instead
is introduced history states.

14
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.753
And so what this is saying is that
when we're in the hidden state and

15
00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:54.672
be turned on event happens,
we go to visible.hist and so

16
00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:57.612
we specified this hist as a history state,

17
00:00:57.612 --> 00:01:01.803
this is just convention you
could call it whatever you want.

18
00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:05.932
And what this is going to
say is go to the last,

19
00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:11.240
the last visited child state
of this visible state.

20
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.009
So it the last date that we were in,
in this visible state was dark,

21
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.330
then when we turn off and
when we turn on again,

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.692
it's going to go back to dark
instead of directly to lights.

23
00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:26.840
And that's what that history
state allows you to do.

24
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.604
History states are knots for going back
and forth between different states.

25
00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:35.896
That's something that you
should use context for

26
00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:40.528
history states are all about the last
visited child of a parent state.

27
00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:42.900
So it's most useful for hierarchical and

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.094
parallel states which we're
going to talk about next.
