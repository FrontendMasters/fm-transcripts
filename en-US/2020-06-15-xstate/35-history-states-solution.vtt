00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.420
We are going to remember
which mode we selected,

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.780
whether it was light mode or dark mode.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.770
So the first thing we need to do
is we need to define some states.

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.700
So initially,

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.680
we're gonna be in light mode,
might not be a preference for everyone.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.960
It's not for me.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.079
So that's why we're going to give

8
00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.727
the option to switch between light and

9
00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:35.199
dark mode, so states we have light,

10
00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.553
All right, so when we turn on the machine,

11
00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:46.848
we have this switch mode button that

12
00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:51.990
goes between light and dark mode.

13
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.670
And you'll see that it
does that automatically.

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.910
Again, that's using those data
attribute selectors in CSS

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.260
in putting this directly on
the state's You're on the DOM node.

16
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.790
But of course, when we turn it on switch
to dark mode and turn it off, we see that

17
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.650
it forgets our mode, which isn't something
that we are expecting as a user.

18
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.980
So that's why we could add a pseudo
state which is the history state.

19
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.400
And so we'll just call this hist or
previously selected mode,

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.840
whatever you wanna call the state,
it doesn't matter.

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560
What does matter is
the type that you give it.

22
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.190
We want to say that
this is a history node.

23
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.610
And what this is going to do
is it's going to remember

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.310
which one of these child
states we were last in.

25
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.530
So, now we could transition
directly to visible .hist and

26
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.990
so that's going to go to either the last
remembered child state, light or dark.

27
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.300
Or it's going to go to
the initial state by default.

28
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.910
So when we turn it on, switch to dark
mode, turn it off, and turn it on again.

29
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.460
You can see it goes to dark mode.

30
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.580
And just to show you how exactly that
works, let's console dot log, this dates.

31
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.640
When we turn it on and

32
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.280
go to dark mode you'll see that we
have what's called a history value.

33
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.780
Now don't worry too
much about this object.

34
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.420
all it's doing is it's keeping
track of the the current value and

35
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.670
the last remembered values
of those nested states.

36
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.378
So in the visible state we're
seeing that the current is dark.

37
00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:40.590
And and
we're remembering each of the history

38
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.070
states in each of the parents states,
so just visible in this case.

39
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.920
So that means when we turn off and

40
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.270
when we turn on, we have some way to
reference what that last date was.

41
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.150
And so that's how it knows to
go directly back to that state.

42
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.980
Brian asks, Is there any preferred naming
convention that the community has for

43
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.040
coming up with naming your history states?

44
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.210
Now by the community,

45
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.540
you have to realise that state charts are,
Definitely not a new idea.

46
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.980
They've been around for three decades and
they're using many, many languages.

47
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.760
So if we search the charts,
history states and

48
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.680
we go to images, we could see that
people name it all sorts of stuff.

49
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.010
Generally people like to name it this.

50
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.800
A single letter H.

51
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.790
And so you could do that.

52
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.840
That tends to work pretty well for
most use cases.

53
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.780
So either H,
I like it being hits just because

54
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.710
I have a little bit of an aversion
to those single letter names.

55
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.850
I'd like them to be.

56
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.210
A little bit more descriptive.

57
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.340
So really, it's up to you.

58
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.510
And you could always look at prior arts
and what people have been doing in other

59
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.000
languages for a really long time to
see exactly how to name your states.
