&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, we've got a website,
it's got all the slides you're gonna see

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.885
today and
more that you will not see today.

3
00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:12.091
As well as a repository with a bunch
of examples, so you can co-visit it and

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:17.298
your favorite way to clone it works for
me, whether that be the GitHub CLI,

5
00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:21.950
GitHub Desktop, HTTPS,
which we'll talk about today, or SSH.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.591
I do have it installed, so
you will kind of pull it down,

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.003
you can do everyone's
favorite npm install first.

8
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.849
There are a few options that are kind
of available to you as well.

9
00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:37.041
Most of them, you'll know it if
you need it is like npm start.

10
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.287
We'll pull up all of the exercise and
let you pick them.

11
00:00:39.287 --> 00:00:40.667
We'll take a look at that in a second.

12
00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:45.172
If, for some reason, you're I really
wanna see every SQL query being executed

13
00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:49.087
while we do the SQL injection pieces,
you can pass the --sql flag.

14
00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:54.042
If you wanna run it on a different port
than the ones I picked, for reasons, you

15
00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:59.224
can choose a different port, and a lot of
these are using SQL lite databases, so if

16
00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:04.283
when we try to cross-site script ourselves
and put bad data into our database.

17
00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:08.414
If you need that to go away,
this will wipe out all of the databases in

18
00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:12.560
the repository, which are not,
they're all get ignored anyway.

19
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.782
But if you do wanna just have
a clean slate, you can do that.

20
00:01:15.782 --> 00:01:18.914
So pulling it up,
we can go to npm start, and

21
00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:23.850
you'll get this kind of list of
all the different examples, right?

22
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.557
The first one we're gonna be
doing is this cookie jar one.

23
00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:31.039
And basically, you pick the one you wanna
run and you see that at that point, right?

24
00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.136
It'll see the database with
everything you might need, and

25
00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:40.451
give you a local host port that you can
kind of command click on and play around.
