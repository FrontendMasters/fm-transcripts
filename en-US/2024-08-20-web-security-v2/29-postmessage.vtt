00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:03.459
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There are other
things that we can play around with,

2
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.856
let's talk about kind of
another interesting one.

3
00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.864
Again, this falls under
the social engineering piece.

4
00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:13.482
And then we'll kind of pull
out to the if you need it,

5
00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:18.912
here are some other options for you and
just some other high-level techniques

6
00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:23.698
that we can kind of take a look at
that are kind of more like bonus laps.

7
00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:29.375
And areas to explore but I think worth
calling out because they're important.

8
00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:33.632
We started with things that you need to
think about every day and as we pull out,

9
00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:36.096
we're talking about weird attack vectors.

10
00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:36.864
And then finally,

11
00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:39.801
we'll talk about things you probably
set up once in the very beginning.

12
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.702
Cuz if you don't set them up in
the very beginning, you will be sad and

13
00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:44.211
need to do some maintenance later.

14
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.812
So, well, that's kinda the way
that we'll kinda bubble this up.

15
00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:56.686
But we have,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Actually, I think,

16
00:00:56.686 --> 00:01:01.557
yeah, yeah,
we're gonna check out this one called

17
00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:06.553
support-chat, real quick,
which is another two.

18
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:16.542
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So support chat
has some interesting features to it,

19
00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.514
that's ahead, 4008 and, yeah.

20
00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:25.357
Yeah, so if we look at just,
it's actually interesting doing this,

21
00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:29.543
not in an incognito window,
is going to show you the attack,

22
00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:33.174
because extensions are weird and
they play around.

23
00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:37.111
But I think instead of moving
into an incognito window,

24
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:41.736
I'm going to choose to show you
the slightly nefarious version.

25
00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:44.821
Let's do that another tab too,
which is local host I think.

26
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:56.836
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: These
injected object objects are actually

27
00:01:56.836 --> 00:02:00.036
one of my browser extensions,

28
00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:05.091
sending a post message in to the frame,
as well.

29
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.472
And so this is basically something from
the outside world is sending messages in.

30
00:02:09.472 --> 00:02:14.218
This is super easy to fix,
cuz it's on both ends,

31
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:17.847
but we need to kind of take a look at it.

32
00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:23.220
So, we look at the code in this case.

33
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.631
We've got,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's

34
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.824
just an iframe that if we look at it by
itself, it's just a chat, it's great.

35
00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:38.458
And even but fully loaded, it had
stuff being injected in there as well.

36
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:43.135
And if you look in the console,
it's from, I think,

37
00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:49.290
my one password extension or whatever,
this is outside code in this case.

38
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.458
So we've got that, and
then let's see, this is in client.

39
00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:00.368
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So effectively,
in this case, we are saying, hey,

40
00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:04.224
we've got this window event listener for
message, and

41
00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:07.520
if a message comes in,
add it in there, right.

42
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.854
This is an easy fix,
which is that right now it is just

43
00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:15.411
accepting messages that come in, right?

44
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:17.471
Which could be anything.

45
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.982
And so,
if I went to that malicious one again,

46
00:03:20.982 --> 00:03:26.035
now they've iframed it in almost
in a compelling iframe, right?

47
00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:29.831
I put a shadow on it, so
it looks totally real.

48
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:35.395
We could say support and,

49
00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:41.039
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't like you,

50
00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.160
right?

51
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.008
And it sends the message into the window,
right?

52
00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.888
And this might be a situation
where we have a pop-up or

53
00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:52.058
an iframe just in the chat from a segment
integration or something like that.

54
00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:54.626
And the message comes in, and

55
00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:59.363
we just blindly take it and
apply it to the DOM, right?

56
00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:04.493
So, on the receiving end
this is easily fixed by

57
00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:09.623
just checking and
kind of the way we felt about

58
00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:14.893
just allow listing
what you will stand for.

59
00:04:14.893 --> 00:04:21.101
So we can say, yeah, whatever the trusted
domain, I think in this case,

60
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:26.223
it's like 4108 and
the other one is coming from 4008.

61
00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:29.620
And so now, if we try to do that,
and we say,

62
00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:37.713
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can see,

63
00:04:37.713 --> 00:04:38.995
nothing happens, right?

64
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:42.981
Cuz all these events that come
in have an origin, right?

65
00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:48.010
And if you don't check the origin on
the way in for any of these messages,

66
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.758
like anyone can wrap you in an iframe and
trigger that.

67
00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:56.954
Including what I did in a non incognito
window, like extensions, right?

68
00:04:56.954 --> 00:04:58.168
That will pass it on in.

69
00:04:58.168 --> 00:05:01.854
There is another side, which is,
what if the opposite is true?

70
00:05:01.854 --> 00:05:05.459
What if you don't want someone
to put an iframe in you and

71
00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.693
receive messages that you're sending,
right?

72
00:05:08.693 --> 00:05:11.622
You're worried about what if they
swap out a very legit iframe for

73
00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:14.935
something nefarious and now they're
receiving data and collecting it?

74
00:05:14.935 --> 00:05:18.999
Cuz then they control the code,
it's almost the reverse of a CSRF,

75
00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.922
where you're sending messages to
what you think is your iframe,

76
00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:25.583
and they're collecting them all, right?

77
00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:29.886
Again, incredibly easy to do in this case,
but

78
00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:33.230
problematic if you don't, right?

79
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.546
Which is to give it an origin that
it is allowed to send messages to.

80
00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:40.328
So in this case,
the frame has to be on that allow list.

81
00:05:40.328 --> 00:05:44.517
And so we could say, in this case,
that should be the 4108.

82
00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:46.909
And now it will send them in,

83
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.016
they won't go anywhere because
they're blocking it here.

84
00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:56.889
But if I set this to a very different one,
let's just say,

85
00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.011
like, 5555,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,

86
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:03.137
and we try to send something.

87
00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:08.562
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It will block it,
so again,

88
00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:13.362
both sides can protect each other from
visibility and messages can actually work

89
00:06:13.362 --> 00:06:17.612
with pop up windows like theoretically,
if it spawns it into a new tab.

90
00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:21.067
There is effectively a link
between those two windows.
