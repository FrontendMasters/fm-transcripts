00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:03.994
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is another way
to do privilege escalation in this app

2
00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:04.646
as well.

3
00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:06.797
We're using SQL ,right?

4
00:00:06.797 --> 00:00:11.137
But a lot of apps whether they be
JavaScript apps otherwise will sometimes

5
00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:14.847
use a NoSQL database which is
effectively JSON under the hood,

6
00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:18.216
which we can think about as
JavaScript Objects, right?

7
00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:23.163
And one of the attack vectors there is
a little bit different than trying to put

8
00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:25.230
something in a string, right?

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.185
A lot of us who have written front-end
code before will see something

10
00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.745
like this where it's like object and
it's like, sure, no.

11
00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:38.529
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, and

12
00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:43.789
I wanna say const extended
= {...object and,

13
00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.227
like, admin:true}, right?

14
00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:51.891
Or maybe that's not actually what the code
is doing but if you're spread operating

15
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.967
all the properties from one object
onto another you can do this in Mongo.

16
00:00:55.967 --> 00:01:00.224
You can do this in CouchDB, you can
do this a lot of NoSQL databases as

17
00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:04.934
JavaScript objects, and if someone
can slide an extra property in there,

18
00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:09.295
then they can theoretically change
stuff that you did not intended.

19
00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.085
And honestly,
that one's on you it's not like,

20
00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:16.104
they were super clever it's just you
were blindly allow listing everything.

21
00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:20.773
One of the key ways to keep yourself
secure is,it's not deny list.

22
00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:23.775
It's not saying it has admin,
then don't let it in cuz, well,

23
00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:27.791
they'll find some weird way to put a back
tech in there and I'll get through, right?

24
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:32.347
It is basically like, no, for
this request, we allow list a certain

25
00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:36.764
number of properties and
everything else is not allowed, right?

26
00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:38.412
So if you find yourself doing like this,

27
00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:41.379
you're going to like no library is
gonna save you from this, all right?

28
00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:47.882
And there's some really interesting attack
vectors around privilege escalation,

29
00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:51.594
I'm using SQL, so
I made a fake version of this.

30
00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:55.860
And if we go look at posting
to the user profile or

31
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.089
I think patching it, right,
cuz a patch HTTP method means

32
00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:06.658
I want to update only some
properties on this object, right?

33
00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:10.244
Obviously, post means make
a new to-do item, right?

34
00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:15.403
Put means completely updated,
Patch means change a few properties.

35
00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:18.527
Now we all abuse HTTP methods and
we use them wrong and

36
00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:20.524
there are reasons why we do that.

37
00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:25.087
For instance, in the browser,
you can say that a form has a method get,

38
00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:29.954
you can say post, you can try to say any
other one, but it's like the browser

39
00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:34.170
performs only supports get and
post and not all the HTTP methods.

40
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.866
You can only use Patch and Delete and
the other ones with like Fetch, whatever.

41
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:44.639
So we all tend to abuse the verbs, but if
we're being intellectually honest, right?

42
00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.951
What I just wanna do is take
whatever comes in from the body and

43
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.499
update the user with those params.

44
00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.845
And that seems legit, right?

45
00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:58.232
So for instance,
if we went back to the core app,

46
00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:02.833
we went to the Profile and
I don't need this open for

47
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.478
a little bit, we can zoom out slightly.

48
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:11.449
I can go update stuff about myself so
we can become Bobby Tablets.

49
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:18.991
I included one additional field in here
for a later example that then I broke.

50
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.649
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That one
right there get out of here.

51
00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:30.271
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Bobby Tablets.

52
00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:34.098
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool.

53
00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:39.331
So now if you look, I can change this name
from Bobby Tables to Bobby Tablets and

54
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:44.352
I did that a second ago, so I can
actually say, let's change it to Robert.

55
00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:46.996
He's decided as he got older,

56
00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:52.090
he's gonna go by his full
first name that's great, cool.

57
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.978
And I refresh you can see it
persists in the database, but

58
00:03:55.978 --> 00:04:01.324
if we are doing that kind of extending
pattern that we sometimes do from habit,

59
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.978
especially if we've written
a lot of react, right?

60
00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:08.419
We're like, immutable data structures,
yeah, right?

61
00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:15.468
We tend to bring that wherever we go,
and all it takes is someone going,

62
00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:19.782
I think I'm gonna inspect
element over here.

63
00:04:19.782 --> 00:04:24.927
What if we said, instead of Name,
this one was like Admin we'll go,

64
00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:28.921
we'll say the Name of this
property is really admin,

65
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:32.582
and we'll say the value is like,
true, right?

66
00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:36.833
And it's gonna take all those request body
things, cuz it's making a JSON object.

67
00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:39.230
And if we scroll up and we refresh, look,

68
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.799
we just privileged escalated
ourselves to administrator, right?

69
00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.606
Because, again, we blobbed on the object
they guessed that there was a field called

70
00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:47.580
Admin that was true.

71
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.099
Other thing I would probably guess is
probably role seems like a good one and

72
00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.759
maybe you don't succeed.

73
00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.865
A lot of these things are again, when
we look at some of the famous attacks,

74
00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.554
it was, I kind of noticed a thing.

75
00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:06.518
And that led me to notice another thing,
and that led me to notice another thing,

76
00:05:06.518 --> 00:05:10.106
and that led me to the FBI at my house,
right, literally.

77
00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:14.153
And so those are usually how these go but

78
00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:19.434
the solutions on our end are Lala's work,
right?

79
00:05:19.434 --> 00:05:26.209
And so again,
that the solution to this is very simple,

80
00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:31.110
it's basically, kind of in the cases of

81
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.309
.patch for the Profile, right?

82
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:40.273
Instead of grabbing everything from
request.body, you could say let's say,

83
00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:43.709
assume this thing only let
you change the name, right?

84
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.962
I could grab the credit card and
everything else and it's not important.

85
00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:51.380
So we could say like, for
instance, name, right?

86
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.741
Even those right name, email and
body, and then only pass these in.

87
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.701
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cuz again,

88
00:06:02.701 --> 00:06:06.934
this is what I was talking about forward
with this idea of allow listing, right?

89
00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:10.131
Where no longer are we
letting them take anything.

90
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.828
They can pass an admin,
they could pass in whatever they want.

91
00:06:13.828 --> 00:06:17.196
They can try to change their address
in this form now to their address and

92
00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:19.624
try to order stuff,
even if they did get the thing.

93
00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:21.851
This case,
we are only allow listing these things.

94
00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:24.882
So now, trying to use the same
attack wouldn't go anywhere,

95
00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:26.938
it would just fall into the void, right?

96
00:06:26.938 --> 00:06:30.031
And no library is gonna
save you from that, right?

97
00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:33.596
That is a tiny little thing that
hopefully, like even a code review,

98
00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:36.429
no one's gonna catch that
in the code review, right?

99
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:41.034
This is where that kind of thinking
about some of the principles of how we

100
00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:45.205
architect things, and
to give us some mind to go looking for it.

101
00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:50.811
But no code scanning tool, or
thing is gonna detect that for you.

102
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.923
And I think that's kind of one
of the key pieces here as well.

103
00:06:53.923 --> 00:06:55.979
And again I could do this with the form.

104
00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.605
Let's say there wasn't a form I could
get a curl command, right, for funsies,

105
00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:06.650
if you ever want, you can go to the
Network tab and you can grab any request

106
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.779
that makes you happy and you can do copy
as either curl as a fetch command and

107
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:16.632
you can tweak all the different
params to anything you want, right?

108
00:07:16.632 --> 00:07:21.566
Cuz again, the good part of the web is
that they don't need to install anything.

109
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:26.319
The bad part is effectively
whoever's on the receiving end

110
00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.081
has access all your code, right?

111
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:32.973
And so they can theoretically
grab these tweak them, and

112
00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:36.309
there's nothing wrong
with that per se as well.

113
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:41.197
But knowing that it is on
your responsibility to then

114
00:07:41.197 --> 00:07:43.762
defend code defensively.
