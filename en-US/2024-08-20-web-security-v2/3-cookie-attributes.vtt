00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.703
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's just talk about
some of the attributes on a cookie,

2
00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:05.281
you can think about a cookie as
like a key value store right.

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.137
But then there are some
special properties, right?

4
00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:12.741
That like are again that agreement,
which is previously just an undocumented

5
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:17.988
agreement, but as we saw before, as of
2011, we've got a standard for this stuff.

6
00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:22.562
Some of the various different agreements
of what should the browser do with this

7
00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.143
cookie, right?

8
00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:28.233
And so for instance we'll see a whole
bunch of them that are more tightly

9
00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.461
related to security, but this is
arguably one somewhat related as well,

10
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.643
which is when should I get
rid of this cookie, right?

11
00:00:35.643 --> 00:00:36.704
You've got two options.

12
00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.211
You can set an expiration date, or you can
also set just some kind of age like 24

13
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:45.049
hours, 30 days something along
those lines, whatever works for

14
00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.626
your application.
I think at one point,

15
00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.134
Google set some cookie

16
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.919
until 2038, which is by my guess,
when we run out of 32 bit integers,

17
00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:59.023
which I think creeped a lot of people out,
so generally speaking depending on

18
00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:03.231
what you're doing, obviously sessions or
something along those lines.

19
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:07.494
Shorter, stuff like their settings or
if they're in dark mode or not,

20
00:01:07.494 --> 00:01:10.205
maybe you keep a little
bit longer than that.

21
00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:13.952
But generally speaking,
if you don't set one of these, you are for

22
00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:15.946
the duration of a session, right?

23
00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:18.785
And it's nuanced what
exactly is a session, but

24
00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:22.186
let's assume closing the browser
is the end of a session.

25
00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.028
For our purposes,
that's not always true, but

26
00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:27.815
generally speaking, it's a good heuristic.

27
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:30.695
Which then brings up,
how do we delete a cookie?

28
00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:36.420
And the answer to that question
is you can't, kinda, right?

29
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.747
You can't delete a cookie, you can set
its expiration date to the past, right?

30
00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:43.862
And then the browser will
get that cookie again,

31
00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:46.399
and will see that it's like,
it's set to last week.

32
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.121
I am going to clear out
a bunch of this as well.

33
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:54.301
There's some other settings that you
probably shouldn't use unless you deeply

34
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.784
have a good reason, right?

35
00:01:55.784 --> 00:02:00.743
Cuz they have these weird,
unintended side Yeah, side effects,

36
00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:03.766
side consequences, side-equences.

37
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:06.895
Unintended consequences, so for
instance, the path one is like, hey,

38
00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.770
I only want it for these sub-directories.

39
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.424
But there are all sorts of fun
exploits with iframes, as we'll see,

40
00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:17.687
that kind of invalidate a lot of
this as well, and a few others.

41
00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.925
So the domain one is super
interesting as well.

42
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:26.396
You can say by default, it is for
the given domain that you're on.

43
00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.393
But in this case, putting that dot
in front of it would make it for

44
00:02:30.393 --> 00:02:33.593
frontendmasters.com and
all of its subdomains.

45
00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:38.341
Now, we'll start out with the fact that
there are some changes to the spec

46
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:42.170
where you're actually trying
to scope it down to a domain,

47
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.786
you could accidentally make
it less specific, right?

48
00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:48.090
And we'll see some of that later.

49
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.080
But also, it really depends,
right on what the domain is.

50
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.281
So for instance, you can say, cool, I want
it for all the subdomains of my domain.

51
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:01.485
That might be really great if you
have login.enterprise.com, right?

52
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:02.780
No, I guess not enterprise credit card.

53
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.907
But well, your company.com and then,
the www and maybe some other dashboard?

54
00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:13.533
Great, however,
what if you were just hosting your page,

55
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.861
GitHub.io or vercel.app?

56
00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.761
We'll talk about that as well.

57
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:22.377
Every subdomain would mean everyone
else who was also at Github.io.

58
00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:26.887
Right, again, it's like just adding
a little property or just maybe something

59
00:03:26.887 --> 00:03:31.987
even you're like, this is something that
has a server side framework set for you.

60
00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:35.457
You didn't even realize it, but you just
gave anyone else on that subdomain or

61
00:03:35.457 --> 00:03:37.627
anyone who get one of those subdomains,
right?

62
00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:40.156
Which again, if you own the DNS, fine.

63
00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:45.296
But if it is something where you
just have a subdomain, all right?

64
00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:47.141
Wide open for all that stuff.
