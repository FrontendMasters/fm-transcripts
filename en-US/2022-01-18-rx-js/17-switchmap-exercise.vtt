00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.846
So with that, what we would kinda wanna do
is see if we can get that working with our

2
00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:08.760
counter, because we have a lot
of the infrastructure in here.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.260
We had a play in a pause button.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.450
We had an observable that we care about.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.303
What we wanna do is now take,

6
00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:19.346
we're gonna merge together those two
buttons in our basic counter, right?

7
00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:22.910
And then we wanna switch between
that interval observable and

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.346
never based on the given state
that we're in at a given point
