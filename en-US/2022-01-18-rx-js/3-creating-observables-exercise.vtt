00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.802
So as we break into the exercise,
right, this is a good opportunity for

2
00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:06.054
you to answer this question for yourself.

3
00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:09.028
And we have a series of just
kind of making observable,

4
00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:13.293
all sorts of different things, so you
got to see me do it, the simple version,

5
00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:15.964
now I give you the hard
version cuz that's fair.

6
00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:20.420
And you kind of go through some of the
basic versions and kinda yeah, exactly.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.251
Answer that question for yourself and
find out how exactly we would go about

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:30.250
testing asynchronous value versus
a synchronous value, so on and so forth.

9
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.360
Cool, so I'm gonna give you a little
bit time to download npm install,

10
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.910
all that fun stuff.

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.310
There are instructions
on the site as well.

12
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.649
If you just wanna run the tests for
creating observables,

13
00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.922
which is where we're gonna
be doing this next exercise,

14
00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:52.070
you just run npm test creating or
only run those tests.

15
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.647
You do need to unskip them, and

16
00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:58.920
then we will kind of go
through them each together.
