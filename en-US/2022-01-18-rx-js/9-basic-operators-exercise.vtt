00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.592
So your mission is to get comfortable
with some of these basic data

2
00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:06.513
manipulation operators.

3
00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.062
We have a kinda a series of tests
that we're gonna go through,

4
00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:12.199
just to kinda like, understand and
seeing just again, like I said before,

5
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.910
sometimes the syntax is a little bit
different from what you might be used to.

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.815
So this will kinda allow you to get
a little bit of muscle memory and

7
00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:22.300
some understanding around that as well.
