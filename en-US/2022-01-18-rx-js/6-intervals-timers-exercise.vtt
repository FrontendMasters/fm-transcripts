00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.019
So we're going to play around with
this with another quick exercise,

2
00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.919
which is we have a little counter that
we're gonna build where we're gonna

3
00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:11.960
have a Start button.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.790
And we're going to have a Pause button or
Stop button.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.116
And ideally, when when I hit the Start
button which to start counting.

6
00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:24.790
And when I hit the Stop
button we should unsubscribe.

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.497
Now, this counter, I'm gonna warn you
right now, it's not gonna be idiomatic

8
00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:32.290
just yet, we don't have all the tools
that we need to build it the right way.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.253
Your job is to kind of figure out,
based on other pieces of JavaScript,

10
00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.570
how to get this to work.

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.298
And then we'll go over a series of other
exercises this morning, we'll add more and

12
00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:47.695
more functionality and
we'll get it to be idiomatic RxJs but

13
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.300
it's not gonna be in the very beginning.

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.110
So worry less about getting it right.

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.282
Worry about using a timer interval and
getting it working at all.

16
00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:59.643
And then we'll kinda play around with
that and build on it as we go along.
