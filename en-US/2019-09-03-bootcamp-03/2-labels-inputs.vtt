WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.423
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if we were coding very
minimally, that is what we would do.

2
00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:08.473
But there's actually an additional step
here that I'd like you guys to be aware of

3
00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:10.478
which is making your forms accessible.

4
00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:13.811
What do we mean by accessibility, yeah?

5
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:15.617
&gt;&gt; Ryan: People with
disabilities can access them.

6
00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:18.938
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That people with
disabilities can actually access our

7
00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:20.750
form as well and complete it.

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.849
And so on the web there's a whole,
just like in real life,

9
00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.349
there are a lot of people who have
various types of disabilities.

10
00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.285
But in fact, there are a lot of
disabilities that we don't necessarily

11
00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:34.049
think of as disabilities
that apply to websites.

12
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:38.502
For example, color blindness,
I briefly mentioned the other day,

13
00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:41.970
10% of the population is
red-green color blind.

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.836
We try to avoid making red web pages in
Christmas colors for that reason, okay?

15
00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:48.629
Because it can be very difficult for

16
00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.288
people who are colorblind to tell
the difference between red and green.

17
00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:54.898
Likewise, we don't necessarily think of

18
00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:57.658
people who wear glasses
as disabled people.

19
00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:02.071
But yet, some people need deep
fonts to be a little bit bigger,

20
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:07.168
especially older people, so
that they can read web pages very clearly.

21
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:10.344
So these accessibility features
don't take a lot of time to add.

22
00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:14.435
And they can really help a whole
lot of people in using your work.

23
00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:19.177
So what we're going to do here to make
this form more accessible is we're

24
00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:21.832
gonna add a new field here for your name.

25
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:26.347
And instead of it being a paragraph,
we're going to make it a label.

26
00:01:26.347 --> 00:01:30.746
And we're going to do
a lot of labeling today.

27
00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:38.077
And this label tag is going to go all
the way around your name, all right.

28
00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:41.627
So with that,
we know that your name is a label.

29
00:01:41.627 --> 00:01:45.072
But it's a label for what?

30
00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:48.294
Do we know?

31
00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:50.406
We have no idea.

32
00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:54.224
So we need to associate the label
with the field we just created.

33
00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:58.590
So we're going to say label for name.

34
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.564
So the ID down here, in our input,

35
00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:08.057
is what will be associated
with the label here.

36
00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:12.872
So whatever you type in for ID, that
is what's going to go up here for for,

37
00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:15.606
the for attribute value in the label tag.

38
00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:17.079
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
you could have named it George.

39
00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.272
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I could have
named George and if I did that,

40
00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.863
I would have said the ID is George.

41
00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:25.214
And then the for value up here would be.

42
00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:30.273
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: George.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: George, just like that.

43
00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:34.210
Just because you can doesn't mean
you should, but technically,

44
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.185
that will work just fine, okay?

45
00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:40.786
And what's the difference between id and
name, as- Okay, great question, so

46
00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.631
what's the difference between id and name?

47
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:48.433
So ID is going to be used
specifically in this case,

48
00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:51.458
certainly with this label tag.

49
00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:55.326
Often there's a JavaScript processing
script associated with forms that do error

50
00:02:55.326 --> 00:02:58.600
checking to make sure people have
filled out the fields that you want.

51
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.166
Sometimes those IDs can also
be used in JavaScript, okay.

52
00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:08.047
But in our case, very specifically,
this ID is associated with the label.

53
00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:10.483
The name portion of this, okay,

54
00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:16.227
the name portion of this is going to be
associated with the processing script.

55
00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:19.471
When we click our submit button for
our form, and

56
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:23.678
this whole contents of the form
get sent to the server, right?

57
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:28.408
The processing script on the server
needs this name field in

58
00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:32.293
order to do whatever it needs to do,
make sense?

59
00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:34.987
Fortunately, we don't need to
worry about the processing script.

60
00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:36.022
We're front end people.

61
00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:37.210
We don't write that stuff.

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.961
We hire people to write those
processing scripts, okay?

63
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.753
And our engineers are gonna tell us
exactly what we need to do in terms of

64
00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:47.792
name fields in order for
our processing script to work.

65
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.118
Make sense?

66
00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:52.934
We're actually gonna work through
that later once we have this initial

67
00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:53.643
form coded.

68
00:03:53.643 --> 00:03:54.274
Yeah, Ryan?

69
00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:58.903
&gt;&gt; Ryan: Just for clarification, ID, name,
and for need to all have the same value?

70
00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:00.859
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They do not all
need to have the same value.

71
00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.956
You could have three different values.

72
00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:06.647
But I like to make them the same value.

73
00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:11.784
[LAUGH] Because I just think
it works better, okay.
