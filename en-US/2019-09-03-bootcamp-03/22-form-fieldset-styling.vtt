WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, that's nice,
it's a great picture.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.020
But now we can't read the form at all.

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.780
That's kind of bad, all right?

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.336
So one of the tricks that you can do
when laying at a web page like this,

5
00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:14.910
that's kind of fun.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.445
Notice that there are colors on
all these galaxies, yeah, okay?

7
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.840
Notice that you have your eye
dropper in Colorzilla, right?

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.970
You can go ahead and pick here
some cool color from this galaxy,

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.140
and it will match so
nicely with your picture.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.290
Your whole color scheme will come
together, it'll look so professional,

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720
all right?

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.000
So you can roll your mouse around in
here and pick a color that you like.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.140
And we're gonna set that to be
the background color for our wrapper.

14
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.900
And I already did this, so

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.010
I've already picked my color,
[COUGH] which I have here in my notes.

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.688
So on my wrapper,
let's set this to a background color.

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.923
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
that color is going to be, in my case,

18
00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:11.750
efb106, which is a lovely shade of orange.

19
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
if you refresh your page,

20
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.350
this is a nice way of
applying a background image.

21
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.807
And still getting the benefit
of a background image, but

22
00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:26.985
still having readable text
on your webpage, okay?

23
00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:30.422
So you can just put a solid
color on your wrapper, and

24
00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:34.210
already it's looking
a little bit more polished?

25
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.097
Very, very simple technique.

26
00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:39.450
This paragraph style,
we actually aren't gonna need anymore.

27
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.850
That was there when we had paragraphs,
we have very few paragraphs at this point,

28
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.880
you can go ahead and get rid of that.

29
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.131
Our section, we have our aside,
and now we're moving on.

30
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, actually,
I did keep my paragraph style,

31
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.070
I just moved it down here.

32
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.920
So I'm gonna go ahead and do this.

33
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.865
Let me put back in my paragraph style,

34
00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:08.810
margin-bottom: 0, margin-top: 2rem.

35
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.095
How else could I have written this,
instead of writing margin-bottom and

36
00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:16.026
margin-top, how else could
I have written this?

37
00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:16.533
&gt;&gt; Student1: Margin.

38
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.226
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Margin?

39
00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:19.862
&gt;&gt; Student1: 2rem.

40
00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:21.968
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2rem, like this?

41
00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:25.230
&gt;&gt; Student1: No, then 0 after 2rem.

42
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 0 after 2rem?

43
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.197
Is that the same thing?

44
00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:30.451
&gt;&gt; Student1: No, sorry.

45
00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:37.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How could I write a margin
top of 2rem and a margin bottom of 0?

46
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.980
Which also means
the margin on the left and

47
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.560
the margin on the right of 0,
how could I write that?

48
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.690
&gt;&gt; Student2: Trouble.
&gt;&gt; Student1: Zero.

49
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Trouble, remember,
we gotta remember our trouble, right?

50
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.310
&gt;&gt; Student2: Top.

51
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So top is 2rem, 0.

52
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.620
&gt;&gt; Student2: Right 0.

53
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 0 on the right,
0 on the bottom, 0 on the left.

54
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.660
&gt;&gt; Student2: There you go.

55
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That'd be
another way to write it, right?

56
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.010
All kinds of different ways
to write these numbers.

57
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.119
They're all correct.

58
00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:06.200
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna
move on here to my fieldset.

59
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.104
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me put in a bunch of
returns so you can see what I'm doing.

60
00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna move on to my fieldset.

61
00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:17.582
[COUGH] Now you notice that the fieldset
right now has got a great big huge

62
00:03:17.582 --> 00:03:20.308
line going around our content, right?

63
00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:24.340
You guys dig the line, you wanna keep it?

64
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.920
Do you hate it?

65
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.163
How do you feel about the line?

66
00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:29.000
&gt;&gt; Student1: I like it, it's cool.

67
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.460
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You like it?

68
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.300
If you like it, you can keep it.

69
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.506
If you don't like it,
we can get rid of it.

70
00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:38.150
So I'm gonna show you how we can
go about working with that line.

71
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.984
One possibility is simply to redeclare.

72
00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:44.342
Cuz right now what you have
going on here with this line,

73
00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:48.065
this is kind of a 90s sort of effect,
I think, I think of it.

74
00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:51.549
[LAUGH] It's either called inset or
outset,

75
00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.140
it kinda gives you that
fake 3D sort of look.

76
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.320
Which is not really in the graphic
design fashion world at the moment.

77
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.210
We like flat in the current
graphic design fashion world,

78
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.200
this is kind of a dated book.

79
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.270
We just need to update,
trim down the bell bottoms a little bit.

80
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.600
No more parachute pants, all that stuff.

81
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.735
So what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna say instead, border.

82
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:22.779
And I said 1 pixel solid black,
which will give me a nice flat,

83
00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:28.215
narrow black line around it,
it will be a little prettier that way.

84
00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:33.160
And I also did this,
border-radius: 10 pixels.

85
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.021
So we'll have some nice pretty rounded
corners on our fieldset as well.

86
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.486
And one other thing you might wanna add,
as you'll see here in a moment,

87
00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:46.108
we may also wanna add
a little bit of margin.

88
00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:52.736
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: margin-bottom of 2rem, so
that's gonna give us a little bit of space

89
00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:57.168
in between our two fieldsets, a little
bit of breathing room between them.

90
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.915
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So go ahead and
type all that in, refresh your page.

91
00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:08.170
Aw, isn't that prettier?

92
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.330
So much nicer looking.

93
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.301
So you can keep your lines, you can
just like jazz them up a little bit.

94
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.070
[COUGH] Bring them into the new millenium.
