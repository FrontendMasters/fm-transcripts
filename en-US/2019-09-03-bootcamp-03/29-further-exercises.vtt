00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But
your exercises are these.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.555
First of all, catch up.

3
00:00:02.555 --> 00:00:04.333
[LAUGH].

4
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.490
We've been going a little bit long,
these last few days.

5
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.180
You may feel a little bit behind.

6
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.600
Just spend some time reviewing
what we've done, so far.

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.790
Look at some of your code.

8
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.130
Think about that.

9
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.690
The second thing is, over the weekend,
you're going to be working on a portfolio.

10
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.280
Okay?

11
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.090
So, actual portfolio for your future job,
where you can show the work that you've

12
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.800
done this week, and you can add to
it with your JavaScript, later.

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.890
So, you might wanna spend some time
thinking about what goes on a portfolio.

14
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.310
If you wanna put up your resume, for

15
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.460
example, maybe you need to make
sure your resume is up to date.

16
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.330
That would be a good thing to do.

17
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.780
Okay?

18
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.765
Or get together some pictures of yourself.

19
00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:45.330
That would be a good thing to do.

20
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.010
So, so
start thinking about that kind of thing.

21
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.830
I have some more CSS practice,
here, where you can go ahead and

22
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.620
work on some HTML forms.

23
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.100
And then, finally, if you're into it,
you can create a contact form for

24
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.190
your website, so
code a whole form from scratch.

25
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.757
Ask people whatever you wanna ask them.

26
00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:04.540
You can use the same action and

27
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.830
method in all the stuff that
we did in the form in class.

28
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.780
You can use that on your website.

29
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270
Okay?

30
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.100
At least, for now.

31
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.540
That's not gonna work indefinitely,
but it'll work for a little while.

32
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.630
And that will be a contact form for you.

33
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.870
Try to keep the same sort of styling,
going across those pages.

34
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.432
All right?

35
00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:24.083
Sound good?

36
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.641
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
if you're feeling a little burned out,

37
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.050
it's okay If you want to just go home and
rest your brain.

38
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.617
That's okay, too.

39
00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:34.690
All right?

40
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.333
But I wanna make sure that you're plenty
challenged and you have lots to do,

41
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.416
if you're, like, really fired up and
you want to do more.
