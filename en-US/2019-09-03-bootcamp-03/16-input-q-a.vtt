00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.560
&gt;&gt; Student1: Is it bad to just put in for
every time you use label?

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No,
you won't hurt anything.

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.890
You can put in a four,
four equals subscribe.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.233
And you could put in an ID of subscribe.

5
00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.860
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you want to do that,
that's not gonna hurt anything.

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.390
We haven't broken anything.

7
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.400
But it's not required.

8
00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:23.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sense?

9
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.800
Okay, so I'm just gonna take that out,
so I don't confuse anybody further.

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.780
Any other questions at the moment?

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.660
Yes?

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.480
&gt;&gt; Student1: Okay, so for

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.760
the phone number-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.310
&gt;&gt; Student1: That box, and
then the text area box.

15
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.780
Writing we have in there is different.

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

17
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.510
&gt;&gt; Student1: Can we interchange that,
can we do the placehold?

18
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.690
Cuz I personally don't
like having to erase text.

19
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.235
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Student1: But I like writing over it.

20
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:49.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Student1: I find that easier.

21
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.780
So could you do placeholder there?

22
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.968
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure, let's go ahead and

23
00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:55.860
try putting a placeholder
in the text area.

24
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.203
So in our text area,
we'll put in placeholder

25
00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:05.180
equals quote tell me everything.

26
00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:09.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so let's try that.

27
00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.630
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That shows up in Firefox.

28
00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:24.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And that shows up,
I think, here in Chrome.

29
00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Something's
cached on my Chrome.

30
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.620
But it looks like it might be working.

31
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.330
But notice that it is a different font.

32
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.384
This is Courier that's showing up here,
that font.

33
00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:38.440
As opposed to up here,
where it's Helvetica.

34
00:01:40.468 --> 00:01:42.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's
a weird browser thing.

35
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.990
&gt;&gt; Student1: Okay.

36
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How might we fix that?

37
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.870
&gt;&gt; Class: CSS.

38
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about a little CSS?

39
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.140
We owe a lot of work to
do on this form of CSS.

40
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.030
Okay, yes?

41
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.770
&gt;&gt; Student1: Okay, and then,
when you have these forms and

42
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.754
you can enter your phone number-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

43
00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:00.875
&gt;&gt; Student1: I like it when
they have it set up for

44
00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:05.252
you so when you do the three numbers,
they put the dash in for you.

45
00:02:05.252 --> 00:02:06.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, that's-
&gt;&gt; Student1: Is that HTML?

46
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.240
Or not.

47
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.358
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, that's JavaScript.

48
00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:10.810
&gt;&gt; Student1: Okay.

49
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.183
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And it's totally cool
when they do that, provided that you

50
00:02:14.183 --> 00:02:18.440
are collecting phone numbers from
people in the United States and Canada.

51
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.420
Then that works great.

52
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.120
If you're from another country and your
phone numbers that you're collecting or

53
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.210
in a different format,
it may not be necessarily so good.

54
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.160
But if you have a US based company and
you're gonna collect US based phone

55
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.710
numbers, phone numbers from Canada,
then that's an awesome thing.

56
00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.990
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I know
you got to think bigger.

57
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.953
It's the Internet,
you gotta think about the whole world.

58
00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:40.401
