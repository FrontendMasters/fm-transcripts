00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so, my label has
flipped on to another line, here.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.380
There are actually little micro
arrows in my number field,

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.780
here, where I can crank this up and down,
just by clicking the little arrows.

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.615
Do you have that?

5
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:19.294
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

6
00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:20.157
Okay.

7
00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:22.717
Anyone see any issues here?

8
00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:27.615
Perfectly happy with this,
the way it works?

9
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.180
I would like to abduct
negative eight people.

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.330
Anybody happy with that?

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Actually, yes.

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

13
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.763
You like that idea?

14
00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:40.911
We do want to abduct negative
eight people, after all.

15
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.134
By the way,
you can also type in this field, so

16
00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:49.170
I could have type in that I want
to abduct 7.5, 8, 7 people.

17
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.421
That's completely legit, too.

18
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:52.437
Okay?

19
00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:56.480
I could also just say, how many people
would you like abducted, George?

20
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.396
Poor George, man,
we're really picking on him today.

21
00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:01.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right?

22
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.350
So, remember,

23
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.550
just because the the arrows are there
doesn't mean anybody has to use them.

24
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.795
They are kind of tiny, and you can
still type anything you want in here.

25
00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:15.765
But it is possible to constrain those
arrows because abducting negative people,

26
00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.078
despite what Ryan says,
abducting negative people,

27
00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.830
you probably don't really want to do.

28
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.544
So there's some other attributes for this.

29
00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:29.200
You can have a min, as in a minimum value.

30
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.680
So, I want a minimum of one person
to be abducted because otherwise,

31
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.800
why are you filling out the form?

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.720
Okay?

33
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.990
And a max of 10.

34
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.060
We just don't have more room than that,
in a lot of these spaceships.

35
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.190
So, 10 is gonna be my max.

36
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.470
Okay?

37
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.230
Yes?

38
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.021
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So, I know you can
have multiple things with the same

39
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:50.680
ID-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Uh-huh.

40
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.692
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In HTML.
What about name,

41
00:01:51.692 --> 00:01:56.362
like, if I had another question about-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Every ID has to be unique.

42
00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:57.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Really?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: IDs are the ones

43
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.769
that are unique.

44
00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:01.155
Classes, you can have-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Use one class, many times,

45
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:04.446
but the ID has to be unique for
every web page.

46
00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:09.780
Now, I could take my qty ID from this
page and use it on a different web page,

47
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.730
but within this one web page,
it has to be used only once.

48
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

49
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.354
What about name?

50
00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:17.770
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Name,
typically is unique, as well.

51
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.690
There's nothing that is required,
on the HTML side, but

52
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.310
on the programming side, if you had two
fields that were called the same name,

53
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.460
your script is gonna get confused.

54
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.669
Yeah.
Okay?

55
00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.090
Sound good?

56
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.340
Okay.
So, if we save our form and

57
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.900
we take a look at our revised form,
you'll see,

58
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.340
here, that now I might,
and I hit my up arrow.

59
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.940
I can only go up to 10.

60
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.281
I can only go down to one.

61
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.137
And it just so happens to be
it's doing it in whole numbers,

62
00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:53.980
which is good because we don't want to
abduct half people, only whole people.

63
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.580
Okay?

64
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.114
But once again, you can type anything
in that blank that you want.

65
00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:02.080
We're gonna need some JavaScript,
to double check and

66
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.680
make sure that we have
entered things correctly.

67
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.290
That's the way it's gonna
wind up working out.
