00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.794
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about those legends,
do you like the legends?

2
00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:07.740
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're a little
bit hard to see, aren't they?

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.070
They kinda blend in with
everything else that's there.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.800
Maybe we need to make our legends
a little bit more prominent?

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.970
Okay, so we can do that.

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.017
Let's write a style for that, legend
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

7
00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:30.266
what I did was I said font-weight,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: bold,

8
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.969
that'll help right there.

9
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.940
font-size, I said 1.3rems,
just to make it a little bit bigger.

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.040
I gave it some room on the top.

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.710
If you notice, right now, it's kinda
smashed into the text on the top here.

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.500
So we need a little bit
more room on the top.

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.653
So I said margin-top of 1.5rem,

14
00:00:55.653 --> 00:01:00.027
margin-bottom of 1rem.

15
00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:08.436
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
all of that is all about making it pretty.

16
00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:14.335
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
if you go ahead and save your CSS and

17
00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:19.785
take a look at your webpage,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's a little nicer?

18
00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:22.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Little bit.

19
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Do you think legend is a
block level element or an inline element?

20
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Inline.

21
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You think it's in line
cuz it's inline with the border?

22
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.135
Okay, anyone think it's
a block level element?

23
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.613
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How would we find out for
sure?

24
00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:43.830
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Put a border on it.

25
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.740
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Stick a border on it.

26
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.840
Let's put a border on it.

27
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.140
So let's just put a border on a legend for
a moment.

28
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.318
border: 1 pixel solid blue.

29
00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:02.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what does that tell you?

30
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800
Is it a block level element or
is it an inline element?

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.412
It is an inline element, why?

32
00:02:11.412 --> 00:02:12.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Doesn't
go all the way across.

33
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.798
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It doesn't
go all the way across, and

34
00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:18.760
it is as big as its content, right?

35
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.290
So that is an inline element.

36
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.669
What would happen if we turn legend
it into a block level element?

37
00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:32.907
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's
just see what happens,

38
00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:36.029
let's put in a display: block here and
see what happens.

39
00:02:41.404 --> 00:02:42.478
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not a lot.

40
00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:48.664
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Still in the same place.

41
00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:52.049
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

42
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.055
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How are we doing so far?

43
00:02:57.055 --> 00:03:00.513
It's already looking better,
we still can't read the form itself, but

44
00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.580
the page looks great.

45
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.230
Okay, let's start working on
the legibility of the form itself.

46
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.560
Let's style up those labels.

47
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.877
Are labels inline or are they block?

48
00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:21.501
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is the label tag inline or
block?

49
00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.920
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Inline.

50
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cassie says it's inline.

51
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.380
How many say it's totally inline?

52
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.775
Okay, we have one for inline, and one for
block, and eight I have no ideas.

53
00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:31.613
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I think it depends.

54
00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:33.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] It depends?

55
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

56
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.036
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
why do you say it depends?

57
00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:39.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Cuz for some of the things,
the label has been around a whole thing.

58
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.470
And for some of them it's only been,
I think its label,

59
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.825
maybe its legend that I'm thinking of.

60
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.510
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mm-hm, okay.

61
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.460
Yeah, that is true,
label wrapped around some things entirely.

62
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.570
And in other cases,
it was kind of a standalone kind of thing.

63
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.210
But take a look at our radio buttons,
for example.

64
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.860
Our radio buttons are all
next to each other in a row.

65
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.840
What does that imply?

66
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.300
Maybe it's inline?

67
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.200
So always we can figure it out.

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.892
All we have to do is say
border: 1 pixel solid blue.

69
00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.814
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Stick a border on it,
take a look.

70
00:04:19.043 --> 00:04:20.160
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What does that tell you?

71
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.860
They're inline, Cassie's right, okay?

72
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.705
What happens if we change them to block?

73
00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:33.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anything gonna
change if we change them to block?

74
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.000
What will change in terms of
the way the page looks, Cassie?

75
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.719
&gt;&gt; Cassie: They will probably
be in a column, other than-

76
00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:42.761
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Maybe they'll be in

77
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.160
a column, why is that,
why do you think that?

78
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.466
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Because.

79
00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:54.451
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're as wide as
their containing element, maybe?

80
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:55.676
&gt;&gt; Cassie: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

81
00:04:55.676 --> 00:04:57.600
what's their containing element, Cassie?

82
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.114
&gt;&gt; Cassie: The line.

83
00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:01.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Close,
it's the fieldset, right?

84
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.128
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

85
00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:04.326
let's make them as wide
as the fieldset and

86
00:05:04.326 --> 00:05:07.146
that should kinda push
some stuff down the page?

87
00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:08.510
Let's give it a shot.

88
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.259
So let's change this border to display,

89
00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:18.435
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: block.

90
00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:19.545
[COUGH]

91
00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Whoa, pretty cool?

92
00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:32.970
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That really helped a lot.

93
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.412
Already it's much more readable.

94
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:41.187
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
sometimes it's just those little

95
00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:45.980
things that will help make these
things work a little bit better?
