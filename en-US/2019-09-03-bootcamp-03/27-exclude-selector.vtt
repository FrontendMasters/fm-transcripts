00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We didn't really mean to do
that to the radio buttons though, right?

2
00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:05.514
We actually wanted everything but
the radio buttons.

3
00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:07.840
So not the radio buttons.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.089
And we actually have the same problem
here with our checkbox too, right?

5
00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.896
So not the checkbox.

6
00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:19.480
So all the input types, but not the radio
buttons, and not the checkboxes, right?

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.229
Okay, I have something crazy here for you.

8
00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:27.148
So we're gonna change the selector,

9
00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:31.688
there's actually a not, how cool is that?

10
00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:34.454
So we can say not something.

11
00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:40.230
And what I'm going to do here,
inside of the parentheses for not,

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.262
we're gonna put in some square brackets,
and we're going to say type = radio.

13
00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:52.815
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So like I said,
this is a crazy selector.

14
00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:57.093
This is well beyond where you are, but
I just wanna give you a little bit of

15
00:00:57.093 --> 00:01:00.970
something, to show you there's
more out there to learn, okay?

16
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.707
So when you see square brackets like this,

17
00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:07.900
that is an indication that this
is called an attribute selector.

18
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.802
So far we've been selecting
everything with HTML tags, right?

19
00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:16.021
We select our aids,
we select our paragraphs,

20
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.571
we select our whatever,
our labels, our legends.

21
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:22.768
But this time,
we're selecting by our attribute.

22
00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:25.820
So in other words, type = radio.

23
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.151
So this selector, so far, says input.

24
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:35.078
All the input tags, but
not the radio buttons, do this, right?

25
00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:37.373
Save that, let's see what that looks like.

26
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:43.039
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Woo, much better?

27
00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.571
So we fixed that little problem.

28
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:49.977
We also need to fix the checkbox though,
don't we?

29
00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:53.854
So we can pile these on top of each other.

30
00:01:53.854 --> 00:02:00.813
So let's pile another one on here,
not, once again.

31
00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:05.573
And inside of here,
we're gonna say type = checkbox.

32
00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.743
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's no
spaces in any of that.

33
00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:15.744
So input colon, not type radio,
not type checkbox, which does work.

34
00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:18.448
Okay, so that keeps our formatting.

35
00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:22.690
When you have a selector that doesn't work
at all, it just throws out the styling for

36
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.906
that particular item.

37
00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:27.814
And you saw how the whole page broke at
that point, or not the whole page, but

38
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.863
all the styling associated with that
selector, it all broke at the same time.

39
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.352
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, now I have
one more thing I wanna add to this.

40
00:02:37.352 --> 00:02:42.616
This is good for everything, but I'd
also like to apply it to the text area,

41
00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:46.590
down here at the bottom,
I'd also like to apply it here.

42
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.883
So what could I do to add all these same

43
00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:55.880
styles to the text area
down on the bottom?

44
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.177
Besides the craziness
I have here right now.

45
00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:03.055
Hint, you do know how to do this, yeah?

46
00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:03.725
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Comma, select?

47
00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:09.235
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Comma,
text area, in this case,

48
00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:12.657
it's the text area.

49
00:03:12.657 --> 00:03:18.614
So for all the inputs, but not the radio
buttons and not the checkboxes,

50
00:03:18.614 --> 00:03:23.313
and for the text area,
this is the crazy thing I wanna do.

51
00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:27.917
So just to show you, there's way more for
you to learn, here in CSS.

52
00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.939
And then, isn't that nice?

53
00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.063
Look at all those nice big input boxes.

54
00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:36.189
They line up, isn't that lovely?

55
00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.283
Aren't you happy?

56
00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:39.467
I'm happy.

57
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:45.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the size of the input
box based on the font size then?

58
00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:48.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The size of
the input boxes have to do with,

59
00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:53.655
we have a width here associated with that,
the width.

60
00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:58.295
We put in some padding, and
we also put in a font size in here too.

61
00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:02.405
And I also put in, because remember
what I was telling you about,

62
00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:04.813
pointy corners and rounded corners?

63
00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:08.025
Look at all those form fields,
what have they got?

64
00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:09.024
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Pointy corners.

65
00:04:09.024 --> 00:04:14.084
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Unsightly pointy corners.

66
00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:18.523
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so border radius,

67
00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:20.651
10 pixels.

68
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:23.368
You can round the corners of anything,
go on ahead and put that in.

69
00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:28.612
And you should have, so lovely.

70
00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:30.421
Aren't those pretty?

71
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:33.081
So pretty, yes?

72
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:38.387
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So the border radius
also gave me those weird 3D effects.

73
00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:41.775
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It does give you
kinda those weird 3D effects, right?

74
00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:46.710
You could set your border to none,
and that should make that go away.
