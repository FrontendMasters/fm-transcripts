00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
the next thing we need to add is a date.

2
00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:07.413
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Guess how
the date tag is gonna look?

3
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Date?

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.280
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Kind of like that, right?

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.260
Same sort of format.

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.662
The ID is gonna be what?

7
00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:20.717
What should we call the ID?

8
00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:23.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The date?

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about date?

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.104
What should we call the name?

11
00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:30.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Date.

12
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about date?

13
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.383
Okay?

14
00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:37.498
And our input type is gonna be what?

15
00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:38.627
How about date?

16
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:47.464
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so a little bit
about the date type here in HTML.

17
00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:53.360
This date input type is
a relatively new addition to HTML.

18
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.490
And there's actually not a lot of
consensus about how the date tag looks and

19
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.310
how it functions.

20
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.490
So there's actually quite a few browsers
that don't support the date tag, yet.

21
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.230
And the way it looks in Firefox and
Chrome is somewhat different.

22
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.150
So I want you to be aware of that.

23
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.840
This may not necessarily be ready for
prime time, the date tag here.

24
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.456
A lot of people will actually
use JavaScript instead.

25
00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:20.777
You can add little bits of JavaScript
to to mimic the date look and

26
00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:25.360
feel that you're going to see here for
this particular item.

27
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.281
But before we take a quick peek at it,
let's go on ahead and

28
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.910
put in our label tag right
around requested date.

29
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.037
What is this gonna be?

30
00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:35.488
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Date.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Label [LAUGH],

31
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:39.919
&lt;label for=date&gt;, right?

32
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.029
And /label.

33
00:01:45.303 --> 00:01:45.803
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

34
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What if you
wanted to add a time as well?

35
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is a time option
as well, if you wanted to do that.

36
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.230
I'm not gonna go through that,
but you can look that up.

37
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.230
Okay, so I am in Firefox right now.

38
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.480
And so once I've coded my date field
in you'll see that, by default,

39
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.980
it says right here, mm/dd/yyyy,
at least here in the United States.

40
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.640
Those of you who are overseas
using a different date format,

41
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.160
you may see a different sort of
placeholder here in that particular field.

42
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.980
When I click on it,

43
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.360
I'll actually get a little drop-down
here with a little calendar, okay?

44
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.470
So this is Firefox, and
that's how that looks here.

45
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.811
If I go over to Chrome, and

46
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:36.528
take a look at it here,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Chrome has

47
00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:37.940
got the same thing.

48
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.740
It's got that same
little date placeholder.

49
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.186
When I roll my mouse over it, it actually
has a little down arrow that appears.

50
00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:46.560
That didn't happen in Firefox.

51
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.240
And when we click on that,
it also gives us a calendar, but

52
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.420
it's a different formatted calendar.

53
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.380
See what I'm talking about?

54
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.240
These things are somewhat different.

55
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.090
They're coming from the browser.

56
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.090
We didn't code these things,
they're coming from the browser.

57
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.390
And this is the way they look by default.

58
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.120
So if you want something pretty, and you
want it to be consistent across browsers,

59
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.920
it might be better to use JavaScript for
this particular functionality.

60
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.794
And that's all I have to say,
[LAUGH] cuz you get JavaScript later, yes?

61
00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:19.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was gonna
ask if you could CSS?

62
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

63
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.314
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're saying JavaScript,
though?

64
00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:26.001
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: JavaScript's
probably a better option, okay?

65
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:30.959
Sweet, and by the way, those of you out
there who might be looking at it with

66
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.050
Safari or Edge,
I have no idea what you're gonna get.

67
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.733
It might be completely different
from what you just saw here,

68
00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.535
cuz that date formatting is coming
from the browser once again.

69
00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:46.426
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, moving on,
how many people would you like abducted?

70
00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:50.480
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, you might not
wanna just go just by yourself.

71
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.080
Maybe you wanna bring your friends, right?

72
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.063
Okay, guess what this is gonna look like?

73
00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.730
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Oops, not like that,
it's gonna look like this.

74
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.878
Just like our other input types,

75
00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:08.801
only we're gonna change a few things here,
okay?

76
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:15.479
So this time we're gonna change
our type here to number, okay?

77
00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.221
So this is obviously
gonna collect a number,

78
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:21.405
cuz we're asking how many
people we want abducted.

79
00:04:23.483 --> 00:04:26.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then we have an ID.

80
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.790
And for that, I use the value of
qty as in quantity, shortened qty.

81
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.167
And my name is also qty.

82
00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:47.393
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then, of course,
what else do we need to do?

83
00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:48.288
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Change it to a label.

84
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:55.537
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Change it to a label,
&lt;label for=qty&gt;.

85
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:05.769
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, fabulous,
let's refresh our page.
