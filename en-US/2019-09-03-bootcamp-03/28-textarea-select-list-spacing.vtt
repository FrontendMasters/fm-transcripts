00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:04.124
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have a couple
little tweaks left to go here,

2
00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:09.706
this is all kind of tight,
a little bit tight together here, okay?

3
00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:15.795
So I have some more stuff for that,
this goes back to crazy selectors again.

4
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:18.242
I'm gonna scroll back up to my paragraph.

5
00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.061
So this paragraph worked really well.

6
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:25.315
This has got a nice little bit
of margin to separate things,

7
00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.110
but I need to apply
the same kinda styling.

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.742
I'd like to apply it here to what type
of abduction experience do you want?

9
00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:38.850
I need a little space between that and
those radio buttons, don't I?

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.644
Okay, so let's go take a look at our code,
where is that?

11
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
so I have a label here.

12
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.430
What type of abduction
experience do you want?

13
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.950
So you guys would probably
write a class for that.

14
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.250
And you could stack a class here,
like whatever.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.370
Some sort of class here with the paragraph
and put in that margin on the top and

16
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.260
that would get you that space.

17
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.770
But in the interest of
showing you weirdo selectors,

18
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.620
notice that that label has a for
on it, right?

19
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.990
That's an attribute selector, and
it's unique here in this document.

20
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.746
Cool, so
we could use an attribute selector,

21
00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:26.636
just use our square brackets like this,
and we could say, [for='abtype'].

22
00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.703
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is Jen showing off,
this is not like, and I mean,

23
00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:35.917
it's actually good practice, you don't
have to create a class here or anything.

24
00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:37.130
But I'm just, again,

25
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.656
just trying to show you a little bit
more of what's going on out here.

26
00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:42.770
You could definitely do this with a class.

27
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.388
You could do what I just showed
you before with a class too.

28
00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:50.040
But if you know some of these cool CSS
selectors, then you don't have to use so

29
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.690
many classes, all right?

30
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.727
You can keep your code nice and clean.

31
00:01:53.727 --> 00:02:00.051
So using [for='abtype'],
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we go ahead and

32
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.285
add that little bit of space, yeah, nice.

33
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:09.007
The other thing is, we need some space
here between my Select drop-down, right,

34
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:10.361
and Special requests?

35
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.750
That's really the last thing that we
need here to make this form look pretty.

36
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.785
This is a little bit tight
in terms of our space.

37
00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:21.860
So let's look again at our HTML,
all right.

38
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.350
So, how could we create some space between

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.850
this label here for comments and
that Select drop-down, right?

40
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.390
That's where we are,
that's where that space is.

41
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.198
Between Special requests and Select one.

42
00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:49.529
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How could we
create some space there, yeah?

43
00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.193
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's you.

44
00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:54.169
&gt;&gt; Cassie: All right, [LAUGH] could
we just add a comma after the input,

45
00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.030
not all that stuff, and
just put a select afterwards?

46
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could, sure.

47
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.600
Although that's got a lot of other stuff,
but let's try it.

48
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.332
So the crazy selector down here,
the very last one on our page.

49
00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.842
You wanna put a comma here and say Select?

50
00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:10.582
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Yeah.

51
00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:13.057
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
let's see what happens.

52
00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:17.067
So we're gonna add select to our
list of all these selectors here,

53
00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:20.801
on our absolute crazy one here,
and let's see what happens.

54
00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:25.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Ooh, so
that rounded the corners and

55
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.243
it made it the same length,
and it gave us a nice font.

56
00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:32.507
That's pretty nice, great solution.

57
00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:37.848
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and now you know
a little bit about how to tweak these.

58
00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.369
You could go back to these labels,

59
00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.880
you could add a little bit of padding
underneath if you wanted to do that.

60
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.830
I think we already have a label property
here, or a label declaration, yeah.

61
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.019
So we could say padding or
margin, either one, bottom,

62
00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.269
let's say 0.3rem,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On our label,

63
00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.754
this is around line 46, 47,
48, something like that.

64
00:04:08.618 --> 00:04:11.724
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That'd give us just a
little bit of breathing room between those

65
00:04:11.724 --> 00:04:13.461
words and the actual labels there.

66
00:04:15.494 --> 00:04:17.025
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nice.

67
00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:21.242
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep?

68
00:04:21.242 --> 00:04:28.892
&gt;&gt; Cassie: How do you make those check
boxes pretty in just the radio points?

69
00:04:28.892 --> 00:04:30.250
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These radio buttons here?

70
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.900
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Yeah,
how can we make that more pretty?

71
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.547
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: More pretty?

72
00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:33.795
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Yeah.

73
00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:38.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'll give you that for
homework.

74
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.970
&gt;&gt; Cassie: All right.

75
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Why don't you look into
it and come back and tell us tomorrow?

76
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.670
Seriously.

77
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.190
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Okay.

78
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.261
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, that would be good.

79
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:47.160
Yeah, Dylan?

80
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.160
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Other than her solution, from
going down and then putting in a comma,

81
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.903
I just put it back up on the top of
the p for=abtype comma bracket for

82
00:04:56.903 --> 00:04:59.896
comments, is there any issue with that?

83
00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:04.332
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nope, nope, but
just be aware, so Cassie's solution here,

84
00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:09.820
she added select here to the bottom so
this adds all of these styles.

85
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.710
It made it a block, it gave us a margin,
it gave us a width,

86
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.870
it gave us a font-family, padding, blah
blah blah, right, gave us all of that.

87
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.177
If you put it up here on the other one,
this one here, p,

88
00:05:21.177 --> 00:05:26.224
[for="abype"] and
we add it on to that with whatever for=,

89
00:05:26.224 --> 00:05:32.340
whatever the other thing was,
then all we're adding is the margin.

90
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.484
That's all we're adding, which is better?

91
00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:36.333
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It depends.

92
00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:41.498
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends, yeah,
what do you wanna do, right?

93
00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:43.800
Okay, how are you guys feeling?

94
00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:46.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

95
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: To do what Dylan was
talking about, is that colon and

96
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.520
then the same square bracket and-
&gt;&gt; Dylan: It was just a comma.

97
00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:56.855
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: It was a comma and

98
00:05:56.855 --> 00:05:59.083
then [for=
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Comment.

99
00:05:59.083 --> 00:05:59.727
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Comment, okay.

100
00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.206
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, so yeah.

101
00:06:01.206 --> 00:06:02.722
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: There's
a comment [INAUDIBLE]

102
00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:04.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Instead of abtype,

103
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.663
this would be comment.

104
00:06:05.663 --> 00:06:07.266
So the selector would look just like this.

105
00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.947
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You just put that comma and
then that, yeah, okay.

106
00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:10.552
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep.

107
00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:11.333
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: And a space, too.

108
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.645
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [for="comment"] or
comments,

109
00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:19.824
I don't remember which it was,
but whichever is correct.

110
00:06:19.824 --> 00:06:23.460
Yeah, you can just line them up
separated by commas, just like that.
