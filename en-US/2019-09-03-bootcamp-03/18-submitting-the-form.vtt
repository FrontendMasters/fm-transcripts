1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.092
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, now that
we have finished our HTML form, so

2
00:00:03.092 --> 00:00:05.792
we've added all of the form
fields to our form.

3
00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:10.119
Our form currently does
absolutely nothing.

4
00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.357
So this next part that we need to add to
the form is actually all of the things to

5
00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:15.626
make it do something.

6
00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:19.744
The thing we want it to do is we want it
to take whatever we type into the form.

7
00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:22.260
We're gonna dump it into an email and

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.413
we're gonna send that email off
to you as the website owner.

9
00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:30.189
So if you return to the notes for today,

10
00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.265
this is the
frontendmastersgithub.io/bootcamp/forms.

11
00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.857
You could go through here and refer to all
of the things we've talked about today.

12
00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:41.641
So the form tag is here.

13
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.014
I'm gonna talk more about
that in just a second.

14
00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:46.874
We've also talked about
the input type of text.

15
00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:52.156
The input type of tel, email, date,

16
00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:59.432
number, radio, check box,
text area and select.

17
00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:04.589
So as you take a look at all of those,
they have descriptions of what they are.

18
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.931
We have links to where you
can read more about them on

19
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:10.185
the Mozilla Developer Network and

20
00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:14.395
there is a short example of how
these things can be used in a form.

21
00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.994
So you can take a look at that, as well.

22
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:19.390
And of course,
we talked a lot about the label tag.

23
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.495
The one type that is listed here
that we have not talked about yet,

24
00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:24.822
which will momentarily
is input type of hidden.

25
00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:27.080
I'm gonna say something
about that in just a moment.

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.350
So now that we actually have the whole
form built out at this point,

27
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.940
let's go ahead and add the programming
to make that form do something.

28
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.250
So here, we have a section of this
website that is devoted to adding

29
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.360
the processing to the form.

30
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.741
So generally speaking, the way that
processing is gonna happen is,

31
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.383
it's going to happen on the web server and

32
00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:54.331
you don't have the background
to write that kind of code yet.

33
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.313
I don't have that kind of background to
write the code even though I've been in

34
00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:58.766
this business for a really long time.

35
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.462
So I always partner with someone
who knows what they're doing.

36
00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:07.369
And Brent who was our fabulous back-end
developer wrote us a great little script

37
00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.841
to go ahead and do exactly what we
requested which is fill out the form, and

38
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:15.120
it will email the results
of that form to us.

39
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.412
And so what Brent has told
us to do is the following.

40
00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:21.340
So we wanna make sure to take
the action of the form here.

41
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.572
So that's the action attribute
that goes in the form tag.

42
00:02:24.572 --> 00:02:29.353
This is the link that we need to use and
then we need to use the method of post.

43
00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:31.865
So these are two attributes
that go with the form tag.

44
00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.852
Let's go ahead and add those.

45
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:39.334
So here inside of VS code around line 13,

46
00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:42.576
you should find your form tag.

47
00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:49.088
And what we'll do then is
just copy that big, long URL.

48
00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:50.275
Go ahead and copy it.

49
00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:55.068
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then we'll go ahead and paste this.

50
00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:57.435
So this is going to be
the action of our forum.

51
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:05.037
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And your developer
will always give you that action.

52
00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:06.444
So it could be anything,

53
00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:10.129
you'll just have to ask your
developer what you should be using.

54
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.018
So the next thing we're going to
add is the method for this form.

55
00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:20.587
The method is how the information in
the form is transmitted to the server.

56
00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:24.939
So getting post are the two most
common methodologies that are used.

57
00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.211
The get methodology sends
the information over the URL.

58
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.447
The post will send it behind the scenes
and Brent told us to use post.

59
00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:35.800
So go ahead and choose post.

60
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.745
All right, so
now that we have the action and

61
00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:43.609
the method set here, there's more
information that he that he gave us.

62
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:50.392
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it says here that we're
gonna need to configure a hidden input

63
00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:53.137
field and
the name of that should be send to and

64
00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:58.210
the value should be the email address that
you use to register for boot camp, okay?

65
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.197
So again, first thinking about security
of this particular script and here is

66
00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:08.257
an easy way for us to be able to configure
what email address description go to and

67
00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:13.338
an easy way to do that it's just simply
putting in and hidden field in your HTML.

68
00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:16.396
That way, we don't have to open up
the script and configure it and

69
00:04:16.396 --> 00:04:17.292
deal the servers.

70
00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:19.118
None of us need that headache.

71
00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:23.382
So the way to add a hidden field
is just up here just above

72
00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:27.021
the section on adding
processing to the form.

73
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:28.388
And as you see here,

74
00:04:28.388 --> 00:04:33.393
the hidden form fields are sometimes
used with form processing scripts.

75
00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:35.925
They are always used, but
they are occasionally use.

76
00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:37.210
There could be as few as one.

77
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.067
There could be dozens of these.

78
00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:42.166
It sort of depends on the developer and
how they wrote it.

79
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:46.961
There might be none and your processing
script developer will tell you

80
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.139
what to use for the ID,
the name and the value.

81
00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.866
So what I'm gonna do here is just
copy line three on this code.

82
00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:57.293
You don't need the form tag here.

83
00:04:57.293 --> 00:04:59.638
There's only one form tag per page.

84
00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:04.655
Just copy this middle part here
about the input type of hidden.

85
00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:07.531
So go ahead and
highlight that, and copy it.

86
00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:13.991
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then in our form, we
can put the hidden tag absolutely anywhere

87
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.360
at all as long as it's
inside of the form tag.

88
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.248
I'm gonna put mine right
here after the form tag and

89
00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:25.869
then we need to modify this
according to what Brent had said.

90
00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:32.657
So he indicated that the name should be
send_ to and that the value should be

91
00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:38.071
the email address that you use
to sign up for this boot camp.

92
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.990
So here's mine.

93
00:05:44.426 --> 00:05:47.838
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Ask for the ID,
the idea actually strictly isn't required.

94
00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:49.651
This is a hidden field.

95
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:54.827
And so no label tag is required,
because it doesn't need to be accessible.

96
00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:58.161
So therefore, we actually we
don't need an ID on this either.

97
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.283
If you leave the ID in there,
it's not gonna hurt anything.

98
00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:04.568
I'm just gonna take mine out,
because it's just not needed.

99
00:06:06.914 --> 00:06:09.655
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
if we go ahead and save that,

100
00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:12.675
we can put that into our default browser.

101
00:06:18.367 --> 00:06:22.036
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And at this point, if you
go ahead and click the submit button,

102
00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:25.499
you'll actually get an error
on the second page that says,

103
00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.716
please provide your email address and

104
00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:31.826
that is actually error checking that
is happening on the server side.

105
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:35.494
So the whole contents of the form
have been submitted to the server.

106
00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:39.810
One of the first things that script is
gonna do is check to make sure that

107
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.660
certain required fields are filled out and
not a lot of junk has been sent over.

108
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.500
It's one of the ways you can hack
a website is through sending odd things

109
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.981
through fields and forms.

110
00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:52.756
So Brent put some error
checking in there and

111
00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:56.509
this indicates that we should
be providing email address.

112
00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.200
So and in fact, if they do this again,
it will ask me for my name also.

113
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.542
Those are the two required
fields on this form.

114
00:07:02.542 --> 00:07:06.518
So I'm gonna go ahead and
put in my name and I'm gonna go ahead, and

115
00:07:06.518 --> 00:07:08.020
put in my email address.

116
00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:17.225
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And now when I submit this,
this is gonna give me a message on

117
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:21.620
the screen here that says
that the message was sent.

118
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.120
So if I check my email now,

119
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.020
I should find an email message
from this particular script.
