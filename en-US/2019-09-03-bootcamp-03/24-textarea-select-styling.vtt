WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.778
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: My text area.

2
00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:08.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna
set a height on this.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.360
10rem, and I'm going to set
a padding on it too, 1rem.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.420
What do you think this is gonna do for
my text area?

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.218
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Make it bigger.

6
00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:22.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make it bigger.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.730
We have a tiny little box to start with,
we want it bigger.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670
We can just use CSS to do that.

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.776
Historically there's been HTML attributes
that you could use to make your text area

10
00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:35.344
bigger.

11
00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:37.136
Not needed anymore.

12
00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:41.810
We can just use CSS to do that, okay?

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.007
So we go ahead and refresh the page.

14
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:48.610
Hey, we have a bigger text area.

15
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.897
Isn't that nice?

16
00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:51.685
So nice.

17
00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:56.442
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And how about this select,

18
00:00:56.442 --> 00:01:01.172
anyone bothered by the size
of the font on the Select?

19
00:01:01.172 --> 00:01:05.863
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm bothered by it cuz I'm

20
00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:06.665
an old person.

21
00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:07.457
It's tiny.

22
00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:09.060
I can't see it.

23
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.768
I want it bigger.

24
00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:15.496
So I'm gonna go ahead and
add a style to make that bigger.

25
00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:19.359
So I'm gonna go ahead and say select,

26
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.960
how would I make the font,
bigger font size?

27
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.908
Font size.

28
00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:27.620
And then pick something.

29
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.948
It's not one rim right now.

30
00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:31.152
So I'm gonna go ahead and
just set it to one rem.

31
00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:44.657
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now I can read it,
sort of somewhat better.

32
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.721
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

33
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.290
Next up I want to style
this button down here.

34
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.750
That has got to be the tiniest button
I have ever seen in my entire life.

35
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.920
I'm really bothered by
the size of this button.

36
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.465
I want it much bigger.

37
00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.707
I want it a different color,

38
00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:08.384
because it's very lost down
here at the bottom of the page.

39
00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:12.841
Buttons are very commonly styled
in all kinds of crazy ways.

40
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.528
So, I've got some good stuff here for
this button.

41
00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:20.120
Let's style up our button.

42
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.269
First of all, let's go ahead and
change our font size to one rem.

43
00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.928
That alone is going to help
our button tremendously.

44
00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.348
Just change the font size.

45
00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:34.439
And then you can actually
start to see the button, yeah.

46
00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:43.528
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm going to
put a margin on this button.

47
00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:48.432
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2rem 0,
what does that mean, 2rem 0?

48
00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2 rems on the top.

49
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.122
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 2 rems on the top and
the bottom?

50
00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:56.771
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 0 on the lett [INAUDIBLE]

51
00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:00.187
0 on the left and
the right, correct, okay?

52
00:03:00.187 --> 00:03:06.455
So that's gonna give this button a little
bit of breathing room down here.

53
00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:09.110
Okay, little bit more breathing room.

54
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.044
Okay.

55
00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:23.647
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now we can go ahead and
change its color.

56
00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:25.687
So I have a background color.

57
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.604
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
that background color is bb342F,

58
00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:37.324
which is a lovely shade of red.

59
00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:42.044
You can also pull off a different color
off of the galaxy using your colorZilla

60
00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:45.035
eyedropper and
just run it around on the galaxy.

61
00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:48.709
And find a nice looking color that
will work great for that button.

62
00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.492
Go on ahead and choose something.

63
00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:54.089
Once i do that you won't really
be able to see the text so

64
00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.000
we need to change the text color.

65
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.342
What is my property for text color?

66
00:03:58.342 --> 00:03:59.296
Just color.

67
00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:05.435
Just color, I don't know why they did
that, but okay, just color, white.

68
00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:17.752
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
looking a little more appealing, okay?

69
00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:21.297
We still got that 90 styling
thing going on here,

70
00:04:21.297 --> 00:04:24.640
right sort of popped off the web page.

71
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.354
Everybody see that?

72
00:04:26.354 --> 00:04:31.107
Anybody who have any idea what's causing
it to sort of pop off the web page and

73
00:04:31.107 --> 00:04:32.455
then 3D sort of way?

74
00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:35.361
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
there's sort of button decoration.

75
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:37.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Maybe it's some
kind of button decoration?

76
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which might be a border.

77
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.684
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Border, yeah.

78
00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:45.127
Let's try resetting the border here.

79
00:04:45.127 --> 00:04:48.265
So if we go ahead and

80
00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:53.179
say border, how about none?

81
00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:59.311
[LAUGH] Let's turn off
the border that we have, okay?

82
00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:03.397
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we will make our button a little flatter.

83
00:05:03.397 --> 00:05:06.553
Still doesn't look very clickable does it.

84
00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:13.434
Okay but it's getting more appealing
looking alright, so next step.

85
00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:18.912
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's put some padding
on it to make this button bigger.

86
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.414
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 0.5rem 1rem.

87
00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:30.524
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
where is this padding going?

88
00:05:30.524 --> 00:05:32.030
0.5rem where?

89
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.633
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Top and bottom.

90
00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:33.752
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Top and bottom.

91
00:05:33.752 --> 00:05:35.390
1rem where?

92
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sides.

93
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.943
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Left and
right, okay let's add that.

94
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.869
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's starting
to look like a button.

95
00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:50.827
Just adding a little padding, right?

96
00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:57.440
Now, notice how nicely we
rounded the corners here.

97
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.671
Notice how our button has pointy corners,
all right?

98
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.011
This is another one of those
fashion things, all right.

99
00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:09.291
If you're going to go with pointy corners
go all the way all the corners are pointy.

100
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:12.698
If you're going to go
with rounded corners,

101
00:06:12.698 --> 00:06:15.665
go all the way it should all be rounded.

102
00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:20.925
And they should generally be rounded
about the same amount, okay?

103
00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:24.506
So I'm gonna go ahead and

104
00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:30.652
add to this a border radius of 10 pixels.

105
00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:33.855
That's actually what I
used before I think.

106
00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:38.673
Yeah, so I'm being consistent, 10 pixels.

107
00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:43.840
[COUGH] And if we refresh the page

108
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.617
Whoo looking like a button.

109
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.993
What do you think?

110
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:52.910
Okay, yes.

111
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.750
So I think there should be a hover state.

112
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.030
What a great idea.

113
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.224
How about a hover state?

114
00:06:58.224 --> 00:06:59.294
I also have a question.

115
00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.624
So that is a clickable link.

116
00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:03.629
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How come when
I put my cursor over it,

117
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:05.645
it doesn't change to a pointy hand?

118
00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:06.887
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

119
00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:10.191
Because that's the way the browsers
their buttons dealt with.

120
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:13.058
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so
this is a safari thing and not well?

121
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.918
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well but it's actually
the same here I'm using Firefox and

122
00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:18.616
I have a pointy arrow also when
I run on the mouse over it.

123
00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:22.633
There is a way to change that in CSS,
it's the cursor property.

124
00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:24.160
So that we can take a look at that.
