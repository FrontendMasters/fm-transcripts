00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So some of you are probably
wondering at this point why it

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.890
didn't work.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.100
And you might be wondering
where some of the big pitfalls

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.100
are in terms of configuring
a form like this.

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.430
And so a lot of these go back
to our processing script and

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.190
the way that processing script was
put together, and its requirements.

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.710
So if you got any of
its requirements wrong,

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.650
the script is expecting certain things.

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.250
If it doesn't get what it expects, then it
just sort of throws up its hands and says,

10
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.690
I don't know what to do,
I'm just going to make an error.

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.160
So things you need to
be sure to get right.

12
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.820
First of all,
make sure you have all the characters, and

13
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.570
you copy that URL correctly.

14
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.274
It's really easy to leave off
a character here or there or

15
00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:46.989
forget something in
the configuration of that form tag.

16
00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.074
So make sure you've
copied the full URL and

17
00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:55.142
all the capitalizations and lower cases,
all of that is all correct.

18
00:00:55.142 --> 00:00:58.891
Make sure the method is set to post and
not to get or

19
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.012
to any of the other dialogues, values.

20
00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:05.718
Make sure that the value of
your hidden form field is set

21
00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:10.240
to the email address you use
to register for the boot camp.

22
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.560
Those email addresses
have been whitelisted,

23
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.350
this is to prevent this script
from getting out of control and

24
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.790
spamming the entire globe
with unsavory messages.

25
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.030
So make sure that that is
an approved email address,

26
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.000
and the way it's approved is because
you used it to register for boot camp.

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.100
Make sure the name of that
hidden field is called send_to,

28
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.660
all lower case, no hyphens.

29
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.800
It's not one solid word.

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.890
It is send_to, all lower case, just
like that, and it is a name, not an ID.

31
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.430
As we go on down the page, in general,
you need to be sure that the names of your

32
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.410
form fields here are the same as what I
have called my names in my form fields.

33
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.270
You can change around
the IDs here if you wish.

34
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.960
That's fine.

35
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.230
You can call the IDs whatever you want but
the names as I have coded this form

36
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.420
are important in order to
make this script work.

37
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.083
Once again,
this is the way the script has been coded.

38
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:15.158
It's expecting these names to be submitted
in order for the script to work correctly.

39
00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:18.220
So make sure you spell name correctly.

40
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.390
Make sure you use the same spelling for

41
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.260
all of the name fields here
that I have used here.

42
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.568
No capital letters, no funny characters,
make sure you spell them all correctly.

43
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.810
And then finally, as always,

44
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.960
you can always run your form
through the HTML validator.

45
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.372
Sometimes there'll be some
other funny thing that,

46
00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:43.279
some other funny mistake you've
made somewhere along the way.

47
00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:48.046
You forgot to close a tag, or
you left out punctuation, or

48
00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:51.468
you literally spelled something wrong.

49
00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:53.366
Computers are very literal, and

50
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:56.633
these kinds of errors are going
to throw everything off.

51
00:02:56.633 --> 00:03:01.406
If you put them in the validator, the
validator will catch those mistakes for

52
00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:06.328
you, so that is a great check to make sure
that everything else is correct in this

53
00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:07.666
particular script.

54
00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.653
Those are some of the typical things
that can go wrong with the script.

55
00:03:10.653 --> 00:03:15.163
Check those things and in all likelihood
what you did was one of those things and

56
00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:17.620
if you don't see it right now, walk away,

57
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.920
go take a little walk around the
neighborhood, come back in a half an hour,

58
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.779
or an hour or so, and look again,
and it might pop right out at you.

59
00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.732
So hopefully all your forms are working
but this is the way web development is.

60
00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.251
Sometimes, things don't work,
you need to go in,

61
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.673
you need to double-check
some of your settings.

62
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:41.234
If your code is not working, one of the
form fields doesn't have to be submitting,

63
00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:46.110
it's likely because the name
is not what I used my example.

64
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.140
Look into the end folder, so
you see how we have a begin folder and

65
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.570
we have an end folder.

66
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.290
Look in the end folder, and look at the
names that I used, if they're in there,

67
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.540
hopefully they're in there, if they're
not, use the IDs, they're the same thing.

68
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.080
And make sure that those
are the names that you are using for

69
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.490
your form fields on your form as well.

70
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.470
Because JavaScript is looking for
those specific names, in order for

71
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.410
things to work, okay?

72
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.439
So double-check all of those names.

73
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.200
After that,
we're just gonna move on to the CSS.

74
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.910
All right, cuz goodness knows our forum
is completely unusable the way it is.

75
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.660
It looks horrible.
