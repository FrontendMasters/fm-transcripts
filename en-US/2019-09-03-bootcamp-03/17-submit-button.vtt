00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody wanna tell me
what we're missing from this form now?

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.390
Other than like some kinda styling,
cuz it looks awful?

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.200
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Submit?

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about a Submit button?

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or Reset.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That might be a good
thing to add is a Submit button.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.553
The Reset buttons have
historically been put in place.

8
00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:20.695
But has anybody ever filled
out a form before, and

9
00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:22.565
then clicked the Reset button by mistake?

10
00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:24.337
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: By mistake, and

11
00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:25.960
then eased everything you typed in?

12
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.870
I don't think they're
really all that helpful.

13
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.600
So I think you actually find people not
doing the Reset buttons these days.

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.290
But a Submit button would be
a great thing to add to this form,

15
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020
because it's not gonna work without it,
right?

16
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.870
So we need to go ahead and put that in.

17
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.746
If you want it inside the fieldset,
you're gonna put it here,

18
00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:49.726
in between the /label tag and
the /fieldset around line 58.

19
00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:52.434
If you want it outside of the fieldset,

20
00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:56.466
then you're gonna put in
between line 59 and line 60.

21
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.850
And it just depends on where you
would like that button to be.

22
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.990
I'm gonna put mine here
outside of the fieldset.

23
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.467
So it sort of will look like
you have a section of the form,

24
00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:09.570
you completed another section of the form,
and then the button down there by itself.

25
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.360
And so I've kind of been
previewing what that tag might be.

26
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.730
What might this tag be?

27
00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:22.883
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Submit?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about button?

28
00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:32.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
button type="submit", okay?

29
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.324
And then we can put in our text, Submit.

30
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:38.684
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's the text
that we wanna show on the button.

31
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then close your button tag.

32
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.540
No ID, because there's no label.

33
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.371
No name, because the button has
nothing to with any values that we're

34
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.585
trying to process on the server.

35
00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:56.870
This is just sending the information over.

36
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.020
And then therefore there's also
no value for the button, right?

37
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.084
Does that does that all make sense as to
why this one's a little bit different?

38
00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:07.103
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, all right,

39
00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:10.160
so the button type is submit.

40
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.670
Okay, but
the we put in the word Submit here.

41
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.890
We could also say Order your abduction
experience, that's cool too.

42
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.730
You can say whatever you want on
that particular button, right?

43
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.700
Whatever you type in there will
be the text that's on the button.

44
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.280
Go ahead and save it, and when you refresh
the page, you should see a button.

45
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.490
There it is.

46
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.540
And when you click it,
nothing should happen.

47
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.180
Did it work,
did absolutely nothing happen?

48
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.108
Fabulous.
