1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now we get on to some ones
that are a little bit more different.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.380
So we've done a whole bunch of
different input types here.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.850
They've all been variations on a blank,
right?

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.787
So we've had plain old texts,
we had phone numbers, we had e-mail,

5
00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:16.973
we had dates, we had numbers.

6
00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:19.426
Those are all basically
a field that looks like this,

7
00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:21.770
little box that looks like this.

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.010
Okay, so now, we're gonna move on to
some other types of possibilities here.

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.805
And so, in this particular case,

10
00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:34.690
there's only four kinds of UFOs that can
do this abduction, only four choices.

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.811
Sorry, you can either have your
classic old UFO, a Star Wars style

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:44.410
imperial cruiser, a Battle Galactica
style viper, or a Borg style cube.

13
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.570
Those are your only choices.

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.220
I'm sorry, that's all we've got right now.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.470
And since this abduction is happening,

16
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.650
you're only gonna pick one of these,
right?

17
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.240
You can't pick like multiples,
you have to pick only one.

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.970
So a great way to do this is
something called a radio button.

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.770
And you've seen these on forms before.

20
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.590
They're the little round guys.

21
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.370
You get a group of them and you can only
pick one of those in the group, right?

22
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.010
So if I pick the first one,
and then I change my mind and

23
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.800
I pick this one down here, this one
unselects and this one selects instead.

24
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.536
You've seen this in action?

25
00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.870
Okay, so we're gonna go ahead and
code some of these radio buttons.

26
00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we're actually not
gonna wind up using this list at all.

27
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.445
And so, I'm actually just gonna
delete some of these tags here,

28
00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:40.528
and just
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Set it up like that.

29
00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:46.881
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I'm gonna leave my
paragraph here with my question what type

30
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:48.278
of UFO do you prefer.

31
00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:53.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'll show you why in just a moment.

32
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.820
So what I'm going to say here is,
once again, this is still an input type.

33
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.660
This time it's radio.

34
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.680
That's our type.

35
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.540
This goes back to the old
radios from 50 odd years

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.400
ago where you had the little buttons that
you could press and things would change.

37
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.008
That's where the name
radio button comes from.

38
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:20.360
We'll give it a name of UFO type, okay?

39
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.892
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we'll give it a value of classic.

40
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I'm just gonna
show you this much right now.

41
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.640
So normally,
the radio buttons are to the left, right?

42
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.410
You have the button and then you
have the text that comes after it.

43
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.477
You've seen these on forms before, right?

44
00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:47.120
Radio button, text, radio button,
text, radio button, text.

45
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.070
So the way I've coded it here,
you see that?

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.150
That's gonna be my radio button
followed by the text after it, right?

47
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.990
Let's just do that much so far.

48
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.302
If you go ahead and save that.

49
00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:01.601
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And refresh your web page,
you'll see you have,

50
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.800
there's your button,
and you can select it.

51
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.090
You probably can't unselect it,
but you can select it.

52
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.419
Now, right now,
take a look at the clickable area.

53
00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.115
You can click that radio button
right there on the button.

54
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:20.631
But if I come over the text over here,
I can't click the text, can I?

55
00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:23.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
select that radio button.

56
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.580
I have to click very precisely
right on that button.

57
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.302
Wouldn't it be nice if that
whole thing was clickable?

58
00:03:30.302 --> 00:03:32.340
That would actually be much better.

59
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.590
And so, our label tag is
gonna come in handy for that.

60
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.200
And that's the purpose this
label tag is gonna serve.

61
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.920
But since the words that describe that
radio button are right next to this,

62
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.270
we're gonna apply our label button
in a slightly different way.

63
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.343
All we have to do is just say
label before that radio button.

64
00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:57.413
And then,
slash label after that radio button.

65
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:02.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we just make sort of a unit there, okay?

66
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.980
So label tag right before,
you close it right after.

67
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.600
And you don't need to use the for
in that case.

68
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.880
You actually don't need an ID in this
case, either, for the purposes of HTML.

69
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.430
And once again, there might be something
with JavaScript that you want an ID for.

70
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.050
But for what we're doing here,
we don't actually need that.

71
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.360
So let's code one more of these, and

72
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.650
then I'm gonna let you code
the last two on your own.

73
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.411
So let's go on ahead and
do our Star Wars style imperial cruiser.

74
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.247
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So basically,
we're gonna go ahead and

75
00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:39.880
take our radio button once again.

76
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.300
That same radio button code.

77
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.920
We're gonna have a label for it.

78
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.803
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're gonna drop
in our radio button code right before

79
00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:57.030
the Star Wars style cruiser.

80
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:02.794
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're gonna
put in our slash label after it.

81
00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:11.194
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now, in terms of this
code for the Star Wars radio button,

82
00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:15.430
okay, it's still an input type of radio.

83
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.130
The name is actually going to
be exactly the same, okay?

84
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.918
That's how we associate all of
these radio buttons together,

85
00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:24.660
they get exactly the same name, okay?

86
00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:29.123
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But
the value is gonna change.

87
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we'll change that to,

88
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.607
what did I call it, Star Wars?

89
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:46.736
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now,
if you go ahead and save that, and

90
00:05:46.736 --> 00:05:52.457
take a look at the web page,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We

91
00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:55.517
have two radio buttons to choose from.

92
00:05:55.517 --> 00:06:00.476
And you should be able to
select only one of them, right?

93
00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:03.520
And you should be able to
click on the text as well.

94
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.390
So, I don't have to click on the actual
button, I can also click on the text.

95
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.600
And that will select my button.
