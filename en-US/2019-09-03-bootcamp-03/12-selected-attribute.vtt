1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.866
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I have ne more thing
I want to add for the Select.

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:06.562
We put in the selected value here,
on line 46.

3
00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:11.030
We added selected because that is
the thing that is selected by default.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.110
Just because we've put selected there and

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.270
it happens to be the first thing
in the list, that's great, but

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.330
did you know of course that we can
move selected anywhere we want?

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.717
So I could put selected down here,
Alien dinner and discussion.

8
00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:27.039
You can do that.

9
00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The first item doesn't
have to be the one that's selected.

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.920
Does that make sense?

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.937
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So if you do that,

12
00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:38.976
it still shows in the same order?

13
00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:42.008
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It'll still show
in the same order, by default-

14
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.679
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It'll say select one at the

15
00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.914
first glance, but they've already selected
one for you to cram it down your throat.

16
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.413
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right so
in this case, Alien dinner and

17
00:00:51.413 --> 00:00:53.469
discussion is pre-selected.

18
00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.120
When I click on the Select I'll
still see select one,

19
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.594
tour of the solar system, and
then under it, the other options.

20
00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.828
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Basically,
make that the default option for

21
00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.315
anybody who doesn't select one,
I've sort of selected it for them.

22
00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:10.532
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I selected one for
them, correct.

23
00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:15.262
Can anyone think of a use case
where this might actually work?

24
00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:20.115
Or a situation where you may actually want
to select something that's not the first

25
00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:21.233
thing in the list?

26
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:24.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If it was like 90% of
the time what was selected by people?

27
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, something that's
going to be selected by somebody a lot.

28
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.094
So for example, you have a list of states,
and you are a restaurant,

29
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:40.075
you're right here in Minneapolis and
people are ordering takeout.

30
00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:45.094
Are people ordering take
out from your restaurant in

31
00:01:45.094 --> 00:01:49.894
Massachusetts or Virginia,
or even Wisconsin?

32
00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:54.599
Wisconsin's closer but you know still
a long drive to go get it there, right?

33
00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.224
Okay, so in that case,
if you had a list of 50 states,

34
00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:01.172
you might want Minnesota
to be pre selected.

35
00:02:01.172 --> 00:02:05.638
And clearly M in Minnesota is not at the
top of the list of states in alphabetical

36
00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:06.595
order, right?

37
00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:11.443
So this is a reason that you might want
to choose something in your select list

38
00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.352
that's not the first thing.

39
00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.438
Make sense?

40
00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:20.436
But 99.99% of the time,
it's probably the first

41
00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:24.911
thing on the list that you want selected,
right?

42
00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:28.360
Okay, so we'll go ahead and move it back.

43
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.899
Likewise, I didn't tell you about
this about radio buttons, but

44
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.692
we can pre-select the radio
button as well, okay?

45
00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:38.250
So by default we have no
radio button selected, but

46
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.316
if you want one choice selected as
people go into the form you can do that.

47
00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:47.740
Which one would you like selected
by default, anybody, yeah?

48
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.468
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Classic.

49
00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:54.731
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The classic, okay, so what
we would do here is we would say checked.

50
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.131
Checked is our value.

51
00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:00.323
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, if you say check there,

52
00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:02.830
that radio button will
be selected by default.

53
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.557
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And,
when we refresh our web page, there it is,

54
00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:15.387
it's selected by default,
classic oval UFOs.

55
00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:21.275
Obviously you can chance it
to something else, right.

56
00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:24.097
But by default the first one is selected.

57
00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:27.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Can we have two name values,
like 1,2?

58
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.738
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 1,2?

59
00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:36.923
If you have a value like 1,2,
that is not you're passing 1 and 2.

60
00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:42.060
You're passing 1,2,
the whole thing as a unit.

61
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.900
Make sense?

62
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.892
I don't know what you're
gonna do on the backend, but

63
00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.465
you're passing the whole thing as a unit.

64
00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:49.304
You're not passing two values.
