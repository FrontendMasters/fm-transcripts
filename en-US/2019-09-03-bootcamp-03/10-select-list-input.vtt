00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.221
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just have a couple more
fields here to code on this form.

2
00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:08.652
And the next thing that we're going to do
is and it looks like some of you might be

3
00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:13.084
working ahead a little bit, the type of
abduction experience that you want and

4
00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.385
I gave you four choices here also [COUGH].

5
00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:18.568
Now this would be a great thing
to code with radio buttons, and

6
00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:21.457
I think some of you already
did code with radio buttons.

7
00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:24.514
So that's just fine if you
coded that with radio buttons.

8
00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:28.826
But there are some other form field
types that I wanted to show you, and

9
00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:32.786
one of these is called select,
and you've seen select before.

10
00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:36.551
Here in the United States, it's very
commonly used for a list of states.

11
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:40.247
You click on the little arrow,
you get this really long drop-down

12
00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:44.142
with all these different choices,
and you can only pick one, right?

13
00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.828
Okay, so you here in the US,
we see it with states,

14
00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:50.533
you might see a list of countries on
a form, that's the kind of thing.

15
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:55.210
Let's go ahead and
try coding a select list for this.

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.466
Just like with radio buttons, a select
list is designed to pick one thing,

17
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:03.267
not a whole bunch of different things,
just one thing on the list.

18
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so,
to put that code together,

19
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.108
what we're going to do is up here,
we are going to have a label for

20
00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:18.069
the type of abduction
experience that you want.

21
00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:24.630
This is going to be a label tag, and
we're going to say it's for ab type.

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.704
That's short for abduction type, ab type.

23
00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:32.742
You can call it anything you want,
that's what I called mine.

24
00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:37.366
And then of course,
ends with a slash label tag.

25
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:41.718
And then here,
it's no longer gonna be an unordered list,

26
00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:44.865
obviously, this is gonna be a select tag.

27
00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:50.013
So select is the tag, and
we're going to give it an ID.

28
00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:54.174
And what's my ID going to be?

29
00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:55.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Ab type.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Ab type and

30
00:01:55.472 --> 00:01:57.926
how did you know that, Riley?

31
00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:00.421
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because that's
what we call it a label.

32
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's what we
called it in the foreign label.

33
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.815
Those two things have to be the same they
need to match so that's exactly right.

34
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:13.207
Okay, and then the end of that select is
going to happen down where the previously

35
00:02:13.207 --> 00:02:18.063
where the slash UL was, that's going
to be the end of the select, okay?

36
00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:24.921
Inside of this, we don't have li's,
we actually have instead options.

37
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:31.923
So this is an option tag, which is
gonna end with a slash option tag.

38
00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:38.642
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you can go on ahead and
copy and paste those in place.

39
00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:40.761
These are all gonna be option tags.

40
00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.759
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
selects are always gonna have options.
