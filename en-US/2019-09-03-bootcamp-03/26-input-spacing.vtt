00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.154
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I now have the craziest
selector you've ever seen in your

2
00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:04.740
entire life.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.840
We've kept our selectors really,
really simple up until now.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.242
Yeah, we've used HTML tags,
we've used classes, we've used IDs, and

5
00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:13.896
we've used descendant selectors.

6
00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:16.670
But I wrote a really
crazy selector here for

7
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.930
you because I want you to see
what is possible with CSS.

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.410
I'm not expecting you guys to know
how to use selectors like this.

9
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.450
I'm not expecting you to be able
to write selectors like this.

10
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.240
But I want you to take a look at some of
the crazy things people do in their code.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.190
So you can look at it and go,
that's a weird selector thing,

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.830
I need to do a little research
to know what that means.

13
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.330
Okay?

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.120
And so this crazy selector
has to do with the following.

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.240
Let's just look at our form right now.

16
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.550
We've got all these fields and text right?

17
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.540
Things are kind of close together.

18
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.760
We have a nice separation
of space here but

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.950
really everything else is kinda
piled on top of each other right?

20
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.280
Okay, so we could go ahead and

21
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.110
look at our HTML, and we can see,
we have some inputs, right?

22
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.960
Lots and lots of input tags here, and

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.640
we need to have some margin that
goes underneath those input tags.

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.680
So let's go on ahead and
add that here to our code.

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.740
I'm gonna start with input.

26
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.020
Warning, this is gonna blow up,
that's okay, all right?

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
So let's start with just our input tags
here, and let's say that what we wanna do.

28
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.193
First of all, are these input tags,
are they inline or are they block?

29
00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:42.585
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Do we know?

30
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:47.492
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are input tags inline or

31
00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:48.143
block?

32
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.397
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're
probably inline right?

33
00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:55.580
And in fact, if you put the border on
them, you'll find out that they're inline.

34
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.056
So I'm gonna switch their
display to block because that's

35
00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:03.440
gonna allow me to put a little bit
of padding on underneath of these so

36
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.700
we can get some more spacing on
our page with our form, all right.

37
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.950
And so, otherwise our margin isn't
gonna quite work correctly here.

38
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.887
So I'm gonna to put on a margin
on the bottom of 2rem, okay.

39
00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:29.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna give them
all a nice width of 20rem, okay.

40
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.090
So that they're all nice and even right?

41
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.440
Nice, the same size.

42
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.320
That's a hallmark of
a nicely coded web page.

43
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.850
You don't want unsightly,
different sized form fields right?

44
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.228
These are just little graphic design
things you can do even if you're

45
00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:43.810
not a designer.

46
00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We noticed that some of the
input fields had different fonts in it.

47
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.195
So I'm gonna go ahead and
declare a font family here, a font family.

48
00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:59.732
Arial, helvetica, sans-serif.

49
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.595
And I'm gonna declare a font size because
we have different font sizes, right?

50
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.786
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna
put on some padding,

51
00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:17.924
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 0 1rem,

52
00:03:17.924 --> 00:03:21.000
and what does that mean again?

53
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.950
0 1rem?

54
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.440
0 and what?

55
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Top and bottom.

56
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.160
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And 1rem where?

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Left and right.

58
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Gosh,
you guys are getting good at this!

59
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.510
Okay.

60
00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:33.309
So that's gonna put on some padding.

61
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.965
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
I think I got everything.

62
00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:40.415
Now we're gonna go ahead and save this.

63
00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:44.015
I'm warning you, it's gonna blow
some stuff up, don't panic.

64
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.553
Save it and let's look at the web page.

65
00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:52.052
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, what happened?

66
00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.965
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
let's look at it and think about it.

67
00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:00.288
So what happened here?

68
00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:05.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This looks pretty good,
doesn't it?

69
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.450
This is exactly what we wanted.

70
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.050
We have some nice input
fields up here on the top,

71
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.720
we have some nice spacing in between.

72
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.300
Cool stuff, right?

73
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.210
Okay, this is looking pretty good.

74
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.556
And then when we get to our radio buttons,
what happened?

75
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:28.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Made it look bad,
cuz it's an input, also.

76
00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:34.726
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's also an input, and
that's how a 20rem radio button looks.
