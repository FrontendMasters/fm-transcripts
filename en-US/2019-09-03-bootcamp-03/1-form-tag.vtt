WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we'll be ready
to get started here on our form.

2
00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:06.032
Because as I said, we have a lot of
thing already typed in to the page.

3
00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:11.721
We're going to be adding a lot of
tags around the code we already have.

4
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.175
So what we've got going on here then
is this opening paragraph, right,

5
00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.352
here on line 11.

6
00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:21.633
We have our title of the page,
kind of the alien abduction auto form.

7
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:26.120
We have some instructions and
then we actually start the form.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.464
So after the instructions are done.

9
00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:32.050
But before the form starts,
we're gonna start with a form tag.

10
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.680
It looks like this, form.

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.020
Okay, pretty simple.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.420
That tells you where
the form is gonna start.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.345
There are some additional attributes we
need to put in this form in order to make

14
00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:47.960
the form actually do anything.

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.780
We're gonna do that at
the very end of this process.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.462
But for right now, just go ahead and
put in that form tag to start this and

17
00:00:56.462 --> 00:01:00.275
guess where the ending tag for
form is gonna go.

18
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:01.359
Anyone wanna guess?

19
00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:10.141
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No one has any idea where
the ending form tag would go, yes?

20
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right before
the ending of the body.

21
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably, well,
it could go all the way down there

22
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.170
by the end of the body, but
it goes at the end of the form, right?

23
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.325
And the end of the forum is actually
going to be inside of the section,

24
00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:26.803
because we put the form tag
inside of the section, didn't we?

25
00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:27.844
Here's the section.

26
00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:32.643
We have some h1's in a paragraph and
we put the form inside of that section.

27
00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:36.729
So the closing form tag should
also be inside of the section, but

28
00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.301
it's probably after add me
to your email list, right?

29
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.096
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it

30
00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:45.075
best practice to always
have form within a section?

31
00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:47.708
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, this section has to
do with the markup of the web page and

32
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.402
what you're trying to communicate.

33
00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:53.087
Yeah, so we'll go ahead and say,

34
00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:58.691
/form down here just before slash section,
okay?

35
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:01.956
So that's how we designate what portion
of the web page is actually going to be

36
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.029
a form where we'll be
collecting information.

37
00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:07.231
And then after that,
we're ready to go ahead and

38
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.974
start putting in our form fields, okay?

39
00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:14.000
So scroll back on up the page and
we are gonna start here on line 15.

40
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.366
We're asking for your name, okay?

41
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:23.423
And so we're gonna go ahead and
put in a field to collect your name and

42
00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:26.455
the tag for this is called input, okay?

43
00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.668
So this is an input tag.

44
00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:32.716
There are a bunch of different
kinds of input tags, but

45
00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:37.910
the type that we're going to use
here is the type that's called text.

46
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.570
Because guess what this does?

47
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's text.

48
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can collect text.

49
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.840
That's a good match to a name, okay?

50
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.853
So that alone will go ahead and
make a little box on your web page, but

51
00:02:51.853 --> 00:02:55.609
we're gonna need some additional pieces
of information that are gonna help

52
00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.210
with the programming for this.

53
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.427
And in this particular case, what we're

54
00:03:01.427 --> 00:03:06.370
going to need is we're
gonna need an ID for name.

55
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.094
You remember ID's,

56
00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:13.854
we talked about them briefly on at
the beginning of our CSS discussion.

57
00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:17.683
And we said, IDs are often used
more often in JavaScript and

58
00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:20.602
in programming than they
are in CSS styling.

59
00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:24.002
This is the ID, you're gonna see
what the purposes in just a moment.

60
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:27.575
So we're gonna put an ID,
you can call it anything you want.

61
00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.865
Generally speaking,
they're self documenting.

62
00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:33.581
We're collecting names,
let's call it name.

63
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:38.263
All right and
then sometimes we also have another

64
00:03:38.263 --> 00:03:42.041
attribute here called name, as well.

65
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.528
The name for this field and

66
00:03:43.528 --> 00:03:47.591
the attribute name actually have
nothing to do with each other, okay?

67
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.605
So we could actually call this name field.

68
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:52.281
We could call it like full name or
something that,

69
00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:54.240
if you find that confusing.

70
00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.450
We could actually call the ID for
this field, we could call it George, okay?

71
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.670
You might not know what George is.

72
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.829
So it's probably better to call it
something you actually know what it

73
00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:06.585
means, right?

74
00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:09.500
Okay, so these IDs can be anything.

75
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.470
I just happened to call my name.

76
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.333
For the name portion of this form field,
this is gonna be important for

77
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.028
the script that will
actually process our form.

78
00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:21.408
All right and
we're also gonna call that name.

79
00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:26.177
We got a lot of names going on, right, and

80
00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:29.596
then go ahead and close that.

81
00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:34.607
Now if you go ahead and save that and
take a quick peek at that

82
00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:40.043
in your web browser,
there's a box there that you can type in.

83
00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:43.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Did it work?

84
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.480
Pretty cool.
