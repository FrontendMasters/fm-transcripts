1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let's move on,
let's code our next one.

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.910
We're gonna code a phone number, okay?

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.610
We need to collect a phone number.

4
00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.865
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
I'm actually gonna copy what I just did,

5
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.069
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And paste it on in here.

6
00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I could make a few
changes to this to make this work, right?

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.351
For my phone number, what would I
need to change to make this work for

8
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:25.148
my phone number?

9
00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:31.327
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Everything in quotes.

10
00:00:31.327 --> 00:00:33.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I would need to
change all the stuff in quotes?

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.228
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not quite everything but
well, text.

12
00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:35.854
Is it text?

13
00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:37.500
It's a number so-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's actually not

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.190
gonna be text but
we'll leave that for the moment.

15
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.900
What should I change here,
what should I change the id to?

16
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Phone?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about phone,

17
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.180
that's a great idea.

18
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.380
And what should I change the name to?

19
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Go with phone?

20
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.059
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about phone,
that's a good one also, okay?

21
00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.690
Now for the input type,
if you wanted to collect a phone number,

22
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.808
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
using a text box to do it, okay?

23
00:01:04.808 --> 00:01:08.868
Cuz obviously, you're typing in a bunch
of numbers for phone number, right?

24
00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.660
Okay, but what happens when
you get to an actual phone and

25
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.829
you're trying to fill out
your form on a phone?

26
00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.400
What does the keyboard look like when
you're trying to type a phone number in?

27
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Num pad.

28
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You get the full alphabet,
right?.

29
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.563
With the numbers across the top, and
sometimes you have to like hit a shift

30
00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:31.370
key or something to actually
get to the phone numbers.

31
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.363
It's a pain in the neck, isn't it?.

32
00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:38.186
Okay, so
one of the things that we can do here is

33
00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:42.655
we can change our input type to tel, okay?

34
00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:45.451
tel, or telephone.

35
00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:52.024
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
tel will do absolutely nothing for

36
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:55.800
our form on our desktop computers.

37
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.848
Nothing at all, nothing is gonna change.

38
00:01:57.848 --> 00:02:00.483
There's no difference
in the experience for

39
00:02:00.483 --> 00:02:04.518
you people on desktop computers if
you're typing in a phone number.

40
00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:08.034
But if you're actually on a phone,
guess what?

41
00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:14.104
Your keyboard was gonna change to actual
numbers, which is pretty awesome, okay.

42
00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:17.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet.

43
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.680
So this is a good reason to do that.

44
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.922
Now we also need to add a label for
this, don't we?

45
00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:28.522
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what should I
change here for my paragraph?

46
00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:29.440
What am I going to do now?

47
00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:32.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Maybe label?

48
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.867
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is going to be label,
and then what?

49
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.552
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Phone?

50
00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:43.549
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: for =
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: phone?

51
00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.826
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Phone,
phone, spell it correctly.

52
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:57.717
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: /label
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right.

53
00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:00.231
So we go ahead and save that.

54
00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:01.487
Refresh your form.

55
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're gonna start stacking
up our fields next to each other.

56
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.250
Don't worry about it.

57
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.940
We'll make it look pretty later.

58
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.014
How do we make it look pretty?

59
00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:13.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: CSS.

60
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: CSS, right.

61
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.680
So we got some styling to do for
this form later on.

62
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.507
But if you can't see it on the web page,
you can't style it.

63
00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:26.599
So we're gonna concentrate
on writing our HRML first,

64
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.222
don't worry about how the form looks,
we'll come back and style it later, okay?

65
00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:31.935
Yes?

66
00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:35.565
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I noticed that in Safari,
before I changed the input type to tel, so

67
00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:36.905
when it was still text,

68
00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:41.499
it came up as an option to let
autofill my phone number specifically.

69
00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:47.798
So that's coming from the name field
that Safari recognized if the name for

70
00:03:47.798 --> 00:03:53.150
him and input his phone, I should search
for the phone number that I have saved.

71
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, there's some browser
stuff that's going on where it's smart

72
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.561
enough to know because you've probably
filled out a few forms on a computer.

73
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:05.275
[LAUGH] And it remember some things about
you if you set up your browser settings

74
00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:08.350
such that it will remember
some things about you.

75
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.370
And the names that we're using here for
our form fields are fairly common, right?

76
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.550
As I said, there's no reason to call
your form field George or Sally, right?

77
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.526
Most developers are gonna call it phone.

78
00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:26.637
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It is specifically
coming from name and not ID, right?

79
00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:27.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, yes.

80
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.080
And so, by the way, notice that
the way this form is coded right now,

81
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.310
I can very happily and
say my phone number is Jen Kramer.

82
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.830
There's nothing wrong with that at all.

83
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.910
I can go ahead and do that because
your browser isn't going to test

84
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.310
to see if you've actually typed
numbers in here, all right.

85
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.450
That's why we have JavaScript
to do the checking here.

86
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.297
JavaScript, if you've coded JavaScript,
well, JavaScript will look at that and go,

87
00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:56.267
Jen Kramer does not look
like a phone number.

88
00:04:58.074 --> 00:04:59.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
it will give you an error.

89
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.474
You can write your JavaScript to test for
a phone number or

90
00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:07.340
a format for a phone number, it should
be all numbers or something like that.

91
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.386
Okay, email,
guess what we're gonna do for email?

92
00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:13.453
What should email be?

93
00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:17.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: id=email.

94
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.870
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
a box that we type in, right?

95
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.130
So it's gonna look pretty much
like the other ones, right?

96
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.356
So what should we use for an ID?

97
00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:29.081
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: email?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about email?

98
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.067
How about the name?

99
00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:32.857
How about email?

100
00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:33.780
Okay.

101
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:39.712
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And just like you saw
before, there is an input type for

102
00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:41.726
email addresses now, okay?

103
00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:45.604
And depending on what kind of phone you
have, and operating system on the phone,

104
00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:49.213
and all the rest of it, it'll change
the keyboard there for mobile users.

105
00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:51.930
Usually it makes the at
symbol really easy to find.

106
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.920
Sometimes it'll put in a button for like
.com or something, sometimes you see that.

107
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.060
It sort of depends on what
the manufacturers of the phones are, and

108
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.820
the software doing.

109
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.470
So guess what that type is called?

110
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.675
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Email.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Email.

111
00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:12.726
[LAUGH] Sorry, input type is email.

112
00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:18.267
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and
then for our email label up here,

113
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:20.660
what are we going to change this to?

114
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.949
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Label?

115
00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.610
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: label
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: for

116
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: for=

117
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: email.

118
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.027
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: email.

119
00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:32.125
/label

120
00:06:36.487 --> 00:06:37.414
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
