00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.642
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And
as what we've always done,

3
00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:07.537
we talk about the alternatives.

4
00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:11.357
Obviously if you go with a platform
as a service like Heroku.

5
00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:17.020
It's fully managed, your DevOps
responsibilities are virtually nil.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.370
But it does cost,
tends to cost a lot of money at scale.

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.020
Whereas if you go to the other extreme
on managing your own infrastructure,

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.760
what you don't get is this
orchestration software.

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.630
So when you do an eb deploy,
there's no management software

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.980
that's going to take some of your
instances out of the fleet update them,

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.160
put them back in and
do those changes for you.

12
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.740
So there's lots of other
open source software and

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.770
Amazon tools that you can
use to accomplish this.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.860
But that is essentially the value that
elastic beanstalk provides is that

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.820
even though it is kind of a pain in
the ass to set up, once it is set up,

16
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.620
the orchestration that you get
is actually pretty strong.

17
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.430
There's just generally if the more
control you have of the infrastructure

18
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.270
the more DevOps you're gonna have to do.

19
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.730
I mean really what this comes
down to is resources, right?

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.080
Like if operating your service
at scale is more expensive than

21
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.390
the time you might spend on dev ops.

22
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.660
Then that's the time when you're
gonna wanna probably manage your own

23
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.310
infrastructure versus if time is
more precious than time is more

24
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.830
expensive than the amount of money you
would spend on server infrastructure and

25
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.650
going to something like a pass
is probably a wiser choice.

26
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.180
And lastly,
Beanstalk is kind of in the middle.

27
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.263
It's the gateway between
something like Heroku and

28
00:01:44.263 --> 00:01:48.430
a fully self-managed EC2 environment.
