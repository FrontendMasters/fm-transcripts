00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.106
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:08.680
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: All right, so
at this point I'll just poke out a couple

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.970
bits to show you some
features of these platforms.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.120
So I'll go into the to do

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.090
MVC repository and just write some
changes that I'm gonna immediately

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.350
throw away just to demonstrate some of
the features that you can bring to bear.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.655
So for Browserify,

8
00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:34.120
I mentioned there's a lot of different
transforms that you can use.

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.945
And in fact,
if you Google Browserify transforms,

10
00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:44.220
even if you misspell it,
you're probably gonna get it.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:52.411
You'll see this list of at least
a few popular transformations.

12
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.890
So we'll just kind of pick one out.

13
00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.530
I thought I was gonna do, there's
a markdown one which is kind of neat.

14
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.290
Which allows you to essentially
require a markdown file

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.420
as a string in your
JavaScript application.

16
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.298
So just temporarily, I'm going to install
this without saving it because I'm not

17
00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:17.490
including the dash dash save,
I'm gonna install the module locally.

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.623
But it's not gonna be added
to my package.json, so

19
00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:25.600
none of you will get it if you were
to clone the repository right away.

20
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.940
And this is going to add a new
transformation capability

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.742
to our Browserify code.

22
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.977
And you'll notice that the configuration

23
00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:45.266
isn't terribly well documented here.

24
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:49.926
But if I go into,
as James pointed out, my grunt.file,

25
00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:54.684
I can see these are my Browserify
options where I can pass in

26
00:01:54.684 --> 00:02:00.530
different bits like whether or
not I want to generate a source map.

27
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.760
And then I will specify a source file or

28
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.430
multiple source files and
a destination file for my bundle.

29
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.410
This is kind of the core arguments
you would pass in if you were

30
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.510
executing a Browserify
from the command line.

31
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.230
But where the transformations were
declared is here in the package.json.

32
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.770
So here in the transform section I
specify browserify-shim is one of them.

33
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.199
I also specify babelify.

34
00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:40.153
And now I'm also going to drop
in browserify-markdown as one of

35
00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:41.540
the transforms.

36
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.456
So if I fire up my-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What does

37
00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:51.151
browserfy-markdown do?
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: It allows you in your

38
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:54.412
JavaScript code to require
a markdown file and

39
00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:58.439
have that available in your
JavaScript code as a string.

40
00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.730
Not terribly useful [LAUGH] all the time.

41
00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:06.870
But just to kinda show
you a feature that you

42
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.720
can add to your transformation, I figured
we would take a look at this one.

43
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.665
So now I have this transformation added
to my configuration in my browser code.

44
00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:24.739
Let's go into app.js say.

45
00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.295
And the feature that this
transformation allows me to

46
00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:32.390
do is rather than just
requiring JavaScript files.

47
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.240
I can require markdown files which
will be converted to a string.

48
00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:42.670
It'll actually also be parsed into HTML,
if memory serves.

49
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.659
So just for demonstration purposes,
I'm gonna require the readme for

50
00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.711
the project.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And

51
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:58.141
that's going to be up one directory.

52
00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:01.811
Let's see if I can get the resolve right.

53
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:02.950
So we had source.

54
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.383
I think it's one more.

55
00:04:05.383 --> 00:04:12.590
And then, README.md.

56
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.402
And when the application initializes,

57
00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:21.559
I'm just gonna go ahead and
console.log the contents

58
00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:26.578
of the readme file.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: So I'll start up my

59
00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:33.925
server.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: todomvc

60
00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:37.518
js/app.jsmust be obj.

61
00:04:37.518 --> 00:04:40.711
Let's see,

62
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:45.360
what did I mess up?

63
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.453
js/app jsmust be object.

64
00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:00.577
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Source browser.

65
00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:09.942
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Must be object.

66
00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:10.870
Okey dokey.

67
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.050
So my markdown transform doesn't seem
to be working cuz it's blowing up

68
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.180
on this line.

69
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.270
It could be that I didn't
do this correctly.

70
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.468
So up one directory would be,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Browser and

71
00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:34.861
then up another directory would be source.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And

72
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:37.897
then up, yeah, I know that's the,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: That

73
00:05:37.897 --> 00:05:38.709
is the proper path.

74
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.427
Well, this is less
impressive than I had hoped.

75
00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:50.795
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: All right,

76
00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:56.499
I'll keep trucking for now but the the way
that typically you would do this

77
00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.860
like the running it through grunt, you
don't get the full output of Browserify.

78
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.188
So you could run the Browserify command
line utility to get a more detailed SEC

79
00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:08.995
trace of why this isn't going.

80
00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:14.020
But I won't waste your
time with that right now.

81
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.263
So I'll go ahead and take this out.

82
00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:24.015
But the idea there is that these
additional transforms essentially

83
00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:28.360
give your code new capabilities
that it didn't have before.

84
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.992
So I'll get that running, hopefully, while
you guys are at the break and figure out,

85
00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.100
or while you guys are working
on the exercises,

86
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.600
figure out what went wrong there.
