00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.969
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.581
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: The other bit that I'll
show you in the administrative section is

3
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:08.769
how to create a goal.

4
00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.571
Because a lot of the very useful
stuff you can do in Google Analytics

5
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:17.670
results is about like
users reaching a goal.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.970
So if I go into the goals section and
create a new goal.

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.940
A very common goal.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.473
There's lots of different kinds.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: But

9
00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:35.880
a goal that you're probably gonna
use a lot is, what is this?

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.730
This is new and I'm gonna go with custom,
cuz this scares me.

11
00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:47.720
So a goal you're probably gonna use
a lot is arriving on a certain page.

12
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.240
Whether it's like a marketing page that
you're trying to drive a lot of traffic to

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.480
or if it's a page like after a user signs
up it's a successful like sign up page.

14
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.070
If people are reaching those
goal pages like that is an event

15
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.190
that you want to track in your analytics.

16
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.000
So I could create a goal for
a page that doesn't exist called sign up.

17
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.420
And you can only in Google Analytics
this is another another limitation,

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.070
you can only set a certain
amount of goals.

19
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.840
I haven't used any of my goal slots yet
so I will go with goal one.

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.710
And the type of goal I'm gonna
create is a destination.

21
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.830
So that's going to be a specific place
that somebody can go on my site.

22
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.490
And then for the destination,
you can have you know any page that begins

23
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.184
with something or
you can have a specific page like sign up.

24
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.370
Success, so this is how you know that
somebody successfully made it through

25
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.810
your entire sign up flow.

26
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.860
And then there's other advanced stuff you
can do here for funnels and what have you.

27
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.134
But I'm gonna create that goal.

28
00:01:56.134 --> 00:02:01.740
Even though I'm not gonna actually
catch anybody with that goal.

29
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.500
But if I go back to my
customization in my custom report,

30
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.235
I can actually track that now
as a metric in my report.

31
00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:21.115
So in this case I won't name my report yet

32
00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:27.205
but I will add as a metric here that
specific goal that I just configured.

33
00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:32.865
So it was goal number one
which we called Sign up.

34
00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:38.300
So there's a few different metrics
you can track based on the goal.

35
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.130
You can check the raw number which
is gonna be sign up completions.

36
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.989
So that will be the raw number
of times if somebody arrived

37
00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.354
on that page and
then you can also track the Goal 1.

38
00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.600
You can also track the conversion rate.

39
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.950
So this is one that you're
gonna use in conjunction with

40
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.990
a landing page report, like this one.

41
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.250
So you can say,
across all landing pages on my site,

42
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.190
show me how many sign ups
each one of them generated.

43
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.980
And then also show me the conversion rate.

44
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.520
What percentage of sessions
that began on this page

45
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.970
resulted in the type of
goal that I created?

46
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.195
So this ends up being a powerful
combination to start looking at

47
00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:30.530
specific sections of content in
your site to understand what

48
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.831
pages are performing the best.

49
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:38.729
What sections of the site are performing
the best and how good a job you're doing

50
00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:44.377
and converting users into doing the things
that you care about on your site.

51
00:03:44.377 --> 00:03:50.119
Now the last bit I'll show you here in the
UI is the ability to create segments and

52
00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:56.450
a wise man once told me that segments
are where Jesus lives in Google Analytics.

53
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.340
And this is how you can really
start to break down like which

54
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.140
sets of browsing sections on
your site are the most valuable.

55
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.540
So if I open up this UI
to create a new segment.

56
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.880
I can create a customized view
of a certain set of users and

57
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.940
compare them to other
kinds of users on my site.

58
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:28.300
So for this one I will say Russian

59
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.900
users because apparently my site like
there's some weird spammy stuff going on.

60
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.180
So like over half of the traffic
to my site is from Russia.

61
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.780
So we'll separate them out as a segment,
and

62
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.050
look at them in comparison to some others.

63
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.051
So some of the conditions
we can do are Demographics,

64
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.031
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And Location.

65
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.298
So we can do a country, contains Russia,
and that's going to be as it updates,

66
00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:09.140
it's only 48% I guess of users on
my site are coming from Russia.

67
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.360
So I've created a segment for
just Russian users that visit my website.

68
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:24.100
So I can look at just those users and
then I can look at the inverse as well.

69
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.480
So I can create a segment for
non-Russians.

70
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.068
And I can look at how
the behavior of these

71
00:05:37.068 --> 00:05:46.471
two does not contain.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And

72
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.020
if our math is correct.
&gt;&gt; Audience: [CROSSTALK]

73
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.763
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: I didn't, whoops.

74
00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:54.971
Did I say contains?
&gt;&gt; Audience: I think contains

75
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:56.608
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Whoops.

76
00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.383
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Does not contain,

77
00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:01.600
good job team.

78
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.088
And there we are back to our 51%.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And let's

79
00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:15.810
edit this report back to something that
might actually be kind of interesting.

80
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.572
And look at some metrics like.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Time

81
00:06:21.572 --> 00:06:25.871
on page.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Average time on page

82
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:32.360
and bounce rate let's say.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: I'll

83
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.594
save that up.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: So

84
00:06:38.594 --> 00:06:43.795
it turns out that the Russian traffic,
which I assume

85
00:06:43.795 --> 00:06:51.270
to be almost completely due to Shenanigans
is a much higher time on page.

86
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.810
And people from everywhere else in
the world spend an average of 30 seconds

87
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.330
on any given page,
even given a landing page in the site.

88
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.770
So I can kind of sort and

89
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.480
see which ones are performing the best
based on average time on page.

90
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.250
The about page is clearly performing.

91
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.793
But I can see that folks that are coming
from outside of Russia actually

92
00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:15.801
bounce much less frequently.

93
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:22.378
So they're more likely to see more than
one page during their browsing session.

94
00:07:22.378 --> 00:07:27.880
So this is doing segments
by geography can be useful.

95
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.740
But it's also very useful to
create segments by event.

96
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.930
So if you have a session which
contained like a video play event,

97
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.420
those types of users might behave
very differently from users that

98
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.850
didn't initiate like a video
play say on your site.

99
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.770
So I know there's a ton
to do in this tool.

100
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.790
if you have more questions about it, I
definitely I'm happy to geek out on this.

101
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.280
I'm learning more about the two all
the time, trying to get better at it.

102
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.700
And the more I learn the more
I want to learn more about

103
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.300
how users are interacting with the site.

104
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.270
So hopefully,
this will put a bug in your ear to

105
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.580
get that same level of visibility
into your own website.
