00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:07.732
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: So the last bit before
I turn you loose on some scripting tasks,

3
00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:11.337
which I'm kind of weird in
that command line scripting is

4
00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:13.005
my favorite part of Node.

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.109
I love to do stuff on the command line,
I don't know what my problem is.

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.750
There's lots of alternatives out there.

7
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.340
We already started talking
about some of them.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.060
Gulp is probably the other major one.

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.123
The big advantage of Gulp over
something like Grunt is the fact that

10
00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:39.605
it uses the Node JASS streams interface to
stream data from one plugin to another.

11
00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:44.151
So that you don't have to wait for
one task to be completely finished

12
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:47.764
before you can start streaming
data to another task.

13
00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:52.522
And that is really cool, and it does speed
things up oftentimes quite a lot, but

14
00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:58.420
again, old man Kevin kind of thinks it's
harder to reason about how streams work.

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.710
And write custom tasks that
execute in the order that I expect

16
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.720
using the streaming interface.

17
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.620
So I did Gulp for a long time,

18
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.400
and then I kinda found myself
coming back to Grunt again.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.090
Not because it's bad,
just because my simple mind

20
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.970
was able to comprehend what was going
on in Grunt a little bit more easily.

21
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.120
But it's super fast, and it also
has a very nice ecosystem of tools.

22
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.180
I think Grunt's been around longer,

23
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.700
so I think there's probably
more out there for Grunt.

24
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.450
But Gulp probably is cooler at this point.

25
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.550
So there's maybe more new stuff
being invented for Gulp these days.

26
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.750
Webpack is a tool that's out there
that some folks have kind of used

27
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.990
as a front end for executing tasks,
like for compiling their front end assets.

28
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.480
And it's really awesome,
it does a lot of really cool stuff.

29
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.039
It's got really cool plugins.

30
00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.800
The way that you would implement those
cache buster URLs that I was talking about

31
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.350
briefly earlier, I think the easiest way
to do it is with Webpack through Grunt.

32
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.280
So there's lots of really great uses for
it, but

33
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.079
I think it's not necessarily as good of
a general purpose task runner as Grunt is.

34
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.418
Like I said, we use Grunt for
all kinds of stuff,

35
00:02:18.418 --> 00:02:20.928
from deployed tasks to just
simple scripting stuff.

36
00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:25.658
And that's not really what Webpack is for,
so using Webpack from Grunt, I think,

37
00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:27.290
is the winning combo for me.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.450
Yeah, we have another question?

39
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
what happens if you don't define

40
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.070
default task in the Grunt file?

41
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.600
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: If you don't define
a default task and you just run Grunt,

42
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.370
it will say that there's no default
task defined and it'll error out.

43
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.420
That's what'll happen if you
don't have a default defined.
