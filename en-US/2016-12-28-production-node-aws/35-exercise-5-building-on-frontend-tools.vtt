[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:06.560
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: So we talked a little
bit about some of the alternatives.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.617
And so at this point, we're gonna take
a little bit of time to knock out

4
00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:17.490
a few more issues in our GitHub repository
related to browserify and SaaS.

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.150
And these ones are fairly simple, should
be a nice warm up for the rest of the day.

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.230
So let's head out to GitHub and

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.371
see which tasks have been
flagged with exercise five.

8
00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:35.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: So
we have a couple of bits here.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.304
The browserfy related task is
to add ES 2016 presets to our

10
00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:49.260
Babel configuration in addition to the ES
2015 presets that we're currently using.

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.970
So our friend JavaScript
clearly not progressive enough,

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.680
need to add in some additional next
generation echo script features.

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.190
So we are going to be changing our
transformation configuration to

14
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.930
allow us to include those
ES 2016 features as well.

15
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.906
So that is one task to add to
head of the configuration.

16
00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:19.330
The other is to update the styles for
our to do's page.

17
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.210
And the thing that you're
gonna wanna accomplish here

18
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.740
is to ensure that the links in the footer.

19
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.860
So down here,
we have to scroll our way down.

20
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.050
So these links in the footer,
right now are not colored significantly,

21
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.770
differently than the rest of the text.

22
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.450
So I would like to do is make
those links in the footer the same

23
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.710
color as this header up
at the top of the page.

24
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.930
And I don't know about you, but
that's really hard for me to read.

25
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.120
So I think messing with the opacity or

26
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.870
the color of that H1, deciding on one
that's a little bit easier to read.

27
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.750
And then essentially ensuring that the
color is stored in a variable that we can

28
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.000
use both in the header and
in the links way down here at the footer.

29
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.245
So it'll require to use at
least that one feature of SaaS.

30
00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:22.095
So I feel it's something we can knock out
in a relatively short period of time.

31
00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:24.165
So I think we'll take about 20 minutes,

32
00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:26.215
and then come back as
a group to knock it out.

33
00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:29.229
Yes, Mark?
&gt;&gt; Mark: There's a question about,

34
00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.288
is there a reload module
that you recommend?

35
00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:38.394
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: There is a LiveReload,
is a popular

36
00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:43.010
one that you can use with grunt.

37
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.464
I don't use one,
I work on a project that does use one.

38
00:02:47.464 --> 00:02:53.546
And it just constantly pisses me
off cuz reloading the page I'm on,

39
00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:59.748
every time I save a file,
it just isn't the behavior I want usually.

40
00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:03.838
So I don't use one, but
LiveReload is a popular one.

41
00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:08.727
&gt;&gt; Mark: So
LiveReload would reload the entire page.

42
00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:10.521
So LiveReload,
when reloading [INAUDIBLE] page,

43
00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:12.929
I think hot reloading is
reloading an individual modules.

44
00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:14.660
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Right, yeah.

45
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.284
&gt;&gt; Mark: You're working on, cuz typically,

46
00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:24.527
people use [INAUDIBLE] reloading
with web packing react, right?

47
00:03:24.527 --> 00:03:29.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, yeah,
I think that's a feature of those tools.

48
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.003
So I don't have one that I
recommend because I don't.

49
00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:37.420
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah, but
there's module reloading [INAUDIBLE].

50
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.120
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, I mean I'm
not familiar with that specifically.

51
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.070
Yeah, I know that react tooling does that.

52
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.876
It's especially to great effects
if you're using RAC native like it

53
00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:53.054
will reload reload code in the simulator,
but

54
00:03:53.054 --> 00:03:57.308
there isn't one that I use, so
my answer is derp there, yes.

55
00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.180
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: All right,
so let's go ahead and

56
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.852
try to knock out those two
issues in our GitHub repo.

57
00:04:11.907 --> 00:04:16.670
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And yeah, we'll take
about 20 minutes break to do that.

58
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.510
We'll take a look at any pull requests
that come in and merge those down.

59
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.200
And we'll move on to some
VJS stuff after that.
