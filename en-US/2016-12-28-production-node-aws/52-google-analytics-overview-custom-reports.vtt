2
00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:07.266
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: So,
what I'm gonna do is just hop into

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:11.756
the Google Analytics UI and
show you a few things.

4
00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:16.000
My Google Analytics have been kind of
broken on my personal website for a while.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.937
So, the dataset here is going to be
a lot smaller than it should be and

6
00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:27.337
just nobody visits my website in general.

7
00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:31.492
It's a very low, a low traffic place,
I hardly update it.

8
00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:35.970
So when you implement
Google Analytics on your site,

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.747
you'll have access to see
some pre-canned reports from

10
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:45.142
just by integrating
the tracking code on your site.

11
00:00:45.142 --> 00:00:48.616
You'll be able to see things
like how many users or

12
00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.924
how many sessions are being initiated
on your site over a given time period?

13
00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:59.589
And this date chooser up on the top
right is constant across the custom

14
00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.063
reporting interface and
this pre-canned reporting interface,

15
00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:09.766
so you can select the time
scale data you're looking at.

16
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:14.272
A couple of the pre-canned reports
which are useful are gonna

17
00:01:14.272 --> 00:01:19.122
be the content drill down which is
something that I use regularly,

18
00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:25.204
especially the primary website that I work
on at Julio is the is the documentation.

19
00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:30.245
So I'm very interested in which pages
people are visiting most often,

20
00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.269
which pages have the highest bounce rate,

21
00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:38.073
which ones are the most popular
landing pages, that sort of thing.

22
00:01:38.073 --> 00:01:42.749
So, we'll frequently just kind
of come in to the content drill

23
00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.454
down to maybe start at the root
of the of the site and

24
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:52.477
drill into these various areas to see if
where people are navigating in the site.

25
00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:57.940
So for me, the most hits I have right
now in terms of page views are on

26
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.211
the home page and then the about
where the recruiters can get some

27
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:08.480
information to try to start to spam me and
then some other odds and

28
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.606
ends on my very poorly
maintained personal blog.

29
00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:17.039
The other bit that you're gonna take
a look at, which is part of one of

30
00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:21.626
the challenges that you can take on
this afternoon is a custom events and

31
00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:26.596
custom events allow you to track user
interaction events in JavaScript while

32
00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:29.215
somebody is interacting with the site.

33
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:33.896
So that if you are an front-end
masters.com in the video

34
00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:39.257
browsing section or whatever,
you can fire off a custom event for

35
00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:44.327
a video play and understand how
many people are playing videos

36
00:02:44.327 --> 00:02:49.297
on a given page and the idea that
you can get in the pre-canned

37
00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:54.205
is gonna be down here in
the behavior section under events.

38
00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:57.816
If you go to overview,
you'll see a listing of events here.

39
00:02:57.816 --> 00:03:03.369
I'm not doing tracking on my
personal website right now,

40
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.562
but the way that you
track custom events with

41
00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:12.225
a category which consists
of a family of events.

42
00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:17.380
So if you're tracking actions on video
plays, you'll have a video category.

43
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.450
And then actions will be things like play,
pause, rewind, scrub on

44
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.340
the video players and
then labels will be things like the actual

45
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.680
title of the video say and you can use
these customer events in reports in GA.

46
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.016
Now, the part you're going to probably use

47
00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:44.708
the most frequently is a custom report.

48
00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:47.814
And in fact, the newest version of

49
00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:52.325
the Google Analytics API
which you can use today.

50
00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:57.141
Actually, users custom reports as
the way in which you create a filter for

51
00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.107
the data that you're
fetching from the API.

52
00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.275
It's actually creating
a report ends up in the GUI.

53
00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:05.757
It does actually end up being
a little simpler than it is.

54
00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:10.921
I'm trying to pull the same
data out of the API.

55
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:14.914
So when you create a custom report,

56
00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:19.439
you're going to be tracking metrics and

57
00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.774
across certain dimensions.

58
00:04:22.774 --> 00:04:27.449
So, a metric in Google Analytics is
something that you can measure or

59
00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.460
something that you can count.

60
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.512
So some common ones would be for
behavior you have,

61
00:04:36.512 --> 00:04:42.159
let's see,
like the average time on page say.

62
00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.674
So, you can track how long
people are staying on a page.

63
00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:52.195
There's also things like the,
oops, the bounce rate.

64
00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:57.034
So when a user lands on a page on your
site and then immediately leaves,

65
00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:01.313
the percentage of people that
do that make up the bounce rate.

66
00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:04.421
And generally speaking,
a high bounce rate for

67
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:07.071
your offer of page is not all that great.

68
00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:14.356
So, you can track a bounce rate for a page
or other metrics that you care about.

69
00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:19.221
The other bit that you probably are gonna
care about a lot is our goals and

70
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:24.588
I can show you that interface to create
that very quickly after I'm done here.

71
00:05:24.588 --> 00:05:26.078
But in the custom report,

72
00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:30.831
you can see how many people are reaching
a certain goals within your applications.

73
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:36.287
So if you have a page that a user can land
on after they successfully signup for

74
00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:39.697
an account,
you can configure that as a goal and

75
00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:45.326
you can track how many people are reaching
that account sign up success page and

76
00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:48.934
you can start to slice and
dice data based on that.

77
00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:55.643
The dimension is going to be
the other axis of this report.

78
00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:59.248
So if the metric is
the thing we wanna count,

79
00:05:59.248 --> 00:06:04.035
the dimension is the unit that
is generating the metrics.

80
00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:07.949
So for something like bounce rate or
a goal conversion,

81
00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.795
the dimension that that would
map to is a landing page.

82
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:16.252
So whichever page somebody comes to
on your site, I'll just search for

83
00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:20.577
landing page and there are lots of
different dimensions you can use.

84
00:06:20.577 --> 00:06:23.885
So we can run a report,
for every landing page,

85
00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:27.550
which of them has the lowest bounce rate?

86
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.442
Here, so you can also filter,

87
00:06:30.442 --> 00:06:36.129
add filters to only look at
certain sections of the site say.

88
00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:44.723
So, you can have a landing page filter and
I do this a lot.

89
00:06:44.723 --> 00:06:45.864
So in this case,

90
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:51.910
I wanna only look at landing pages that
whose paths start with slash docs.

91
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.823
So if you're only interested in running in
a port for certain sections of the site,

92
00:06:56.823 --> 00:07:00.485
you can add a filter down there,
but I will raise that for now.

93
00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:05.611
I'll just add a few more metrics in here,
so we can see what they look like.

94
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:11.500
Users and then I can also look at say,
time on page.

95
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.269
Average time on page.

96
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:19.571
So, I have three metrics that
we're gonna track across

97
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:24.525
all the different landing pages
on my piddling little website.

98
00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:26.423
So, here's our custom report and

99
00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:30.620
we can see the number of users total
across all the landing pages on the site.

100
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.140
So the landing page with
the highest bounce rate is my

101
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.930
description of a Toy Signal Conference,
but

102
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.540
has a very small amount of
users that are coming there.

103
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.839
The home page has the most
amount of users coming to it,

104
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.488
also has a very high bounce rate.

105
00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:54.269
But for folks that land on the about page,
that bounce rate is quite a bit lower.

106
00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:59.440
After they look at about, they're much
more likely to view a second page or

107
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.410
a third page on my site
during the session.

108
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.906
So, not large numbers here.

109
00:08:05.906 --> 00:08:10.848
But when you're trying to optimize
landing pages for certain user goals,

110
00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:15.946
creating custom reports like this can tell
you how close you are to the mark and

111
00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:19.020
it will let you track
your progress over time.
