[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.058 --> 00:00:07.762
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: What we're gonna finish
up with is a topic which is near and

3
00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:09.202
dear to my heart,

4
00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:15.780
which might be kind of strange
considering I'm a developer by trade.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.950
But understanding what's going on in your
application from a user's perspective

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.460
is something that I try to get
better at every every day, and

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.290
make part of my decision making
process as much I possibly can.

8
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.820
And the primary tool that I use
to do that is Google Analytics.

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.440
There are actually some other paid tools
that you can use that are very cool.

10
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.090
My new favorite toy is Heap Analytics,

11
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.660
where you can retroactively
create behavior statistics.

12
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.220
By essentially creating CSS selectors for

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.460
elements on your page and
attaching events to those.

14
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.099
And you don't need to instrument
those events ahead of time.

15
00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:04.950
You can actually retroactively
pull those events out.

16
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.740
So there's that.

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.047
There's Optimizely,
which is useful for A/B testing.

18
00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:16.080
But the core of it all is definitely the
data that we get out of Google Analytics.

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.335
So what we'll do in this section is we'll
learn a little bit about what kind of

20
00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:23.157
intelligence we can glean
from Google Analytics.

21
00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:28.704
I'll hop in at the UI and point out
a couple of the key features that you

22
00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:34.460
might wanna check out in your quest
to find data about your users.

23
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.540
And then we'll also take

24
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.730
our last code break of the day to
actually implement Universal Analytics

25
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.210
on our TodoMVC application
using a handy node module.

26
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.573
So, why do you care about
analytics in the first place?

27
00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:58.640
Mostly because you don't know everything,
right?

28
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.351
You may have a strong hypothesis
about what a user might need.

29
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.910
About places they might go on your site.

30
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.240
But all it is without
data is your opinion.

31
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.280
So using Google Analytics as a part
of your decision making process as

32
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.520
a developer.

33
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.700
For what you spend your time on,
ends up being a useful skill to acquire.

34
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.630
Once you realize that you want to
be working as smartly s you can,

35
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.930
and not just shipping code with your head
down, Google Analytics can help you make

36
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.750
the best decisions possible for
what you're going to be focusing on.

37
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.770
And when you look at some of the data
coming from your application,

38
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.130
you'll be able to serve your users better.

39
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.393
You'll understand what they find useful.

40
00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.690
What they're searching for.

41
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.144
And you can help them find
it a little bit more easily.

42
00:02:49.144 --> 00:02:52.004
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
are parts of Google Analytics free, or

43
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:55.155
are they just all free or-
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: You can sign up for

44
00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:57.143
Google, I know, yeah its free.

45
00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.970
So you can integrate on your site.

46
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.610
There is a premium offering for
Google Analytics, but it is,

47
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.970
what is it like,
it's in the six figures annually.

48
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.440
I forget what the actual price tag is,
but it is quite expensive.

49
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.330
Then you can get closer to real-time data,
and it's more granular information.

50
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.150
But the core of the offering
is definitely free.

51
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.918
Who in here is in
Google Analytics regularly?

52
00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:34.780
So we got James, we got Mark,
couple folks looking around.

53
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.620
That's okay.

54
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.280
As developers it's not something
that we necessarily do every day.

55
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.650
But it can make all of us better at our
jobs if we're developing for the web.
