2
00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:06.596
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So what do you have
to do your code to put flags or

3
00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.150
whatever in there to make
it easier to find them

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.443
on the reports?
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Man,

5
00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:14.041
are you on a two-wheeled
machine that you lean to drive?

6
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.569
Because that was an amazing segue,
my friend-

7
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:17.208
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH]

8
00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:18.643
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Into what we are going

9
00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:19.447
to do next.

10
00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:24.509
Which is we talk about how we
implement universal analytics in

11
00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.569
Node.js where we will be adding
JavaScript code to the client

12
00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.747
side of our application to track
page views and custom events.

13
00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:38.160
We talked a little bit about
the custom event data model.

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.980
A category is a logical grouping for
a kind of event, like video events.

15
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.080
An action is a play, pause, or a scrub,

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.230
and then a label might be the specific
video that's being played.

17
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.500
But the general stats around page views
are what you're gonna be collecting first.

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.600
And a page view event will send
with it all kinds of other events

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.238
to Google to populate all the rest of
the data that you saw on that interface.
