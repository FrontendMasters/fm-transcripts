[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.716
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: I
think what we can do now,

3
00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:09.960
is folks that want to take the plunge,
can start doing that.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.520
I'll come around and help anybody who
wants to go through the actual deploy

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.150
process and/or answer any questions
about anything else that we had today.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.700
If you are planning on doing
the Elastic Beanstalk deployment,

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.440
we just sat and did it for
a good 30 minutes.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.220
So that's probably about the budget
that you had set at this point for

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.960
getting that going.

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.570
Which is totally cool and
it's kind of why we're here,

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.790
or one of the reasons why we're here.

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.821
So if you're down to give it a shot,
I will handhold

13
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:51.739
all of your way through
that process as best I can.

14
00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.637
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And you're planning on
writing some documentation about this too?

15
00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:58.988
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yeah,
as part of the written materials I'd

16
00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:02.440
like to do some written
stuff on this as well.

17
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So all the stuff that was
just deployed, is that all free, then,

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.854
to run or is it hourly?

19
00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:12.859
Is there any hourly?

20
00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: All the stuff that
I used was within the free tier.

21
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.198
Like all the instances were T2 micros.

22
00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:22.610
So yeah, this was within the free tier.

23
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.520
But you can sort of dial up any of
the individual pieces to more expensive.

24
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So you could run a ton
of little applications like this on

25
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.640
free tier, and then it's just when
you want to dial them up is when

26
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.780
the charges will start coming in.

27
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, yeah and I think
the free tier is my understanding is you

28
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.915
have 12 months with it or something and
then you start paying regardless.

29
00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:47.190
But yeah,
I think at this at this level and

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.196
I think there might be
limitations on numbers as well.

31
00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:51.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 750 hours.

32
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.267
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: 750 hours?

33
00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:54.135
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: A month.

34
00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:56.170
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: A month
is the free tier limit.

35
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So
it's 1 instance in 31 days.

36
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.397
If you got 2 instances, it's 15 days.

37
00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:04.015
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Of computer time,
essentially.

38
00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:04.712
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

39
00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:05.665
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Gotcha.

40
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So you want to make sure
you aren't just spinning these up all

41
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.249
the time.

42
00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.780
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Not willy nilly, no.

43
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.212
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have like
a monthly $15 Amazon bill that I just have

44
00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:21.034
no idea that.

45
00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:24.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
That's what I'm afraid.

46
00:02:24.174 --> 00:02:26.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just opt for
the $15,000 Enterprise one?

47
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.925
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: [LAUGH]
I don't know man.

48
00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:31.433
But no, I think I just have
enough little stuff where

49
00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:33.896
I've ran out of the free
tier on a couple accounts.

50
00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:39.726
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: For
those of us that want to go through this.

51
00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:44.306
I mean, could you go through that
list slower, the whole set up?

52
00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:44.832
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Mm-hm.

53
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:48.212
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Cuz you went through it fast
enough that there was no way I could be

54
00:02:48.212 --> 00:02:49.851
here and watching at the same.

55
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:52.061
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yep, absolutely,
I can definitely do that.

56
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:55.790
I can kind of go back into
the environment that we just created.

57
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.150
And show you some of the bits that we had
to configure kind of from the beginning,

58
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.040
if that helps.

59
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.474
All right, so
great request is to kind of retrace

60
00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:09.777
the steps of that deploy now that we.

61
00:03:09.777 --> 00:03:14.820
There's a lot of downtime in there that
where we might have missed some things.

62
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.627
So I'll just go through and
retrace the steps of the deployment from

63
00:03:19.627 --> 00:03:23.520
top to bottom, or
provisioning the new environment.

64
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.477
So the first thing that I did,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Was here in

65
00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:30.029
the console.

66
00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:35.770
I go down to my Identity &amp;
Access Management interface.

67
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.530
And if I don't have one already,
I'm gonna create a user for use in

68
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.570
essentially deploying stuff like getting
credentials to deploy stuff to Amazon.

69
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:57.260
So we create a new user with a username
and I'll just delete that one right away.

70
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.280
So we create the user and
then we download the credential,

71
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.150
the security credentials for that user.

72
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.080
And so we can use that to authenticate
the Elastic Beanstalk command line

73
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.630
interface later.

74
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.733
After we create that user,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Here I'll just

75
00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:20.651
delete that right away,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: All right,

76
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:24.580
so after we create that user,
we wanna add that user to a group.

77
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.803
So we check that user, and
then we say Add User to Groups.

78
00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.493
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: I think I actually
already added it to the only group that I

79
00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:37.610
had, like this one.

80
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.660
But if I do like-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So for

81
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.360
how do you download the credentials?

82
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.890
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: After you create,
I'll do it one more time.

83
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.952
So after you create the user,

84
00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:53.620
there's a button here that
says Download Credentials.

85
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Okay, I was trying to get
it from an existing user, so I have to.

86
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.380
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, from an existing
you only have one opportunity to download

87
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.190
credentials for
a user after you create them.

88
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.663
Otherwise you have to regenerate
credentials for a user.

89
00:05:13.258 --> 00:05:16.276
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And then for
a new user that's been created,

90
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:18.840
you can add them to a group.

91
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.410
In my case, I only have one group,
and that's like the super admin group.

92
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.260
So you choose to add them to that.

93
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you have to
create that ahead of time?

94
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.349
Is that something we'll have to do?

95
00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.300
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yes,
you will have to create that group.

96
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.043
So when you create the new group,

97
00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:41.195
you can say, you call it some group.

98
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.344
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: And then after you
create the group, you can choose like

99
00:05:56.344 --> 00:06:01.810
a preset policy from a list
that will apply to that group.

100
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.620
Administrators access
is the god mode policy.

101
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.458
And then there's lots of other
more granular policies you

102
00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.110
can choose from as well.

103
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.686
So you create that group and

104
00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:22.849
then all the users you assign to that
group will have that set of permissions.

105
00:06:28.735 --> 00:06:31.421
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So it doesn't matter
the name of the group really,

106
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.608
it just matters that that user's
is a member of that group and

107
00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:36.177
that they have admin-
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Yep,

108
00:06:36.177 --> 00:06:41.710
and that they have privileges on whatever
AWS resources they need to access.

109
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.430
And using the super admin policy
means that they have everything.

110
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.520
So once you have a user created
who's assigned to a group

111
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.050
with a sufficiently permissive policy.

112
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.173
Then you're ready to start
cranking out some actual stuff.
