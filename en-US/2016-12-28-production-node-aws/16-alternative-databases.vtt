&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Before
we dive into that,

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.415
quickly going through some alternatives,
I think probably the most popular

4
00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:14.480
alternative in the Node world is
MongoDB which is really great.

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.720
It natively speaks JSON.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.260
It's pretty fast and there's no migrations
because obviously it's a NoSQL database,

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.840
and can sort of store document objects

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.810
whose content can change without
necessitating a database migration.

9
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.380
Also Mongoose, as I mentioned,
the ODM on top of MongoDB

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.260
is probably much better than any
similar tool in Node.js right now.

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.600
There's a lot more resources
out there on on how to use it.

12
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.855
So there is definitely that advantage.

13
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:56.241
Using ORM Sequelize is definitely
a choice that you would make if

14
00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:02.640
using a relational database is important
to you for reason, as it is for us.

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.920
And if you like the features that Postgres
offers, which are many and in great.
