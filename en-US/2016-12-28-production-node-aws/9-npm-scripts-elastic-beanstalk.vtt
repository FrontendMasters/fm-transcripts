&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: I
mentioned this before but

3
00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:09.846
the NPM scripts have a special
relationship with Elastic Beanstalk

4
00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:14.940
which is gonna be our deployment
environment here this afternoon.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.350
The three NPM scripts that Elastic
Beanstalk cares about is NPM start,

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.920
which is going to be the command
that's run to actually start up

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.654
the web process that's gonna serve
requests on your EC2 instance.

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.790
Prestart, which is the command
to run prior to the start.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.245
And poststart, which as you might imagine,

10
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.641
is the command run after
the start command.

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.482
So wherever we have an NPM start
is going to be the way that

12
00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:48.424
Elastic Beanstalk launches
our node process.

13
00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:53.273
In our example, we're just launching our
server process with the node command.

14
00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:57.621
But you might imagine we could do
other things like start it with

15
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.151
a process manager like PM2 or
Nodemon or Forever or

16
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:05.270
something like that rather
than just using node directly.

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.546
So this is the opportunity we have to kind
of configure how our node process is run.
