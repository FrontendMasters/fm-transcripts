00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:07.399
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: Looks like we have
a couple pull request in to take a look at

3
00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.110
our two challenges.

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.800
So let's see what we've got,
see if folks were able to crack this nut.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.080
I did notice that we had
one one contribution,

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
that is what we're looking for,
in addition to a couple stylistic fixes

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.670
that I had actually mentioned yesterday,
so I appreciate the help there.

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.720
Well, basically what we had to do to
add this Babel set of presets is,

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.390
number one, install the preset
set as a development dependency.

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.150
In our package.json, which we did here.

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.974
So there is the ES at 2016 preset.

12
00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:54.626
We also added the presets, or
we changed the presets configuration for

13
00:00:54.626 --> 00:01:02.180
Babylon five, such that it would use both
of those presets, both es2015 and es2016.

14
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.130
So that is what we're looking for and
now when we compile our JavaScript,

15
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.140
we'll have the ability to use those ES
2016 features which I think there's

16
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.300
actually only like one or two major
ones in our JavaScript files as well.

17
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.150
So we want to immediately put it to work,
but now our JavaScript,

18
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.352
our client side JavaScript capabilities
are just that much more lite.

19
00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:32.277
So I'm gonna go ahead, and

20
00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:37.854
+1 this guy looks good to me.

21
00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:39.270
And I'm gonna merge it down.

22
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.394
So thank you very much, good work there.
&gt;&gt; Kevin Whinnery: All right,

23
00:01:45.394 --> 00:01:51.837
we also have a pull request for
the for the SCSS changes.

24
00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:57.887
We have the font color
defined as a variable here,

25
00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:04.812
looks to be a gray,
I'm sure it's perfectly readable.

26
00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:10.061
And then we're using or we're
changing the color of the H1 to that.

27
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:15.518
And then in the info, we're actually
changing all of the color to that,

28
00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:19.660
rather than just the anchors,
which I guess is fine.

29
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.860
So that's pretty close.

30
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.510
I think what I was hoping for was we'd
actually just get the anchors themselves.

31
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.210
But that's pretty close.

32
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.690
So I'm gonna say part
partial credit there.

33
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.760
The primary bit is here we define this
shared color that we're then gonna

34
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.130
use two different places in our,
in our CSS declarations.

35
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.950
So that is definitely what
we're looking for there.
