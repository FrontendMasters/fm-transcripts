Hi everyone, welcome to this
workshop on design patterns.

2
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.477
I'm Lydia Hallie,
I'm a staff developer advocate at Vercel.

3
00:00:06.477 --> 00:00:10.327
And in my free time, I really enjoy
writing about technical concepts,

4
00:00:10.327 --> 00:00:11.748
especially JavaScript.

5
00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:15.844
And I like to do that in kinda like
visualized way, so creating animations to

6
00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:19.757
get a better understanding of what's
actually going on under the hood.

7
00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:21.024
And back in 2020,

8
00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:25.098
I collaborated together with Addy Osmani
on a project called Patterns.

9
00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:29.066
And this is actually related to a book
that he published back in 2012,

10
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.354
which was incredible.

11
00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:32.694
But as you can imagine, back in 2012 or

12
00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:36.727
the JavaScript ecosystem was pretty
different than what it is nowadays.

13
00:00:36.727 --> 00:00:41.388
So I collaborated with him to kind of give
this a modern perspective using the ES15

14
00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:46.318
syntax, and also including React patterns,
design patterns, rendering patterns,

15
00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:47.735
performance patterns.

16
00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.703
So in this workshop, I'll be covering
design patterns, React patterns,

17
00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:54.370
performance patterns,
and rendering patterns.

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.777
And for this workshop I've
created a website hosted

19
00:00:57.777 --> 00:01:00.493
on javascriptpatterns.vercel.app.

20
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.901
So if you want to follow along and
do the exercises,

21
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:06.132
make sure to visit this website.

22
00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.676
And for the exercises,
I'm using StackBlitz.

23
00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:11.870
Now, you don't need to have an account for
that, which is pretty nice.

24
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.835
I just didn't wanna have to deal
the environment setup, all of that stuff.

25
00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:19.740
So when you're doing an exercise and
you wanna get it on a bigger screen,

26
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.492
just to quickly show,
you can just click on here and

27
00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:26.675
you actually see it open up a bit bigger,
bigger font size and all that stuff.

28
00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:31.415
So design patterns are concepts that we
can use to solve or at least solve in

29
00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:36.239
a performant way, commonly recurring
issues in software architecture.

30
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.728
Now, before I get started with all
the patterns that we'll be covering today,

31
00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:41.144
they aren't just a checklist.

32
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:44.834
It's not like, these are the patterns
that will make your app performant, so

33
00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.964
just implement this in your app
right away, that's not how it works.

34
00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:52.457
I'm just here kind of to raise awareness,
hey, these patterns exist.

35
00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:54.889
These are commonly recurring issues or

36
00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:59.467
minor problems that might affect
your app's performance pretty badly.

37
00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.015
So maybe in the future,
if you ever run into an issue with

38
00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:06.083
your software architecture, you're like,
hey, wait a second, I've learned this,

39
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:09.628
I've heard about this issue, I believe
I can use this pattern to solve this.
