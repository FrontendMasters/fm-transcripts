00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.580
All right, so the first thing I'm gonna do
is to create a new file called observable.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.670
And in here first we're just going to
create an empty array with the observers.

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.040
And then we're just going to experts and
Objects.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.970
Now I'm just going to freeze it.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.822
You don't have to,

6
00:00:18.822 --> 00:00:22.270
I just like to do that to make sure
that we don't accidentally change it.

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.450
And the first method that we
wanna add is to subscribe.

8
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.287
So this one takes a function and

9
00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:30.475
we are pushing that function
to the observers array.

10
00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.310
And then the second one is notify.

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.866
And in this one we have the data and

12
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.430
we want to notify all
the observers within this array.

13
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.513
So we can do observer stuff for
each observer.

14
00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:42.065
And we invoke these
observers with the data.

15
00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:48.589
Now we can import this observable,
for example, in the NRES, so

16
00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.382
we can use,
I'm just going to change this real quick.

17
00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:57.410
Us import Observable, from observable.

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.490
And instead of invoking these methods
I can say, Observable.notify data.

19
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.129
And same for the other one.

20
00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:11.916
Now the only thing I have to change
here is in analytics I also have to

21
00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:16.720
import this observable, so
import Observable from observable.

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.176
And here I just have to subscribe
these methods because we want to

23
00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:23.640
invoke these methods when we notify them,
are the observable.

24
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.524
So Observable.subscribe
since you analytics

25
00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:34.142
Observable.subcribe, custom analytics,

26
00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:39.402
and then Observable.subscribe,
sendtoEmail.

27
00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:43.230
Subscribe, all right, so
right now when we click on the button,

28
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.860
the observable gets notified
with the data that we pass here.

29
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.521
So let's see if our observer
is that a function?

30
00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:55.810
Let me just refresh this real quick.

31
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.130
Yeah, so this was just stackless thing, I
have to refresh it so the error goes away.

32
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.415
But now when we invoke the observer,

33
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.990
you can see that it has
the exact same results.

34
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.190
We log data to this fake
analytics provider.

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.109
But instead of invoking all these methods
here on the event listener we just have to

36
00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.761
say observable.notify.
