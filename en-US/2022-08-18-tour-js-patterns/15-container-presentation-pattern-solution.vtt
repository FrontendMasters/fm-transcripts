00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:04.294
So the first thing or
I just open a backup in StackList.

2
00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:07.434
So the first thing that we see
here is that oldest data or

3
00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:10.869
the fetching data is now in
our presentational component.

4
00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.486
So we don't want that, so

5
00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:16.761
we're just going to move this to
our container listings component.

6
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:20.037
I just copied it,
I'm just going to paste it.

7
00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:24.801
Now, in here, I already imported the
listings component from the presentational

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.782
listings that's exported here.

9
00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:31.582
So I can remove this and instead,
I'm going to expect some props from here,

10
00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:36.157
because I'm going to get the listings
from props instead of my own data,

11
00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:37.735
instead of my own state.

12
00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:40.923
Now, it just shows up because
I haven't passed it there yet.

13
00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:44.806
So in here, I have listings and
all I'm gonna do is to return listings,

14
00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:48.063
the presentational components and
then listings is data.

15
00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:53.557
Data listings sorta like that.

16
00:00:53.557 --> 00:01:01.351
Let me just get this real quick,
There's a caching problem again.

17
00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:05.404
Oops.

18
00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:07.583
Presentational.

19
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:13.045
It'll just props them up.

20
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.762
Listings.

21
00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:22.334
Okay, I'm just gonna
refresh this real quick.

22
00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:29.260
&gt;&gt; I think in app.js,
you need to be pulling in listings from

23
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.894
container instead of
presentational component.

24
00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:38.249
&gt;&gt; You are so right, okay, it's from
the container, yeah, that was it, okay,

25
00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.162
that was my bad.

26
00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:43.793
Okay, so now indeed, yeah, so because we
had to render that upper level container

27
00:01:43.793 --> 00:01:47.913
component, which of course,
wrapped that presentational component.

28
00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:51.610
It was complaining that it didn't have
access to props because we were still

29
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.819
rendering that presentational component.

30
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.625
Yeah, so in here,
we're now just fetching the data here and

31
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:59.886
then rendering listings as
a presentational component right there.

32
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.974
So that's a pretty useful way too, yeah,

33
00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:04.652
like I said before I have
that separation of concerns.

34
00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:09.440
We just have one component just
responsible for fetching data and

35
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.411
the other for the presentational side.

36
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.434
Questions?

37
00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:17.910
&gt;&gt; Is it common to split the component
files into container and

38
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.515
presentational folders?

39
00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:24.577
I've typically always kept similar files
together, all the listing files and-

40
00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.082
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

41
00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:28.135
&gt;&gt; Components listings folder,
for example, but

42
00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:31.342
I've never known what
the preferred approach is.

43
00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:34.446
&gt;&gt; I don't really think
there's a preferred approach,

44
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:37.484
I'm very used to splitting
this up into container and

45
00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:42.290
presentational, but everyone has their
own way of naming files, naming folders.

46
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.891
I mean, yeah, we could have just
moved this back to, no, okay, well,

47
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:47.855
I won't, cuz it just throws an error.

48
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:51.534
We could have just named this like
listings container component about tsx, or

49
00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:53.604
listings component, it doesn't matter.

50
00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:56.604
Personally, I prefer this, but
if you prefer anything else,

51
00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:57.916
that's completely fine.

52
00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:00.936
I don't know if there is
the best way to do it,

53
00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:06.594
I think every developer kind of uses their
own way of folder structure naming files.
