WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so we can open files.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.470
We can read the files
from the file system.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.960
There's a few other things
that we can do here.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.200
These are all kinda silly.

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.986
I don't personally use them all that
often but you can do button label,

6
00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:19.098
which will be instead of the word Open,
it'll be something else.

7
00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:22.246
Does anyone have strong opinions on
what we should name our Open button?

8
00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:23.135
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Unveil.

9
00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:24.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Unveil?

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.970
I will just let you know in my notes.

11
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.960
It's just wow, wow, wow,
wow, so this is better.

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.850
So do unveil, and this one,
if you're on a Mac,

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.470
you will never see, which is the title.

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040
But if you're on Windows,
you will see this.

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.150
Just, it's that for

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.220
native file dialogues, modern versions
of MAC don't have a tunnel bar at all.

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.700
But if you're on Windows or Linux,
you will see this title in there as well.

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.780
All right, let's go ahead and
fire that up.

19
00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:04.231
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
now you can see that when I select a file,

20
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.960
I can unveil it in my application.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.900
All right, so
you got some customization here.

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.090
Again, if you were Window or Linux, there
would be a title bar up here that would

23
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.300
show you the open firewall document thing,
right?

24
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.760
MAC OS users will just have to trust me.

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.800
Do any of the Windows or LInux can
we verify we see something there?

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.508
All right, cool.

27
00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:30.560
All right, so that's neat.

28
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.930
We can do stuff and
console.log it to the terminal.

29
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.390
Generally speaking, the users or

30
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.660
application are not going to
have the terminal open, right?

31
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.510
So having this cool user interface
here where we ask them for a file and

32
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.210
then show them nothing, I mean there
was that one, it was Yo App, right?

33
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.420
So I guess you could
make money off of this.

34
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.980
I don't wanna tell what
you can do with your life.

35
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.830
In Renderer, let's go ahead and
start to wire up the code.

36
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.640
And so we could say something
along the lines of openFileButton.

37
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.790
We'll addEventListener.

38
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.523
We'll say, hey, when they click that
button or they clock it, if they click it.

39
00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:15.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll also start with

40
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.425
an alert,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You

41
00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:23.300
clicked the open file button!

42
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.314
Cool, the other thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna get rid of this function

43
00:02:30.314 --> 00:02:30.858
right now.

44
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.233
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll go ahead and
we'll start this up.

45
00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:48.017
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We hit open file,
we've clicked the open file button.
