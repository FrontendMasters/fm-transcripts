00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah?

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.815
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So before I knew how
to actually do it, I just had made

3
00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:14.040
main.js's getFileFromUser
function just return the content.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.690
And then renderer, it just

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.980
took the content that was being returned
by that function and slapped it in

6
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.109
the document the same as we're doing here-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: For

7
00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.253
an absraction over the same-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And, it worked, but

8
00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:35.020
obviously, we want to maybe do
this other event-based way.

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.550
What are the pitfalls of the sort of
naive way that I initially did it?

10
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.980
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't know
if it's necessarily naive.

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.870
It becomes black magic,
[LAUGH] And so part of it,

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.250
this is how it is working under the hood.

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.130
It becomes a little more
interesting though, too,

14
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.652
when what happens in one window,
you might not need it for that window.

15
00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.790
So what if it happens if we have
a window that is our settings, and

16
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.660
changing the settings you need to
communicate with a different window.

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.392
So, generally speaking,
returning from the function will work.

18
00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:04.422
But if you need to get slightly more
complicated, then figuring out how to

19
00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:08.517
communicate between the different
processes and sometimes you're doing

20
00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:12.040
a contrived example to show,
[LAUGH] How it works under the hood.

21
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.830
So I think, yeah, you could totally
return out of it, cuz effectively in

22
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.730
the same way remote is using IPC,
but we don't really see it, right?

23
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.100
We're just saying, hey,
remote don't require main process.

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.610
Everything's great, right?

25
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.004
It's the same basic underlying
mechanism both ways.

26
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:26.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, question,

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.530
all the rendering processes will
receive the same message, pretty much?

28
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, if we look-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The multiple ones.

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.235
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If we
look over in the code.

30
00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:39.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: In this case I'm
sending it to the main window, right?

31
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.760
So if we had multiple windows,
we'd need some kinda data structure,

32
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.732
ideally not an array, but let's say
like some kind of like map, right?

33
00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:48.930
And we'd say, all right, for this Window,
I'm gonna send you this message, right?

34
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.680
And there's all sorts of fun things, like
having multiple windows creates a certain

35
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.380
number of complexity problems which is,
all right, they go in MacOS.

36
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.080
They go to the application menu and
hit open.

37
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.730
Neat, which window, right?

38
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.530
On Windows and Linux, the application
menu is for every window, right?

39
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.270
But on MacOS when you have that common
one, you need to know what the most

40
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.180
recent or the currently focused
window is to send the message to.

41
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.220
So stuff gets slightly more complicated,
right?

42
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.490
So for your example, right?

43
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.040
For the button, it would work, right?

44
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.021
But if we had the application menu, right?

45
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:26.943
We're not calling it from the window so
we still need to figure out,

46
00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:30.763
we'd have to get the focus window and
then send an IPC message to it, right?

47
00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:31.915
So there's really,

48
00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:36.589
to answer the previous question an example
where simply returning it wouldn't work.

49
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.363
You'd need to find a way
to communicate to it.
