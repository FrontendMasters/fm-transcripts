00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.045
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If we know that
we can access the file system,

2
00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:08.214
it would be really great if we could
actually go ahead and read a file, right?

3
00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:09.849
But what file do we read?

4
00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.310
Well, in Node land,
we just use const fs = require fs.

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.730
And either you take it as
a command line argument, or

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.379
you know which file you're reading,
so on and so forth.

7
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:21.962
In this case we're
creating user interfaces,

8
00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:27.884
which means that we need to go ahead and
ask the user what file they want to open.

9
00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:30.235
Now, this could be tricky, right?

10
00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:32.838
Do you want to create your
own bespoke user interface?

11
00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:36.245
Like, all right, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to start in the current

12
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.610
directory and
I'm going to do like the fs.redir.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.956
And then I'm going to create
this entire react application.

14
00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:43.906
Where they're going to pick a file and
it's going to look all weird and

15
00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:44.422
brand new.

16
00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:47.513
Because have you ever opened up one of
those Java applications from the early

17
00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:48.053
2000s?

18
00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:51.991
And everything looks like slightly off and
weird, right?

19
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.808
We don't want to do that, right?

20
00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:56.954
It won't look like a Windows app, it won't
look like a Mac app, so on and so forth.

21
00:00:56.954 --> 00:00:58.656
So what we'll end up doing is,

22
00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:02.068
we'll actually use the native
file system dialogs, right?

23
00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:07.330
And so in Windows, the Windows user
will get a Windows file picker, right?

24
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.623
On Mac OS,
they'll get Mac OS file picker, on Linux,

25
00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:13.210
they'll get a Linux file picker, right?

26
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.250
Whatever, whether it's Gnome or KD or
whatever, they'll get that in place.

27
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.296
So we don't have to do that ourselves
because that it is kind of built in for

28
00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:24.448
us in Electron.

29
00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:28.825
Anyone want to take a lucky guess
what module we use for a file dialog?

30
00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:33.513
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: File dialog?

31
00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:36.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Close, dialog, [LAUGH].

32
00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:41.594
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so we have
dialog and dialog will go ahead, and

33
00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:43.760
there's a bunch of methods on it.

34
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.619
I'm going to create a function then
we're going to move it around and

35
00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.715
use it different places.

36
00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:52.380
Because we don't know, I talked about it
earlier, which is operating system stuff.

37
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.357
The dialog module is only available
in the main process, right?

38
00:01:56.357 --> 00:02:00.178
And so that might be tricky, like but
I have a button in my user interface,

39
00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:02.596
I'm going to need to
talk to the main process.

40
00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:05.081
We'll deal with that in a second, right
now we're just going to call the function,

41
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.701
and then we'll figure out
how to wire it up correctly.

42
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:09.385
So I'm going to make this function
because I'm going to move it around

43
00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:10.119
multiple places.

44
00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.558
I'm going to call it const,
maybe not in all caps.

45
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.969
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: const getFileFromUser,
right?

46
00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.290
This is arbitrary function name,
you can call this any way you want,

47
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.564
you want to write ES5 function keywords,
whatever, it's fine.

48
00:02:24.564 --> 00:02:26.230
This is just a JavaScript function.

49
00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:34.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and
what we'll do now is we can say.

50
00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:41.764
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Dialog, let's hit dot,
and there is a bunch of stuff in here,

51
00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:47.280
the ones that I'm kind of most
interested in are these show methods.

52
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.214
So showErrorBox,
showMessageBox, showOpenDialog,

53
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:55.920
that one seems useful for
what I want to do.

54
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.325
So I'll say dialog.showOpenDialog, and

55
00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:05.820
we've got,
this takes a few different arguments.

56
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.416
It can take a first argument,
which is a browser window object.

57
00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:13.371
Which we'll talk about in a second, we're
going to ignore that one for a second.

58
00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:18.197
It takes effectively an object
full of options, and

59
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:24.462
what we can do is give it some
properties and properties is an array.

60
00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:29.368
And these are the kind of, what kind
of native file dialog do you want?

61
00:03:29.368 --> 00:03:32.711
And you might be like,
I want one where I can pick files,

62
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:37.069
cool, which is different than one for
saving files, so on and so forth.

63
00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.309
But depending on your application, should
they be able to select multiple files?

64
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.380
Do we show hidden files?

65
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.970
So on and so forth, so
there's a bunch of options in here.

66
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.280
We can look at the docs in a second, but

67
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.530
the one that we know we want is openFile,
right?

68
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.553
Which will allow us to
basically select a file in

69
00:03:59.553 --> 00:04:04.460
this case, and so
this method returns stuff.

70
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.618
And it'll either return one of two things,
it'll return undefined if the,

71
00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:17.042
undefined or null,
we'll find out together in a second.

72
00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:22.148
Undefined or null if the user hits cancel,
or it will turn an array of file

73
00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:27.020
names based on the user's selection,
you're like, why an array?

74
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.103
Because I said earlier,
they can do multi select, so

75
00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:36.840
it could be several files that they
picked, and so on and so forth, right?

76
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.227
So in that case it is an array, that way
you don't have to be like, array.is array,

77
00:04:40.227 --> 00:04:42.351
if they picked multiple
files versus a single file.

78
00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:46.097
It will either be undefined or
an array, cool, so

79
00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:51.735
we'll say const files and that will be
the whatever the result of that was.

80
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:58.150
And for now, we're just going
to console.log files, right?

81
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.899
Let's just see what it gives us,
let's not take my word for anything,

82
00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.417
I'm untrustworthy.

83
00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:10.410
So, any time you change the main process,
you have to quit the application.

84
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.561
We also want to call this function,

85
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:15.368
eventually we want to
wire it up to the button.

86
00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:21.981
We are not there yet, so what we'll do is,
whenever the application is ready,

87
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:25.770
we will do this getFileFromUser function.

88
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.797
So as soon as the application starts up,
it's going to create a browser window.

89
00:05:28.797 --> 00:05:33.070
And right after that, it's going to go
ahead and give me this native file dialog.

90
00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:46.456
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Bounce in, there it is,
cool, so I can pick either one of these

91
00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:50.240
two files from my desktop,
let's go with Grocery List.

92
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.060
The other one is none of your business.

93
00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:01.726
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There it is in the array,
I'm running an old version

94
00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:06.360
of Mac OS because as much as I thought
about upgrading Mac OS yesterday.

95
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.455
The day before I did a six hour workshop,
I resisted that urge, so you may or

96
00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:10.894
may not see this, but it's fine.

97
00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:15.540
It's just yelling at me about
objective c frameworks, it's okay.

98
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.410
More importantly is we've
got this array down here,

99
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.742
which is the file that I selected,
cool, so there it is, and I picked it.

100
00:06:24.742 --> 00:06:26.655
Now I can do all sorts of stuff with this,

101
00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:29.203
now let's just try it one
more time where I cancel it.

102
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.438
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'll go ahead and
I will hit Cancel, and I get undefined.

103
00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:41.348
So we're going to have to be a little
bit defensive, if they hit Cancel,

104
00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:42.600
it's not going to be in array.

105
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.258
So if you go in there and you try to grab
the first thing out of the array, and

106
00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:48.813
it's undefined,
guess what's going to happen?

107
00:06:48.813 --> 00:06:52.127
Your app's going to blow up,
that's not good, so

108
00:06:52.127 --> 00:06:55.070
we have to be slightly
defensive about that.

109
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.640
And what we'll do in this case is we'll
say, if there's no such thing as files,

110
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.998
like if files is false.

111
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.626
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just return out early,
don't do anything else.

112
00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:05.682
Like they cancelled,

113
00:07:05.682 --> 00:07:09.640
we don't need to do anything else here,
cancel this, let's move on, it's fine.
