&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now, your mission.

2
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.660
We implemented Save Markdown.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.790
Save Markdown had to know if they
had a current file, prompt them for

4
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.510
a new one if they didn't, and
then put that in place and open that file.

5
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.360
Export HTML is a subset of that.

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.210
Basically, no matter what, we want to
ask them where they wanna save it.

7
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.410
We don't need to reopen that file,

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.730
cuz it's the HTML,
it's not what our editor does.

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.931
So all we need to do in this case is
wire it up to the Save HTML button to

10
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.476
trigger the Show Save dialog,
let them choose a place.

11
00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:34.321
Based on that choice, write a file to
the file system with that file name and

12
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.830
the HTML content.

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.420
If you need the HTML,
which you're gonna need, I mean,

14
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.480
you could call the marked library, but you
also have it in that DOM element, right?

15
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.890
You have it in that div
where we're rendering it.

16
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
So you could also just grab
the htmlView and grab its innerHTML,

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.150
and you'll also get the same content.

18
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.620
So it's up to you which
way you choose to do that.

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.545
I would just grab it.

20
00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:57.680
If I already did the work, I would
just grab that output and use that.
