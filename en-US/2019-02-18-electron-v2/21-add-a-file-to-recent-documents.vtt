&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The other thing that we
might wanna do is a lot of applications

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.419
will show you the recent documents, right?

3
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.540
My application shows me
the recent documents

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.600
from when I was working on this
previously but not officially, right?

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.490
And so what we want to do is append it
to the recent documents there as well.

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.650
And we could do them to render a process,
but

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.590
that is something that kind of
belongs in the main processes.

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.889
The method on app and when we see it,
it will be very clear what it does.

9
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.740
But we'll say when we open the file,
say app., this one looks good.

10
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.030
addRecentDocument feels
like a good method.

11
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.100
I could do it on the render process, too.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.510
I don't wanna do it on every keystroke,
though, which is when that

13
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.240
update user interface is getting called to
see if we have saved or unsaved changes.

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.220
And I don't want to use the remote module,
so do it here and we'll just say as

15
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.360
the filename and
now that application will get added.

16
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.780
So then if you open up a few files and
either in Windows,

17
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.960
I think you've got the recent documents
in Windows Explorer should show up there.

18
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.424
In MacOS, it will show up either in
the recent documents in the Apple menu or

19
00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:30.789
when you right click on the icon and
on Linux, I don' know.

20
00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.380
[LAUGH]
Somewhere but cool,

21
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.320
so yeah, again, we get to basically play
nicely as if we were a native application,

22
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.250
even though we're built
on web technologies.

23
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.150
Which is kinda cool and not something
I'm used to seeing from the GTK built

24
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.370
applications or Java apps or
anything along those lines.

25
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.100
It is definitely,
you're not gonna fool anyone.

26
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.740
I have a strong opinion about building
Electron apps, which is if you try to

27
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.000
fool somebody, you're never gonna create
a web interface that looks like Mac OS, or

28
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.890
Windows, or a thing like that.

29
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.720
Slack, and Visual Studio Code, and
all those applications, don't really try.

30
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.650
And that's probably better than trying and
by getting 95% of the way there.

31
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.685
But you can do some of the kind of like
base levels of what a user comes to expect

32
00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:23.997
out of an application, really easy with
some of the APIs that Electron gives us.
