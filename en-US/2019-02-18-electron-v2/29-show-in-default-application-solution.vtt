00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.475
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Earlier, we implemented
the ability to show the item in

2
00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:10.026
the folder, we kind of accidentally
tripped on opening the item.

3
00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:12.660
We just wanna get that button
wired up with the event so

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.730
that we gonna have both in place.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.510
So here we have the show file
button with an event list, and

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.640
we really need to add an event
list to the other button.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.825
So here we have the openInDefaultButton,

8
00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:31.397
we'll add the event listener, and
register our click event again.

9
00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:40.864
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we should totally
put a more helpful error message, but

10
00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:45.090
the risk of watching me type and
make typos, we'll just go with that.

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.350
And this time we'll do open item.

12
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.625
And we can actually just pass in
the file path, and now we can go ahead,

13
00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:55.650
flip back over.

14
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.898
Open up a file.

15
00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.794
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We hit open in default
application, my default application is

16
00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:08.534
TextMate, you might have a different
default application on your computer, it

17
00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:12.780
will know that, it will ask the operating
system, what do I open mark down files in?

18
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.740
And it will open it there, right?

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.340
Which is again not possible from
the browser and super cool.
