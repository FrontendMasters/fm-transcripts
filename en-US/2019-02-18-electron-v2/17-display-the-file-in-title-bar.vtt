1
00:00:02.297 --> 00:00:05.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can show the file
in here, and this feels good.

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.100
But, there's some stuff missing in terms
of we can polish this a little bit better.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.540
We can get to a little bit of a deeper
sense of operating system integration.

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.577
Which is, if you go ahead and
look at Visual Studio Code behind me,

5
00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:25.164
I can see what the currently open file is,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right?

6
00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:29.911
Here it's like Fire Sale, it would be
awesome if we could do the same thing

7
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.762
where we could see what
the current file is.

8
00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:37.892
Also like Save File,
I'm keeping disabled right now

9
00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:42.680
because I don't know
the file's changed at all.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.210
I don't know if we've unsaved changes or
anything on those lines, right?

11
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.293
So being able to know if we have saved or
unsaved changes,

12
00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:52.056
being able to show the current
file in the menu bar,

13
00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:55.033
these are all useful things
that we'd come to expect.

14
00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.610
As like, hey, Electron's really great,

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580
because we need to build
these desktop applications.

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.710
But you also have to do a certain
amount of due diligence to like

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.860
build the UI that the user expects, right?

18
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030
And what they're used to,
cuz now you're playing on the game of like

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.410
at least fitting in with
the other applications.

20
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.190
So, what we'd love to do is, we'd love
to see if there's no file, if it's

21
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.540
a brand new Windows, sure, show the name
of the application, that's fine, right?

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.920
But, if they've opened a file,
I would love to show them a filename here.

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.950
If it has unsafe changes,
we should show that in some way.

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.365
I'm curious what Visual Studio Code does,
let's see.

25
00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:34.027
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So it doesn't show
anything in the title bar, but

26
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.720
we'll actually see the very subtle thing.

27
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.237
It does show in the tab bar,
in this case, right, so

28
00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:40.663
it does need to keep track
of some of those things.

29
00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:46.088
All right, so what we'd love to do is show
in the title bar, and the thing about

30
00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:51.944
Electron applications is we can change
anything we want, right, we can edit this.

31
00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:55.360
This is from the title
attribute in the HTML file.

32
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.630
Right, but we can modify this
programmatically with JavaScript.

33
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.430
So let's go look at how we do that.

34
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.320
You'll notice that when I was
sending the contents over,

35
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.360
I sent the filename even
though we weren't using it.

36
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.930
Mostly cuz I have a lesson plan and
I know what we're doing next.

37
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.586
So we're sending both over,

38
00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:17.844
it would be cool if we could
keep track of all those things.

39
00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:20.365
So what I'm gonna do is
in the render process,

40
00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:22.637
I'm gonna create two global variables.

41
00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:27.653
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm gonna have
a file path called file, and

42
00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.838
that'll be an empty string.

43
00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.918
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
I'll have an original content.

44
00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:37.420
Actually, I'm gonna make file null.

45
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.300
OriginalContent and empty string, right,

46
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.110
cuz if they open up a brand new window,
there is no file associated with it.

47
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.798
But if I did the value
of that empty text area,

48
00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:52.109
in the dom, I would get an empty string.

49
00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.024
All right, so
these are effectively the two defaults,

50
00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.010
if you open up a brand new one.

51
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.571
If we open a file,
we're going to set these two variables,

52
00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:03.074
the file name into the original content.

53
00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:07.192
And what I'm gonna be able to do with the
original content is at any given point,

54
00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:11.251
look at the current contents of that
text area, look at the original content,

55
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:13.360
do a string comparison.

56
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.670
If they're different,
guess who has unsaved changes?

57
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.400
Right, the current user.

58
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.600
Right, and if they're the same,
guess who doesn't have unsaved changes?

59
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.280
The user of the application.

60
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.064
So, we'll do real quick is we'll go in
here, and as soon as we get a file open,

61
00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:34.875
what we'll say is that the file,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm actually

62
00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:39.390
gonna rename this variable because
I'm scared of insolent yelling at me.

63
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.036
We'll call it filePath.

64
00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:46.159
We call it filePath = file,
right, cuz scoping.

65
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:53.769
And we'll say originalContent =
this content that just came in.

66
00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.895
If you wanted to name this one filePath
instead, you totally could, but

67
00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:58.688
they just can't be named the same thing,

68
00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:01.881
otherwise one variable overshadows
the other one and nothing will work.

69
00:04:01.881 --> 00:04:04.872
And it will be one of those things where
I sit here squinting at my screen for

70
00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:07.150
25 minutes trying to find the bug.

71
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.650
Let's not do that.

72
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:11.850
All right so,
we'll set those two global variables.

73
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.740
Anytime a new file comes in, right?

74
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.467
We'll be able to use that later.

75
00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:21.347
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's a whole bunch of
things we might want to do to the user

76
00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:22.800
interface whenever we open a file.

77
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.080
We know that we wanna change the file,
we'll see a few others in a second.

78
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.350
So, let's give ourselves a function for
this.

79
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.503
Let's give ourselves a function called,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: const

80
00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:39.209
update,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: UserInterface.

81
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:49.605
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and we'll call this
originally whenever we open a new file.

82
00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:52.956
And we'll eventually call this a few other
places cuz we're gonna need to change

83
00:04:52.956 --> 00:04:54.890
the state of the user
interface in a few ways.

84
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.480
Like for instance, if they have unsaved
changes, maybe we enable that save button.

85
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.750
Seems legit, right?

86
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.800
May be we will enable the revert button,
any of those things.

87
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.414
So there is a few things we need to
do based on something happening.

88
00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:13.153
But first and foremost, let's go ahead and
figure out how to change that title.

89
00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:15.580
So the default title was Fire Sale.

90
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.136
So we could say something like let title

91
00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:23.014
=,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Fire Sale,

92
00:05:23.014 --> 00:05:24.675
which will be the default case.

93
00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:31.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If filePath is a thing,
right now, it's null.

94
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.080
So null is falsy, which means
this conditional will not happen.

95
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.179
But if filePath is not null,
we'll say the title

96
00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:47.402
is,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: filePath

97
00:05:47.402 --> 00:05:51.811
plus the current title,
which is Fire Sale.

98
00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:04.082
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and then, to set
the title of the window, we need to get

99
00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:10.580
a reference to the window, and
then we need to call a method to do it.

100
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.450
So remote has a few other
helpful tricks up its sleeve.

101
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.326
We could say, in this case,
const currentWindow.

102
00:06:21.357 --> 00:06:23.225
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: = remote.currentWindow.

103
00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:34.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and so that will
go ahead and give us the contents of that.

104
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.883
I believe that it's a function,
let's call it doing from memory here.

105
00:06:38.883 --> 00:06:43.192
Luckily we can find out, remote =,

106
00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:49.989
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, or

107
00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:51.503
how to getCurrentWindow.

108
00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:59.381
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
I'll just fix that, getCurrentWindow,

109
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:04.810
which will give me a reference to
the window that this render a process is.

110
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.931
Cuz main window has method
called set title, but

111
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.609
we need the reference to the main window.

112
00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:14.330
So hey, remote, tell me what this current
window is, get me a reference to it.

113
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.591
And so here we're gonna actually say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: currentWindow.setTitle.

114
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.880
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will set
it to the title, right?

115
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.692
So we start with the title being Fire Sale
every time this function is called.

116
00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:34.388
If filePath is not null,
we'll actually prepend the filePath and

117
00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:38.876
then- Fire Sale, and
we'll set the window title.

118
00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:43.784
Now, you might notice in my VS Code
setting that this is slightly dimmed out,

119
00:07:43.784 --> 00:07:45.610
it's cuz I'm not using it.

120
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.528
So we'll say, whenever the user opens
a file, do all that other stuff, and

121
00:07:50.528 --> 00:07:52.128
then update the user interface.

122
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:56.344
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I was take it for a spin.

123
00:07:59.742 --> 00:08:00.889
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll open a file.

124
00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:11.870
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And you can see
I get this long, nasty file name.

125
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.360
Not nearly as nice as
what I had in VS Code.

126
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.009
So let's go ahead and fix that real quick.

127
00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:22.742
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Node has
a useful library called path.

128
00:08:27.246 --> 00:08:30.466
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I can use anything in
the node standard library right next to

129
00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.735
all my dom manipulation, so that's cool.

130
00:08:32.735 --> 00:08:37.710
And,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

131
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.030
say path.basename(filepath), and

132
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.102
that will just get the file name
part of that long slash users,

133
00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:50.950
slash Steve Kinney,
slash desktop yadda yadda yadda.

134
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.772
It'll just get grocerylist.md.

135
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.615
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So npm start.

136
00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:02.228
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Open a File.

137
00:09:03.894 --> 00:09:08.041
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now it's just
Grocery List.md- Fire Sale.
