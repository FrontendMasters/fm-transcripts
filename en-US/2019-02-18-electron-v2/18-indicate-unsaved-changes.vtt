00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Weird though
is like I can just type, type,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.470
type, type, type and I do not know if
I have any unsaved changes or not.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.050
I went and got a cup of coffee and
I came back and sat down.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.540
Is this different?

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.260
I do not remember.

6
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.770
It would be cool if we could show
them some kind of visual indicator

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.540
to see whether or not,
they have unsaved changes.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.514
Now that originalContent,
we have the kinda current

9
00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:30.010
content whenever they go ahead and set it.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.573
So, we could do something like.

11
00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:37.651
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can
make another global.

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:42.384
I'm torn on this one,
do like isEdited = false.

13
00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:47.371
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, cuz when
the application starts up it hasn't been

14
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:49.150
edited, right?

15
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.256
So, then we can go ahead, and
whenever they do that key up.

16
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.194
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can say
isEdited = currentContent.

17
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:10.714
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Does not equal.

18
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.658
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Original content.

19
00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:19.368
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then after we
renderMarkdownToHtml or before,

20
00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:23.224
it really doesn't matter, we can
call that updateUserInterface again.

21
00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:29.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't love this.

22
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.812
The other thing I might consider
doing is passing it in.

23
00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:36.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: As an argument.

24
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.870
Let's actually do that.

25
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.780
Either one is fine.

26
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.980
Whichever one makes you happier.

27
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.259
I don't want to impede on your happiness.

28
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.129
I'll just take a isEdited, and

29
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.609
right now we're just gonna console log.

30
00:01:57.402 --> 00:01:58.560
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Get
rid of that global now.

31
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.060
All right let's review
before we see it in action

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.420
which is whenever there is a key up,

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.260
we're going to see if the currentContent
is not equal to the originalContent.

34
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.932
If so, it's been edited,

35
00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.936
we're gonna pass whatever that
value is updateUserInterface,

36
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:21.121
which right now is just gonna console.log
whether or not we're in an edited state.

37
00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:29.573
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, fun fact, when
you make a change to the main process,

38
00:02:29.573 --> 00:02:34.340
you do need to kill the application and
restart it.

39
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.751
When we make a change to
just the renderer process,

40
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:38.942
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The good buddy

41
00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.760
refreshes back.

42
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.700
And just hit refresh and
you'll be able to see.

43
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.420
So, hit open.

44
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.324
Grocery list, it's edit is undefined.

45
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:57.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: True,
delete, delete, false.

46
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.810
Add AD, it's true, false, true, false.

47
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.700
Right, so now in update user interface,
we know whether or

48
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.110
not the document has been edited.
