&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: As consistent with our
current pattern, I implemented Open and

2
00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:06.604
Save for the full markdown file.

3
00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:07.740
Do you know what you're gonna implement?

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.690
SaveHTML, right?

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.950
So a same basic pattern,
I'll save this branch and I'll push it up.

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.910
And then you're gonna do the same thing.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.270
You're gonna add one more
menu item called saveHTML.

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.540
If you wanna make it,
you don't have to give it an accelerator,

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.070
I don't know if exporting
always will have one.

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.690
You can give it Cmd+E if you want,
Command+Shift+S,

11
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.700
whatever makes you the happiest
you can go ahead and give it.

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.580
What we wanna do is same thing, we wanna
refactor out that event listener to it's

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.550
own method, send a message from the main
process to the renderer process.

14
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.150
And then when that happens, go ahead and

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.840
call that saveHTML function that we
already have in the main process.
