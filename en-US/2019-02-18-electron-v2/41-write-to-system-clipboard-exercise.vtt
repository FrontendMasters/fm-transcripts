&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You are going to
register a second global shortcut.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.427
Might I suggest command, shift, at symbol.

3
00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:12.708
Which is also command, shift, two.

4
00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:15.799
With that we'll send a write
to Clipboard message.

5
00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.215
Which you will, in the same way that we
registered a renderer here you will go

6
00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:21.877
ahead and do the same thing.

7
00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:25.110
And this time it will call
the handleWriteToClipboard method.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.420
And now you'll be able to
add stuff to Clipmaster

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.050
from anywhere in the operating system.

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.550
And read stuff from Clipmaster
anywhere in the operating system.
