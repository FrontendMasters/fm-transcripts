1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So our mission is
to implement the save HTML button.

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.680
So we need another function,
cuz let's not overload the one we have.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll call it exports.saveHtml.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.160
And that we don't, we're always gonna
ask for a file, so we don't need to pass

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.620
on a filename, all we really need is that
html content, so you can call it html,

6
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.486
you can call it content,
I'm gonna call it content for uniformity.

7
00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:38.594
And, it's very similar,
this time we're gonna ask for

8
00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:42.293
a file dialog.showSaveDialog.

9
00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:49.785
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pass in some options,
in this case the title is going to be,

10
00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.650
let's call it Save HTML.

11
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.848
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The default path,
you can set it to whatever you want,

12
00:00:57.848 --> 00:00:59.786
I'm gonna set it to desktop.

13
00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:07.962
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And the filter is gonna
be a little bit different from last time.

14
00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:16.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll have
a name of HTML Files this time.

15
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.762
And we'll go ahead and
give it the extensions of html,

16
00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:30.458
htm, is all the ones I can think of.

17
00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:40.608
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say if there's
no file after all that, return.

18
00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:45.051
Otherwise, fs.writeFileSync,

19
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:50.970
the file we just and
the content we passed in.

20
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.640
And this should be most of the way there.

21
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.390
We will do one tiny Mac OS
optimization in a second but

22
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.829
let's make sure this works
before we do anything else.

23
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.848
So in this case,
we'll go back to the render, and

24
00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:12.765
we'll do the savehtml button,
we'll add EventListner.

25
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This
time we do mainProcess,

26
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: saveHtml.

27
00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:34.282
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll give it
the htmlView and the innerHTML.

28
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:39.870
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now, we've changed the
main process, so we have to kill the app.

29
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.552
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And restart it.

30
00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:49.322
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Type some content.

31
00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:55.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so now we can save it.

32
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.054
And at this point it's
defaulting to the desktop.

33
00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:01.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's an HTML file.

34
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.950
You can see we still edited there's no
saved file at all cuz we didn't save

35
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.780
a file that's totally what we expect.

36
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.730
But we do have this new file on
the desktop with some content.

37
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.750
One thing that you might have
noticed is that if I'd go let's say

38
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.300
to our different apps with
this new text made document.

39
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.510
In Mac OS, a brand new one, is,

40
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.210
I get this nice dropdown sheet, right?

41
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.680
But if I go to save in Firesale,
do the save HTML, it opens like this.

42
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.940
And even then, I don't even get
the title in here, which is lame.

43
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.837
But, we can actually have the same
implementation that we saw with the drop

44
00:03:46.837 --> 00:03:51.362
down sheet that we're used to in
MacOS as we do in a Nato application.

45
00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:54.421
For Windows and
Linux what we're about to do is nothing.

46
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.481
But again some of your
users might be using MacOS.

47
00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:01.162
So considering the amount of
effort it's going to take for us,

48
00:04:01.162 --> 00:04:03.114
I think it's probably worth it.

49
00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:09.182
So, in our main JS,
turns out that dialogue.showSaveDialogue

50
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:13.500
actually can take,
it has that one overload.

51
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.914
It can take an optional first argument,

52
00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:20.391
which is the window that you would like
the sheet to drop down from, right?

53
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:24.194
Now, if you have many windows, you have to
pass a reference to the correct window.

54
00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:28.064
But if you have only one
main window like we do,

55
00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:33.139
you can go ahead to all three of these and
just do mainWindow.

56
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:37.861
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: mainWindow.

57
00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:41.540
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And one more.

58
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:45.161
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: mainWindow.

59
00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:48.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we'll kill the app and
start it back up again.

60
00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:56.298
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Open the file.

61
00:04:56.298 --> 00:04:59.300
Now you can see,
it drops down from that window.

62
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.870
It's the little things that matter.
