00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We need to create
a new menu item called savehtml.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.340
That is going to send a message
to the renderer process.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.033
The renderer process is gonna receive that
message, find all the stuff it needs,

4
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:14.029
communicate back to the main process that,
hey, save this html,

5
00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.452
in the same way it's doing
with the button right now.

6
00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:19.353
So, we can start with little
bit of copy paste action.

7
00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.690
Save file, we'll change that to save HTML.

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.380
HTKM nope, there we go.

9
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.970
We'll add a Shift in there.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.540
And in this case we'll say, save-html.

11
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.265
In the renderer process,
we do need to refactor out this function.

12
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:50.234
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: const saveHTML.

13
00:00:56.527 --> 00:00:58.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oops,
I got a little carried away there.

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.000
There we go.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.730
And we'll go ahead and we'll say saveHTML.

16
00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:11.073
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: For ipcRenderer,

17
00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:16.993
we'll say on save-html message,

18
00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:21.542
go ahead and save the HTML.

19
00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.388
All right, we'll go ahead and
we'll kill that.

20
00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:30.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Check the menu up here.

21
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.967
We've got this new Save HTML.

22
00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:40.947
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
you can see that we've got now this,

23
00:01:40.947 --> 00:01:46.120
fit the HTML in there automatically,
cuz it's calling the same code path.

24
00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:51.057
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We don't update anything,
check my desktop.

25
00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:57.342
[NOISE] There it is with our Hello World.

26
00:01:57.342 --> 00:02:01.590
Awesome, and with that we've
got most of an application.

27
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.550
Obviously, we could fill out the rest
of the menu a little bit more,

28
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.540
build that out.

29
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.310
New File could either
do one of two things.

30
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.400
It could open another window or

31
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.430
it could just reset everything in here as
it was if we open up a brand new window.

32
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.880
There's a little bit of places to
kind of play around and extend this.

33
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.180
But I think we've gotten most of
the functionality in place for

34
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.000
a full desktop application that can
read and write to the file system,

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.370
create an application menu,
open things in their native applications,

36
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.679
show things in the finder,
so on and so forth.

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.170
So now, we're gonna kind of talk a little
bit about some other things that we might

38
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.680
want to do in Electron and
build our second applications.
