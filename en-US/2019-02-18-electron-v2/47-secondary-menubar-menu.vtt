00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's create
a very simple menu, and

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.100
we'll do it all kind of
in this ready event.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.292
So const secondaryMenu, cuz this is not
an application menu, cuz we don't really

4
00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:15.944
have an application menu anymore, is Menu,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep,

5
00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:17.887
cool, Menu.buildfromtemplate.

6
00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.515
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we'll just give this one label.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.632
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll call it Quit,
and we'll say click, and

8
00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.994
the main thing I want to show you
is if you need the actual app

9
00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:41.212
instance you can do menubar.app.quit(),
right?

10
00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:45.870
You can actually get the one browser
window instance the same way.

11
00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:54.904
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll use
the accelerator of CommandOrControl+Q.

12
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.990
And then we'll go ahead and
take the menu bar and

13
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.764
say, tray and we'll do it.

14
00:01:07.764 --> 00:01:12.185
So the menu bar, remember,
we saw menubar.app, and we'll go quit,

15
00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:16.210
menubar.tray is the tray instance that is
also creating that little cat up there.

16
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.149
We'll say on right-click.

17
00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:29.696
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Then we'll say
menubar.tray.popUpContextMenu

18
00:01:29.696 --> 00:01:32.110
with that secondary menu.

19
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.750
So we can access that tray module directly
the same way we can access the app.

20
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.850
Menu bars simply are an abstraction
over all those things,

21
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.702
it just gets those very native electron
things and wires them all for you.

22
00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:55.534
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There it is.

23
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.538
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The template for Menu,
that's because it's gotta be an array.

24
00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:17.928
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let it start up.

25
00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:22.614
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is a menu that
you can also right click on it and

26
00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:24.408
get this quick menu now too, right?

27
00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:26.740
So you can build applications
that live outside.

28
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.670
So one of things I want you to think about
when it comes down to this is now where

29
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.980
can you put user interfaces in places that
you couldn't put user interfaces before?

30
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.600
When we're a web developer, we have to
effectively put all of the controls for

31
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.060
application directly
into the user interface.

32
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.320
We saw with the application
menus in Firecell,

33
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.760
we don't necessarily have to do that,
right?

34
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.610
We can put stuff in menus,
we can assign stuff to hotkeys, right,

35
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.280
we don't need to shove
every button in the UI.

36
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.987
We don't need a dedicated window for
things,

37
00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:53.237
we can have applications that
kind of run in the background.

38
00:02:53.237 --> 00:02:57.190
And are listening maybe if they're just
a menubar they're the UI that we kind of

39
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.730
even see all the time, right?

40
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.950
And can do stuff, and
can write to databases under the hood and

41
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.750
stuff along those lines.

42
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.480
Listen to the clipboard,
so on and so forth, right?

43
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.930
There's a lot of different opportunities

44
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.840
to create applications that we don't
normally think about when we're just

45
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.420
thinking about that
viewport in the browser.
