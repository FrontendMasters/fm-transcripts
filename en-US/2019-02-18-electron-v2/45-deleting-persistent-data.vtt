00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: One thing though that
I have slight problem with is that

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.390
there's no way to ever clear out
this database right now, right?

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.930
And yeah sure, they write limits and
all sorts of stuff like that.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.150
Absolutely, and I'll leave that all
up as an exercise to the reader.

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.070
But at the very least it'd be cool
to be able to either update or

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.920
remove a clipping.

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.580
Let's go ahead and
we'll add a remove button.

8
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:35.688
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool so
in the clipping, add another button,

9
00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:43.696
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just make sure I can

10
00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:44.880
remember my own CSS.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.450
So now I can hover it and
I see this fancy remove button.

12
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.690
And we'll go ahead and
say this time we're gonna

13
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.060
start passing in the ID as well so
we can do stuff in the clipping itself.

14
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.819
So we'll say ID, clipping.id.

15
00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.882
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
and we'll go ahead and

16
00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:23.121
we can actually even put it up here.

17
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.528
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll actually give it a,

18
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:47.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: onRemove we'll say

19
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.811
database.where id is that

20
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:56.147
current id, delete it.

21
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.758
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I could break
that out into its own thing,

22
00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:08.150
but let's make sure it works first.

23
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:16.410
So we'll say say, onRemove,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: When I click that button,

24
00:02:25.524 --> 00:02:33.338
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll say on remove id.

25
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.475
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Clippings.

26
00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's
give ourselves one here.

27
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.869
We'll say const remove.

28
00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:12.114
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Make sure it's getting
called, and then we'll go ahead and

29
00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:12.710
say yeah.

30
00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:28.317
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think you removed it,

31
00:03:28.317 --> 00:03:34.529
you just didn't refresh the-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

32
00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:42.071
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That should
have done the, it's the,

33
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:47.378
with the arrow function,
it's probably bound wrong.

34
00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.398
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go ahead,
let me grab this and say.

35
00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:38.095
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Because I can't spell.

36
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.280
There we go, missing the i in clippings.

37
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.573
So, if you miss it on the object
that is undefined and

38
00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:46.623
React doesn't call
undefined as a function.

39
00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.137
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So spelling is
important is what we all learned

40
00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:54.360
together as a group.
