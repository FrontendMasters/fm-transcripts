&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So here is your job,
here's our first exercise.

2
00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:06.688
We've seen the code, I'll put it
back on the screen in a second, but

3
00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:09.096
we can use the remote module
to touch the main process.

4
00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:16.371
We're exporting the getFileFromUser
from the main process.

5
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:19.822
So instead of alerting,
when the user clicks that button,

6
00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:23.920
what we really wanna do now is we
wanna call mainprocess.remote.

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.353
I'm sorry,
mainprocess.getFileFromUser, and

8
00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.880
that will trigger the file dialog
when someone opens that button.

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.010
We don't know how to send the file
content from the main process to

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.520
the renderer process yet, but

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.660
our main goal right now is to go ahead,
and at least trigger that file dialog.

12
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.790
So when they hit the Open File button,
they can go ahead, and they can see

13
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.220
the dialog, select the file, they'll
still get logged to the council now.

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.941
But our next mission after
that will be to go ahead and

15
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.380
figure out how to actually
read it in the application.

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.620
I will go ahead and create a branch called
Live Coding and push it up very shortly.
