00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We have just a little
bit more to ingratiate ourself

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.550
with our current operating system here.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.590
And again, this really goes to show just

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.540
basically how deep Electron can
get its tendrils into the OS.

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.180
Which is show file, which'll show
that file in the file system, and

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.470
then also open in default application.

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.280
Which'll ask the operating system,

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.450
hey, markdown files,
those are used to open these, right?

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.700
And then trigger the operating
system to open that application and

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.180
open the file in that application.

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.392
And so we do need one more module for
this one.

12
00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:46.313
And that is the shell module, which is
not necessarily for a terminal shell, or

13
00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.644
anything like that.

14
00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:50.527
It's basically for these kind of,

15
00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:56.040
I would call them miscellaneous
operating system things, right?

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.320
It's kinda like the junk drawer,
that's mean to whoever made this decision,

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.090
so let's go with it.

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.590
It's kinda like the junk drawer of other
different ways of interacting with

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.520
the operating system that don't
necessarily necessitate their own module.

20
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.660
Like the dialog, or like the stuff
we were doing with the window, and

21
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.060
stuff along those lines.

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.760
It's got a bunch of kind of
like little methods like hey,

23
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.010
right now we do have a little
bit of a problem here.

24
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:36.147
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's probably not what
my application should do, right [LAUGH]?

25
00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:41.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cuz it's like,
I'm a web browser, this all works, right?

26
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.512
And so we clicked a link,
it opened it in that browser window,

27
00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:49.210
which is not what I would expect
from my application, right?

28
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.620
We would probably expect it to open it
up in the main browser, not do this.

29
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.739
Cuz now I have to,
[LAUGH] I don't even have a back button,

30
00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.060
this is the worst browser ever.

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
And now I'm stuck looking at a pic,
my, it's like Inception.

32
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.692
Let's close this,
I'm done with this [LAUGH].

33
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.990
So shell allows us to basically intercept
those things, be like hey, that link,

34
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.240
I know you clicked a link, very cool.

35
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.290
Maybe a browser?

36
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.670
Maybe open that link up in Chrome?

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.350
We're going to do it for files on
the file system, showing it in Finder, or

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.380
Windows Explorer, or
whatever Ubuntu uses [LAUGH].

39
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nautilus.

40
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.635
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Nautilus,
right, I knew that at one point.

41
00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:37.744
And we'll open it up there, and
we'll open up in the default application.

42
00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:42.284
The shell is one of those modules that's
available in both the renderer as well as

43
00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:43.366
the main process.

44
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:46.180
So it's one of those few
that's available both places.

45
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.270
For us right now,

46
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.300
we mostly care about using it in
the renderer process at this point.

47
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.713
All right, so first of all, those
buttons right now are always disabled.

48
00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:03.325
So, we do need to enable them
if there is a current file.

49
00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:07.084
So unless it is a brand new
window with an unsaved file,

50
00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:11.340
then we want to go ahead and
turn those buttons on.

51
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.949
So if we're got a file path, we can
basically say, showFileButton.disabled.

52
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Very similar to
what we did for the isEdited, right?

53
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.132
And the openInDefault button, cool.

54
00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:34.855
So we get both of those in place,
those will now turn on if I go ahead and

55
00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:35.923
start this up.

56
00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:40.587
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: They're disabled,
I can open a file.

57
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now they're enabled.

58
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.510
They don't do anything yet, cuz I didn't
put any event listeners on them, but

59
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.670
they are, in fact, enabled.

60
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.770
So step two, as you can probably guess,
would be to go ahead and

61
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.440
actually have them do a thing.

62
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.580
So, we can actually put
that in place as well,

63
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.050
let's put it next to the other buttons.

64
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.731
So we could say,
showFileButton-addEventListener('click').

65
00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:19.794
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll say hey,
we'll just check one more time,

66
00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.108
if there really is a file path, right?

67
00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:26.200
Cuz it's disabled if there's not,
but let's, users are wiley.

68
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.996
So if there's no file path at all,
we'll just show an alert.

69
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And if so, we can pull in
the shell module, so we'll add that here.

70
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.665
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Scrolled down too far.

71
00:04:55.447 --> 00:04:58.161
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say shell.

72
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:06.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: OpenItem.

73
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.980
Here are some of the other
ones you can do.

74
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.273
MoveItemToTrash, openItem,
openExternal, readShortcutLink,

75
00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:17.540
writeShortcutLink, so it's mostly for
Windows and stuff along those lines.

76
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.350
Can do a bunch of interesting
ones in this case.

77
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.810
These are the ones we kind
of care about the most.

78
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.730
Let's go with showItemInFolder.

79
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.370
Give you a hint.

80
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.890
The next exercise we're gonna do?

81
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.124
I might have spoiled it [LAUGH],
so I don't know.

82
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:40.221
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so we'll
go ahead and save that, we'll refresh,

83
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:44.744
open a file up
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

84
00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:48.470
now we can see it, it triggers Finder,
or Windows Explorer, or

85
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.377
Nautilus as I just learned,
it'll open the right
