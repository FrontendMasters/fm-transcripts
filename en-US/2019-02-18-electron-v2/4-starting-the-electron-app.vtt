00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, so we're gonna
build this markdown text editor.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.210
Markdown it's called Fire Sale
cuz like price markdowns,

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.293
it was a stretch but work with me here.

4
00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:13.863
So there's a repo that is
should be in the notes, and

5
00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:18.490
it is Fire Sale FEM v2 cuz this
is the second version of it.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.821
And, what's gonna happen,
let's actually take it for spin.

7
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.943
What's gonna happen is we have some
markdown that we right over on

8
00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:26.850
the left side, and

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.340
then we see it rendered on the right
side will be able to save file system.

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.380
We go to export .HTML BIBA open up
text files and markdown files on our

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.770
computer and edit them, we're gonna
save over them, so on and so forth.

12
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.180
And like you can see from those two
currently disabled buttons that will be

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.080
able to show it in the file system, and
open it in the default application.

14
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.200
Not bad for
our first Electron application.

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.820
Cool, so let's get into it.

16
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.480
So, here I am in my terminal, which again,

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.700
as I mentioned before is
an Electron application.

18
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.467
And, I can go ahead and let's take
a little tour of the code using,

19
00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:08.910
this is cute right,
another Electron application, right?

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.960
We're all having fun
with this running gag?

21
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.408
All right so, let's take it for a spin.

22
00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.195
I have the dependencies installed,
but if you don't,

23
00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:19.519
this is a really great
time to run npm install.

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.554
And hopefully,
by the time I'm done with tour, it's done.

25
00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:31.880
So, a lot of the package JSON
is what we'd normally expect.

26
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.645
Again, we have this brand new app
/main.js and you if you look at my

27
00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:41.929
directory structure, there's just
a JavaScript file called main.js.

28
00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.735
We've got some devDependencies,

29
00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:46.390
some of which we will be
using later in the workshop.

30
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.745
Start is just running electron dot.

31
00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:56.918
I don't have Electron globally installed.

32
00:01:56.918 --> 00:02:00.352
If you run like npm start it says
this electron here will be from

33
00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:02.110
your node modules directory.

34
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.177
So once you do an npm install,
you'll have a project specific

35
00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:11.963
version of electron and
that version right now is 3.0.

36
00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:15.354
Quick note on version numbers,
which is basically, for

37
00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:20.554
the longest time electron was sub 1.0,
right, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15.

38
00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:25.776
All right, when the API stabilized,
it hit 1.0.

39
00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:29.493
Right, and this is incredibly
important if you're writing a book and

40
00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:33.399
you're keeping track of version
numbers is hit 2.0 and then like three

41
00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.880
months later it hit 3.0 because they
went to a new version in scheme.

42
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.460
And those basically
tracking versions of V8 and

43
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.960
node which kind of has those move up,
the version number goes up.

44
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.210
So, it's not necessarily always breaking
API changes, it is also just versions

45
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.590
of V8 as the increments you kind of know
what you're working with in that case.

46
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.540
So, if you are watching this course later,
you're like it's 4.0 now.

47
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.355
This is likely still,
most of the content of this course will,

48
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:09.305
knock on wood, be very valid and useful.

49
00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:12.435
There will be minor API changes,
some of them just caused mostly by

50
00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:14.895
internal changes and
stuff along those lines.

51
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:19.875
But the API, in my experience,
has been incredibly stable.

52
00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.358
Again, with the little parts of like,
API behaves very differently cuz of

53
00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:26.890
the curious concerns in Chrome,
and stuff along those lines.

54
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.230
So, just wanted to point that out.

55
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.300
So to start, we'll do electron dot so
on and so forth.

56
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.310
My main.js fault right
now is pretty simple.

57
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.255
It's a console log with this as
an Electron application, sound good?

58
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.340
Let's take it for a spin.

59
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And,
few things to notice here.

60
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.715
One, my console.log works.

61
00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.090
So that's the first really great and

62
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.080
wonderful part of this is that
it didn't crash and burn.

63
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.970
Two, is that you'll see that
it's still hanging there,

64
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.670
right, you can you see that little but
it didn't put me back to the command line.

65
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.065
And, for you, you should likely see
either in your task bar in Windows or

66
00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:16.952
in your Doc, a little Electron icon and

67
00:04:16.952 --> 00:04:20.561
if you command tab you
should also see it as well.

68
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.372
I have my doc on the other side,
let me actually switch over.

69
00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:30.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can see I've
got the Electron icon right here.

70
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.890
Now, you might be like, I don't see
an application, which makes total sense.

71
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.570
We talked about the main.js
as kind of like your server.

72
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.520
We haven't actually spun
up a user interface yet.

73
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.989
So, let's go ahead and

74
00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:48.845
do that because this is the world most
boring Electron application right now.

75
00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:52.360
And it's not doing anything that I could
have done with a very simple node process.

76
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.176
This is also considering
it's just a console log,

77
00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:59.838
the world most boring node application as
well, so we should fix it on either level.

78
00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:03.924
So go ahead, and if we hit Ctrl+C,
we're back on the command line.
