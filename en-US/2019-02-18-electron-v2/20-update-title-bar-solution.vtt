00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:03.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
our mission was to update the title bar

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.290
based on whether or not the application
was in an edited state.

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.220
And then we're gonna take that
one step further by enabling or

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.240
disabling the buttons based
on the editing state.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.710
And then we'll kind of do a bonus run for
some MAC OS specific integration.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390
We have it in this update user interface,

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.990
we just need to basically do something
similar to what we have above.

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.300
So we could say, if isEdited,

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.789
we can further modify that title, and

10
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.246
we'll say, again, I left it up to you
on exactly how you wanted to do that.

11
00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:45.540
If you want to put an asterisk,
if you want to put edited, colon,

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.310
whatever, I'm gonna go with edited.

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.420
If yours is slightly different,
that is very okay.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.250
We'll go ahead and refresh this, and
I can see that as soon as I start typing,

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.860
I have that edited.

16
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.803
If I delete it all the way
back to its original state,

17
00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:05.290
and those strings match again,
it's no longer edited.

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.566
Let's go ahead and open a file.

19
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:12.894
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Edited,

20
00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:17.400
not edited, it's oddly gratifying
to change the window title.

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690
I understand that I'm doing that multiple
times but it makes me feel good and

22
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.470
sometimes this is about me, all right.

23
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.210
So let's do a few other things,
we wanted to enable those buttons so

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.290
we have the saveMarkdownButton.

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.208
And we have to do a little bit of reverse
logic here, cuz the property is disabled.

26
00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:41.196
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll do the same for

27
00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:47.248
the,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: SaveHtmlButton.

28
00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:48.966
Go ahead and refresh that.

29
00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:55.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
save file and save html.

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.880
Actually save html should
always be enabled.

31
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.973
We actually want a revert button.

32
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.130
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so

33
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.270
now our user interface responds based
on whether or not we edited the state.

34
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.733
We can see the file name in there as well.

35
00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:22.752
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
all right, next view,

36
00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:26.913
little tricks that we're
gonna do are Mac OS specific.

37
00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:30.205
Now even if you're on a Windows
computer or Linux computer,

38
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:34.335
there is a nonzero chance that the person
running the application could be on

39
00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:38.490
Mac OS but you won't be able to see
anything on your system currently.

40
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.240
That's okay, cuz later when
we get to application menus,

41
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.740
the roles will be reversed.

42
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.600
And the Mac users will have to do
extra work to have a very simple,

43
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.630
easy functionality.

44
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.850
So it's all even.

45
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.600
It's all a game of give or take here.

46
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.080
But right now, we're gonna do one or

47
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.790
two things just to make it feel a little
bit more like a native application.

48
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.270
If I open up a true Mac app,
this is TextMate.

49
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.760
This is a text editor, and I save a file,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, show untitled.

50
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.540
Save it to the desktop.

51
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.420
You can see a few things going on here.

52
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.990
One is I have this little file icon here,
and

53
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.906
if I actually hit Cmd+Click,
this will work in any native Mac app.

54
00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:24.390
You can kind see the entire file tree and
open that up in finder.

55
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.270
And you can also see that if it's unsaved,

56
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.140
I got a little dot here
in the Close button.

57
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.280
This signify I have unsaved changes.

58
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.000
That is built in to native MacOS.

59
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.460
It would be cool if our
application had the same thing.

60
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.610
So we can do that pretty easily,
cuz Electron has access to those APIs

61
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.040
in the same way that it had access to
open up a file dialogue on Windows or

62
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.280
Mac OS or Linux or
anything along those lines.

63
00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.470
So what we can do is that little file icon
here, it's called the represented file.

64
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.378
And so what we can basically say is,

65
00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:15.372
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney:
currentWindow.setRepresentedFilename(file-

66
00:04:15.372 --> 00:04:20.908
Path), and we can do currentWindow.

67
00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:26.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: SetDocumentEdited
to isEdited, right?

68
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.320
And these will just further modify that
title bar to make it basically fit in

69
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.580
a little bit more with
the Mac OS operating system.

70
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.780
So now we'll go ahead.

71
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.434
Let's open a file.

72
00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:44.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can see,
I've got the little icon up here.

73
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.560
And I can click it and I can see where it
was in the file system just like if it was

74
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.960
an application built on Cocoa.

75
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.580
And if I change it, you can see that I've
got the little dark dot here as well.

76
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.200
So basically it fits in, right.

77
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.300
Now we could listen for a Window close
event and alert them about unsafe changes.

78
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.070
It's very much the same that we
would do it in the client as well.

79
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.780
That'll work, right.

80
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.160
You can have an event listener for that.

81
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.980
We're not gonna do that right now,
cuz we're going to do some more Electron

82
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.940
specific stuff but I'll leave
that as an exercise to the reader
