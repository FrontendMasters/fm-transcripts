00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's another really
great tool called Electron Forge.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.230
Electron Forge, if you ever use something
like Create React app, which is like,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.250
you don't need Create React app
to make a React application.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.330
But, if you don't want to wire everything
up by hand, and you just want sensible

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.920
defaults for a lot of stuff we're doing,
Electron Forge will do that for you.

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.660
So with Electron Forge, you just
install it as a global dependency, or

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.084
use MPX, and you basically say end
it in the name of a new project and

8
00:00:27.084 --> 00:00:30.412
it will wire up the basics
of your project for you.

9
00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:34.684
The application we're gonna use next is
made by Electron Forge, but I jammed my

10
00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:39.082
own CSS in there again as well and changed
the file structure a little bit, so it's

11
00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:43.630
the same the previous one because Electron
does not have a pre-described one.

12
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.320
If you look at the screenshot you see over
in the upper right hand corner there's

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.150
templates.

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.291
You'll get a pretty plain old
Electron application if you just do

15
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:53.740
Electron Forge init.

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.900
But you can also give it a template
of Typescript or React, and

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.382
there's a whole bunch in there you
can kinda look through and see.

18
00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:05.712
And you can pick one of those
templates as a good starter too,

19
00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:09.367
if there's a given tool or
framework that you know you like to use,

20
00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.290
it will set all of that out for you.

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.140
I just went with a very plain one to
keep things simple in this case, but

22
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.650
that's definitely an option
you might wanna look into.

23
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.010
And there's gonna be other things that
we do later in this workshop that

24
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.590
are basically taken care for you out
of the box by Electron Forge as well,

25
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100
such as packaging and
stuff along those lines.

26
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.880
Cool, so like I said,
it's like React app but for Electron.

27
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.592
It comes with some of the most popular
userland tools built in, the third party,

28
00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:38.900
kind of open source libraries
a lot of people use.

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.719
So there will be one or two things that we
talk about today that we'll just get for

30
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.142
free with Electron Forge as well,
and it includes, for our purposes,

31
00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:47.130
Electron Compile.

32
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.080
So again, you can install it globally,
you can init a new-application, and

33
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.230
you will get the basics there.

34
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.300
So we are gonna use something
very similar to that for

35
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.750
Clip Master, the next application
that we're gonna build.
