&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Your mission is to
do the Show in Default Application,

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.750
which is as we saw briefly,
the open item one.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.240
Theoretically, if you wanted as a bonus,

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.390
there is apparently the ability
to move a file to trash.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.825
That could be fun as well.

6
00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:21.832
And so, just to see, let's just
look one more time at the shell and

7
00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:22.820
what it has to offer.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.640
I don't know what shell.beep does.

9
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.450
I'll leave that as an exercise for
the reader.

10
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:39.392
Open external is the one that we would
use to open it in the actual browser.

11
00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:41.947
And so remember when I made
that link we clicked on it and

12
00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.140
we had inception of the live stream.

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.070
In this case, you could actually
open it up in Chrome instead.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.400
So your mission is to implement

15
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.780
the ability to show it in
the default application.

16
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.427
And then we'll come right back and
we'll take a look at that one together.
