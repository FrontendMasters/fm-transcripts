&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's time for
your mission.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.030
Your mission is,
it would be cool in the window title

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.620
to display whether or
not the document has been edited.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.800
So if isEdited is true,
we wanna add maybe edited, or

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.170
some applications just put a star
next to it, whatever you want.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.766
Write something in the title
bar that signifies to

7
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:28.453
the user that the document
has in fact been edited.

8
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:32.591
As a bonus, if you'd like,
the Save File, Revert button,

9
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:38.049
we can probably enable them, right,
in the case that the file has been edited.

10
00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.856
Cuz like cool, we've edited the file,

11
00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:42.152
you're probably gonna wanna save it now,
right?

12
00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:45.847
So we could enable those buttons for
when we wire them up, but

13
00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:48.391
your main mission first is for set title.

14
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.614
We wanna show something in that
title that shows whether or

15
00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.270
not the file has been edited.
