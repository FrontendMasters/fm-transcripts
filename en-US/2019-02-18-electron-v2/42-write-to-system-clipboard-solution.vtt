00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so our mission
was to do something very similar to what

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
we did for creating a new clipping, but
this time taking the most recent clipping,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.020
and writing it back to the clipboard.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.030
So we put down the underlying
foundations for doing that.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.780
We basically just needed to send.

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.840
We needed to register a global shortcut,
and

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.660
then when that global
shortcut was activated,

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.110
then we needed to trigger the message
from the main process to the render.

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.250
And have the render go ahead and
do the rest of the work for us.

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.110
So let's go ahead and
see if we can implement that.

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.812
So in the main process,
very similar to what we have right now,

12
00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:42.944
we can even go ahead and grab that.

13
00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:49.954
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This case, we'll call

14
00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:55.184
writeToClipboardShortcut and

15
00:00:55.184 --> 00:01:01.822
in this case-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Send

16
00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:04.860
a message to write to the clipboard.

17
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.331
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we'll say write-to-clipboard,

18
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:17.341
it's very similar to what we had earlier.

19
00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:24.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Paste that as well.

20
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.350
That's a change to the main process,
so we will have to restart it, but

21
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.530
before we do that,
let's implement the render process.

22
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.745
The only thing we need to do is not
rush the same keyboard shortcut twice,

23
00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.670
I'm not even gonna try to say that word.

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.090
All right, so we've got these very
intuitive keyboard commands in place.

25
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.888
Back in our renderer,
we need to basically say-

26
00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:57.867
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: handleWriteToClipboard.

27
00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:04.092
When we get that-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: write-to-clipboard

28
00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:05.552
message in place.

29
00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:12.732
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Do npm start.

30
00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:21.156
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Very cool, so

31
00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:26.740
I'm going to copy literally anything
else to my clipboard, that seems good.

32
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.187
Then we'll go over here to do
a Cmd+Shift+2, paste that.

33
00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I say I get
at index zero, all right?

34
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.550
So let's take a look at that.

35
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:53.445
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
the write to clipboard function.

36
00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:05.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Looks like it's having
a hard time getting that off the state.

37
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.935
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's an object
when you writeToClipboard.

38
00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:15.860
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

39
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.655
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Good catch, I don't even
need to debug when I have friends with me.

40
00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:25.390
[LAUGH] This is why you
write some code hastily and

41
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.890
then have other people do the exercise.

42
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.585
And then when you all come back together,
they've solved your bugs for you.

43
00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.252
Yeah.

44
00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.900
[LAUGH] That's why you
live code with friends.

45
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.332
Cool, so
we should be able to restart that.

46
00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:46.460
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There we go, I can
copy something else, copy all of that.

47
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.000
I'll hit Cmd + Shift + @, and we'll get
the most recent thing on the clipboard.

48
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.520
All right, cool, so

49
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.770
now we have the ability to have
global keyboard shortcuts anywhere.

50
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.240
I can reach my application,
I can write to my application.
