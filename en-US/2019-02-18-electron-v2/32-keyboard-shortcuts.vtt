00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.935
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's say, what do we
normally, depending on your operating

2
00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:09.279
system, open file is usually
either Command O or Control O.

3
00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.185
Right now it's nothing.

4
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.778
Now we got some for free before, but

5
00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:17.800
what happens if we want to actually
define a shortcut for a menu item?

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.410
Turns out we can do that as well,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.216
give it an accelerator.

8
00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:31.573
In this case, we can do,

9
00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:35.411
it's just basically a string that
says what you want the hotkey to be.

10
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:41.363
Now, well, on MacOS,
I want Command O on our Windows and

11
00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:44.310
Linus, I want Control O.

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.637
So what I'll do is I'll make a turnery.

13
00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:55.810
Let me just do Command or Control O,
right, and I'll take care of that for you.

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.522
The comma here.

15
00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now you can see it
has the accelerator attached to it.

16
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.530
So I can actually start hitting Command O,
Open File,

17
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.300
Open File, Open File, Open File,
Open File, Open File, right?

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.140
Be better if I did something with it.

19
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.670
So let's go ahead and

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.066
just change change this to,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The same

21
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.467
thing that we did when we actually
hit the Open File button.

22
00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:36.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, Command O.

23
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.637
I get the native file dialog, and
go ahead, I can open that file, right?

24
00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:48.582
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: In the way that
we structure a application,

25
00:01:48.582 --> 00:01:54.540
opening a file is pretty much totally
owned by the main process, right?

26
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.560
We go ahead.

27
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.095
We open a file.

28
00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.212
It sends it off.

29
00:01:57.212 --> 00:01:59.170
Saving a file.

30
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.935
It's a little trickier because where do
we store the file name and the content?

31
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:07.655
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The renderer.

32
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:10.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The renderer, right?

33
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.910
So we are going to need to figure out
how to tell the renderer process.

34
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.320
Hey, you, we need you to go ahead and

35
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.706
send us the information we need to
go ahead and save the file, right.

36
00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:28.787
So, this is going to be a little bit
trickier, not necessarily because saving

37
00:02:28.787 --> 00:02:32.168
is trickier than opening, just generally
in the way that we structure application.

38
00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.920
You're like well,
dummy why don't we go ahead and

39
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.783
just store it in the main process?

40
00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:40.566
That would work except if we
had multiple windows open.

41
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:41.186
It's a little tricky.

42
00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:44.941
It's better to talk to one window because
there is a method on browser window called

43
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:48.162
get focused window where you can get
the most recently opened window and

44
00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:50.700
stuff along those lines which
is the front most window.

45
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.910
You can communicate by like
letting the communication back and

46
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.285
forth and this is kind of like why we set
up that pattern a little bit earlier.

47
00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:58.877
Cuz we knew we'd have to
like figure out how to talk.

48
00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:05.340
It's we're going to tell the main window
hey, the user wants to save the file.

49
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.440
Can you send me back the file name,
and the content so I can go ahead and

50
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.735
do that for the user?

51
00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:16.741
That's only gonna involve a tiny
refactoring on the renderer process,

52
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.591
which is if we go to
this saveMarkdown button.

53
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:24.480
This is an anonymous function
that's part of the event listener.

54
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.100
Which means I can't really
call it separately.

55
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.491
Well, that's easily solved.

56
00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:33.479
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: A little
bit of this action, cut.

57
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.620
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Paste.

58
00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:47.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will say saveMarkdown
whenever they click that button.

59
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.371
And then also, we can set up a listener,

60
00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:55.439
which is like ipcRenderer

61
00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.715
dot,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If

62
00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:04.128
you get something on
the save-markdown channel,

63
00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:09.810
what I would really like you to do is
also call that saveMarkdown function.

64
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.470
So now we'll take the same function,

65
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.030
if I hit the button in the UI,
we will save the markdown.

66
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.955
And if we receive a message from
any other process saying, hey,

67
00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:24.153
we need you to save the markdown,
it will go ahead and

68
00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:27.154
communicate back to the main
process to do that.

69
00:04:27.154 --> 00:04:30.167
So now we can go ahead in here.

70
00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:35.735
We'll make,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You'll

71
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:37.242
want to call it Save File.

72
00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:54.546
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will send a message
over that channel to tell the main

73
00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:56.330
window hey.

74
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.850
Go ahead and save the markdown.

75
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.287
So we'll send a message to
the renderer process saying,

76
00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:02.826
hey I need you to save the markdown.

77
00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:05.559
Renderer process gets it,
like cool, I know about the file,

78
00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:06.728
I know about the content.

79
00:05:06.728 --> 00:05:09.680
I will send that back to you so
you can go ahead save it, right?

80
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.070
So we're basically again,

81
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.160
iterating on that communication
between the two processes.

82
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.735
Let's go ahead and verify that this works.

83
00:05:23.588 --> 00:05:24.289
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Awesome.

84
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:30.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we can save it with Command S.

85
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.388
I can change the content in here.

86
00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:37.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Can save it, you can
see it went back to a non-edited state.

87
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.130
We go ahead and we find our brand new one.

88
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.480
I've been very good with file names.

89
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.800
There it is.

90
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.380
Content is changed.

91
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.576
Right so now we have keyboard shortcuts
that are available within our application

92
00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:51.170
for opening and saving files.
