&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Lets talk about who's
using Electron to basically give ourselves

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.560
a sense of what are the kind of things
that you could build with Electron.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.880
And it is mostly through
happy accident that a lot

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.140
of the applications that we're gonna use
to build our Electron applications today,

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.020
or that I'm gonna use to build
these Electron applications today,

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.170
are in fact Electron applications.

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.610
Kind of one of the more
famous ones is Slack.

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.670
So Slack is an Electron application
that has a web view kind of

9
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.620
in this shell that allows it to run.

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.360
You can Cmd+Tab over to it.

11
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.469
It's in the dock, has its own menu,
so on and so forth.

12
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.847
Visual Studio Code is one of
the more famous examples.

13
00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:50.234
It's a full IDE for writing applications.

14
00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.880
It's gonna be the IDE that I use
to build Electron applications.

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.296
So again, building Electron applications
in an Electron application.

16
00:00:58.296 --> 00:00:59.010
It's crazy.

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.770
Hyperterm, or Hyper, is a terminal
emulator that I'll be using for

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.740
navigating around the command line,
also an Electron application, right?

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.800
So, these are not normally, when we think
about yeah, building web applications,

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.730
these feel a lot more like
full-fledged native applications.

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.710
They just happen to be built using HTML,
CSS,

22
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.430
and JavaScript, which is pretty awesome.

23
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.510
GitHub's official client is
also an Electron application.

24
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.340
Electron started from the kind of
underneath of the Atom text editor.

25
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.240
Get it?
Atom.

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.490
Electron.

27
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.320
It's cute.

28
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.080
And so obviously GitHub uses it for
other things, including this application,

29
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.580
which is a visual editor for
making get commits,

30
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.320
which is actually really great because
you can select different lines.

31
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.043
And, I don't want to do it on the command
line cuz I'm a front end engineer, and

32
00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.111
I like pretty things.

33
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.997
So a lot of the applications that
I'm gonna using for building this,

34
00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.560
again, are Electron applications,
which are super cool.
