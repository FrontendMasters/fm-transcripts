00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.352
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's
do this one together.

2
00:00:01.352 --> 00:00:04.022
So previously we had this alert in here,
and

3
00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:07.415
what we want is when the user
hits that open file button,

4
00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:12.469
instead of alerting them that they hit the
button that they just clicked, we want to

5
00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.982
figure out from the main process, hey, can
you trigger that getFileFromUser function?

6
00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.214
Right, can you trigger that file dialogue?

7
00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:23.566
Then eventually, after that we're gonna
have to figure out how to then read that

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.788
file from the file system and communicate
that back to the renderer process.

9
00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:29.854
Which, again,
the main process is not a server,

10
00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:34.088
the renderer processes are not clients,
but you are not mistaken for

11
00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:37.750
using the metaphor of almost
like a client server request.

12
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.290
So to talk to the main process,

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.508
we need that remote module that
we used in the dev tools earlier.

14
00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:47.700
So we can say, const { remote }.

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.688
We can pull that from
the electron library.

16
00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:54.796
Remote is not available in
the main process, right?

17
00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:58.104
There are different modules available in
the main process than for in the renderer.

18
00:00:58.104 --> 00:01:01.473
This is why we even need to talk to the
main process to get the dialogue, right?

19
00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:04.805
Cuz dialogues are only available
in the main process, but

20
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.806
remote gives us that kind
of communication bridge.

21
00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:12.830
And with that, we can get almost
anything from the, remote will give us

22
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.692
everything from the require('electron')
in the main process,

23
00:01:17.692 --> 00:01:22.326
but it won't actually allow us
to access the code from main.js.

24
00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:25.090
For that,
we also need to require that, but

25
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.395
we need to require it in
context of the main process.

26
00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:29.931
So for instance, this won't work.

27
00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:41.092
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,
cuz this will try to require it.

28
00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:45.166
Just a regular require will
read that file, parse it and

29
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.640
compile it in context of
the renderer process.

30
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.734
App and dialog are not available
in the renderer process.

31
00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.363
So it will blow up.

32
00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:58.725
Instead, what we say is, hey,
I need you to require this in

33
00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:03.544
the context of the main process
using the remote module, right?

34
00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:05.487
So we use remote.require.

35
00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:09.015
And so now,
we've got this mainProcess object,

36
00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:12.296
which is everything exported from main.js.

37
00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:14.861
We can call it in our renderer process,
but

38
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:17.937
all of that code executes
back in the main process.

39
00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.992
And we'll look at a few
diagrams in a second.

40
00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:22.557
But let's do it, and
then we'll talk about it.

41
00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.231
So we've got mainProcess, and

42
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:29.630
now if I scroll down the bottom,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say mainProcess.

43
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:35.995
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: getFileFromUser.

44
00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:37.203
All right, let's take it for a spin.

45
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:46.809
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hit Open File,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I got the dialogue.

46
00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:48.337
That is executing from the main process.

47
00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:51.585
Now I can select a file, and
you can see it still console logs.

48
00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:52.768
That's not great.

49
00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:55.764
Let's talk a little bit about
inter-process communication for

50
00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:57.460
a second before we solve this problem
