00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Another
really interesting one is,

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.343
actually let's go over to Electron docs.

3
00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:20.758
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is a built in role,
that we can use because you certainly

4
00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:28.800
do not want to implement your own version
of copy or paste or select all, right?

5
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800
These work in just general text areas,

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.170
in Chrome, there's no reason why
you should have to write your own.

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.550
So for some of these operating
system level features,

8
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.870
these roles, you basically say,
hey I wanna create this menu item.

9
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.740
And if it is one of these
kind of like built in things,

10
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.100
you can go ahead and use that role.

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.460
An electron we'll call the native
OS ability to do that thing.

12
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.120
So you can see there's a role for
quit, that's interesting.

13
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.470
There is an entire edit menu.

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.510
The entire window menu.

15
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.460
There's one for closing a window,
minimizing, all of these right here.

16
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.410
Paste and match style, which I think was
not in the default menu, select all, so

17
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.090
on and so forth.

18
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.200
So you can put these menu
items where ever you want.

19
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.970
You can give them their own hotkeys,
everything along those lines.

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.099
Let's actually try that with the quit, so
instead of this, we'll actually say role,

21
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.320
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Quit, quite, quit.

22
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.420
And here we'll actually say, role about.

23
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.880
And just for our Windows, let's say,

24
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.936
let's add one more,
we'll add it to the file menu.

25
00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:46.064
For now, say label, we'll go with Copy.

26
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.237
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The role copy, all right.

27
00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.059
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Then
now we can close this.

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.550
You could also put the quit
menu on file if you wanted to.

29
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.080
So, actually gave us dictation and
emotions and

30
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.390
symbols as well we had copy in there,
those are usually in the edit menu.

31
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.780
You can see that with the quit,
it actually give us the command q as well.

32
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.330
It just basically did everything you would
normally expect, it's just a shortcut of

33
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.980
what you would normally expect the
operating system to do, with a quit menu.

34
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.179
About, actually, in Mac OS,
we'll pull up this little about.

35
00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:30.017
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It can take some text.

36
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.302
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Manually select all,
go to copy, paste it in, and

37
00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:39.270
I have some text.

38
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.108
So you can start of like reimplement
some of the menus in this case.
