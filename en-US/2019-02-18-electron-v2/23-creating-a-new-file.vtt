00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:05.205
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now let's try it again,
where we make a brand new file, fresh.

2
00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.186
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I got an error, you can
see my save button wasn't showing up,

3
00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.797
which means I've got a small error here,
let's see.

4
00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:25.928
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: setRepresentedFilename,
it's not working out for me, I know why.

5
00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:32.574
setRepresentedFilename, when a brand
new file opened, was undefined.

6
00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:37.821
Which is not okay for that, so
what we'll do is we'll just give

7
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:43.959
ourselves a guard there, we'll say,
if filePath, then do it, right?

8
00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:47.667
Because if this is undefined,
that is not an acceptable value.

9
00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:52.625
The same way that fs.writeFileSync and
giving it null there wasn't okay,

10
00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.335
it's also not okay here.

11
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.964
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But
that's just a change to the render, so

12
00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:01.749
we should be able to just refresh,
and we'll hit Save File.

13
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.434
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
it looks like nothing happened, but

14
00:01:12.434 --> 00:01:17.200
if I go to my desktop,
there's that file on the desktop.

15
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.023
But again, I kind of showed the problem,
it looks like nothing happened, right?

16
00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:30.028
That's not great, what would be great is,
now we have a file, right?

17
00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:35.210
We can show it here,
we just don't have that code path.

18
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.411
So you have a few options here,

19
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.737
all of the saving the file
happened on the file system right?

20
00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:46.190
But, I mean, having the files that
happened in the main process, but,

21
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.818
we could communicate all that stuff back.

22
00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:51.809
I'm going to cheat,
what I'm going to do is,

23
00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:56.198
I've saved a file, I have my open file,
it does everything right.

24
00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.128
So as soon as I save the file,
you know what I'm going to do?

25
00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:02.001
Just open the file that saved,
and everything will just work,

26
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:02.931
famous last words.

27
00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:09.018
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what we'll do is,
we will save that, and

28
00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:12.498
we'll say openFile with our new file,

29
00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.931
which is why I kind of broke
it out like an hour ago.

30
00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:24.737
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say.

31
00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:35.315
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so

32
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.588
we can see that it's edited,
let's see what we've got here.

33
00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:42.663
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: setDocumentEdited.

34
00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.678
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Next problem
is in my renderer, before we had

35
00:02:56.678 --> 00:03:01.444
the issue with setRepresentedFilename.

36
00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:02.086
In this case,

37
00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:05.950
now it's blowing up on setDocumentEdited
because that's expecting true or false.

38
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.543
It's undefined because I passed
it in as a variable, but

39
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:14.960
when I call it down here,
we didn't pass anything in.

40
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.650
So, if we just open a new
file that's not edited.

41
00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:32.181
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Boom, I've got a file
name, I've got a represented file,

42
00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:35.761
we know whether or not it's been edited,
since the last save.

43
00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:41.048
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Back and forth, right?

44
00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:42.635
We can open files from the file system.

45
00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:46.638
We can update the UI,
both in our actual browser-based UI,

46
00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:48.296
as well as the native UI.

47
00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:52.920
Based on that file, we can write files
from the file system, so on and so forth.
