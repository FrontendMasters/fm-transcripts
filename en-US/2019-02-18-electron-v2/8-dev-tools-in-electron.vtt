00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can go ahead and
go to Window, or rather View and

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.460
do Toggle Developer Tools.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.723
And we'll se that I've
got some dev tools here.

4
00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:11.704
And I can do stuff like alert.

5
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.369
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I get an alert.

6
00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.718
Or I can do like Require
the file system module.

7
00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.786
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I can do like FS.

8
00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:36.328
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oops,
I'll give it a call back.

9
00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.217
Let's say console log.

10
00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:42.965
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, I can access
the current directory that I'm here,

11
00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:46.230
as you can see my node modules,
my read me, my license.

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.870
I can access the file system
directly from the browser.

13
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.338
So if you didn't believe me before that
all the node APIs are available as well as

14
00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:58.690
all the browser APIs, I have just proven
it to you, and we're ready to rock.
