00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.813
Let's get into some code and
let's see this in action.

2
00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:11.070
So I'm going to hop into the Angular
13 fundamentals repository.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.083
And the one thing that I just,
so you understand where I'm

4
00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:21.417
going with this,
I'm going to jump to the 00 start branch.

5
00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:24.316
And this has some things that have been,

6
00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:29.451
I've just streamlined some stuff,
so we're not starting from zero.

7
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:35.077
So I'll go git checkout 00-start,

8
00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:42.587
and now I should be able to
hop back into my code here.

9
00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:48.418
And let's just run this so everybody can
see what we're dealing with, so npm start.

10
00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:59.460
And this should spin up here in a second,

11
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.645
wait for it, there we go.

12
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:09.166
All right, so now what we have is
super basic, there's not a lot here.

13
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:13.073
More importantly, is if I go to Courses,

14
00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:19.786
you'll see that I have an empty course
list and an empty course detail.

15
00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:23.460
So if we go into the code and

16
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.472
drill down to Src &gt; App &gt; Courses,

17
00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:33.485
we have our CoursesComponent, and

18
00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:39.520
we also have our CoursesComponent class.

19
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.811
So, Let's start to

20
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:50.787
build this out and
make something functional.

21
00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:56.113
So the idea here is, I want to, first and

22
00:01:56.113 --> 00:02:02.240
foremost, I want to
render a list of courses.

23
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.800
And then I want the ability
to select a course, and

24
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.370
then based on the selected course,
I want to be able to display that.

25
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.984
So let me just write this down here.

26
00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:22.440
So step 1,
we are going to render courses in a list.

27
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.540
Step 2,
we're going to be able to select a course.

28
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.714
Step 3, we're going to be able to
render selected course, right.

29
00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:40.533
So this is the goal that I am
going to endeavor to complete.

30
00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:45.759
So what I'm going to do, because I
think we need more than one course.

31
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.830
I'm gonna go here.

32
00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:59.556
We'll go JavaScript The

33
00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:04.462
HARDEST PARTS EVER!

34
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.847
Learn, Like a pro with will, all right.

35
00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:21.753
So we now have a property with
two course objects in it,

36
00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:27.930
and we're going to render
the courses in a list.

37
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.407
So the first thing that I'm going to do,
and

38
00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:36.763
this is a favorite technique of mine, is,

39
00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:42.221
using the pre tag,
I can put a property and bind to it.

40
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.182
And then using this JSON pipe here,

41
00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:50.144
that if I go back to my application,

42
00:03:50.144 --> 00:03:55.560
what this has done is
it's taken the structure,

43
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.241
and it's just essentially
done JSON stringify and

44
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.970
it's just kind of put it out there.

45
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.991
So this is a really, really fast and
easy way for when you're programming,

46
00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:17.842
and it's just like I just want to see
where I'm at, how things are going.

47
00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:22.904
And so I will, especially on two monitors,
I will use this just to

48
00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:28.166
kinda do spot checks and
make sure that my assumptions are correct.

49
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:33.119
So, interesting enough,
we talked about the first set of

50
00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:37.971
bindings is string interpolation
using the pre tag which

51
00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:42.619
preserves formatting, and
then this JSON pipe here,

52
00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:48.911
that we're able to see the structure
in fairly high fidelity right here.

53
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:54.910
So that is just kind of a bit of
a pro tip that I use frequently.

54
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.169
Now what we can do is we can iterate
over this courses collection and

55
00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.160
display it as individual item.

56
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.160
So let's go with,
we'll do an unordered list,

57
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.110
and we want to create a list item for

58
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.870
every single course that exist.

59
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.222
So what I can do here is I can,

60
00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:35.907
using ngFor, I can say,

61
00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:40.592
let course of courses and

62
00:05:40.592 --> 00:05:46.838
then I can bind to this particular

63
00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:53.775
instance of whatever iteration is.

64
00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:58.242
Angular does a really good job
of keeping track of what item in

65
00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:00.619
the collection am I binding to.

66
00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.720
So in this case, let me just pick this up.

67
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.650
And let me just,
I'll pick up the whole thing, and

68
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.090
this is gonna be humorous,
I think, we'll see what happens.

69
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.021
Instead of courses,
we're going to do course.

70
00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:23.061
Let's go back to our code, and so

71
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:28.067
now all I've done is I've
moved this into a list item.

72
00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:32.329
And so what we have here,
just to summarize,

73
00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:38.956
is when you have a collection using ngFor,
you can iterate over that.

74
00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:43.120
And you can, then for every iteration,

75
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.408
it pulls an item out
of that collection and

76
00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:51.470
then it allows you to display it.

77
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:58.651
So what I can do now,
is we do something like course title and

78
00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:03.403
we'll go here, so back into our code.

79
00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:09.347
And so
now you can see it is in a list format.

80
00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:16.358
So what we're doing is we have
the ability to then drill down and

81
00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:21.010
bind to a specific property on this item.

82
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:28.525
Now, let's think about this,
if we were going to click on this and

83
00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:35.590
we're going to capture this,
what would that look like?

84
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.159
Well, we would use event binding.

85
00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.756
So here, click and
we're going to add a, or

86
00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:48.270
define a method here called SelectCourse.

87
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.526
And we're going to pass in the course,
and so

88
00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:57.680
Angular also is keeping track
of when I select course,

89
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.720
what course am I talking about.

90
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.986
And so now I do not believe that I
have a SelectCourse method in here,

91
00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:12.907
so we need to do a couple things.

92
00:08:12.907 --> 00:08:19.740
So the first thing is I'm
going to go selectedCourse,

93
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.904
and we'll just set this to null.

94
00:08:23.904 --> 00:08:29.500
And then what we can do, and
this is actually course, singular.

95
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:37.018
I'm going to create a selectCourse method

96
00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:44.199
that is going to take a course
property and it's going to,

97
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:54.002
Assign it to selectedCourse.

98
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.210
Now we'll save this, and

99
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.851
let's go back into our template,

100
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:10.182
rather into our template here.

101
00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:16.124
And I'm going to take,
I'm gonna do a pre tag and

102
00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:20.243
then let's go ahead and dump,

103
00:09:23.249 --> 00:09:28.419
The selectedCourse out, And

104
00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:32.379
we'll go using the JSON filter.

105
00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.720
Let's save this.

106
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.217
And so now you can see that
selectedCourse is null.

107
00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:45.144
But once I select this list item,

108
00:09:45.144 --> 00:09:51.739
you can see here that this
becomes the selected course,

109
00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:58.250
and I'm able to go kind of back and
forth across these.

110
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.392
Now, what I will do,
just to clean this up and

111
00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:08.714
because I don't remember what this
looks like off the top of my head,

112
00:10:08.714 --> 00:10:17.399
let's go to, I'm just jumping into, The,

113
00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:25.663
Source code here and
we are going to do a mat-list.

114
00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:30.830
So I'm just borrowing this from the master
branch, then we'll go back here.

115
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.984
And you'll notice here, I've already, for

116
00:10:37.984 --> 00:10:44.395
the most part, written this,
and so we can get rid of this.

117
00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:47.860
And I'm gonna just comment
this out real quick.

118
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.925
All right, so
just review what I've added, so

119
00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:56.039
I've just pulled this in
off of the main branch.

120
00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:59.797
Is instead of using an unordered list,
and actually,

121
00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:03.880
I need to put this up here,
I put this in the wrong section.

122
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.974
So, here we go.

123
00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:14.510
An unordered list here, let's go ahead and
we're going to use a material list.

124
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.981
So we have a mat-list, mat-list-item, and

125
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:23.840
let course of courses, and
selectCourse, of course, like a horse.

126
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:30.810
And now what we're doing is displaying
the title and the description.

127
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.910
And remember when I used
the JSON type here, well,

128
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.020
we have one that's called title case, and

129
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.890
what this will do is it'll
turn it into a title case.

130
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:53.387
So back to here,
I'm gonna just put my pre tag back,

131
00:11:53.387 --> 00:11:57.826
selectedCourse, won't do JSON.

132
00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:08.299
We'll save this and
let's see how this is looking.

133
00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:13.562
All right, so
now what we have is two items,

134
00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:16.988
but it is in a material list.

135
00:12:16.988 --> 00:12:21.756
So just a quick small
deviation off of this is,

136
00:12:21.756 --> 00:12:26.035
I don't make it a habit
to memorize SDKs or

137
00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:29.964
even really large amounts of syntax.

138
00:12:29.964 --> 00:12:35.523
But if you go to material.angular.io,
and you check on Components,

139
00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:39.137
they've done a really
good job of laying out,

140
00:12:39.137 --> 00:12:43.505
these are the components
that are available.

141
00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:47.674
And so for instance, you can see
the list here, which I'm using.

142
00:12:47.674 --> 00:12:51.156
And right inside of the document here,

143
00:12:51.156 --> 00:12:56.230
you can see kind of
the underpinnings of what I've done.

144
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.950
So if somebody said, hey,
I need you to write a list item, but

145
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.550
you're not allowed to use any pre-existing
code, this is what I would do.

146
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:09.020
Is I would go to material.angular.io,
and I would copy this.

147
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:14.930
So this is what I call document
driven development, DDD.

148
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.906
And another pro tip, since I'm here,

149
00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:27.330
that if you click on this out arrow,
that this will open up in StackBlitz.

150
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.584
And you can see the code
running here as well.

151
00:13:31.584 --> 00:13:39.700
So ironically, you'll see that
they also have some squiggly line.

152
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.501
So I think this might be just an Angular
13 thing that they're ironing out.

153
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:50.960
But if you have a question about a
particular component, how to implement it.

154
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.075
If you're like me,

155
00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:56.350
you're not going to memorize
an entire component development kit.

156
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.273
But what you're going to do is,

157
00:13:58.273 --> 00:14:02.563
I think it's important at least
understand where to find the answers.

158
00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:06.581
So if I wanna do a menu or
a progress bar or whatever,

159
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:11.815
they've done a really good job of
surfacing working code examples

160
00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:16.314
that you can just copy right
out of their documentation.

161
00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:23.377
So now, same exact thing,
click, click, and we can see it.

162
00:14:23.377 --> 00:14:28.052
So we will extend this just

163
00:14:28.052 --> 00:14:32.728
a little bit further and,

164
00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:37.992
I'm going to add in this or

165
00:14:37.992 --> 00:14:42.682
uncomment out this delete button, and

166
00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:48.380
let's talk about this and
what's happening.

167
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:57.439
And we will, Kind of step through this,

168
00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:02.180
and there's just kinda one piece
here that I want to call out is, so

169
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.920
what we've added is a delete
button in to the list item.

170
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.131
And so if we look at this just
the way that this is rendering,

171
00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:14.543
so let me add in this first.

172
00:15:14.543 --> 00:15:18.240
So it's looking for deleteCourse.

173
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.555
And so I'm gonna go back here
into my component class,

174
00:15:26.683 --> 00:15:31.783
And we're going to go deleteCourse.

175
00:15:31.783 --> 00:15:37.055
And we're going to take a course ID, and

176
00:15:37.055 --> 00:15:43.732
we're going to just log this out,
DELETE COURSE.

177
00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:52.053
All right, the course, course ID,
and so they should render.

178
00:15:52.053 --> 00:15:56.289
So that's one nice thing is that if it's
looking for something in the template, it

179
00:15:56.289 --> 00:16:01.650
doesn't exist, it's going to call you out,
because better now than in production.

180
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:06.608
And so here,
if I open up my console that, and

181
00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:09.355
this is probably small.

182
00:16:09.355 --> 00:16:11.949
Let me just make this big, bigger,

183
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:16.539
you'll notice here that DELETE COURSE 1,
DELETE COURSE 2.

184
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:24.577
Whereas if I select this, then you're
seeing the selected course over here.

185
00:16:24.577 --> 00:16:29.530
Now, I'm gonna save you a little
bit of heartache and frustration.

186
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.540
And you'll notice here
that on this click event,

187
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.880
I'm calling deleteCourse, but

188
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:43.620
I also have this
$event.stopImmediatePropagation.

189
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.888
And what this does is that
when I click on the button,

190
00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:51.186
it prevents that event from bubbling and

191
00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:55.170
also selecting the course
that I want to delete.

192
00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:00.567
So if I take that off and
I go back, you'll notice here that

193
00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:05.963
when I select this,
I hit the Select or the Delete button,

194
00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:10.275
but it also selected
the list item that was in.

195
00:17:10.275 --> 00:17:14.367
So essentially, because I clicked
a child component, it bubbled up and

196
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:17.710
it registered the click event
on the list item as well.

197
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:23.389
So this is undesirable behavior,
this is obviously not what you want.

198
00:17:23.389 --> 00:17:29.461
And so how you solve that is to keep
your events from bubbling in Angular.

199
00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:34.223
Is that within the click handler itself,
so click,

200
00:17:34.223 --> 00:17:38.771
you're calling the method
on the component, but

201
00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:42.160
then you're also doing $event.

202
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.543
So it's capturing the event that
was triggered, it was just saying,

203
00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:49.080
we're going to stop this immediately.

204
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.231
So stop immediate propagation.

205
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:56.244
And so we go here,
now we can click this and

206
00:17:56.244 --> 00:18:02.914
it's going to obviously show in
the console that we're doing this.

207
00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:09.822
But from here,
we're still able to select the course.
