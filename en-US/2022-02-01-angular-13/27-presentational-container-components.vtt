1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.750
We'll do a quick coding demo and answer
questions and we will then go from there.

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.271
So the question is how can we identify a
presentation component versus a container

3
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:13.420
component?

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.500
There's a few ways to do that.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.370
One, a presentation component and
I'm gonna build one in just a moment.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.050
It's going to be very
close to inside of it.

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.584
It's gonna be mainly just bindings and
so a presentation

8
00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:36.600
components should have zero or
very little logic inside of it.

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.478
It container component is going to be
a much kind of a larger component and

10
00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:49.457
it's going to consume data and
essentially direct commands or

11
00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:53.207
function calls out of that component.

12
00:00:53.207 --> 00:00:57.930
But then inside of it in
the container component is

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.310
just gonna hold other components.

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:09.505
So with that in mind let me build
let me build out few components and

15
00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:13.530
we can see what this looks like.

16
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.430
So, from the command line,
I'm going to generate a component.

17
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.710
And I'm going to call this courses-list.

18
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.400
Let me just double check that.

19
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.574
This is going to work and

20
00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:35.971
because I have an extra module in my route

21
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:41.224
I'm going to go -m app.module.ts.

22
00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:46.234
There we go, so,
we have a courses component but

23
00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:50.158
I'm also adding in a courses-list.

24
00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:57.484
And then from here I'm going
to add in a course, details

25
00:01:59.883 --> 00:02:03.919
All right so
now I've generated two components.

26
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:14.012
And we have courses-list, courses details.

27
00:02:14.012 --> 00:02:22.616
And if we look at
the courses component HTML.

28
00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:26.602
Currently, you'll notice that
it just has everything in here.

29
00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:29.308
Like there's no semblance like
it's just doing everything.

30
00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:31.319
It has the list and it has the details.

31
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.620
And what we want to do is we
want to start to break this up.

32
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.800
So within our courses component.

33
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.662
I am going to take this courses-list and

34
00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:53.030
I'm just going to go to
the list component here.

35
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.518
And within the HTML I am
going to paste this in.

36
00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:04.818
And what I am going to do just for
a moment just so

37
00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:09.190
we can see this is I'm going to.

38
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:17.100
Just create a quick placeholder for this.

39
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.643
I'm gonna save this and we're going to.

40
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:32.345
Save this,
hopefully let me just double-check.

41
00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:36.570
I believe that this should
be app courses-list.

42
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.555
And so if we go back into our
application here we can see that we have

43
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.600
the courses-list.

44
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.734
And let me do the same thing
with the details component.

45
00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:56.491
So I'm going to go here I'm just

46
00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:00.718
going to chop this out cut and

47
00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:04.713
here Just going to paste this in.

48
00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:09.509
And then we'll go back here and

49
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:15.970
we're going to app, course, details.

50
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.109
And I'm going to save this here.

51
00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.104
Now what's going to happen is
that this is obviously not going

52
00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:28.139
to work because we've moved
some stuff around and

53
00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.999
it doesn't know where
to find certain things.

54
00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:36.068
So, I'm going to comment out
the course details for just a moment.

55
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:39.149
And we're going to focus
on the courses-list.

56
00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:43.193
Now, I'm going to uncomment this,

57
00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.540
All right, what we have here is two kind

58
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.504
of things that are happening or
three things.

59
00:04:58.504 --> 00:05:01.641
So, we are rendering courses but

60
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:06.241
then we have a select course and
a delete course.

61
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:11.371
So let me go into the courses-list
component and I'm going to just

62
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:17.249
delete all this stuff because we don't
need a constructor or selectorial.

63
00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.470
So, I need to generate I
need to define an input.

64
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.477
And it's going to be courses.

65
00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:29.839
And this is just gonna
be an array of courses.

66
00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.690
And for now we're just going to
initialize this as an empty array.

67
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.182
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to

68
00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:45.909
do an output and we will do selected and

69
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.250
this is going to equal
a new event emitter.

70
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.921
Now, what you have to catch
here is notice that there

71
00:05:55.921 --> 00:06:00.350
are a few versions of event emitter here.

72
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.790
And if you import the wrong one,
it's not going to work.

73
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.114
And so I have ran into that
problem a few times, so

74
00:06:09.114 --> 00:06:12.609
we're gonna go selected and deleted.

75
00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:17.990
All right, so far so good.

76
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:25.756
Now what I can do is we can go
back to the courses-list and,

77
00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:33.214
We can do deleted omit.

78
00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:38.861
And selected by emit

79
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:44.176
in theory I thought

80
00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:49.159
I'm just going to

81
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:55.480
comment this as well.

82
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.061
I just would like this to render
why we're building so, all right,

83
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:02.632
not a lot happening, but
at least it's not broken.

84
00:07:02.632 --> 00:07:06.226
So now, notice I am passing in courses so

85
00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:10.998
I can render it, but
then I need to respond to events.

86
00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:17.440
One is when I select a course or
I want to delete a course.

87
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.745
Now if I go back to our
courses component HTML,

88
00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:30.210
what I can do is I can
define courses as in input,

89
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.915
and I'm going to pass in courses.

90
00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:40.394
Now, unfortunately, because I've
turned off angular language services,

91
00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:45.469
I'm not getting the prompts that I
would like, but I can live with that.

92
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:51.818
So if I go here selected,
it can be selectCourse.

93
00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:56.156
And I'm going to use this
event parameter here.

94
00:07:56.156 --> 00:08:00.825
And we'll also do deleted and

95
00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:06.940
then this will be delete course.

96
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.929
We'll just double check.
So, we go into our component

97
00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:15.940
we have selectCourse and

98
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.760
deleteCourse, okay.

99
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.124
So let's go back and
you'll see here that although

100
00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:33.239
my layout is a little wonky
that we are indeed and I think.

101
00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:38.275
All right, well, I'm not tracing
anything out, but this is rendering.

102
00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:45.390
So now, let's go ahead and let's build
out the courses detail component.

103
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.434
So, what I'm gonna do here is.

104
00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:51.322
I'm going to uncheck this and

105
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:55.215
I'm going to update this to.

106
00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:01.191
Current course.

107
00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:12.019
Now what I'm going to do
inside of the template.

108
00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:16.851
I'm going to, add in an input and

109
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:21.862
we're going to allow for course.

110
00:09:27.238 --> 00:09:28.487
And this is gonna be of type course.

111
00:09:28.487 --> 00:09:34.335
And we're going to go output.

112
00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:43.005
We're going to create two
outputs saved equals new event.

113
00:09:48.197 --> 00:09:54.101
Emitter and cancel equals

114
00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:58.666
new event emitter.

115
00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:06.051
All right and
we are not implementing on emit and

116
00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:10.480
so I'm going to save this and

117
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:18.799
then we're going to go back
into our component here.

118
00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:27.520
And we're going to add the sense so now.

119
00:10:30.739 --> 00:10:34.735
Course equal selectedcourse.

120
00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:37.578
And,

121
00:10:41.794 --> 00:10:48.615
Canceled=reset, and saved.

122
00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:57.990
=saveCourse, and
this is going to take a dollar sign.

123
00:11:02.158 --> 00:11:04.367
All right.

124
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.665
This should work minus one thing you'll
notice here that I have current course.

125
00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:18.836
So I'm going to just for
a moment going to update this.

126
00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:27.953
To be currentCourse.

127
00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:31.511
All right,
just a couple things real quick.

128
00:11:31.511 --> 00:11:35.645
So let's go into course details,
and we will,

129
00:11:45.423 --> 00:11:52.775
currentCourse.title and
we go saved.emit and,

130
00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:59.140
What did I call,

131
00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:08.177
Canceled.

132
00:12:10.976 --> 00:12:15.151
And inside of my template,
cancel, all right.

133
00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:18.259
Right.

134
00:12:21.049 --> 00:12:26.833
Notice that I change the input and so
that kind of threw things off hopefully.

135
00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:30.600
All right, here we go.

136
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.566
There we go.

137
00:12:34.566 --> 00:12:35.545
So you can see here.

138
00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:40.630
Now as I select this,
although I'm a little bummed out that this

139
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.732
layout is totally messed up,
let me see if I fix this real quick.

140
00:13:03.344 --> 00:13:05.206
I got a good feeling about this.

141
00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:10.112
And I'm just gonna wager that,

142
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:17.692
I probably need to do the same thing for
the list,

143
00:13:17.692 --> 00:13:21.250
of courses-list, if I'm not mistaken.

144
00:13:24.277 --> 00:13:26.435
And then we are in
the homestretch of this.

145
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.338
Let me check in courses-list.

146
00:13:34.338 --> 00:13:37.806
There we go, boom,
just fixing this layout.

147
00:13:42.893 --> 00:13:43.448
There we go.

148
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:51.303
Let me save this and, All right, awesome.

149
00:13:51.303 --> 00:13:53.654
So now,

150
00:13:58.355 --> 00:14:03.146
New course, but we have a small problem.

151
00:14:09.384 --> 00:14:15.088
Hello, so we need to update this or

152
00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:20.202
one break this, but also one of

153
00:14:20.202 --> 00:14:25.131
the things that we are doing.

154
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:30.756
That we want to be really careful
about is in our selectCourse.

155
00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:35.588
What I'm going to do is, I am not going

156
00:14:35.588 --> 00:14:40.432
to create a clone at the parent level.

157
00:14:40.432 --> 00:14:45.061
But rather we are going to move
that into the child component.

158
00:14:45.061 --> 00:14:50.514
So I'm going to get rid of that.

159
00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:53.155
And let's go back here.

160
00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:59.515
So now if I start modifying this you can
see it happens in more than one place.
