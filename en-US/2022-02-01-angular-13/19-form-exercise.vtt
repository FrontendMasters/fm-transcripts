00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.411
I'm going to issue a challenge,
a challenge.

2
00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:11.247
So let's pull up our challenges MD,

3
00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:16.240
and I believe that we just check here.

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.990
Title description percent.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.470
Yep, all right.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.776
So, what I would like for
everybody to do is to,

7
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:31.795
in the form I would like for

8
00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:37.277
everybody to update the form to show

9
00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:43.730
percent complete as well as favorite.

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.562
Now, I'm going to give you a hint,
If we go to Angular material,

11
00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:57.440
think about if you have
something that is a number.

12
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.180
What is a good representation of that,
especially when it's 0 to 100?

13
00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:14.432
If you have something that is
a Boolean value such as true or

14
00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:19.902
false, what is a,
an appropriate control for that?

15
00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:24.094
So in side of this challenge,

16
00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:28.126
I'm going to check this in.

17
00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:34.860
And just leave this here.

18
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.095
I just want everybody to add these to

19
00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:45.506
form elements into the existing form

20
00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:51.575
that I'm going to check in and push up.

21
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:52.985
But also a bonus.

22
00:01:54.995 --> 00:02:03.624
How can we Edit a course in and

23
00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:16.199
Without affecting,
The other representations.

24
00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:23.590
So I've already given you a hint,
it's actually in the code.

25
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.205
But what I would like for
people to think about is when I

26
00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:33.700
start typing here,
how do I keep this from happening?

27
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.720
So thinking caps on and
this is the challenge.

28
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.420
So to form controls.

29
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.803
And think about how to do this without
affecting the other representations of

30
00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:46.430
that, that's bound to it.
