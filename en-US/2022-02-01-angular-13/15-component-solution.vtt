1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.563
So we're going to walk
through the solution and

2
00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:10.261
I'm going to do just a few extra
things within this solution.

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:14.080
Just so we can start to move
towards a coherent application.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.363
So the first part of this was to,

5
00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:21.110
within the courses component,
display the courses using ngFor.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.259
Add an event handler to select a course,
and

7
00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.237
then display the raw JSON
of a selected course,

8
00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:35.080
we are going to do a similar
thing in the home component.

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.083
So just to lock this down,

10
00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:42.861
if we go into our courses component HTML,

11
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:51.049
you'll see here that I've added a mat
list that has a mat list item, and

12
00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:58.440
so I can kind of shrink
everything else that's in here.

13
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.027
And we are using ngFor to
iterate over the courses and

14
00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:06.781
essentially stamp out a templated item for

15
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:11.588
every single course, so
I'm going to just copy this.

16
00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.958
And let's go into our home component.html,
and

17
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:21.575
we're going to take these course
lessons here that you can see in

18
00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:26.690
the component itself, and
we're going to render these.

19
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.315
So what I'm gonna do so
that I'm not typing everything over and

20
00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:38.570
over, and
I'm going to just delete this up here.

21
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.670
So I just have a mat list,
a mat list item.

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.300
The first thing we're
gonna do is use ngFor.

23
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.470
And we're going to go let
lesson of course lessons.

24
00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.415
And this is going to iterate over,
so let's just go ahead and

25
00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:06.290
make sure that we
are rendering this properly.

26
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.490
I'm just going to go lesson,
don't know what's actually in here.

27
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.470
So we'll just do a pipe and we'll do JSON.

28
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.390
We'll save this.

29
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.826
Let's hop into our browser, and

30
00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:27.000
let's go to our home route here.

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.917
And so you can see we're just iterating
over, we're dumping this out.

32
00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:38.915
But we have a title property here
that we actually want to bind to,

33
00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:43.765
so we'll go back into our code and
we'll go.

34
00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:47.220
All will bind to this, oops, lesson.title.

35
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.040
Let's check this out.

36
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.010
Here we go.

37
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.978
And what I want to do is create an event
handler that when I select this,

38
00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:02.980
then I'm able to capture that and
do something with it.

39
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.101
So we're going to go click and
we're going to go select lesson and

40
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.566
we're going to pass this lesson in.

41
00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:19.744
And we'll hop into our all component and
we'll add in our event handler here,

42
00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:24.220
select lesson,
which is going to take a lesson.

43
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.117
And I'm kind of doing this backwards,

44
00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:34.631
I realized selected lesson equals lesson,
all right?

45
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.019
So you can see here that
this doesn't exist.

46
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.331
And I wonder what happens if I click
declare property selected lesson.

47
00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:46.840
Well, what do you know?

48
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.740
It went ahead and just added this for me.

49
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.540
So let's hop back into our browser.

50
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.876
And you can see here that
one it's rendering, but

51
00:03:56.876 --> 00:04:00.330
let me go back into my code real quick.

52
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.010
And, or rather,
let's go into our template.

53
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.793
And let's do,
want to just do a horizontal row,

54
00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:16.590
which I just use as a,
just to kind of segment the layout.

55
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.136
And we'll do our favorite pre tag here,
and

56
00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:30.147
SelectedLesson, and we're just gonna

57
00:04:30.147 --> 00:04:34.761
dump this out back into the browser.

58
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:41.980
And so you can see here that as we select
this, this is now showing up underneath.

59
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.050
And so I believe this satisfies
the entirety of this particular challenge.

60
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.692
Let me just double check, yep,
raw JSON of selected lesson.

61
00:04:54.692 --> 00:05:01.258
But let's go ahead and
I'm going to do a few other things,

62
00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:07.824
jjust as kind of an extension
of our component challenge,

63
00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:12.649
so that we can see this working,
so in our,

64
00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:25.410
app.component.html, we
have a sidenav here.

65
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.230
And If we look in the HTML itself, you'll
notice that there's nothing actually here.

66
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.259
So what I'm going to do is,
because I have to find the path here,

67
00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.725
so I have a links collection
with home courses,

68
00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:46.984
even some icons, a couple different thing.

69
00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:49.760
Let's go ahead and let's build this out.

70
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.660
And so
we're going to use a nav element here.

71
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.470
And then within this,
I'm going to go anchor tag that button.

72
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.688
We're going to set this to class nav link.

73
00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:14.100
And we're going to,
let me just close this off real quick, so

74
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.120
I can do this in a way that
makes a little bit more sense.

75
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.280
So now, let's iterate over this.

76
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.870
And so ndFor, and we're going to go,
let link have links.

77
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.350
And let's go ahead and add in a mat icon.

78
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.522
And we're going to go link icon.

79
00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:48.460
And from here,
We're going to do link.title.

80
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.800
So let me just save this real quick and
see where we ended up at.

81
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.040
So here we go.

82
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.280
So you'll notice here that
it's not actually doing much.

83
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.300
And so let's wire this up.

84
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.420
And we're going to talk about this a
little bit more when we get into routing.

85
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.743
But at the same time,
I think that having something functional,

86
00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:13.113
trumps narrative arc in this case.

87
00:07:13.113 --> 00:07:19.563
So we need to add the ability to link.

88
00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:24.722
So in this case,
we're going to bind to router link and

89
00:07:24.722 --> 00:07:27.982
we're going to call link.path.

90
00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:34.212
And then, what we'll also do is,
we'll go router link active and

91
00:07:34.212 --> 00:07:38.893
we're just going to attach
an active class here.

92
00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:45.490
So let's save this, and
hopefully, we can navigate.

93
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.817
So we'll talk a little bit
more about router link and

94
00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:54.568
how that works, but even if we go to,

95
00:07:54.568 --> 00:07:58.577
real quick, let me just inspect this.

96
00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:07.583
What you see here is that,
if you look right here,

97
00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:13.940
because this is active courses that
we have the active class on this.

98
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.294
And so if I went in and
defined inactive class that,

99
00:08:19.294 --> 00:08:23.360
I could say I want this to be read.

100
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:30.235
We now have the ability to navigate
from home to courses and back,

101
00:08:30.235 --> 00:08:35.362
because we built up
the navigation using ngFor.

102
00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:39.313
And is well using property binding,

103
00:08:39.313 --> 00:08:43.520
we were able to essentially bind to this

104
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.240
router link directive and
send in the path.

105
00:08:51.057 --> 00:08:55.680
Now let me do one other thing
real quick since we're here.

106
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:06.293
If I go to, Coursescomponent.html,

107
00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:10.312
you'll see here that I have

108
00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:18.710
a Course that when we select it,
we are displaying it.

109
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.650
But then, if nothing is selected,
then it's just kind of like no book.

110
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.440
Super boring.

111
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.630
So I want to update this slightly,

112
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.690
within this mat card title.

113
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:38.133
What I'm going to do is
I'm going to introduce

114
00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:42.877
a span tag, and I am going to go ngIf, and

115
00:09:42.877 --> 00:09:47.779
we're going to go selectedcourse.id.

116
00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:53.110
So it's basically saying, is there
a selectedcourse and does it have an ID?

117
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.039
And if not else,
we're going to give it just a,

118
00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:02.465
want to call it elseBlock.

119
00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:04.510
Really, really progressive there.

120
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:10.172
So If it does exist,
then we're going to go

121
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.740
SelectedCourse.title, title case.

122
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:25.516
So just what we did up here,
and then if it doesn't,

123
00:10:25.516 --> 00:10:30.444
then we're going to do ng template and

124
00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:35.526
we're going to define our elseBlock,

125
00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:40.476
and We'll go select a course, all right?

126
00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:48.975
Let's save this,
let's go back into our application.

127
00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:53.105
So what you're gonna see here, mat two,

128
00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:57.826
it's trying to read selectedCourse.id, but

129
00:10:57.826 --> 00:11:02.285
guess what, that doesn't exist.

130
00:11:02.285 --> 00:11:07.310
So this is where we use our
safe navigation operator,

131
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.380
to say, try to read it.

132
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.725
And if it doesn't, then just give up.

133
00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:17.419
So now, here,

134
00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:24.883
Here, and so let's go.

135
00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:31.974
And let's add something else in,
since we're here,

136
00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:38.425
and I'm going to jump back into the code.

137
00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:45.905
And in the actions,
I'm going to add a button.

138
00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:53.885
And eventually we're going
to use this to reset a form.

139
00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:59.035
But for now,
what I'm going to do is select course,

140
00:11:59.035 --> 00:12:04.430
and I'm gonna pass in null,
we'll see what happens.

141
00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:16.392
So back here, And

142
00:12:16.392 --> 00:12:22.892
so what I'm doing now is I'm essentially
setting the selected course to null.

143
00:12:22.892 --> 00:12:28.865
All right, so we're kinda moving along,
things are looking cool.

144
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.834
So I'm going to cut this off,
check it in, and

145
00:12:34.834 --> 00:12:41.790
then we're going to go to the next
logical extension of this application.
