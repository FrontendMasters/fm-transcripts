00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.235
I would like for you to, in a sense,

2
00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:09.330
do what I've done in to the start branch.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.770
And so start that out.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.587
And so, in the courses component,

5
00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:18.670
complete the following challenges.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.464
So display the courses using ngFor.

7
00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:25.733
Add an event handler for
the selected course and

8
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:31.290
display a, Raw JSON of selected courses.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.050
Now let me check something
here real quick.

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.596
I'm going to augment this just slightly.

11
00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:47.436
And I'm going to add in,

12
00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:58.250
I would also like everybody to,
within the home component,

13
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.195
you should see that there's
a number of course lessons.

14
00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:08.905
I would like for
everybody to render those as well.

15
00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:11.846
So I'm going to update,

16
00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:19.000
This challenge, File.

17
00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:26.595
Complete the following challenges.

18
00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:37.160
Display lessons using ngFor and also,

19
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:51.352
We're gonna basically do the same thing,
but, We're gonna do this for lessons.

20
00:01:51.352 --> 00:01:54.939
So you're gonna just double up on this.

21
00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.092
So, everything I've done up to
this point has been checked in.

22
00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:04.079
I would prefer that you start at 00
Start and if you go into the resources,

23
00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.466
the challenges MD,
this is the first challenge here.

24
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:11.231
And I've already done a portion of
this but I'd like you to do it.

25
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:17.700
But then we'll also do the home component
when I get back as the solution.
