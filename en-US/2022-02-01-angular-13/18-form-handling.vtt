1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.745
In our courses component dot HTML,
we are gonna come in and

2
00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:11.920
we are gonna start to build this out.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.935
And so
what I wanna do here is attach a form and

4
00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:21.693
we're going to put this around because.

5
00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:25.820
So the one thing is with a material
cart is you have your content and

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.060
then you have your actions.

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.609
And we're going to wrap this
entire thing inside of a form.

8
00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.896
So the form body is going to
go inside of the content and

9
00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:43.590
then the actions themselves are going to
go inside the actions section of the card.

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.675
And from here let's go ahead and

11
00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:56.463
we're going to go form equals mg form

12
00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:04.547
And, Let's go and

13
00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:07.265
just so we can see some of this in action

14
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.975
We'll get on pre And

15
00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:23.775
we'll just go form, non value, JSON and

16
00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:31.330
I'm gonna duplicate this and
we'll go valid.

17
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.246
And I'm not quite for sure what's gonna
happen because there's nothing in here,

18
00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:42.388
but it's a good No direct

19
00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:48.130
is found with export as in G form,
what do you think that could be?

20
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.651
Let me check.

21
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.207
It's like I'm like a prophet
like I'm a minor prophet like,

22
00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:02.883
I'm over you're saying everybody
needs to be real careful.

23
00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:05.120
Well, there you have it.

24
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.595
We just organize imports just because
I'm obsessive compulsive, all right.

25
00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:23.836
Better, so make sure you import your
forms module and we have a form,

26
00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:30.140
we don't have any input fields,
it's not doing much.

27
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.603
So let's go back into our code here and

28
00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:40.223
let's start to build the cell.

29
00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.709
So, I'm gonna type one of these out and

30
00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.737
then I might copy paste the rest
of them or some of them,

31
00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:01.866
just because typing is
not that interesting.

32
00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:09.330
I'm gonna give this a class of full width,
and we're going to add an input.

33
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.672
And from here, we're going to add

34
00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:20.823
in mat input here, we're going to

35
00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:25.987
give this a placeholder of title.

36
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:35.132
And, I'm

37
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:39.882
going to do something that
is going to blow up, but

38
00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:44.078
let's do it anyways current course title,

39
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.602
So there's a couple things
that is problematic

40
00:03:56.602 --> 00:04:00.788
about what I've done up to this point, but

41
00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:04.641
YOLO let's see what's going on here.

42
00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:10.379
So current course that's super

43
00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.270
easy, so let me go back here

44
00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:22.981
Let's try this again.

45
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:33.487
So, This is what happened last time,

46
00:04:33.487 --> 00:04:39.040
so you can do a couple things
here that I think are okay.

47
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.770
The first one is, I'm pretty sure I can
put a safe navigation operator in here.

48
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.491
And the expressions are not allowed, okay.

49
00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:57.507
So one of the things that I
will say about angular 13

50
00:04:57.507 --> 00:05:02.870
versus its predecessors is
that it is a lot more strict.

51
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.525
So, what I'm gonna do here is,
they're forcing

52
00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:14.820
my hand to solve a problem
that I was going to solve

53
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.999
a little bit later, but
I'll do it now, that,

54
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.485
When I have a form that I'm
using to either create or

55
00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:36.419
update something because you
absolutely can use the same form.

56
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.986
That when I have something
selected something,

57
00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:44.163
let's say a chorus,
then I bind that form to the chorus.

58
00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:49.214
But if it's empty,
what I want is to essentially

59
00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:54.895
bind it to an empty course
object that gets populated.

60
00:05:54.895 --> 00:05:57.555
So that when I save it,

61
00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:02.601
it just passes it down
the road if you will.

62
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:07.115
So, from here what I am going to do,

63
00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:11.629
I feel like this is a really good time

64
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:16.390
to generate an interface for this.

65
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.354
So, Fortunately

66
00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:29.344
this is from previously when I did this,
so NGG interface common models course.

67
00:06:29.344 --> 00:06:34.007
And so anytime this is generally one of
the first things I do when I'm building

68
00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:38.390
something out is I will actually
build out the interfaces first.

69
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.303
And then everything else is
able to be kind of inferred or

70
00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:46.064
generated off of that, so
let's just double check.

71
00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:50.778
Looks good, and so
just let it be known for

72
00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:55.765
the record that in this particular module,

73
00:06:55.765 --> 00:07:01.500
I generated an interface so
that we could see it.

74
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.301
So now, we'll go to common here and

75
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:10.115
we just look at this real quick,
id, title,

76
00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:14.192
description, percent, complete.

77
00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:23.198
So, Id should actually always

78
00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:28.199
be a string,
the reason being is because numbers.

79
00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:33.900
You can only have so many variations
of them, like really zero through nine.

80
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.235
Whereas with alphanumeric strings,
you can have a ton,

81
00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:46.138
I do think it's funny that I put that
as a in quotes is a string, all right.

82
00:07:46.138 --> 00:07:50.725
So like I was doing an object literal for
a second okay.

83
00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:56.393
We'll go with description is a string

84
00:07:56.393 --> 00:08:01.175
percent complete is a number and

85
00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:06.841
our favorite is going to be a Boolean,

86
00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:11.170
all right, there we go.

87
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:18.675
I'm going to save this,
now if we go back into our courses.

88
00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:22.889
What I'm going to do, is I'm going
to outside of the class itself.

89
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.591
I'm going to go empty course, and

90
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:33.462
I'm going to type this as
a course you can see now that

91
00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:38.033
I've imported the interface and
id is gonna be no

92
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:55.976
I'll address this in just a second,
this is why.

93
00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:59.070
So now what we should see is that
it's declared as never read,

94
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.521
as well as we're missing
a bunch of properties.

95
00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:05.900
So title is just gonna be
an empty string description.

96
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.926
Also an empty string,
percent complete is gonna be zero and

97
00:09:12.926 --> 00:09:17.273
favorite is going to be false, all right.

98
00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:22.510
So, now, what I can do is I can set

99
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.947
selected course to empty course.

100
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.329
And so now when I come back into
this what you'll see here is

101
00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:41.874
that everything is hopefully kosher,
let me check.

102
00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:47.850
Alright, so
mostly kosher this is the other piece.

103
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.272
So if entry model is used within a form
tag either the name attribute must be

104
00:09:55.272 --> 00:10:02.287
set or the form control must be defined as
stand alone, that's not what we wanna do.

105
00:10:02.287 --> 00:10:07.272
Well, what we want to
do is we need a way to

106
00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:13.006
attach ng model to the top
level form control.

107
00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:16.540
And so
this is what this is complaining about.

108
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.625
And so if we go back in here
this is also going to save you

109
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:26.710
a bunch of pain,
that if you're attaching mg model to

110
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.582
an input that you also need
to add a name attribute.

111
00:10:31.582 --> 00:10:35.172
Add to it like so, and

112
00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:39.567
I think this should work.

113
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:46.927
And, lo and behold, what do you know?

114
00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:52.342
That absolutely nothing is
happening which is good,

115
00:10:52.342 --> 00:10:59.338
so now when I select this you can see
here that we populated the title.

116
00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:03.940
And this became or
the value of the foreign

117
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.070
control object became instantly populated,

118
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.478
now if I cancel it I would
imagine that here we go.

119
00:11:14.478 --> 00:11:19.834
So when I tried to set it
to no that was not good, so

120
00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:26.135
this is where things get just
a few extra steps to do this.

121
00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:30.940
So, what I'm going to do here is I'm

122
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.280
going to create one more method.

123
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:44.516
And I'm going to I'll just do this down
here, I'm gonna call this just reset

124
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:56.075
Select the course Or rather I can do

125
00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:08.676
Let's try this I'm going to essentially

126
00:12:08.676 --> 00:12:16.000
just create a copy of the empty course,
there we go.

127
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.746
And so
all I'm doing is I'm taking this object,

128
00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:19.170
I'm just creating a new copy of it.

129
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.077
And I'm setting that is the select course,
JavaScript, as you know, is,

130
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:28.079
unless it's a primitive value,
it's passed by reference.

131
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:31.271
Which can create some interesting things,

132
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:35.331
especially when you're
binding to the same property.

133
00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:38.392
If you ever wanna talk about
the evils of shared mutable state,

134
00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:41.200
this is a really easy
way to demonstrate that.

135
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.241
So what I'm doing instead is
making this immutable by or

136
00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:45.803
rather it is still mutable.

137
00:12:45.803 --> 00:12:50.028
But essentially breaking that
something shared and mutable,

138
00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:54.183
what you need to do is either make
it non mutable or not shared.

139
00:12:54.183 --> 00:12:57.532
So in this case,
I'm calling this lead course but

140
00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:00.173
I'm passing in a copy of empty course.

141
00:13:00.173 --> 00:13:04.731
And before I forget,
what I need to do now is

142
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:09.960
when I call this,
I just need to call reset.

143
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.329
So we'll go here, back to this,

144
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:18.856
select this and if I click cancel,

145
00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:23.693
you can see now I was able to reset it,

146
00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:28.239
and hopefully everything is AOK.

147
00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:35.130
And so let me add in one more property
here and then let me do one more property.

148
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:40.528
And then we will go on to kind
of the next portion of this and

149
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:45.935
I'm going to issue a challenge and
we will go from there.

150
00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:49.591
So, in this case description and

151
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:54.299
the differences this one is not required.

152
00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:59.823
So, if we go here and
notice that when I started

153
00:13:59.823 --> 00:14:04.922
to type this in,
it filled this in, and but

154
00:14:04.922 --> 00:14:12.311
it immediately went to being
valid because this is required.

155
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:17.335
And now that itself you can see that if I

156
00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:24.720
select this what we should
see somewhere in here is yes.

157
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.691
So you can see here, right down here,
you have this ng invalid as well

158
00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:34.003
as it's saying that it's dirty,
and it's been touched.

159
00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:35.800
In summary, nice,
what are we talking about?

160
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.017
All right, so just refresh this and

161
00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:47.250
we'll select, there we go, valid.

162
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.778
And, as I type this in and

163
00:14:50.778 --> 00:14:55.146
you can see here that it's also

164
00:14:55.146 --> 00:15:00.366
filling it out here so, there we go.

165
00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:05.290
Now, we're gonna talk
about this when we get

166
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.957
into component driven architecture, but

167
00:15:09.957 --> 00:15:15.515
remember what I said about
shared mutable state.

168
00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:22.280
So shared state is okay,
mutable state is okay,

169
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.891
but shared mutable state is the devil's

170
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:33.184
playground, and let me show you why.

171
00:15:33.184 --> 00:15:38.250
So you'll see here,
I've selected Angular 13 fundamentals.

172
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.498
And what do you think happens when

173
00:15:44.498 --> 00:15:49.247
I go in and I update this title.

174
00:15:49.247 --> 00:15:55.321
Did you notice that,
I am mutating this title and

175
00:15:55.321 --> 00:16:01.558
it's updating in three
other places on the page?

176
00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:06.574
So this is not good, the reason being,

177
00:16:06.574 --> 00:16:14.328
is what if I started typing this
in I'm like, you know what?

178
00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:16.623
I don't really wanna do this,

179
00:16:16.623 --> 00:16:22.638
well I have no way to undo this because
I've already mutated the data structure.

180
00:16:22.638 --> 00:16:28.610
And so the question is how do
I solve this, what do I do?
