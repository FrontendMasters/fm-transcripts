1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.752
Let's do the solutions.

2
00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:10.070
So git checkout -b
02-template-forms-solution.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.326
So now we are on the solutions branch,
back into the code and

4
00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:22.974
so what we're going to do is we're
going to fill this form out.

5
00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:27.739
And we're also going to find
a way to edit the course without

6
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.990
affecting the other representations.

7
00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:40.522
So we have two additional
controls that we need to add.

8
00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:45.436
And if you went and
looked at the main branch for

9
00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:49.855
reference, I'm not going to fault you.

10
00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:54.093
The one thing that is the thing that when

11
00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:59.103
you're dealing with text-based controls,

12
00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:05.664
that everything can kind of
sit within a mat-form-field.

13
00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:09.098
And so you have a mat-form-field, and

14
00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:13.542
you're able to put your
test control into that, and

15
00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:18.696
you get a lot of nice things
around the text-based control.

16
00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:23.593
So for instance, I'm pretty sure
that I can actually change this into

17
00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:28.166
a textarea and let me just see,
hopefully this doesn't blow up.

18
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:33.909
Yeah, so
you can see here whereas this is an input,

19
00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.587
this is now a textarea.

20
00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:42.692
Looks pretty similar, the difference
being that I have a draggable thing here,

21
00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:45.490
you can see I'm running Grammarly.

22
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.945
So it was trying to do some
grammar checking as we go along.

23
00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:56.857
So, but because we are going to use,
coming back to here,

24
00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:03.011
we're gonna use a checkbox and
we're going to use a slider,

25
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:07.616
this mat-form-field is not going to work.

26
00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:13.707
And so what we have to do here
is just use a section and

27
00:02:13.707 --> 00:02:18.382
we're gonna give this a full-width,

28
00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:22.915
like so and then what I'm going to do is

29
00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:27.463
I'm going to add in the mat-slider.

30
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.938
And we're going to add in our property,

31
00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:38.879
so again back to full-width.

32
00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.523
And we're gonna go min=0,

33
00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:47.770
max=100 cuz I don't think you can be at

34
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.872
110% unless I suppose this would be,

35
00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:57.703
I have the tiger mode, so thumblabel.

36
00:02:57.703 --> 00:03:01.279
So this, what I'm adding here,

37
00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:06.258
a lot of this is just
a matter of me going through

38
00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:11.639
the documentation and
finding what works for me.

39
00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.561
So there is nothing particularly,
I think compelling

40
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:21.483
about some of these options
that I'm putting on here,

41
00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:27.479
is just trial and error and
finding out what I think looks the best.

42
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.223
So in this case,

43
00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:35.518
we're doing ngModel current or

44
00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:43.174
rather selectedCourse.percentComplete.

45
00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:50.049
And then let's also do
name=percentComplete,

46
00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.964
all right, let's check this out.

47
00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.915
Yeah.

48
00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:05.231
I think these are probably the same value.

49
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:10.215
So let's just change this up, so
we can get our money's worth.

50
00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:14.498
We'll go 12% on this one and

51
00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:19.110
we'll go 98% on this one and so

52
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.239
now you can see that and

53
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:26.870
then when I cancel, there we go.

54
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.877
So again notice that as I select this that

55
00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:39.831
the underlying value of the form
is being updated as well as the,

56
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:44.397
I totally don't know why I did that,

57
00:04:44.397 --> 00:04:48.987
as the validity or state of the form.

58
00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:50.941
Is it in a valid state?

59
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:56.360
All right, so from here, let's go back and

60
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.905
let's add in one more control here.

61
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.894
And what I can do here,
we'll go section again.

62
00:05:08.894 --> 00:05:15.196
And inside of this, we're going to

63
00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:20.665
do mat-checkbox and we will,

64
00:05:25.622 --> 00:05:28.344
Bind to this using ngModel, surprise.

65
00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:34.087
And this is gonna be selectedCourse.

66
00:05:36.334 --> 00:05:38.288
Favorite.

67
00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:44.823
And we going to add name=favorite.

68
00:05:57.375 --> 00:06:04.059
And what I'm also going to do is,
Let's actually update this to 4.

69
00:06:06.781 --> 00:06:08.105
We're going to go with,

70
00:06:18.838 --> 00:06:22.052
selectedCourse.percentComplete.

71
00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:28.172
Let's go ahead and save this.

72
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:37.007
All right, so now you can see here,
that if I drag this,

73
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.580
There we go, cancel, select,

74
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.330
cancel, there we go, all right, so,

75
00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:57.999
Let's do or
let me add in one more thing real quick

76
00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:02.889
that we kind of briefly
in a roundabout way,

77
00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.457
we've kind of covered some
of the concepts here.

78
00:07:08.457 --> 00:07:15.295
But let's talk about how to
submit this particular form and

79
00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:22.279
so we are going to go ahead and
we're going to add in a button.

80
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:30.715
And this is going to be type=submit.

81
00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:35.519
And we're going to mat-button and

82
00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:39.523
in this case, we're gonna go

83
00:07:39.523 --> 00:07:44.818
color=primary, and we'll go Save.

84
00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:49.477
And now what we can do here,

85
00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:55.150
because this is a submit button,

86
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:03.051
that we can go up to the top
on the form itself and

87
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:09.551
we can attach a submit event handler.

88
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:13.453
And so here we'll go saveCourse and

89
00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:17.883
we'll go (selectedCourse), okay?

90
00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:25.756
So we're calling
submit=saveCourse(selectedCourse) and

91
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:31.301
then we're going to go here and
saveCourse.

92
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.976
And we're just going to log this out.

93
00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:53.968
Okay, now let's go back
into our code here.

94
00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:57.200
I'm gonna select this and
just bump up here.

95
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:05.020
And now if I go and I hit Enter,
Not within, there we go.

96
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.274
So within a textarea,
it's going to just break to the next line.

97
00:09:09.274 --> 00:09:15.654
But as you can see here, that when
I hit Enter within this text field,

98
00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:19.615
then that captures that as a submit event.

99
00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:23.549
So you have to have a submit
button in the form to do that, but

100
00:09:23.549 --> 00:09:26.715
once I added that,
I can also call save as well.

101
00:09:26.715 --> 00:09:30.967
So we cancel this and

102
00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:36.222
you'll notice here that

103
00:09:36.222 --> 00:09:41.983
this is in a invalid state.

104
00:09:41.983 --> 00:09:47.343
And so what we can do here
is we build this out and

105
00:09:47.343 --> 00:09:52.439
go back into here, into our template here.

106
00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:57.903
And what I can do is I
can simply go disabled,

107
00:09:57.903 --> 00:10:03.074
so I can bind to this
disabled property and

108
00:10:03.074 --> 00:10:06.640
I can just say form.invalid

109
00:10:08.998 --> 00:10:14.122
All right, so if it's invalid, I'm not
gonna be able to do anything on this.

110
00:10:14.122 --> 00:10:19.774
So you'll see here that
I'm not able to click it,

111
00:10:19.774 --> 00:10:23.689
so here it's valid and I can save.

112
00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:32.576
When it's not valid, so
if I went here then obviously

113
00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:37.469
once I've satisfied
the title requirements on

114
00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:42.131
the object, on the data model, it's true.

115
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:46.148
And then when I cancel it out,
it is no longer true.

116
00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:52.914
So let's talk about real quick how do or

117
00:10:52.914 --> 00:11:00.306
how could we prevent this from happening.

118
00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:05.652
That when I select one of these elements,

119
00:11:05.652 --> 00:11:10.847
because we are passing this by reference

120
00:11:10.847 --> 00:11:17.288
that all of these are pointing
to the same object.

121
00:11:17.288 --> 00:11:19.431
How do we handle this?

122
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:24.864
So again,
if you have shared mutable state and

123
00:11:24.864 --> 00:11:32.400
in a vacuum, if shared state is okay,
immutable state is okay.

124
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.069
The trick here is you either have to
make it not shared or not mutable.

125
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:40.839
In this case, we have a form,
so by nature that is mutable.

126
00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:48.682
But how we can solve this is
when we go to selectCourse,

127
00:11:48.682 --> 00:11:55.583
we can,
Let's just see what happens if we do this.

128
00:11:55.583 --> 00:12:02.381
So we're just going to take this and
essentially create a copy of it.

129
00:12:06.052 --> 00:12:07.067
I hope this works.

130
00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:12.218
So notice that it's working
over here because we're

131
00:12:12.218 --> 00:12:17.951
still binding to the same object,
but it's not over here.

132
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:24.491
So this is really important that when
you have something that involves a form,

133
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:29.247
it is mutative by nature like
inputting data into a form,

134
00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:33.136
you are mutating some
underlying data model.

135
00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:38.714
And so the trick here is that you have
to make sure that though it's mutable,

136
00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.727
it's not shared mutable.

137
00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:44.665
One little trick that I like to
do when I'm dealing with this is,

138
00:12:51.043 --> 00:12:55.974
I like to, When I set,

139
00:13:02.023 --> 00:13:10.301
A course and I'm going to break
that shared mutation, Connection,

140
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:16.470
what I can do is I'd like to just, Well,

141
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:21.663
what I can do here is I can
just go course.title, like so

142
00:13:21.663 --> 00:13:27.094
and because this is a string,
I'm just going to store it.

143
00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:37.136
Save it off and then here, We will go,

144
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:47.474
Original, I can spell this correctly,
originalTitle, save this.

145
00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:54.238
And now I'm able to change this, but

146
00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:59.167
I'm still able to track the title
because it's just a string.

147
00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:06.310
It's a primitive data type, so that is
passed by value and not pass by reference.
