1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.295
Now that we have built mostly
a completed application with component

2
00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:11.150
of an architecture achieving this
glorious master detail view application,

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.739
we're going to move into some very
specific examples that fortunately for

4
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.340
us, they exist or
they can kind of stand on their own.

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.830
And so with that said, the first thing
I'd like to talk about is child routes.

6
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.570
And this is the ability
to have a route and

7
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.180
then within that navigated route,
then have sub routes that

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.120
you can then navigate within
the context of an enclosing route.

9
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.044
And so
within our code what we're gonna do,

10
00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:53.100
is we are going to update the routing
table to include a child route.

11
00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.200
And so
we'll start with this examples route here.

12
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.326
And it is pointing to
an examples component.

13
00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:09.080
What we want to do is we
want to add in children.

14
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.610
And so this is just an array
that takes in additional routes.

15
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.387
And so from here,
we are going to create a path and

16
00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:23.390
we are going to give this a path of child.

17
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.563
And we're going to
assign the component for

18
00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:31.075
this route to be an admin component.

19
00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:37.287
And there we go.

20
00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:39.501
But inside of this child route,

21
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:45.640
we're going to add in additional child
routes to really drive the point home.

22
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.802
So we'll go children and
within this children array,

23
00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:54.040
we're going to add in
two additional routes.

24
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.770
And you'll notice here that
this is fairly conventional.

25
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.915
So from here, we're going to go payroll.

26
00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:11.909
The component is going to be
the admin payroll component and

27
00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.931
we'll duplicate this and
we'll also create a vacation route and

28
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:24.250
this will go to admin vacation component.

29
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.490
Save this.

30
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.300
We'll clean this up.

31
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.179
And so now we have examples.

32
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.007
An examples route and
then within that we have a child route.

33
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:43.680
So if we go to our app component I've
added in an examples route here.

34
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.060
That's /examples/child'.

35
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.425
And what's going to happen is that when we
go to the top level route examples It's

36
00:02:55.425 --> 00:03:00.950
going to load into the app
component.HTML router outlet but

37
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.173
if we look inside of our
admin component we have

38
00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:10.156
an additional router outlet
that's then going to load

39
00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:15.063
in the child route into that
specific router outlet.

40
00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:19.510
So, let's go ahead and
hop into the browser.

41
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.790
Just refresh make sure, we're clean.

42
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.530
And I'm going to click on child routes.

43
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.780
And what we have here is examples.

44
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.210
And then within that are child routes
example, with these two buttons.

45
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.820
That currently are not doing anything.

46
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.825
And what we want to do is we want
the ability to load those two

47
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:49.050
child routes in to this particular
router outlet down here.

48
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.405
So what I could do is I
could go /vacation and

49
00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:58.470
you'll see here that now
the vacation component is

50
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.880
loaded inside of the admin component or
I could also go payroll.

51
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.700
So we'll just update this to payroll.

52
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.688
And you'll see here now we have
the payroll component loading inside

53
00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:13.920
the admin component.

54
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.997
Now, these buttons here would be nice if
when you wanna navigate to these that

55
00:04:17.997 --> 00:04:21.740
you're not having to go into
the address bar and type this in.

56
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:28.700
And so using router link,
we can target this child route.

57
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.125
And so let's go back into our code and
we are going to update this.

58
00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:48.295
And so within this we are going
to add in a router link, oops.

59
00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:56.440
And then we're going to fix
this up in just a second.

60
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.874
Let me just double check my notes to
make sure that I'm doing this correctly.

61
00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:12.420
All right router link and
we will add property binding to that.

62
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.690
And then from here we
are going to add in an array.

63
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.415
And so this is going to take
a couple of different things that

64
00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:27.667
allows angular to pass out
the values of this array and

65
00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:31.940
put it into or
construct a URL that we can navigate to.

66
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.264
So, the first thing we wanna
do is add in the base route,

67
00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:40.690
which is going to be examples for
slash child.

68
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.682
And then from here we're going to
add in the second portion of this,

69
00:05:45.682 --> 00:05:48.080
which is payroll.

70
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.730
And I'm gonna go ahead, and
I'm going to copy this.

71
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.230
And we'll paste this in here.

72
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.570
And we'll change this to location.

73
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.478
And so
now router link is now going ahead and

74
00:06:03.478 --> 00:06:09.620
taking these two values and
concatenating these into a single URL.

75
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.511
Now where this gets handy
is if you needed to add

76
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:15.370
in like a route param in between these.

77
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.909
You could do something like param,
whatever it is, and

78
00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.180
it would kind of put that together.

79
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.402
So again, using something like array.join,

80
00:06:25.402 --> 00:06:29.840
it is dynamically constructing
that URL for you.

81
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.990
So I'm gonna go ahead and save this.

82
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.474
And now if I click on this,
you'll see that we

83
00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:40.870
are going from one child route to another.

84
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.560
And so this is really handy
if you want to allow for

85
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.330
dynamic navigation within a small
portion of your application

86
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.700
without having to kind of redress
the entire thing from the top down.

87
00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.445
So, this is how child routes works
in angular, very very handy and

88
00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:05.590
as you can see not a lot of heavy
lifting to make that happen.
