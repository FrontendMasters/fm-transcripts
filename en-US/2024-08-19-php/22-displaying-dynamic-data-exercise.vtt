00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.567
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
do you feel enough confidence to

2
00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:09.450
finish this lab yourself?

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.016
I can give you five minutes.

4
00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:18.770
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
what was the answer to this?

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.592
So we are looping through the exhibits and
we are getting different objects.

6
00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:29.492
Somehow we need to spread
the object within the HTML.

7
00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:33.112
So something that I will do initially,

8
00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:37.829
I will add a paragraph that's
going to reach out for

9
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.887
debugging and
I will say I will open php tag,

10
00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:46.628
close php tag, and
I will say var_dump $object.

11
00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:51.198
So it's not going to be nice,
but if I refresh,

12
00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:55.542
now I can see on every article,
HML article,

13
00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:59.793
at the top, I'm seeing what I have, okay?

14
00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.911
So then I say, yeah, I have a title.

15
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:05.431
I have then a description, it's an array.

16
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.101
But remember that when you see array,

17
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.161
don't think just as a normal
array in other languages.

18
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:17.151
Here, the array can also be kind of
a map or a dictionary or a hash table.

19
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:19.961
So it can contain also string keys.

20
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.769
And then I just need to try
to spread that here, how?

21
00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:31.293
Well, here, in the h2, instead of h2,
I can just remove that and

22
00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:36.232
add a php tag with an echo
that will take the object.

23
00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:42.324
And because it's an array, I use square
brackets, and in a string, the key.

24
00:01:44.714 --> 00:01:52.046
Remember, we also have this shortcut that
is equals instead of php echo, okay?

25
00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:54.454
It's up to you if you
wanna use that shortcut.

26
00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:56.154
For the description, something similar.

27
00:01:56.154 --> 00:02:03.877
So within the p, I will delete the hard
code paragraph, and I will open php tag.

28
00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:11.384
And within the php tag, I'm going
to echo from object to description.

29
00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:17.084
And for the image, if we look at the image
values, they don't have the full path.

30
00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:21.353
It's just the image name,
the name of the file, right, the filename.

31
00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:24.404
But here, we see that all
the images are in the gallery.

32
00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:25.694
Question for you.

33
00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:30.504
Can I open php tag in the middle
of an HTML attribute value?

34
00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:32.094
What do you think?

35
00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:34.614
&gt;&gt; Student: Yes.

36
00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:35.914
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yes, why?

37
00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:41.373
Because PHP treats HTML
as just a string output.

38
00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:43.103
It's just characters.

39
00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:44.683
It doesn't matter, right?

40
00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:50.243
Anywhere in the HTML,
you can break the HTML and add PHP.

41
00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:56.013
So that means that, yeah,
I can do that here.

42
00:02:57.173 --> 00:03:01.977
Just have in mind to keep the HTML that
will be result of this consistent and

43
00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:03.704
compatible.

44
00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:05.294
So it's object, image.

45
00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:12.344
So now I'm saving, reloading.

46
00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:16.734
Now I'm seeing the text,
but not the image.

47
00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.601
So let's debug the image first.

48
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:25.530
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: If we look at
the image, we have sea-monsters.png.

49
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.958
So let's see,
do I have in gallery sea-monsters.png?

50
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.083
I do have.

51
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:35.751
So let's see if we have
any typo somewhere, and

52
00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:40.626
let's remove the debug so
it looks better, okay, like that.

53
00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:47.406
So I'm going to right-click here, inspect
on the image and look what's going on.

54
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:51.151
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's
important to see the output.

55
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:55.208
It's gallery only,
gallery only, and say, why?

56
00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:57.343
Do I have an echo here?

57
00:03:57.343 --> 00:03:57.966
&gt;&gt; Student: No.

58
00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.958
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: No, but
it's not giving me any errors.

59
00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.419
No, it's not.

60
00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.361
It's just accessing the value and
doing nothing with it.

61
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:09.349
That's why you don't get an error, okay?

62
00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.592
So be careful with that.

63
00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:14.502
So I don't have an echo, so it's actually
not rendering that to the output.

64
00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:17.456
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Makes sense?

65
00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.709
So not every time you have a PHP tag open,

66
00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.599
it's going to render something
if you don't say so.

67
00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.543
So now, if I refresh now,
I'm getting all the images.

68
00:04:29.543 --> 00:04:33.113
And this is a server side generated app.
