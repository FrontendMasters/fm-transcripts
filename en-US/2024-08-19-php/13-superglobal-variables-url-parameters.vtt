WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.960
First, I'm not sure if you have,
have you ever played with the form,

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.280
html form for server side,
because if you have started doing web

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.990
development the past five years,
probably you haven't.

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.032
It's kind of new,
the form has an action attribute where

5
00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:24.404
you specify where do you wanna
send the results of this form?

6
00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:32.866
For example, I can send this
to a convert.php file, okay?

7
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:37.984
So that convert.php file will
receive the data from this form,

8
00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:40.368
that's kind of idea, okay?

9
00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:46.188
So now if I refresh this,
I type something and click Convert.

10
00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:50.212
Now you can see that the browser
is going to convert.php,

11
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:55.458
we are getting a 404 because
we didn't create the file yet.

12
00:00:55.458 --> 00:01:02.743
Okay, so the next step is to
create a file convert.php.

13
00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:07.213
And this one,
there are two options here to be honest.

14
00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:11.954
We can server side, render the results,
or we can calculate the results and

15
00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:15.343
return back to the index html,
or things like that.

16
00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:18.603
Let's do the simplest one,
I'm going to create another html here.

17
00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:24.592
Here, I mean it's not
going to be really nice,

18
00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:27.402
I just wanna explain
you the basics of PHP.

19
00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:34.472
So in this case, we're going to take
Conversion Results, let me look at that.

20
00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:39.692
Here, I wanna add some php code, this is
the moment where we add some php code.

21
00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:47.882
So in the middle of the html,
we'll say, here comes the dynamic part.

22
00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:51.612
So now we can add php in
the middle of this html.

23
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:55.642
That, by the way, this html has all
the tags, remember we don't need them.

24
00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:57.632
I'm not saying delete them, okay?

25
00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:01.475
Just have in mind they're not mandatory
but in this one, I don't care so

26
00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:02.931
we can just stay like this.

27
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:07.787
And the question is,
how can I read the value from the form?

28
00:02:07.787 --> 00:02:13.896
And this is a time to talk about
this idea that has a weird name,

29
00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:17.902
okay, that is super global variables.

30
00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:22.578
The what, Superglobal Variables.

31
00:02:22.578 --> 00:02:27.039
Well, actually PHP has a lot of
global collections available

32
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.948
typically under dollar sign because
it's a variable underscore.

33
00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:38.378
You can create your own variable
starting with underscore.

34
00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:39.952
It's possible, but

35
00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:44.665
it's a good time practice to
leave those to the system, okay?

36
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:49.347
I mean you can, but also create
your own underscore variable and

37
00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:53.325
these are known as superglobal variables.

38
00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:58.798
These superglobal variables
will automatically

39
00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:03.748
be filled with data
around the HTTP request,

40
00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:08.014
around the web session, okay?

41
00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:14.088
So for example, if I try this again,
and do this, and hit convert,

42
00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:20.227
it's going now to conversion results,
so I can see that now.

43
00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:24.757
And I'm not sure if you can
realize there that there is

44
00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:28.407
a question mark at the end of the URL.

45
00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.397
You say, did I add that question mark?

46
00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:37.347
No, not really,
why do I have a question mark there?

47
00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:38.617
&gt;&gt; Student: URL parameters?

48
00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.481
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: URL parameters.

49
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:46.351
Actually, by default, the form is
trying to send all the values by URL,

50
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.871
also known as the query string.

51
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:54.181
The query string is what you
have after the question mark.

52
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:59.141
But maybe the question is, okay, it's for
the values, but where are the values?

53
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.521
I'm not seeing the values and
I actually type some values,

54
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:04.220
why the values are not there?

55
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.745
Well, the browser will send
the values using the html

56
00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:14.895
semantic name attribute,
an attribute that I haven't set.

57
00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:21.071
I have an id because Ids for the label or
for CSS, but I need to also set a name.

58
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:24.140
I'm not sure if you have used this before,

59
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.065
the name is actually the key that is going
to use to send the data to the server.

60
00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:33.505
So name amount and for
the select you also have name=crypto.

61
00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:41.089
Okay, so I have a name here and name here.

62
00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.083
With that, now, we can go back,

63
00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:48.807
refresh, and say something.

64
00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:52.171
Well, actually, having 10,000
Bitcoins is like a lot, right?

65
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:54.331
But anyway, let's start with 3 Bitcoins.

66
00:04:54.331 --> 00:05:01.175
That is still a lot, but if I convert now,
if you look at the top, this is my URL.

67
00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:05.419
So I have amount equals 3 and
crypto BTC, so

68
00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.565
I can see the variables
from my form there.

69
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:15.555
So, okay, how can I get those values?

70
00:05:15.555 --> 00:05:19.210
Well, everything that
goes there in the URL,

71
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.966
it's actually the superglobal
variable get.

72
00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:27.894
And you can see on the description
it says it's an associative array,

73
00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:33.089
that's an array of where the keys
are something different than an index.

74
00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.508
So it can be a string, for example,

75
00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:40.009
variables pass to the current
script via the URL parameters.

76
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.612
So that means it's an array,
so I can actually go and

77
00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:48.287
read, for example, the amount, okay?

78
00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:52.492
That's how you get it and
I can create the local variable for that.

79
00:05:52.492 --> 00:05:57.073
And I can also create another one for
the crypto,

80
00:05:57.073 --> 00:06:03.348
I should call that crypto code or
something like that, good idea.

81
00:06:04.428 --> 00:06:09.541
So, I'm creating local variables now that
are getting the value from the superglobal

82
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:14.523
variable collection GET,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay?

83
00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:22.890
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So now just to see
if this work, I will do an echo saying,

84
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.703
look at this,
I can even write the html here

85
00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:32.133
because the output is the html buffer.

86
00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:37.211
Let's say you want to convert amount from

87
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:42.289
$crypto, I'm using double quotes, So

88
00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:47.666
I can use interpolation within the string.

89
00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:54.431
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
now I can go back here, refresh, and

90
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:57.813
I can see that you want
to convert 3 from BTC.

91
00:06:57.813 --> 00:07:02.679
Or maybe from, I don't need from 3 BTC and
I think that should be good enough.

92
00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:07.625
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: But now I don't
need the form, because these are URL

93
00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:13.228
parameters, I can actually go to the URL
and change this, and it works, okay?

94
00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:18.058
So you can see that it's not tied to
the form, it's like just the form.

95
00:07:18.058 --> 00:07:20.890
It's just forming the URL for me, okay?

96
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.249
So then this is actually how you make
a search and shine or things like that.

97
00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:29.096
You receive an argument at the top and
actually, today,

98
00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:30.929
you can even index it at Google.

99
00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:35.286
You can even index different URLs
with different arguments there, and

100
00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:37.549
then different results on the page.

101
00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:42.274
And remember, if you look at the page
source, 300 BTC, server side render,

102
00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:43.679
it's part of the html.

103
00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:44.433
It's a static content.
