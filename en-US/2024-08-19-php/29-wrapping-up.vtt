00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.410
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So, just a recap,
we are getting into the end.

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.170
This was just fundamentals of PHP.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.650
At this point, you can realize
there are much more to see.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.820
There are hundreds of functions there.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.663
Of course,
you won't remember all the functions, but

6
00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:16.187
there are lots to talk about.

7
00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:18.222
There are things that we haven't covered,

8
00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:20.533
traits that's something
new that we have in PHP.

9
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:26.610
Similar to make sense in other languages,
you have the ability to create namespaces.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.280
That it's not so cool as it sounds,
but yeah, you have it anyway.

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.473
And then a lot of libraries,
standard libraries,

12
00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:40.470
to do a lot of stuff that is part of that.

13
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.480
But I think that the whole point of this
course was to give you the basic idea.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.711
So now you can open a PHP file and
you can understand what's going on.

15
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:55.259
And also the design patterns of
server side rendering with PHP.

16
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:58.038
If you're going to use WordPress,
for example,

17
00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:01.160
maybe you won't be doing apps
like the ones that we did.

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.227
But you know how to
connect to a database now.

19
00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:08.127
You will probably get data,
render the data, do something with that.

20
00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:12.017
Remember that plugins for
WordPress or Joomla needs that.

21
00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:17.947
And now you may be ready to
check one of the frameworks.

22
00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:21.007
I mean, if you want to do Laravel,
CodeIgniter.

23
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:26.177
You have the basics of the language,
at least, to just start working on it.

24
00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:30.967
So today, we've covered what's PHP,
you know what it is.

25
00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:35.417
You know that it's not a server, and
also it's not creating a server, okay?

26
00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:41.008
She has a script that will be
executed by a URL, by a web server.

27
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:41.918
Why PHP?

28
00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.469
Well, this is an open question,
we don't have an answer, okay.

29
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.884
But we've seen a couple of options
of why PHP is still relevant for

30
00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:50.417
learning these days.

31
00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:54.318
From adding something
new to your curriculum,

32
00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:59.007
to finding a job on the topic
that is being demanded a lot.

33
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:03.251
Because there are not so
many new developers learning PHP.

34
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:07.377
To managing WordPress,
to work with Laravel, or

35
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:12.499
any of these frameworks to cover
most of the basic PHP syntax.

36
00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.174
As I mentioned,
there are more things to cover for

37
00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:20.125
an advanced training,
you can learn on how to pass a.

38
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:24.524
How to create weak reference values
like variables by reference and

39
00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:27.566
not by values, the same for arguments.

40
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:32.216
So there are other things to cover,
but we've covered the basics.

41
00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:35.302
We've seen there are super global
variables, just GET and POST,

42
00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:37.186
those are the ones that we've covered.

43
00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:42.022
SERVER we used, COOKIE, SESSION and
others, that in case you

44
00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:48.023
are doing server side development
with PHP might become useful.

45
00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:53.433
Saw OOP with PHP, again, not a big deal,
but we created the class, method,

46
00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:58.833
the constructor, we talk about
the destructor, properties and so on.

47
00:02:58.833 --> 00:02:59.907
Working with Data.

48
00:02:59.907 --> 00:03:05.017
We work with JSON, we work literally
with collections and with SQL3.

49
00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.737
Remember that working with MySQL is not so
different.

50
00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:15.257
If you already set up your MySQL server,
or Postgre, or whatever other database.

51
00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:19.227
It's just changing some pieces,
but the whole idea is the same.

52
00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:21.972
Then you can talk about performance and

53
00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:27.388
updating data that is just changing
the query with different query and so on.

54
00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:29.412
And then some debugging and

55
00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:35.309
advanced techniques at the end such as
these way to order load file for classes.

56
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:39.158
That will save your life in
every time you create a class,

57
00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:42.133
you don't need to create an include for
it.

58
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:45.903
That's just one example that you can use.

59
00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:48.896
Also, bar dump as a way to do debugging.

60
00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:52.176
And remember that using plugins for
VS Code, or

61
00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:56.850
if you're using PHP Storm, or
other IDs that are more PHP focused.

62
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.133
They typically have PHP
debugging included.

63
00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:04.797
With VS Code, you need to use one of
these extensions to use debugging and

64
00:04:04.797 --> 00:04:08.524
typically follow some
instructions on how to set it up.

65
00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:13.444
It's not something that
you get immediately.

66
00:04:13.444 --> 00:04:16.988
I'm talking about adding
breakpoints in VS Code and

67
00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:19.574
then executing line by line and so on.

68
00:04:19.574 --> 00:04:22.926
So, that needs It's a tag
integration with the engine, so

69
00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:26.258
that's why it's not kind
of available by default.

70
00:04:26.258 --> 00:04:28.469
Well, if you don't have any question,

71
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.618
I hope you can start working with PHP and
learn.

72
00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:36.529
And this is like a trigger to learn
more about the language, thank you.

73
00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.437
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Student: Thank you.

74
00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:43.502
&gt;&gt; Students: [APPLAUSE]
