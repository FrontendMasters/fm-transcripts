1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.344
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, so tools
that you need or we are going to use.

2
00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:08.219
VS Code with extension, VS Code by default
does not support PHP, so the first

3
00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.332
time you try to open a .php file, it will
tell you hey, you need some extension.

4
00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:17.844
So I will show you a lot of extensions and
there are a lot of extensions,

5
00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:19.690
some good ones and bad ones.

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.488
Now there is a pattern
in the VS Marketplace,

7
00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:27.644
where there are a lot of extensions that
are really cool, or they were really cool,

8
00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:32.847
but now they have a pro version, where
it helps you play with AI or whatever.

9
00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:37.107
And the problem is that they're getting
really annoyed because the free part,

10
00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:39.660
it's all the time saying, no, this is pro.

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.818
So you're typing code,
you see an underline, you say, okay,

12
00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:43.997
what's going on here?

13
00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:48.428
You hover, the underline says,
you have to pay for seeing the warning.

14
00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:54.742
I say, come on, don't show me the warning
or don't bother me with that, but anyway,

15
00:00:54.742 --> 00:01:00.753
PhpStorm was a classic IDE for PHP,
it's still there, it has a huge fan base.

16
00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:05.522
It's kind of an IDE only for
PHP developers, okay?

17
00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:08.825
If you're coming from other
platforms these days,

18
00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:13.480
you won't like PhpStorm or
anything different from VS Code, probably,

19
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.500
because you are used to
one way of doing things.

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.457
And, of course, PhpStorm is coming
from a previous RL of IDE, so

21
00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:24.345
it has its own unique ideas.

22
00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:29.978
NetBeans is being used a lot mostly
in the enterprise to do PHP,

23
00:01:29.978 --> 00:01:32.223
as well as with Eclipse.

24
00:01:32.223 --> 00:01:38.332
There is Eclipse PDT, PHP development
tools, where you can write with Eclipse.

25
00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:43.053
Yeah, again, if you're a web developer
If you're a JavaScript developer or

26
00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:47.394
a mobile app developer,
you probably will stay with your IDE.

27
00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:52.072
You don't wanna go into those IDEs,
and even there is a sense studio,

28
00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:56.846
I remember this one was huge at the time,
2005, things like that.

29
00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:01.790
This is not free, so it's an IDE you have
to pay, and mostly, it's for companies.

30
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.871
So, if you will work for a company, I know
that it's using CodeIgniter or things

31
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:09.967
like that, there is a good chance that
they will pay the license for Zend Studio.

32
00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:13.674
So then they're using Zend Studio,

33
00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:17.297
that is an IDE specifically
targeting PHP developers.

34
00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:23.588
Okay, so, another definition
before actually writing code that

35
00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:29.022
probably you have heard that it's
typically around PHP is the LAMP stack.

36
00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:34.533
So, it's a backend stack that
became popular with PHP,

37
00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:40.671
that means, we're going to use Linux,
Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

38
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:44.825
In production, maybe that doesn't mean
that your computer needs to be Linux,

39
00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:45.383
okay, but

40
00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:50.181
in production, the server will be Linux,
then Apache will be my web server.

41
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:54.649
MySQL or now MariaDB,
that is the open source version of MySQL,

42
00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.311
that is an Oracle-based
database these days.

43
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.178
They still keep the M as the first letter,
so

44
00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:03.899
we can still say MySQL and LAMP will work.

45
00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:08.458
Today, we are not going to work with LAMP,
we will just play with PHP, okay?

46
00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:13.547
But have in mind that that
was a pretty common stack of

47
00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:19.788
tools that we were all
the time using together, okay?

48
00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.328
That doesn't mean that today,
today, you can use the cloud.

49
00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:28.006
So then you can use cloud-based
providers to run your PHP scripts.

50
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:32.921
So then you can use any database,
you can use MongoDB if you want, wherever,

51
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:38.381
you don't need to follow that stack,
that was common in the early 2000s, okay?

52
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.436
Now, you can just use PHP as
your scripting language and

53
00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:46.669
then use wherever else you want for
the rest of the layers.

54
00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.952
Okay, so installing PHP, setting up PHP.

55
00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:54.615
So, you need to install
PHP in your computer and

56
00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:58.312
your server in case you wanna use PHP for
your server.

57
00:03:58.312 --> 00:04:02.966
So most of them,
if you are going to hire a server for

58
00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:06.212
PHP, it will be there, of course,

59
00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:12.509
you can use a classic hosting company,
or you can use the cloud.

60
00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:17.648
So Amazon, AWS, Azure,
even some smaller companies like Vercel

61
00:04:17.648 --> 00:04:22.622
that they have Next.js and
Cool stuff, they also support PHP.

62
00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:27.511
So maybe they don't support PHP in
the same way as in the 2000s, but

63
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:30.947
Percel, for example,
to keep you php.percel.

64
00:04:30.947 --> 00:04:38.079
So if you follow the step, for example,
you can even host PHP for free at Vercel.

65
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.200
Vercel, you can start with a free tire.

66
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.620
And they support PHP remote functions.

67
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.409
The thing is that the way to develop your
app is different because the whole Vercel

68
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.340
infrastructure is different
than a normal hosting.

69
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.744
But you can still, so
if you're doing Next.js,

70
00:04:55.744 --> 00:05:00.284
maybe you know Percel because they
are the team behind Next.js and

71
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:05.866
you can, of course, publish Next.js
apps or Nuxt.js apps as well.

72
00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:08.466
But also you can write PHP.

73
00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:14.946
Okay, so PHP is now integrated
with the modern pipeline also.

74
00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:17.401
It's not just all FTP-based web hostings,

75
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.817
where you need to upload
your files manually.

76
00:05:20.817 --> 00:05:23.999
You can still integrate
this with GitHub and

77
00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:28.306
all the rest of the modern ecosystem,
okay, makes sense?

78
00:05:28.306 --> 00:05:32.776
So, then, it's available for
different operating systems and

79
00:05:32.776 --> 00:05:34.492
installation methods.

80
00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:38.362
So, remember I mentioned when we started,
you can go to php.net and

81
00:05:38.362 --> 00:05:42.702
download if you want, but actually,
that download link is more suitable for

82
00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:45.326
production, not for development purposes.

83
00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:50.512
So that manual download, I mean, you can
do that, if you are comfortable with

84
00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:55.795
working, you can even download the source
code and build PHP yourself, okay?

85
00:05:55.795 --> 00:06:00.926
It's possible, but as developers,
mostly if you're a web developer,

86
00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:05.476
you probably want a package manager,
on the Mac, you have brew,

87
00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:09.614
on Linux, you have several
options available there, so,

88
00:06:09.614 --> 00:06:14.032
well, you can quickly install it and
set it up without hassle.

89
00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:18.934
So if you're on a Mac,
you just open a terminal, for example,

90
00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:22.740
and you say, brew,
install PHP, that's all.

91
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.760
And then you wait, okay?

92
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.747
It will download everything, and
after that, so after you do that,

93
00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:33.245
you can run PHP and see if something
happens, and you say, nothing happens.

94
00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:35.011
But actually, there is something.

95
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:38.829
So it's actually the premise,
this is also a common line, but

96
00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:44.347
I didn't get any error, so that's good,
but if you say, php -v, I get a version.

97
00:06:44.347 --> 00:06:48.247
So that means that my
PHP installation worked.

98
00:06:48.247 --> 00:06:52.669
For Windows, if you're on Windows,
you can also do something like that, but

99
00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.607
it takes more steps, to be honest.

100
00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:56.941
It's better to install,

101
00:06:56.941 --> 00:07:01.264
I think it's even the version that is
recommended here in the documentation.

102
00:07:01.264 --> 00:07:06.563
As far as I remember, so if you go to
English Manual, Installation on Windows,

103
00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:10.915
well, Install Requirements,
Recommended Configuration, so

104
00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:16.484
you have all the step-by-step, here,
yeah, I was remembering correctly.

105
00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:19.724
The first one that is
recommended is XAMPP.

106
00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:23.015
Actually, I used XAMPP for maybe a decade.

107
00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:28.311
I'm talking from 2008 to 2018 and
things like that.

108
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:31.152
So when I was setting up my new computer,

109
00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:35.592
my first step after the operating
system was to install XAMPP.

110
00:07:35.592 --> 00:07:38.393
It was part of my process all the time.

111
00:07:38.393 --> 00:07:40.255
So it was, I need XAMPP.

112
00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:41.302
What's XAMPP?

113
00:07:41.302 --> 00:07:46.794
XAMPP is a tool to
install the whole stack.

114
00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:52.361
So Apache, now MariaDB, before it was
MySQL, now it's MariaDB, PHP, and Perl.

115
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:56.645
So, on Windows,
it's also available for Mac and

116
00:07:56.645 --> 00:08:00.322
Linux if you want, you can also use XAMPP.

117
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:05.831
As a quick and
simple way to get PHP up and running.

118
00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:09.211
You will also get other things up and
running that I'm not sure if you want.

119
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:13.611
We are not going to use the other things
this day, we're not want to use Apache,

120
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:17.223
we are not going to use MarieiDB or
Perl or whatever, but anyway,

121
00:08:17.223 --> 00:08:19.741
you will get PHP as one, okay?

122
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:24.476
So, my recommendation is to Windows,
try XAMPP.

123
00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:28.637
If you are on Mac or Linux,
it's better to just download PHP with one

124
00:08:28.637 --> 00:08:33.376
of the package manager, brew, or
the other one you see on the page.

125
00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:35.276
Or if you want,
you can also download XAMPP.

126
00:08:36.306 --> 00:08:41.698
One of the problems on the Mac, at least,
is that the XAMPP file that you download,

127
00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:47.031
it has an installer, but the installer is
not signed using an Apple certificate.

128
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:50.118
So if you have a modern MacOS,
it will say, no, no,

129
00:08:50.118 --> 00:08:54.966
I'm not going to install this because I
cannot verify the developer identity, so

130
00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:56.882
then you need to go to security.

131
00:08:56.882 --> 00:09:00.256
If you are a Mac user, you know this, but

132
00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:05.723
you need to go to security and
enable that and you will be careful.

133
00:09:05.723 --> 00:09:10.329
You can have some insecure code and okay.

134
00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:15.825
And also, if you like it,
you can install PHP through Docker.

135
00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:18.973
You have also the instructions
on the PHP website.

136
00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:21.459
So, it's modernized in that way, so

137
00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:26.679
you can also install it through Docker or,
well, use a LAMP stack installer.

138
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:31.322
So, typically, we need a server,
and servers that were

139
00:09:31.322 --> 00:09:36.372
the most common ones are Apache,
Nginx, Lightspeed, IIS.

140
00:09:36.372 --> 00:09:41.137
And today, actually,
every cloud-based, not every,

141
00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:45.515
but most cloud-based provider
will offer you a way to

142
00:09:45.515 --> 00:09:49.553
execute PHP scripts from an HTTP request.

143
00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:53.444
Okay, but have in mind that
PHP is not responsible for

144
00:09:53.444 --> 00:09:58.588
creating the server, it's responsible for
receiving the request.

145
00:09:58.588 --> 00:10:03.835
Doing something and makes the response,
but it's not the server itself.
