WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.337
PHP was actually created
by Rasmus Lerdorf,

2
00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:08.200
he was a web designer at the time in 1993.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.340
So, he was making his own website.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.336
That's the beginning of the web, and

5
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:19.021
he created a set of tools for
his webpage initially for him.

6
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.908
Like some tools for him.

7
00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:27.756
Then he published them as something
known as Personal Homepage Tools,

8
00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:29.568
PHP tools, okay?

9
00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:33.388
He said, well, maybe someone else can
use this because it, it's useful.

10
00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:39.808
So he released that to the public,
and PHP tools became just PHP.

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.800
So, initially it was personal homepage,
okay?

12
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.340
But now they changed the definition.

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.950
I'm not sure if you know what
PHP stands for these days.

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.847
No, no one?

15
00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:58.764
So, PHP is not personal homepage anymore,
PHP is this.

16
00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:02.863
So the H is hypertext,
like HTML, this is preprocessor.

17
00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:07.609
Some people say it's processor,

18
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:13.594
some people say it's preprocessor,
it doesn't matter.

19
00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:17.018
And the P is actually for PHP.

20
00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:17.931
&gt;&gt; Student: [LAUGH].

21
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:21.022
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
it's a recursive name.

22
00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:24.802
Okay, so
it's PHP hypertext preprocessor, okay?

23
00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:25.590
It's just that.

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.229
So again,
originally was personal homepage, but

25
00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.791
now it's kind of doesn't make any sense,
okay?

26
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.805
So that's why they changed the idea.

27
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:39.187
Okay, but actually at it wasn't yet

28
00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:43.106
something famous that
people were actually using.

29
00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:49.150
He open-sourced this language and
it's inspired by Perl, C,

30
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.166
Java, JavaScript and
many other things as well.

31
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:58.070
Something important here,
Rasmus at that time was not

32
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.237
a developer so
he was not a programmer, okay?

33
00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:07.142
ANd the idea of PHP, so
these tools, was not to target

34
00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:12.669
developers, was not to be
a programming language.

35
00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:19.198
It was just a set of tools for
web designers to make quick scripts so

36
00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:23.473
we they can quickly add
some interaction or

37
00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:27.905
some dynamic content creation for HTML.

38
00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:29.025
That was the idea, okay?

39
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:35.515
And that's kind of the reason
why PHP is how it is.

40
00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:39.395
I'm not sure if you have critics on PHP,
as a language, there are a lot.

41
00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:44.168
There are a lot of haters, okay,
in the developer community.

42
00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:49.526
And typically one of the arguments
is that the language

43
00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:54.313
is not consistent internally,
and it's true.

44
00:02:54.313 --> 00:02:58.580
But the reason is because it wasn't
intended to be a programming language.

45
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.519
Then it grabbed a lot so it was growing
and growing and growing and growing and

46
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.412
that's why you will see that the the way
to do things sometimes is not consistent.

47
00:03:09.412 --> 00:03:13.764
I know sometimes a function has I mean
just to give you a quick idea of what I'm

48
00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:14.924
a very simple idea.

49
00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:18.498
So you have some functions that is for
example is null,

50
00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.683
okay there is a function is null.

51
00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.427
But there is another
one that is called set.

52
00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:28.737
One has underscore,
the other one doesn't have an underscore.

53
00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:32.971
It's just a very simple example of
a lot of things that you will see in

54
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:34.357
PHP like this.

55
00:03:34.357 --> 00:03:39.045
That lack of consistency is annoying
a lot of developers coming from

56
00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:43.991
other languages that are more classic,
more following rules, okay?

57
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.831
And PHP is not following any rule,
actually.

58
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:52.111
So, it's inspired by many languages.

59
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:53.686
So, if you're coming from JavaScript,

60
00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:56.141
you will see some things that
it looks like JavaScript.

61
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.991
There are a lot of things that
are coming from Java and C++ even.

62
00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:04.065
Mostly, they all are OOP part,
the you create classes,

63
00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:06.664
how you define attributes and methods.

64
00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:10.484
It's very similar to Java, so
it's actually copying the Java idea.

65
00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.638
And actually it was the language
used by Mark Zuckerberg to

66
00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:19.147
create the Facebook that was
the first name of facebook.com.

67
00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:24.278
And this is just something that
I will borrow from Rasmus.

68
00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:28.488
So we were speakers, I think two events.

69
00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:31.908
So we both were speakers
at the same events.

70
00:04:31.908 --> 00:04:37.494
I'm not sure in which one he
said this in one of his speech,

71
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:44.011
he actually look into the original
Mark Zuckerberg Facebook code.

72
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:50.053
He actually saw that code, and
he said it was really crappy,

73
00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:53.615
it was the worst code written ever.

74
00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:59.063
But he wasn't actually saying
this as a negative thing,

75
00:04:59.063 --> 00:05:06.568
actually, he was proud that that crappy
code led into a billionaire company.

76
00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:15.278
And actually, I think that's a good
definition of the power of PHP.

77
00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:19.944
Yeah, you can be a crappy developer and
still get things up and

78
00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.281
running, and working.

79
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.911
And that's why you have
a lot of haters as well.

80
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:27.725
History, not because
the history is important,

81
00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:30.661
but I wanna just talk about
some milestones on PHP.

82
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:36.371
PHP 3 was the first one that was
actually used by a lot of people.

83
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:40.901
Actually, that was the first one I used.

84
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:45.460
Okay, when I checked Into my backup code
in the code base that I have in my backup,

85
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.633
my first PHP script is
actually on that version.

86
00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:51.913
PHP 3, it was actually a year after 1999.

87
00:05:51.913 --> 00:05:58.953
But I think the one that got
everyone into PHP was PHP 4, okay?

88
00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.134
Something interesting In about that.

89
00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:05.376
That's 24 years ago, okay?

90
00:06:05.376 --> 00:06:09.198
But now,
if I'm going to the PHP website again,

91
00:06:09.198 --> 00:06:14.336
you can go over the website all
the history, okay, on versions.

92
00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:21.497
Let me see if I can find this
directly version history,

93
00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:26.327
so
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Version

94
00:06:26.327 --> 00:06:29.255
4 is still not deprecated.

95
00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:32.130
The only one that is deprecated is PHP 3.

96
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.790
So you can see support for
3 is discontinued.

97
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.530
Okay, thank you for telling me that.

98
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.944
But that's not for 4.

99
00:06:44.184 --> 00:06:48.599
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Version 4 is
still being maintained for bug fixes,

100
00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:54.433
security fixes, it's still active,
which is incredible, okay?

101
00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:58.762
Compare that with any other platform,
okay, that's not the case.

102
00:06:58.762 --> 00:07:01.769
Only three is actually discontinued.

103
00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:05.428
Of course, we are not going to use PHP 4,
but of course,

104
00:07:05.428 --> 00:07:10.259
the problem is that there are a lot of
websites out there still using PHP 4.

105
00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.789
So PHP 5 was actually a big, a big shift.

106
00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.049
I remember that moment.

107
00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:21.290
I remember magazine
covers talking about that

108
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.213
because PHP 5 was not compatible with 4.

109
00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:27.743
So you had to change your code.

110
00:07:27.743 --> 00:07:31.692
Actually, because 4 has had
a lot of security issues that

111
00:07:31.692 --> 00:07:36.213
I will mention some later, so
they had to change some things.

112
00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:42.508
Remember, it wasn't originally
organized as a programming language.

113
00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:46.580
They were just adding features there,
like a bag of features, and yeah,

114
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.375
at some moments, they realized, hey, this
has security issues, we have problems,

115
00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.658
and so on.

116
00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:59.096
Then, version 6 never existed, and they
had some fights there, it doesn't matter,

117
00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:04.490
and 10 years have passed until version 7,
and now we are in version 8,

118
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:10.271
that was released a couple of years ago,
actually during the pandemic.

119
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:16.646
And so we will remember that
as the pandemic PHP, PPHP.

120
00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:22.847
So, one of the things is
that PHP 8 removed a lot of

121
00:08:22.847 --> 00:08:28.474
crappy syntax that were historical syntax.

122
00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:34.831
So it's trying to get into a track
where it's a better language.

123
00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:36.091
Okay, so PHP 8.

124
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:41.738
So if you have developers or colleagues
that are making fun of the syntax of PHP,

125
00:08:41.738 --> 00:08:46.710
PHP or things like that, where PHP 8
has removed a lot of stuff that was

126
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:52.044
possible before that was making a lot
of noise in the developer community.

127
00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:57.234
So it's getting there, okay, it's
trying to be a better primary language.

128
00:08:57.234 --> 00:08:58.718
So, the mascot.

129
00:08:58.718 --> 00:09:02.656
The mascot, it's the elephant, okay?

130
00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:06.886
The elephant is this one,
I have one here, okay?

131
00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:08.616
So the elephant is the mascot.

132
00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:12.266
I mean, it's not important, but
it has its own history as well.

133
00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:18.225
There are collectors, and actually I think
that the most expensive one of these

134
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:22.402
elephants was sold as $10,000,
something like that.

135
00:09:22.402 --> 00:09:27.612
But anyway, it's actually inspired in PHP.

136
00:09:27.612 --> 00:09:33.902
So if you look at the PHP capital case,
so open your imagination.

137
00:09:33.902 --> 00:09:37.053
That looked like the face of the elephant,
okay?

138
00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:40.243
So this is the elephant, this is the P.

139
00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:44.594
Okay, we have a P here, okay,
and then that's the body and

140
00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:47.134
that's the tail of the elephant.

141
00:09:47.134 --> 00:09:50.906
So actually, the designer look
at the the letters and say,

142
00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:53.254
that looks like an elephant, okay?

143
00:09:53.254 --> 00:09:55.644
And he designing the elephant and

144
00:09:55.644 --> 00:09:59.920
named that elephant as ElePHPant
with the PHP inside that.

145
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.353
Anyway, there is even an official
website where you can buy

146
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:07.991
elephants in case you want, okay?

147
00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:14.851
But it's interesting because that
was in the 90s, right, not now.

148
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:17.971
And now we have our own idea
of why it's an elephant.

149
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:23.703
Because yeah, it's an old language,
it's heavy, I mean, it's an elephant.

150
00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:27.888
And it has its presence in the animal
world, but it's not because of that,

151
00:10:27.888 --> 00:10:31.752
it was just because someone thought
that PHP looks like an elephant.
