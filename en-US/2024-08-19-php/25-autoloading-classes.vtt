00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.355
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano: By the way, will it work?

2
00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.601
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano: What
your brain compiler says.

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.764
I mean, we may have type or something, I
don't know, but there is one missing step.

4
00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:15.036
It's not gonna work.

5
00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:16.299
&gt;&gt; Student: Including the object.

6
00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.956
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano: Including DV.

7
00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:20.230
So you cannot do this.

8
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.352
I cannot just go and

9
00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:28.433
use the class automatically.

10
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.650
So we know how to solve the problem,
right?

11
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.008
We've seen how to solve the problem.

12
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.369
Maybe, but I wanna show you, actually,

13
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:40.896
I will do it at the end,
typically, but we can do it now.

14
00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:42.809
There is another way.

15
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.797
So instead of including the class
manually or including a file that

16
00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:52.441
will include all the classes,
we can do something like this.

17
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:58.093
I can include a class.php or
classes.php, okay?

18
00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:04.266
I'm going to create a new file
with the name classes.php, okay?

19
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:11.415
I will show you some of the advanced
ideas that we have these days in PHP.

20
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:16.255
So in this, I want to create that file so

21
00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:21.106
classes, save this as classes.php.

22
00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:21.898
HP, no.

23
00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:23.345
Hewlett-Packard, no.

24
00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:24.098
Php.

25
00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:25.062
There we are.

26
00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.470
So, php, I'll need to close it.

27
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.215
So you know that I can go and

28
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:38.160
include classes DB.php, okay?

29
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.302
But I don't wanna do that,

30
00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:44.688
because later in my project I
will have a lot of classes.

31
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:48.172
I don't wanna remember every
time I create a class,

32
00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:51.507
I don't wanna remember to go and
add one include.

33
00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:58.701
So I'm going to use something
known as Auto Load.

34
00:01:58.701 --> 00:01:59.824
That sounds good.

35
00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:01.559
So what's the idea?

36
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:06.332
So there is a function in php that it's

37
00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:10.966
called spl_autoload_register.

38
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:16.459
Let's go and try to find first
the documentation for it.

39
00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.798
There we are.

40
00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:20.961
Spl auto register.

41
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:24.877
It will register the given function as
an auto load implementation and say,

42
00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.478
Okay, what's an order load?

43
00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:30.254
Okay, so it's a callable by the way.

44
00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:35.598
When you see a type with the question
mark at the beginning as a prefix,

45
00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:40.682
it means it's optional, so
it means it might not be there, okay?

46
00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:43.943
So here it's explaining what it's doing,
blah, blah, blah.

47
00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:49.669
So what's the deal with
this spl_autoload_register?

48
00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.621
We're going to register a function and
something that we haven't seen yet,

49
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:59.664
so it's a good opportunity to see that
we can create also lambda expressions.

50
00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:05.441
And that means that we can pass anonymous
functions in PHP as in JavaScript.

51
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.861
So instead of creating a function
outside and just pass the function

52
00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:16.763
as an argument as in JavaScript,
I can create a function on the fly in PHP.

53
00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:21.065
In fact, it's if I don't tell you,
this is a PHP file,

54
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:24.282
you may think this is JavaScript, okay?

55
00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.200
Also we have arrow functions if you want,
okay?

56
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.755
So we also have arrow functions
that look pretty similar to that,

57
00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:38.418
but it's typically common for
expressions that fits in one line.

58
00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:44.593
So this function will receive
a class name as an argument.

59
00:03:44.593 --> 00:03:48.948
Every time you call new,
with the name of a class,

60
00:03:48.948 --> 00:03:53.513
if that class does not exist
in the current context,

61
00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:57.974
it will execute this function saying,
hey, hey,

62
00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:01.840
I'm trying to create
an object of the AAAA.

63
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.270
Do you know what to do?

64
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.836
Because I don't.

65
00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:06.943
Does it make sense?

66
00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:11.975
So, and
then if we are following the pattern

67
00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:17.959
of naming the classes with
the same name as the file,

68
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.495
we can match that situation and

69
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:25.721
we can call include or include ones.

70
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:26.943
In this case of what?

71
00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:32.063
Of classes/.class_name.

72
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.735
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano: Make sense?

73
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.481
Anything else?

74
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:45.089
Do we need to add anything
else here to make it work?

75
00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:50.857
In the class name, for example,
if I say new DB, class name will be DB.

76
00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.291
So it will try to load classes /DB.

77
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:56.642
I think there is one more thing missing.

78
00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:57.497
&gt;&gt; Student: .php?

79
00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.410
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano: .php.

80
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.552
Will it work like that?

81
00:05:00.552 --> 00:05:01.479
Well, we can try.

82
00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:11.120
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano: If you don't
like how that looks like,

83
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.007
if you wanna be more like this,

84
00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:19.245
you can remember use.as well
to concatenate strings.

85
00:05:19.245 --> 00:05:22.644
In that case, you can use single quotes.

86
00:05:22.644 --> 00:05:28.660
I think if you wanna see that in
a better way, in a cleaner way.

87
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.902
So before, a few years ago,

88
00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:36.241
this was done with a different way
that was called a magic function.

89
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:38.749
And there are a lot of
magic functions in PHP,

90
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.126
these functions that are being executed.

91
00:05:41.126 --> 00:05:43.581
Okay, if I don't know what to do,

92
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:48.599
let's see if the magic function can
help something like that, okay?

93
00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.441
For example,
there is a magic function for classes.

94
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:55.183
So if you are accessing a property,
for example,

95
00:05:55.183 --> 00:06:00.083
I create DB here and I am accessing
a property that does not exist,

96
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:05.541
because I don't have an A property,
it can execute the magic function.

97
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.841
If I set the magic function,
then we receive, hey,

98
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.066
someone is trying to set
the value of an A property.

99
00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.538
You wanna do something with that?

100
00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:19.412
And then you can create the function and
you receive the property name and

101
00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.597
the value and you do whatever you want.

102
00:06:22.597 --> 00:06:26.513
Okay, so that's why it's a really
flexible language, PHP, okay?

103
00:06:26.513 --> 00:06:32.327
Well, if that works, that means
that because this file, indexphp,

104
00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:37.552
is including classes PHP,
when I'm creating a new database,

105
00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:42.998
it should go through that function and
it should include my file.
