00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.654
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I will open
a folder that you already have that's kind

2
00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:07.323
of empty, there is only one file there,
crypto masters.

3
00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.964
So git, no, I don't want it,

4
00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:14.551
okay I have just a URL here
that we will use in a second.

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:20.392
So we are going to make our first
server side rendering webpage with PHP,

6
00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:23.956
we're going to create a crypto converter.

7
00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:29.031
So I well, I have two bitcoins, I wanna
know how many US dollars do I have, okay?

8
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:31.840
Something like that, not a big deal, but

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.220
we will learn at least some
ideas in the meantime.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.691
And that's the URL that
we are going to use, so

11
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:41.811
it's an open free API available, okay?

12
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:46.828
We will get into that later, so
first I'm in the folder, the next step is

13
00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:52.945
to open the server, so I'm going to open a
terminal here, so terminal, new Terminal.

14
00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:56.505
And it's always the same thing,

15
00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:01.475
it's php -S localhost on any number, okay?

16
00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:06.114
4000, if you like, 4000,
we can stay with 4000, okay?

17
00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:10.965
So, we create index php first,
and again it's a php, but

18
00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:16.023
actually what I want is html,
and I can still use Emmet here.

19
00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:21.919
Again, Emmet is this quick thing to create
an html, but it can be even, I mean,

20
00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:28.095
if you like it, it's fine, if not, we can
just make it even better just with this.

21
00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:33.714
This is Crypto Masters, and then H1,

22
00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:39.517
you will add CSS later to make it better.

23
00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:44.027
We won't care in this particular
example about CSS, by the way,

24
00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.507
is that a valid HTML?

25
00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:50.391
it is valid HTML code, I don't need
the HTML tag, I don't need the body tag,

26
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.340
the head tag,
they are completely optional.

27
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.570
I will just keep it like that so

28
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.855
we can keep it shorter if you
can't leave with that code,

29
00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:05.868
just use if the full HTML, but this is
perfectly W3C valid HTML5 code, okay?

30
00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:10.784
The body is optional and
everything else is optional in actually,

31
00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:15.452
but I know that it hurts, but so
we can just focus on important.

32
00:02:15.452 --> 00:02:21.039
So and everything will fit in one screen
which is a good idea, what's the idea?

33
00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:26.598
I want to form, so
I want to say to the user something like,

34
00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:32.392
hey, enter the amount of crypto,
so I want to a form, okay?

35
00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:37.375
I'm going to write a semantic
form from HTML, so it's a form,

36
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:40.760
we have a label, that will say amount, but

37
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.235
maybe I don't need the paragraph,
I can just use this with an input.

38
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.217
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, and
then I will use a label with crypto,

39
00:02:54.217 --> 00:03:00.592
with a select,
with a couple of options for crypto.

40
00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:05.965
So, you can make have Bitcoin,
let's start with two Bitcoin or

41
00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:10.056
ether, that's the crypto on Ethereum,
okay?

42
00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:14.006
The API that we will use accept both AI,
it has more Solana and

43
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:15.564
other cryptos, okay?

44
00:03:15.564 --> 00:03:18.869
But you can add more later,
this is playing HTML,

45
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:24.786
very basic HTML from again from the 90s,
it works today also, it's validated today.

46
00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:29.141
For the labels you actually need
to apply the four attribute,

47
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.082
I'm not sure if you know this,
it's for accessibility purposes, so

48
00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:38.458
this can be amount, so
I need the input to have its own amount.

49
00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:42.829
And in this case,
this is gonna be the crypto id crypto,

50
00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.540
we are not going to write JavaScript, we
are not going to do client-side rendering.

51
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.789
We're going to do server-side rendering so
we're going to see how that works.

52
00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.012
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Do you
have any question on the HML?

53
00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:04.893
Probably I will add some small CSS shop,
but,

54
00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:09.273
I mean, it's not necessary, but also,

55
00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:13.028
I will need an input type submit, so

56
00:04:13.028 --> 00:04:18.800
it will submit the form,
convert, things like that.

57
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.871
The slide in, to input.

58
00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.168
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Actually,
let's work with the value,

59
00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:32.973
because I'm not using it, but I can use
a button if you don't like input, type,

60
00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:35.467
method, I can use a button if you prefer.

61
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:44.359
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Both are exactly
the same, so both are by the input or

62
00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:47.958
button can work,
type submit will actually,

63
00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.783
when you press on that button,
will submit the current form.

64
00:04:52.783 --> 00:04:57.232
And I don't know why my form disappear, so

65
00:04:57.232 --> 00:05:01.317
my first should look like this, okay?

66
00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:02.936
Do we have any PHP here?

67
00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.568
No, not yet at least.

68
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.363
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let me see that
in action to see how it looks like, so

69
00:05:12.363 --> 00:05:16.640
local host 4000, it looks like new,
I mean, it's not so bad, right?

70
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.954
It's not so bad, so the idea is that
I want to type something here, and

71
00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:29.714
I wanna click Convert, and somehow,
I want to see the conversion, okay?

72
00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:32.758
So, we're going to see how this works, and

73
00:05:32.758 --> 00:05:36.968
that will let us to introduce
super global variables in PHP.
