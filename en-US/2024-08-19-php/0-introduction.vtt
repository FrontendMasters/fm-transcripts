00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.165
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Welcome
to PHP Fundamentals,

2
00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:09.290
we will have a full day to talk
about this new language, okay?

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.640
For all language, okay, we'll see.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.710
So we'll talk about PHP.

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.850
Let me first introduce myself.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.763
My name is Maximiliano Firtman,
I can go by Max or Maxi it's up to you.

7
00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:26.504
My website, third.dev, I'm typically
third on a lot of social networks, or

8
00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:27.713
if not, third.

9
00:00:27.713 --> 00:00:31.196
So I'm from Argentina,
I live in Buenos Aires, and

10
00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:34.293
I've been a mobile web developer for
a while.

11
00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:37.293
I have started as a web developer in 1996,
okay?

12
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.786
So HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

13
00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:45.764
And I think my first year of,
let's say, backend developer,

14
00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:48.767
we were not actually
talking about frontend and

15
00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:53.716
backend at the time we were just
doing everything we were webmasters.

16
00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:56.768
That was a term that we used at
the time we were just doing website,

17
00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:58.856
now it's full stack developer.

18
00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:00.421
But we were just doing everything.

19
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.551
My first year, I was actually ASP team.

20
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:08.945
ASP was actually, at that time,
we were using BBScript,

21
00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:11.831
was a Microsoft alternative to PHP.

22
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:17.501
But then I have started
using PHP actually in 1999.

23
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.963
So yesterday I went to my
backup of all my projects, and

24
00:01:20.963 --> 00:01:23.841
I capture my first dot PHP file.

25
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:29.971
It was actually from 1999, so
a lot of time actually has passed.

26
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:32.810
Actually, we will talk about today,
about PHP 8,

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.831
that's the version that we have
these days, the latest version.

28
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.640
And that file was actually dot PHP 3,
the first version,

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.179
the first version that I
have started using PHP 3.

30
00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.459
So I've done more than 150 web apps,
not all of them were in PHP.

31
00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:55.565
So of course, after that, I started doing
other or using other backend languages,

32
00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:59.869
but I still maintain some
websites that are written in PHP.

33
00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:05.970
So I'm also an author, so I author
13 books, also a lot of courses on

34
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.533
many topics, typically on web development,
most of the time,

35
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:16.446
around frontend, around mobile app
development and web performance.

36
00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.744
And you can see there
are a lot of books and

37
00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:23.539
covers mostly you will
find some words there.

38
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:28.699
You pick some words, mobile, web,
performance, that kind of stuff.

39
00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.516
The latest book that I
author is Learn PWA,

40
00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:35.549
that was published by Google at web.dev,
and it's free.

41
00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.416
It's available for
free on web.dev, Learn PWA.

42
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:46.099
At Frontend Masters, also you will find a
lot of content that I author on Frontend,

43
00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.458
progressive web apps, vanilla JavaScript,
APIs, different kind of APIs,

44
00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:57.406
mobile app courses, Kotlin, Swift, Dart
with Flutter, and some backend courses.

45
00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.773
This is kind of part of that group.

46
00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.443
I also have another one on go.

47
00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:05.273
So, what we're going to cover today?

48
00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:08.883
So, we will talk about,
what's PHP, why PHP?

49
00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:12.133
I think that's the first question
that most people is doing these days.

50
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:13.123
So, why?

51
00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:15.207
We will see why, the PHP syntax,

52
00:03:15.207 --> 00:03:19.313
we're going to start completely
from scratch, which with PHP.

53
00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:23.207
We will talk about things
like super global variables.

54
00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:27.147
So those are things that are kind of new,
no matter which language you coming from.

55
00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:30.437
We will talk about different,
it's a different paradigm.

56
00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:35.208
I mean, it's not a new paradigm because
it's been for 30 years, actually, but

57
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:39.171
it's new for most of you,
it depends on where you're coming from.

58
00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:43.235
So if you're doing JavaScript,
if you're doing Java, Python,

59
00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:49.511
no matter where you're coming from, we'll
talk about, okay, what's the PHP paradigm?

60
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:55.151
OOP, so Object Oriented Programming
with PHP, and working with data.

61
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.184
So we are going to start with the basics.

62
00:03:59.184 --> 00:04:03.914
Seeing the syntax, the differences,
the life cycle of a PHP script.

63
00:04:03.914 --> 00:04:07.776
And then we will make a couple of
little projects, small projects,

64
00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:11.096
like we will directly live code
in some small projects, so

65
00:04:11.096 --> 00:04:14.374
you will actually get that and
working with data.

66
00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:17.002
In that case,
we will use a small database,

67
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.082
so we will see how to
use the JSON databases.

68
00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:24.682
How to make an API,
how to work with that, okay?

69
00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:29.372
And before talking about some advanced
techniques, debugging and best practices.

70
00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:33.642
And of course, after that, there will
be much more to go over on PHP, but

71
00:04:33.642 --> 00:04:37.852
you will get all the fundamentals,
the prerequisites for the course.

72
00:04:37.852 --> 00:04:40.299
So what do you need to know?

73
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:43.553
It's just priming basic
experience in any language, okay,

74
00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:47.539
it's fine if you know JavaScript
it's fine, if you know C it's okay.

75
00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.189
Some OOP concept will be good.

76
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.695
I'm not going to explain what a class is,
what a super class is,

77
00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:59.785
I will understand that you know those
concepts if not you can get them from

78
00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:04.895
other courses, some HTML,
basic background will be good as well.

79
00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:09.035
We're not going to write a lot of HTML,
but just some basic ones, and we will see,

80
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:12.455
why are we talking about HTML when
we're talking about PHP as well?

81
00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:17.229
Because it doesn't sound initially like
something that has a relationship with in

82
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.127
terms of what do you need to
install in your computer?

83
00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:24.787
The only thing that we will use
today is a PHP interpreter.

84
00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:28.957
It has what is not downloading PHP.

85
00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:30.818
Later I will explain how to do that,

86
00:05:30.818 --> 00:05:34.537
what's the best practice to do
that on every operating system?

87
00:05:34.537 --> 00:05:36.627
It's free, it's open source.

88
00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:37.967
The website is php.net.

89
00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:41.156
Then we will use a browser,
any browser will work.

90
00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:45.875
And you have a browser and a code editor,
I'm going to use a BS code, but

91
00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:51.826
you can use any other editor, or
whatever you wanna use, it's fine, okay?

92
00:05:51.826 --> 00:05:53.312
We don't need anything else.
