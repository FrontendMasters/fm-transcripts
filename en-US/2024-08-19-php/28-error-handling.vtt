00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.428
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Again, it's not
the most performant one, there are a lot

2
00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:10.543
of work to do, now we are on the details,
we are going to the database again and

3
00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:15.560
bringing them all, and
maybe we should bring only the one I want.

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.688
I should check for errors, what
happens if I'm passing an index, well,

5
00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:26.666
that doesn't exist, for example, it's in
the URL now, so I can change the number.

6
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.097
Yeah, okay, well it's not working, so

7
00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:35.109
what we should be doing here,
how to deal with these errors?

8
00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.470
And that leads to the final topic
that I have to talk to you,

9
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.881
it's about error management.

10
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.551
Okay, so how to deal with error in PHP?

11
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:52.911
Errors in PHP are complex because there
are so many ways to treat errors, and

12
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:58.286
it depends on what are you using,
it's one way or the other, okay?

13
00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:03.327
So let me start saying that on some
situations, you can use try catch,

14
00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:07.170
so for example, I can try,
I mean the details, yes,

15
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.167
if you're coming from other languages,
you probably know try catch.

16
00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:18.658
So I can try to execute these two lines,
and I will catch in this,

17
00:01:18.658 --> 00:01:25.742
maybe, but it doesn't work like that,
try catch needs something else.

18
00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:30.212
It needs a type, say,
what type, why is that?

19
00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:32.245
Because it's following Java pattern,

20
00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:35.588
not sure how many of you have played
with Java or C sharp as well, but

21
00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:38.712
not JavaScript, it's like you
can have more than one catch.

22
00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:45.419
So it's possible to have more than one
catch, and actually, you will catch

23
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:50.723
different exceptions, so, you have to put
there which exception do you wanna catch.

24
00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:53.243
Exception is actually the base class, so

25
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:57.704
that means you are trapping all
the possible exceptions, okay?

26
00:01:57.704 --> 00:02:03.275
And by the way, here comes the part
where it start doing weird things,

27
00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:07.257
so let's say you wanna echo here,
error, okay?

28
00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:12.115
So you say, okay, error,
so it's not working,

29
00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:15.027
or you can just put HTML here.

30
00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:19.007
Okay, so I refresh, and
am I seeing the error?

31
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.176
No, why is that?

32
00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:24.006
There may be many cases
of what's going on here,

33
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.888
one is that this is not an exception,
it's another kind of error.

34
00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:31.406
As I mentioned not everything can
be trapped with an exception,

35
00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:34.936
which is a problem, because there
are many ways to trap errors.

36
00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:42.979
So errors in JavaScript can be tricky,
to be honest, so it's not really simple,

37
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:48.837
and sometimes, I think that it happened
to some of you in the chat, sometimes you

38
00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:54.211
don't see the errors, because if you look,
these errors are warnings.

39
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:57.541
Okay, because they are warnings,

40
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:02.869
you may have warnings disabled
in your current project.

41
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:06.906
To solve the problem, there are two
ways you can go to your document,

42
00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:09.969
your configuration,
PHP file and change that, but

43
00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.449
sometimes you don't have
permission to that.

44
00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:21.299
So the other thing that you can do is you
can request all errors to be reported, and

45
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.620
you do that with these lines,
I have been using this for a while.

46
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.050
You say, ini_set.

47
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.210
What is ini?

48
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.934
It's a file, PHP.ini, i and
i is the configuration file,

49
00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:41.899
so you can set something from here and
you say, ("display_errors", 1),

50
00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.692
which means, yeah, I wanna see the errors.

51
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:50.221
You also change errors, you also change
display startup errors just in case,

52
00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:55.026
it's another array of errors and
you say, yeah, also.

53
00:03:55.026 --> 00:04:00.058
Also you're going to
execute error reporting and

54
00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:04.064
you will change that to E_All.

55
00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:05.164
E_All, what is that?

56
00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:09.936
Well, it's a list of constants
starting with E underscore, and

57
00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:12.934
you can see all the others we have.

58
00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:17.878
So I wanna see all the core errors,
only warnings, and

59
00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:22.285
actually you can say,
I wanna see warnings, and

60
00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:26.711
also I wanna see user errors,
or I wanna see all.

61
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:34.505
Okay, and you need to put it on every PHP
file, but this is for developer purposes,

62
00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:38.992
don't do that in production,
because that means in production,

63
00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:42.753
your user will see details of your URLs,
your PHP file,

64
00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:47.918
sometimes you will be exposing data,
private data that should be exposed.

65
00:04:47.918 --> 00:04:52.413
Okay, so that's not how you should be
doing, right now it's not going to

66
00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:57.019
make any difference because mine
were already turned on, okay?

67
00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:59.889
You have a question face
now you have [INAUDIBLE]

68
00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.917
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So It says line 22.

69
00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:04.429
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Well,
that line 22 this one,

70
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:08.135
but first one, we have another one here,
actually, we have three warnings.

71
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:08.725
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I see.

72
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.210
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That
they're being executed in order and

73
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.399
because the errors are within my HTML,
they're taking the CSS also,

74
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:19.945
that's why one is bigger,
that's because it's more important.

75
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:20.527
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Understand.

76
00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:22.167
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: My
first one is on line 15.

77
00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:22.977
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Got it.

78
00:05:22.977 --> 00:05:25.737
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So I need to
go and say okay, line 15 is this one.

79
00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:26.417
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Got it.

80
00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:31.111
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So actually,
it says undefined array key 1230,

81
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:35.490
because, yeah, you know what,
it's not null,

82
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.113
that's why it's not taking the 0,
it's a different problem.

83
00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:44.513
It wasn't I do have something,
but actually,

84
00:05:44.513 --> 00:05:47.693
when I've tried to get into that,
so how to solve the problem?

85
00:05:47.693 --> 00:05:53.298
Well, actually, you to first check,
maybe, you need to go and say,

86
00:05:53.298 --> 00:05:59.760
well, the index that I want is this one,
I should check if this index is not or is.

87
00:06:02.577 --> 00:06:07.891
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Lower than
the count of exhibits that I have.

88
00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:13.960
Okay, well, then you need to do this
manually, and then this is index and

89
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.914
do something, and what they're going to
do here also doing an echo with error.

90
00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:25.355
But if you do that,
this is details, right?

91
00:06:25.355 --> 00:06:30.183
Yeah, nothing happens because it's
still executing the rest of the code,

92
00:06:30.183 --> 00:06:33.835
and I'm still executing
the rest of the code.

93
00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:38.392
So sometimes, when you encounter an error,
something that you can do,

94
00:06:38.392 --> 00:06:41.434
is you can kind of stop the execution.

95
00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:46.284
You can say, hey, you know what,
I'm going to exit,

96
00:06:46.284 --> 00:06:52.295
I'm going to terminate this here,
and sometimes when you do that,

97
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:58.782
you also wanna forward the user to
another page that says error 500.

98
00:06:58.782 --> 00:07:01.538
I'm sorry, this is not working,
I don't know what happened,

99
00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:04.103
I can't manage the problem,
so let's go to another page.
