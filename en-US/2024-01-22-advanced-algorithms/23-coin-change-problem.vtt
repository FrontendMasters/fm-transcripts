1
00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:04.347
All right, so we're gonna do one more
problem, and this problem is super

2
00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:07.737
interesting, but I need a little
bit of audience participation.

3
00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:10.035
I want four values between 1 and 10.

4
00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:11.502
&gt;&gt; 7.

5
00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:12.400
&gt;&gt; All right, that's one.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.111
We got one.

7
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:13.775
Next one.

8
00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:14.486
Go, John.

9
00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:15.198
&gt;&gt; 3.

10
00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:15.912
&gt;&gt; Wait, what?

11
00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:16.576
&gt;&gt; 3.

12
00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:17.948
&gt;&gt; 3, I thought you said t.

13
00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:19.719
I was like, that's not even a value.

14
00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.811
&gt;&gt; 8.

15
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:22.810
&gt;&gt; 8, my goodness, this is fantastic.

16
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.957
All right, one more, go.

17
00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:24.574
&gt;&gt; 9.

18
00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:25.191
&gt;&gt; 9.

19
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.524
I really hate your values you've chosen.

20
00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:29.703
I should not have done
audience participation.

21
00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.323
You guys are just the worst.

22
00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:36.323
So we're gonna do a thing called
the maximum coin change problem,

23
00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:38.466
meaning given some number,

24
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:43.037
how many different ways can we
make change with these coins?

25
00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:46.719
We have chosen perhaps the world's
worst denominations for coins, but

26
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.358
we're gonna do it, all right?

27
00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:50.289
So I'm gonna take these values and
move them down.

28
00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.452
3, let's see.

29
00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:57.306
Let's go like this 3, 7, 8, 9.

30
00:00:57.306 --> 00:01:01.325
This is where dynamic programming
really made sense to me.

31
00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:06.752
All right, so let's pretend we
wanna make change for, let's do 15.

32
00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:10.915
All right, we need to make change for
the number 15.

33
00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:13.769
Here's our denominations.

34
00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:16.993
If we had to make change for 0, how many
different ways could we make it for 3?

35
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:19.727
&gt;&gt; 0.

36
00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:24.462
&gt;&gt; 1, we had no coins and
we've successfully at it had the sum.

37
00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.457
1, how about 7?

38
00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:28.029
Same thing, all right, 1.

39
00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:29.165
Okay, fantastic.

40
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.834
8, fantastic.

41
00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:33.777
9, fantastic.

42
00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:35.109
1, okay, we got this.

43
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.749
I'm gonna draw a nice little
line this way, really long.

44
00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:48.354
That was so satisfying.

45
00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:54.347
All right, now I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna go 1,

46
00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:59.668
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

47
00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:06.094
no, I ran out a room, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

48
00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:09.545
Okay, we had to kinda
tighten it up a little bit.

49
00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:12.337
Just tighten it up a little bit.

50
00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:15.308
All right, so
I'm gonna have to draw a lot of lines.

51
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.813
Because if you solved this without
knowing the dynamic Programming solution,

52
00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:25.009
you'd effectively have to do
a series of for loops for

53
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.793
every single change type
in your coin system.

54
00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:32.175
So if you had 21 different coins,
you'd have to have a 21 deep for loop,

55
00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:34.927
just checking every
possibility at all times.

56
00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:38.425
And every time you make a change,
you recompute a bunch of values.

57
00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:42.032
Well, right now we know one value,
which is very simple.

58
00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:46.638
We know for a fact that if we
had to provide a change of 0,

59
00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:49.187
there's one way to do it easy.

60
00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:52.263
All right, we're gonna start
with our first one right here.

61
00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:54.041
We're only gonna consider this change.

62
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.883
It doesn't matter.
Let's pretend we had a coin of 3.

63
00:02:56.883 --> 00:02:59.207
How many different ways
can we make change for

64
00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:01.776
1
&gt;&gt; 0.

65
00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:02.438
&gt;&gt; 0, all right?

66
00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:03.391
You can't even provide it.

67
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.532
It's a 0.

68
00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:07.578
It's just not even possible, all right?

69
00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:08.484
How about 2?

70
00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:09.575
Can we do it with 2?

71
00:03:10.994 --> 00:03:13.027
No, we cannot.

72
00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:15.885
This is where it gets interesting, 3.

73
00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:17.509
Can we do it with 3?

74
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.598
So technically,
you can think of it two different ways.

75
00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:25.157
If it is a module of the coin = 0,
all right?

76
00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:29.275
So whatever our n value is, or
technically our i-th value,

77
00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:34.872
if our i-th value modulo the currency
equals 0, we can just draw a 1 right here.

78
00:03:34.872 --> 00:03:39.055
But another way to think about
it is we can make change for

79
00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:43.060
this if we take the magnitude
of our current change and

80
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.667
walk back that amount and see if we
could make change for that previous one.

81
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.692
Meaning if we can make change for 3,

82
00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:56.777
it also means if we added 3 more,
we could make change for 6.

83
00:03:56.777 --> 00:04:01.418
If we had 6, we know for
a fact that if we added the coin size,

84
00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:05.891
which is 3 to 6,
we could also make change one way for 9.

85
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.352
Meaning there's one way
we can make change here.

86
00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.107
There's one way we can make change here.

87
00:04:10.107 --> 00:04:11.965
There's one way we can make change here.

88
00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.339
There is no other possibilities.

89
00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.153
That is it.

90
00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:20.123
So, at 3, we could walk back.

91
00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:23.077
The size of our coin say, hey,
could I make change at this spot?

92
00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:27.322
I can make change at that spot,
which means I'm divisible here,

93
00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:29.649
I can also make change at this spot.

94
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:30.878
So 4, no.

95
00:04:30.878 --> 00:04:33.669
5, well technically, check right here, no.

96
00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.617
5, no.

97
00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:38.654
6, yes, because we got a 1 right here.

98
00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:44.147
1, 7, no, 8, no 9, yes we can, holy cow.

99
00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:48.772
10, no 11 [SOUND], 12, yes,
13, no, 14, no, 15, yes.

100
00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:56.445
Okay, so we're starting to
see a bit of a pattern here.

101
00:04:56.445 --> 00:05:02.531
All right, now let's pretend we have
two coins inside of our change list.

102
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.608
Well, we're gonna do one extra thing here.

103
00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:11.516
We can make the different amount of
changes here based on two conditions.

104
00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:17.523
How many ways we were able to make change
at this spot for our previous coin, and

105
00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:22.910
how many ways we can make just change
based on bar coin size minus back?

106
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.969
So right now, can we go 7 back?

107
00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.267
No, we can't.
That's negative 6.

108
00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:27.939
You're giving me money at that point.

109
00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.435
So that 0.
How many ways do we make change in our

110
00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:31.741
previous solution?

111
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:33.153
0.

112
00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:36.388
So we can do it 0 amount
of ways at this point.

113
00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:37.286
What about 2?

114
00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.451
Well, up here we just couldn't.

115
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.371
Back here, we're off the board,
that's a 0.

116
00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:49.175
Right here, at 3, how many different ways
can we make change with a 3 and a 7?

117
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:54.994
One way, because we have the 3, we bring
up that 1, try to go back here, it's gone.

118
00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:58.973
Therefore, 0,therefore,
there's one way to make change here.

119
00:05:58.973 --> 00:05:59.633
Do it again.

120
00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:00.943
Notice that we used a previous value.

121
00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:04.354
Again, previous values are used
to calculate future values.

122
00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:11.159
Again, 4, that's 0 + 0, 0, 5, 0 + 0,
0, 6, use the previous value.

123
00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:17.082
There's one way to make change for
6 with 2 coins, 3 and 7, which is two 3s.

124
00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:17.887
That's it.

125
00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:19.106
There's no other solution.

126
00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:21.275
There's no other way we can
make change at this point.

127
00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:22.911
Erase that, get the hell out of here.

128
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.138
Plus 0, 1.

129
00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:26.709
Now this is where things get interesting.

130
00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:32.913
Now we add the previous values, different
ways to make change here, 0 plus.

131
00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:35.870
We can now make change at this point, 1.

132
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.896
Look at that.

133
00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:42.018
It's starting to happen, which means at 7,
with this type of tender,

134
00:06:42.018 --> 00:06:45.407
we can make a unique change
value of just 7, and that is it.

135
00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:47.582
All right, let's keep on going.

136
00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:49.755
So I'm gonna start going right here.

137
00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:53.028
We go over 1.
I got 0 up top plus 0 right here,

138
00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:54.046
go over 1.

139
00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:59.491
We got 0, we got 1 up top and
we got 0 right here.

140
00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:03.251
Now, this is interesting
in the sense that at 10,

141
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:08.473
we have 0 top we can't make anything
there, but we have one right here.

142
00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:10.236
So what happens right there?

143
00:07:10.236 --> 00:07:15.838
Well, if you think about it,
you can make a 3 and a 7, and that is it.

144
00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:17.592
So by using our previous 3,

145
00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:21.549
we know for a fact we can make
a single piece of change right here.

146
00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:24.742
If we remove that 7 out of it,
we can make that change right there.

147
00:07:24.742 --> 00:07:27.751
So therefore, we have a 1 right here.

148
00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:30.346
Okay, fantastic, did I forget to run a 0?

149
00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:34.175
I did, let's do it again.

150
00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:35.312
Let's go right here up.

151
00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:36.743
My goodness, way too far back.

152
00:07:36.743 --> 00:07:38.580
We've got 0, 0, 0.

153
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.431
Now we got, we can make 12.

154
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:45.409
Notice that there's no way
to take 12- 7 and use a 3.

155
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:46.670
We just can't do that.

156
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.998
Therefore, we get a +0.

157
00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:50.475
That's a 1.

158
00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:51.695
Fantastic.

159
00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:54.610
So now we got a 0 from up
top plus a 1 back here.

160
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.557
A 6, which makes sense.

161
00:07:56.557 --> 00:07:58.212
Again, there we go.

162
00:07:58.212 --> 00:08:03.147
Because 13 is gonna be 3,
3, 7 to make change.

163
00:08:03.147 --> 00:08:04.641
We were able to make change like that.

164
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.942
Only singular way we can do that.

165
00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:08.706
14 is going to be where were we?

166
00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:12.883
14- 7 is 7, so therefore,
we have 1 right here.

167
00:08:12.883 --> 00:08:15.148
Well, we have a 0 up top
plus 1 right here, 1.

168
00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:17.438
Now we go to right here, 8.

169
00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:21.694
We have a 1 up top plus a 0 right here 1,
okay?

170
00:08:21.694 --> 00:08:23.689
So there we go we're starting
to make momentum here.

171
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:24.383
Now let's do an 8.
Again,

172
00:08:24.383 --> 00:08:27.331
I told you guys picked
just the worst numbers.

173
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:31.335
Think if you would have had a smaller
number here we'd have this thing growing

174
00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:33.320
it'd be crazy but instead we won't.

175
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.129
All right, previous solution we've already
calculated out we already know that a 3

176
00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:40.681
and 7 can make 0 forms
of change right here.

177
00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:42.464
And an 8 can't be used.

178
00:08:42.464 --> 00:08:43.079
It's just 0.

179
00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:44.398
We already know this, all right?

180
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:45.821
We do it again, all right?

181
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:47.052
0, We do it again.

182
00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:52.637
1,0,0,1,1 unique point, all right?

183
00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:54.845
Because now we're at an 8.

184
00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:57.460
If we go back,
we can use the 1 right here.

185
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:03.102
Therefore, we have 0 from up to
top plus a 1 from the 0 spot.

186
00:09:03.102 --> 00:09:04.019
Now we're at a 1.

187
00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:04.876
Now we go right here.

188
00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:07.719
We have a 1+0, 1.

189
00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:08.480
We go right here.

190
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.277
We have 1+0.

191
00:09:11.277 --> 00:09:12.979
Man, we're so close to hitting a 2.

192
00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:14.674
I can just feel it in my bones.

193
00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:15.996
It's gonna happen at some point.

194
00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:21.287
Again, we have a 1 but we have a 0 top.

195
00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:23.238
Come on, just make it happen.

196
00:09:23.238 --> 00:09:26.292
All right, so now we have a 1 up top and
0 from over here.

197
00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:26.816
1.

198
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.799
We have a 1 up top plus
a 0 from over here.

199
00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:34.900
Now we have a 1 up top
plus a 1 from over here.

200
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.620
So let's think about this
while we're here, all right?

201
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.262
There's two ways to make change at 14.

202
00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:42.991
Let's think about how we would do that
with all three little 10ds right here.

203
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:47.247
First off, we can make change with 7,
7, all right?

204
00:09:47.247 --> 00:09:48.856
What is 14- 8?

205
00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.092
&gt;&gt; 6.

206
00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:51.946
&gt;&gt; 6.

207
00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:56.502
&gt;&gt; 8 + 2 threes is the only
other way we can make change.

208
00:09:56.502 --> 00:09:59.656
And we were able to do that
because we already knew for

209
00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:03.683
a fact at a 6, we already knew that
we could make change once here.

210
00:10:03.683 --> 00:10:07.000
So therefore, we can use the offset
to be able to calculate right in.

211
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.873
At 14, we can make it into a 6, therefore,

212
00:10:08.873 --> 00:10:11.093
how many different ways can
we make change with the 6?

213
00:10:11.093 --> 00:10:14.513
We already know that answer,
boom, goes the dynamite, awesome,

214
00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.258
things are going really good now.

215
00:10:16.258 --> 00:10:18.399
Now we get to here,
we even got a 2, look at it,

216
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.718
it's a 2 with the world's
dumbest change count.

217
00:10:20.718 --> 00:10:21.382
So things are looking good.

218
00:10:21.382 --> 00:10:21.904
Look at that.

219
00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:23.860
You can't even make change for
most of your problems, all right?

220
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.395
Any of your problems,
it doesn't even work out, all right?

221
00:10:27.395 --> 00:10:31.784
We go to 15, so we gotta go all the way
back to 15- 8, 7 and then this one, so

222
00:10:31.784 --> 00:10:32.957
we got a 1+ 1, 2.

223
00:10:32.957 --> 00:10:37.428
Now we could calculate out those
two different ways to make change,

224
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.865
but we just aren't going to do that.

225
00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:45.552
So now we're gonna go to 9,
0, 0, 1,0, 0, 1,1,1.

226
00:10:45.552 --> 00:10:46.694
Interesting point.

227
00:10:46.694 --> 00:10:50.954
Now we have 1 from up
top plus a 1 back here.

228
00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:53.224
Now we got our first 2.

229
00:10:53.224 --> 00:10:56.964
Where is the 2?
We got 3, 3s or one, 9.

230
00:10:56.964 --> 00:10:59.336
That's the only possible
possibilities right there.

231
00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:02.105
Okay, now again we have 1 from
up top 0 from right here.

232
00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:02.711
We got 1.

233
00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:04.166
Boom go over again.

234
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.068
1 from top, 0 from over here.

235
00:11:06.068 --> 00:11:07.582
We got 1.

236
00:11:07.582 --> 00:11:09.915
We got 1 from up top
plus 1 from over here.

237
00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:10.467
That's a 2.

238
00:11:10.467 --> 00:11:11.769
Hey, we got a 2.

239
00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:16.683
Now we got a 0 from over here,
1 from up top.

240
00:11:16.683 --> 00:11:17.439
Got 1.

241
00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:19.595
We got a 2, 0, 2.

242
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.516
And now we got a 2 + 1, a 3.

243
00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:23.143
Our first 3.

244
00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:25.420
We actually got 3 different
ways to make change here.

245
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.000
If you think about it, 9- 15 is a 6,
so we at least have 9 + two 3s.

246
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.844
We have five 3s.

247
00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:33.797
And what's the other way?

248
00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:36.428
I'm trying to think of what's
the other possibility here.

249
00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:37.143
&gt;&gt; 7 + 8.

250
00:11:37.143 --> 00:11:38.650
&gt;&gt; 7 + 8, all right?

251
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.691
Yeah, 7 + 8, there you go.

252
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:41.773
And a 7 + 8.

253
00:11:41.773 --> 00:11:44.275
So there's our three different
ways we can make change.

254
00:11:44.275 --> 00:11:48.051
So this is what dynamic
programming is supposed to be,

255
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:53.809
where you build past solutions, or you use
the easiest case to build the next step.

256
00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:58.296
You don't have to recompute
the same thing over and over again.

257
00:11:58.296 --> 00:12:01.372
Because if we really were to
write this out in for loops,

258
00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:03.671
we'd have to be like our biggest change.

259
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:08.831
We'd have to have i = 0, and
we'd have to step by our biggest change,

260
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:10.989
which would be like i + = 9.

261
00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:14.574
And we'd have to sum them up and
do it over and over again,

262
00:12:14.574 --> 00:12:17.731
seeing how many times can
we hit 0 on our way down.

263
00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:19.429
Which would be just like, yeah,

264
00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:23.202
super inefficient because we just be
calculating 3 over and over again.

265
00:12:23.202 --> 00:12:24.665
We already knew that answer.

266
00:12:24.665 --> 00:12:26.627
So there you go.
This is dynamic programming.

267
00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:28.012
I think this is super fun.

268
00:12:28.012 --> 00:12:29.053
I love this stuff.

269
00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:33.372
I wish I was better at it, but I like it's
very difficult to become good at this one.

270
00:12:33.372 --> 00:12:35.869
And every now and
then when you get the chance to use it,

271
00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:39.363
especially like either in our interview or
your job, it just feels so good.

272
00:12:39.363 --> 00:12:42.555
I recently got to do a problem in
which I had to use a linked list and

273
00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:44.459
all these ways to calculate out time.

274
00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:47.862
But it turns out all I had to do was
just turn it into a singular number.

275
00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:51.409
And so even at Netflix, I one time was
able to use a dynamic programming problem

276
00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:52.823
to solve a real world problem.

277
00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:56.233
And it was absolutely fantastic because
it was way too slow beforehand and

278
00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.768
then became just like a constant time for
everything.

279
00:12:58.768 --> 00:13:00.530
Very fantastic, absolutely love it.

280
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.544
Hopefully this all made sense.

281
00:13:01.544 --> 00:13:04.639
Hopefully this shows you the value of
dynamic programming because it is very

282
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.005
unusual, but it's super cool.

283
00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:08.109
And there's tons of different
ways to solve stuff.

284
00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:10.247
We just aren't doing those
tons of different ways.

285
00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:13.195
And I'm not gonna do any more problems
because at this point they're all

286
00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:13.784
pretty wild.

287
00:13:13.784 --> 00:13:16.648
And once you see the answer,
you're like, that's simple.

288
00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:18.256
But to come up with a solutions.

289
00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.492
This is ridiculous.

290
00:13:19.492 --> 00:13:21.604
It's ridiculous.

291
00:13:21.604 --> 00:13:25.474
&gt;&gt; Does memorization relate
to dynamic programming?

292
00:13:25.474 --> 00:13:26.552
&gt;&gt; In a sense, we're memorizing.

293
00:13:26.552 --> 00:13:30.009
I mean, that's what we're doing is we're
remembering the previous answer, so

294
00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:31.721
when you get the next one, it's a memo.

295
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:33.368
We just look into the past for it.

296
00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:38.322
Now, when it comes to react, and
you use memo, that's slightly different.

297
00:13:38.322 --> 00:13:40.648
Though it's the same concept.

298
00:13:40.648 --> 00:13:41.770
It's the same idea.

299
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.941
You're just trying to remember
what came before you,

300
00:13:43.941 --> 00:13:45.884
therefore you can just
use the same value again.
