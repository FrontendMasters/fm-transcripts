1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.058
Deletion is a little weird, okay?

2
00:00:03.058 --> 00:00:06.697
So we're gonna kinda do it in like
phases because there's a lot of rules.

3
00:00:06.697 --> 00:00:09.341
And so the simplest one we're
gonna look at is leafs.

4
00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:12.553
They're not simple they're
actually really, really,

5
00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:14.724
really, really hard, easy but hard.

6
00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:19.842
So leafs, the simplest one we can think

7
00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:24.969
of is if we have Kmin + 1 keys, right?

8
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.693
We're somewhere between kmin + 1 to kmax.

9
00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.338
If we just delete any of the keys, right?

10
00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:30.886
10, 20, 30,

11
00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:36.580
let's just say we have we're on an order
4 tree that means our minimum is one.

12
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.030
If we were to delete any of these keys,
well, that's actually really, really easy.

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.871
Because you just just delete
the keys there's no children,

14
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:45.463
you just delete the key.

15
00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:48.450
Get out of here because we
maintain all of our requirements.

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.961
I'm gonna bump this up to
a because it just feels nicer.

17
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.968
I think it's easier to see we're
gonna do an order five tree for

18
00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:56.405
the deletion part of things.

19
00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.964
Which means I have to do
a lot more writing but

20
00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:03.405
I just think it's a little bit easier
to kinda see how these things work out.

21
00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:07.544
All right, so we're still at our
minimum which is two, so we're good.

22
00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:10.440
Now, let's just draw out some things here.

23
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.396
I'm gonna go one, two, three and
let's get rid of this one.

24
00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.991
And that means we have to have what,
five up here?

25
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:25.069
We have to have 15 right here and
let's have 25 right here.

26
00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.810
Yeah, that feels good.

27
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.959
That feels just so good.

28
00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.785
We got to have this one that
means we have to have more keys.

29
00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:31.757
Let's not do that.

30
00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:36.706
Well we do want to do we do, we do,
we do, we do which means we need to come

31
00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:41.663
up with something right here which
will be [SOUND] this one's not right.

32
00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:47.107
We need to do 12,
we need to do, we'll do 16,

33
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:52.304
17 and then this last one will be 27, 28.

34
00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:56.342
Perfect and
let's actually also add in an 18.

35
00:01:56.342 --> 00:02:03.367
All right, I'll rewrite it for
you guys 16, 17, 18, beautiful.

36
00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:07.148
All right, so
now let's pretend we're deleting 28 or

37
00:02:07.148 --> 00:02:10.002
we're deleting 12, all right, 12.

38
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.934
We don't even, we do have 28 on here.

39
00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.386
We're deleting 12.

40
00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:15.700
Well, we are at the key minimum, right?

41
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.815
If our order's five our minimum
is two can we delete this key?

42
00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:26.464
I mean the answer is yes overall but
can we just delete it by just removing it?

43
00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:28.164
No, not at all.

44
00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:31.573
So what we do now, remember this is
where we get to use our terms again.

45
00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:32.550
I erased it.

46
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.733
What a, just a loser of man.

47
00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.725
Imagine if I had it still up here.

48
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:41.553
We need our in-order predecessor or our
in-order successor to be able to do this

49
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:46.319
and it's kinda like that but it's a little
different but it's the same thing.

50
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.994
It's gonna be effectively our
in-order on our sibling on either

51
00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:53.379
side it's the exact same thing.

52
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.988
So either we're taking
the largest of the small or

53
00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.544
the smallest of the large
when it comes to leafs.

54
00:02:58.544 --> 00:02:59.790
We're gonna say, hey, can we borrow that?

55
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.530
So case one of course we
already talked about,

56
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.072
three cases let's get rid of these cases.

57
00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:11.337
Let's [SOUND] move this to four cases.

58
00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:16.214
Four cases, one Kmin + 1 we already did

59
00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:20.093
that one that's easy-peasy.

60
00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:24.607
The next one is Kmin

61
00:03:24.607 --> 00:03:29.692
with left Kmin + 1.

62
00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:33.834
All right, so your left-hand side
has enough keys to be able to spare,

63
00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:37.769
which means what we're going to do
is we're gonna take the three and

64
00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.830
we're gonna move that three
up to where the five is.

65
00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:47.467
We're gonna take that five and move it to
the front of the list down here, because

66
00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:51.073
when you take from the minimum side,
you move it to the front of the list.

67
00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:54.251
So now, can we delete the 12 easily?

68
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:59.274
Yes, we've reduced case two to case one,
case one, goodbye, you are dead.

69
00:03:59.274 --> 00:03:59.975
All right, so

70
00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:03.727
now we're gonna do the exact same thing
except we're gonna delete ten now.

71
00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:09.244
All right, so this leads us to case three,

72
00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:16.615
which is we are at a Kmin with
a right Kmin + 1 fantastic.

73
00:04:16.615 --> 00:04:21.330
That means we need to take the smallest
item from our larger sibling.

74
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.516
You can't go two over,
you have to go one over.

75
00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:27.684
Maybe there is a way you could
find a way to snake it through but

76
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.990
we're not gonna do that because
that would be just crazy talk.

77
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.915
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
take 16, we're gonna move it up to 15.

78
00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:39.889
Notice we're not violating
any rules right now, right?

79
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.968
We are maintaining all the rules
of that it's fantastic.

80
00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:45.820
So that means our 15 comes down and

81
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.236
adds to the end of the list because
again it's on the larger side.

82
00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:51.093
The larger side goes to
the end of the list,

83
00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:53.318
the smaller side goes to
the beginning of the list.

84
00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:54.990
Choose your data structure wisely.

85
00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.091
Now we can delete ten because now
we've reduced case three to case one.

86
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.415
Beautiful, delete, you're dead.

87
00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:07.851
All right, so now that we've done that,
we want to delete yet again, 15.

88
00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:14.778
What are we gonna do here?

89
00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:18.847
&gt;&gt; Do it twice,
&gt;&gt; Do it twice, wrong, great idea, wrong.

90
00:05:18.847 --> 00:05:22.995
Okay, I love the passion you have but
it's incorrect.

91
00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.443
I want you to look at this list
just imagine it for a second.

92
00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:31.369
What if the files were in the computer?

93
00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:32.096
All right, they're right there.

94
00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:33.834
It's already right in
front of you right now.

95
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:38.537
We could actually create a list
called one, two, three, five,

96
00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.685
15 we are going to merge it.

97
00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:44.142
This right now is in
violation it is Kmax + 1.

98
00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:50.035
This will always be Kmax + 1 because
we did came in twice plus one more so

99
00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:52.899
that's always a violation rule.

100
00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:56.584
It's always Kmax + 1 which means
now that our three came down and

101
00:05:56.584 --> 00:05:58.337
we're trying to delete 15.

102
00:05:58.337 --> 00:06:05.133
15 is gonna go away and we're gonna have a
new tree so let me just erase all of this.

103
00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:07.821
Three goes out of here and

104
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:13.454
now we are sitting like
that it's now been deleted.

105
00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:16.200
All right, fantastic we've done it.

106
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.601
Now there comes a point where a violation
can then happen at your next level.

107
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:27.326
Which means that as you delete a leaf,
you're then going to have to recursively

108
00:06:27.326 --> 00:06:32.118
walk back up the item until we find
where a violation has happened.

109
00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:35.377
Now again,
you could do the exact same algorithm.

110
00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:40.678
You can look to the left, you can look
to the right or you merge upwards.

111
00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:45.075
You just keep on playing
the same game over and

112
00:06:45.075 --> 00:06:48.903
over again as you fix the tree upwards.

113
00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:50.620
Awesome, everyone's feeling
good about that one.

114
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.815
I'm feeling pretty good about that one.

115
00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:53.503
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

116
00:06:53.503 --> 00:06:55.270
This is pretty fun, all right.

117
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.325
So that is deletion at a leaf level
I forgot the right fourth case.

118
00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:03.973
Fourth case is merge.

119
00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:08.164
Look at those ease those easy,
beautiful, all right.

120
00:07:08.164 --> 00:07:10.698
No, this is not middle out.

121
00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:12.502
Middle outs when you grow, right?

122
00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:15.659
Because when you grow you literally
take the middle when you take it out so

123
00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:16.293
there you go.
