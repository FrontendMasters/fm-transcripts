00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.300
All right, so we are gonna be
doing one more algorithms course.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.099
I know the last one was called the last
algorithms course you'll need,

3
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.392
this one's called the last
algorithms course you'll want,

4
00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:14.472
you'll understand at the end of that at
the end of this why we called it this.

5
00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.385
It'll be very, very much so fun.

6
00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:18.811
And I've never done anything
purely on a whiteboard,

7
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:21.037
this will be my first
whiteboarding experience.

8
00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:25.594
I've always done things behind those nice
keyboard keys with the Vim terminal, so

9
00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:28.237
this is kind of a new experience for me.

10
00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.057
Hopefully it's a new experience for
everybody else.

11
00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:33.767
So today I'm going to try to do things in
a certain way which is probably a little

12
00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.957
unusual considering I've
already done one course on it.

13
00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:41.267
This course will cover some of the same
material, some in way lighter versions

14
00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:44.399
just so we make sure we're all
on the exact same page, and

15
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.249
some in much deeper style just because
we have to be able to take that and

16
00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.952
take it to the next concept which is
inevitably harder than the previous one.

17
00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.951
We'll be using all the fun different
algorithms that I can fit in this

18
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.682
amount of time.

19
00:00:56.682 --> 00:01:00.938
I tried to pick the best ones, the ones
either that I liked the most, or actually,

20
00:01:00.938 --> 00:01:02.803
it's just the ones I like the most.

21
00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:06.154
I really am only picking the ones
that I just think are the most fun

22
00:01:06.154 --> 00:01:08.716
that aren't like your
intro level algorithms.

23
00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:12.635
So there's no linked list today,
though I may say the word linked list,

24
00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.939
there will be no stacks, queues any of
that, but we will use stacks and queues or

25
00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.240
talk about them.

26
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.135
And so I kind of have an expectation that
you have a basic level of understanding of

27
00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:22.904
algorithms.

28
00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:27.230
You know how to walk a tree, everyone here
is comfortable with recursion, right?

29
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.246
All right, good, some joke about knowing
recursion requires you to know recursion.
