00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.697
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm actually
just gonna delete all of this,

2
00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:11.856
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: const isTheSkyBlue.

3
00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:13.830
Actually, it's kind of gray
today if we're being honest.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.908
But well,
let's just roll with blue for now.

5
00:00:15.908 --> 00:00:23.260
True, okay, and then I can just
say console.log isTheSkyBlue.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.186
Refresh here, notice that it says false.

7
00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:32.430
[LAUGH] Just kidding, it says true.

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.720
So these are called Booleans.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.663
It's literally true or false,
those are the only two options, and

10
00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:43.360
these are quite useful,
we use them quite a bit in programming.

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.301
Like imagine that you were making
smart lights or something like that,

12
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:49.404
you would have like are the lights on and
that would be either true or false.

13
00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.776
And you would flip that back and
forth depending on whether or

14
00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:53.370
not the person had turned on the lights.

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.027
Again, this is called a Boolean,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that,

16
00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.450
that's how you spell it.

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.830
I believe it's named after
a computer scientist named Bool.

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.402
Don't quote me on that though, it's
been a long time since I was in school.

19
00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:18.611
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again, this can
be either true or it can be false.

20
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's another one to keep in mind.

21
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.180
Yeah, please.

22
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it have a default value
if you didn't assign it to the thing?

23
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
like if I did this, one with const,

24
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.690
you can't do that because const instance
can never be reassigned, right?

25
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:47.530
But if I did let like this, it would be
undefined because we haven't defined it.

26
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.019
So the default value is undefined.

27
00:01:56.594 --> 00:02:01.582
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, and then if you don't
define it all it says isTheSkyBlue is not

28
00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:04.850
defined at all, so
then it gets upset at you.

29
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.575
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does it become a Boolean
just because we are defining it as true?

30
00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:11.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, yep.

31
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.430
And that's actually
a valid point to bring up.

32
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.710
So JavaScript is what's
called a dynamic language.

33
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.998
So in other languages like,
let's pick our favorite, like Java, right?

34
00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:29.978
It's a statically typed language,
that means we have to define

35
00:02:29.978 --> 00:02:35.048
our types up front,
which means if I say let myName = "Brian",

36
00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:38.020
right, this is now a string, right?

37
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.881
And then down here I can say myName =
15 now we're getting nonsensical but

38
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:44.090
it doesn't matter.

39
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.430
JavaScript doesn't care.

40
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.140
It's like do whatever you want,
I don't care, I will keep up, right?

41
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.080
So if I say console.log(myName)
right here, whereas if I try

42
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.040
to do this in something like Java word,
you have to maintain the types.

43
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.210
It would say note this was a string,
you can only ever be strings,

44
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.930
I don't accept numbers, right?

45
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.739
JavaScript doesn't care.

46
00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.052
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So when it dynamically
moves from a string to a number to myName

47
00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:14.211
= true, to Boolean, it does not matter,
it just keeps up with it.

48
00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:20.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This makes it really
easy to code because that's just

49
00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.039
one thought process you don't have to
think about, but you get bugs from it.

50
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.562
So it's a trade-off.
