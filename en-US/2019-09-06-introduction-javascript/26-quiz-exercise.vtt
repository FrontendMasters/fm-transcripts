00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let us get to your first
exercise or end of day exercise rather.

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.639
So you're going to be building a quiz
today because that's a wholly original

3
00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:14.618
thought that I had.

4
00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:18.347
And no one's ever made
programmers build quizzes before.

5
00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:23.834
[LAUGH] Just kidding, that's everyone's
first exercise, and I am not creative.

6
00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:27.701
So we're gonna use CodePen again.

7
00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:30.520
Yeah, here I explained for CodePen.

8
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.060
I do recommend that you sign up for
an account.

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.400
I think Jen probably had you do that.

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.122
For these ones,
I recommend that you fork them.

11
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.114
Which fork is, as in how are river forks.

12
00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:43.004
That's why it's called fork.

13
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:47.243
It sounds like you're stabbing
with a fork or something,

14
00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:50.193
though you may want to at the end of this.

15
00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:53.970
It is possible to crash the browser,
especially when we're doing JavaScript.

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.416
I give you a link here to a blog post on
CodePen on how to turn off the JavaScript

17
00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:00.095
if you do end up crashing it.

18
00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:07.981
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should not have
to modify any HTML or CSS in this,

19
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.010
this is just JavaScript for you.

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.005
If you see this little red exclamation
point in the bottom right of your CodePen,

21
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.236
it means that you have improper syntax,
right?

22
00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:21.455
And if you click on it,

23
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.900
it will actually show you the line
that has the bad syntax on it.

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.500
So be sure to watch out for this.

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.930
If you notice that your code is not
running and you expect it to, look for

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.170
the little red explanation point.

27
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.540
I tell you that because this
happens to me all the time.

28
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.858
So look for that.

29
00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:40.780
If you're stuck, Google it.

30
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.910
That's not cheating,
that's what you're supposed to do.

31
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.084
It's part of your assignment.

32
00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:48.045
And don't be afraid of
looking at the answers.

33
00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:49.690
I'm not your mom.

34
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.739
I'm not even really your
university professor.

35
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.200
I'm not grading you on this.

36
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.820
So I just want you to learn, right?

37
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.540
That being said, don't cheat yourself.

38
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.466
Do try.

39
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.190
It's hard.

40
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.800
You should struggle.

41
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.389
And I find when I'm struggling,

42
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.897
it's actually when I end
up doing a lot of learning.

43
00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:10.360
So make sure you maintain that balance for
whatever your style of learning is.

44
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.426
Maximize learning, even if it comes to
the cost of not necessarily finishing

45
00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.749
the project on time or
something like that.

46
00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:17.372
I don't care.

47
00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:19.214
I want you to learn as much as you can.

48
00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:21.464
So let's take a look at the exercise here.

49
00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:27.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you double
click on the JS pane or yeah,

50
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.490
on the little side pen right there, it'll
maximize it and get rid of the other ones.

51
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.230
You can look at my CSS and HTML in here.

52
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.220
Definitely not the point of this.

53
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.940
I'm not gonna even say that's any good.

54
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.130
But I want you to focus on
the JavaScript part for this.

55
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.260
Okay, we're going to be
building a quiz together.

56
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.451
So what is the capital of Australia?

57
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.564
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Canberra.

58
00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:51.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's correct.

59
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.022
Usually people don't get that.

60
00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:59.170
[LAUGH] So you're gonna be learning
to about capitals, just kidding.

61
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.188
Unless you don't know what the capital
of Canada cuz that is the next test.

62
00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:07.320
[LAUGH] So
I have done the first one for you.

63
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.630
So if you put Canberra in here,
and you click Guess,

64
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.380
it's going to tell you
that you are correct.

65
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.119
So for each one of these, you can see
here, Australia's been done for you.

66
00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.260
You're going to be accepting a user
answer, which I have written all

67
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.740
the JavaScript to give you that answers,
that's where it's coming from.

68
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.004
It's coming from the user interface and
it's being fed into your function.

69
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.042
So you don't have to write
any of the user interface,

70
00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:38.276
you just have to write
the validation functions, right?

71
00:03:38.276 --> 00:03:42.656
So let's see if I refresh this again and

72
00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:46.505
if I put in something like Sydney,

73
00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:50.641
it's gonna say incorrect, right?

74
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:52.590
So I wrote all the logic
to do all that stuff.

75
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.427
You just have to write the validation
function here that tells me that I'm right

76
00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:58.082
or wrong.

77
00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:03.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If the person is correct,
then you add 100 points to their total.

78
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.126
And points is up here, right?

79
00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.219
So at the end, you can give them,
some sort of score.

80
00:04:08.918 --> 00:04:11.944
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I've given you comments
here of what the question's going to be

81
00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:13.736
and how many points it should be worth.

82
00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:17.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
you're gonna go through and say,

83
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.631
what is the capital of Canada, right?

84
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:21.650
It's gonna be very similar
to the other one above it.

85
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.560
So in here is where it starts getting
a little bit more complicated.

86
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.260
So word is going to be one random word and

87
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.130
it's going to be different
every single time, right?

88
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.940
So you're going to be accepting word
as a parameter up here in addition to

89
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.850
the user answer.

90
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.580
So it's gonna say what is
word in all capital letters.

91
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.459
So then you're gonna have to say
did the user capitalize that word

92
00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:47.714
correctly, right?

93
00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:48.561
Does that make sense?

94
00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:56.015
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And just so you know,
word is not going to be in all uppercase,

95
00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:56.690
as well.

96
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.080
So you are going to
have to uppercase that.

97
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.330
It's just gonna ask you what the word is.

98
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.843
In fact, if I just go there.

99
00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:06.870
In this case, it's gonna be rude, right?

100
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.560
So rude is going to be passed
in here as all lower case.

101
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.393
You are going to have
to make it upper case.

102
00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:18.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, what are the first
three letters of some word?

103
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.700
Again, if I click down here,
what are the first three letters of name?

104
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.181
It's a very difficult quiz, by the way.

105
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:29.331
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What is number squared?

106
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:34.530
If you're not familiar with that,
that's just number times number, right?

107
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.340
That's what something squared is.

108
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.693
So you're gonna have to make
sure that they can math okay.

109
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.637
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact,
it looks like I gave that one to you.

110
00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:51.590
So you could have done it this way or
you could have done it number times

111
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.565
number,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just to show you kind

112
00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.509
of how the math works there.

113
00:06:02.857 --> 00:06:04.936
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll get to the double
equals here in just a second.

114
00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.588
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Multiplication,
so we're gonna ask it,

115
00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:11.260
what is number times by number?

116
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.520
So you're gonna take in two numbers,

117
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.930
and you're gonna ask it,
is the answer what you would expect?

118
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.611
Age, if someone is born
in some birth year and

119
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:24.979
has already had that birthday that year,
how old are they, right?

120
00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.824
So you're gonna have to do the math to
figure out what the age they should be,

121
00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:29.257
and if the person can figure that out.

122
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.161
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Function larger is
gonna give you two numbers and

123
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:40.065
you're gonna have to say which of this
number and that number is larger.

124
00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:43.132
If they're the same number,
then just pick that number, right?.

125
00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:49.320
[LAUGH] And again,
these will be random numbers.

126
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.260
You won't be able to depend on them,
num 1 always being the bigger,

127
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.880
number 2 always being bigger.

128
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.836
And then down here you have to write
getScore which as you might imagine you'll

129
00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.830
just be returning the points, right?

130
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can see here,

131
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.040
I left all the code in here
that actually runs the quiz.

132
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.900
I don't expect you to understand all this
code yet, but by the end of the course,

133
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.160
you definitely will.

134
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.190
But do not modify any the code
under that comment, or

135
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.880
you are going to break the quiz, right?

136
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.103
That's just a bunch of stuff down here.

137
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:27.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice here that
we're asking === 'Canberra', right?

138
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.760
Again, the computer only does
what you tell it to do, right?

139
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.030
So if I put canberra here,
is this the same?

140
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.200
No, because capital C and lower case c
are different things to the computer.

141
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.210
It's not gonna convert that for you.

142
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.390
Now your question is like,
I wanna make this case insensitive,

143
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.290
so how do I do that?

144
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:56.591
So what I can do here is
.toUpperCase() === 'CANBERRA' ; right?

145
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.380
And that will account for that.

146
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.626
So now if I say canberra, I'll be correct.

147
00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:07.334
Yeah, thank you.

148
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.412
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you click guess here and
you don't have anything,

149
00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:15.647
it's like it expects an answer
of either true or false.

150
00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:18.682
If it doesn't get a true or
false from you, you'll get this measures,

151
00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:21.685
which then you'll notice is,
I need to do something different.

152
00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:27.290
So if it gets undefined or something like
that, then it'll give you that message.
