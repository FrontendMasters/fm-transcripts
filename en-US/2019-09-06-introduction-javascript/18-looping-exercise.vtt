00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.546
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I have a little exercise for you.

2
00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:09.595
Let's go back to our browser here,
and we're going

3
00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:14.772
to go to
frontendmasters.github/io/bootcamp.

4
00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:18.089
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come back
to the Boot Camp site.

5
00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.417
Come down to Programming Fundamentals.

6
00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:28.124
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna do a little CodePen here.

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.829
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna click here,
Edit on CodePen to open this in CodePen.

8
00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:45.065
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I want you to do,
I want you to combine two of the things

9
00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:49.308
that we've talked about so far,
which is string concatenation.

10
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.771
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I want you to do a loop and

11
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:57.744
you can do either a while loop or
a for loop.

12
00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:06.223
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So basically the idea is
you're gonna have some character here,

13
00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:11.337
so you can have const character = f or
something that.

14
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.405
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
probably the smallest.

15
00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:15.275
Let's make that a lot bigger.

16
00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:22.193
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And const timesToRepeat.

17
00:01:22.193 --> 00:01:24.440
Go with something like 5.

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.220
And then I want you to write a for
loop here or

19
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.630
a while loop here that will
take this character and

20
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.990
add itself to itself that many times.

21
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.301
So that I end up with a string like f,
f, f, f, f five times.

22
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:43.712
So that whenever I say, let myString or

23
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:49.592
something like that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

24
00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:53.764
is called an empty string right
here which you probably will need.

25
00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:56.538
An empty string is a string with
no characters in it, right?

26
00:01:56.538 --> 00:02:01.118
So it's not undefined, it is a string,
the string just has nothing in it.

27
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.014
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're
gonna put your code here.

28
00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:10.129
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Some sort of loop.

29
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:17.065
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't care.

30
00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:24.170
And then, at the end, I want you to be
able to console.log(myString) here.

31
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.189
And that will log out f, f, f, f.

32
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:33.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or let's do t,
or something like that.

33
00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:41.338
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense, yeah.

34
00:02:41.338 --> 00:02:43.296
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was just wondering.

35
00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:48.943
Earlier, you pointed out that
when it's a constant you

36
00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:54.362
use a different way of labeling,
like all capitals?

37
00:02:54.362 --> 00:03:01.435
And here you're not doing that, so is it
not used that much in the real world?

38
00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:05.116
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, it would be more
things that are like fixed in the physical

39
00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:06.896
world, like months in a year.

40
00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:09.094
That's never gonna change, right?

41
00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:13.439
It's more, or like the, I don't know,

42
00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.547
days in a month or something like that.

43
00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.225
Not necessarily something
like a variable here, right.

44
00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:22.950
So I wouldn't make this in screaming case,
right.

45
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.810
That's why it's called screaming case.

46
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.646
Does that make sense?

47
00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:28.286
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because it could be a,
or b, or c?

48
00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:30.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, and
it could change at a later date, right?

49
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.480
Months and years, never gonna change.
