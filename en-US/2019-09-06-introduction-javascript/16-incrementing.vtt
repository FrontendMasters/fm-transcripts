00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I wanted to show
you are all the different ways you can do

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:04.640
incrementing a number by 1.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.600
So friendsAtYourParty += 1.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.795
This is saying add 1 to
friendsAtYourParty and reassign it.

5
00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.451
As you might imagine, you could
put 5 here and it would add 5 and

6
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:23.950
reassign that, right?

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.807
So that would be the same as this.

8
00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:31.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Line 4 and line 5 are doing
exactly the same thing right now.

9
00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:35.574
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this works with all of the operators.

10
00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:39.940
You can do -=, it'll subtract 5 from it,
you can do *=.

11
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.996
And the way you do times in
JavaScript is with the star.

12
00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:46.435
And /=, which is division.

13
00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:49.986
I don't if you ever seen anyone use /=,
but it's there.

14
00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:54.970
There's also friendsAtYourParty++,
like C++,

15
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.732
right, we've heard of that.

16
00:00:57.732 --> 00:01:00.784
That's because it's 1 better than C,
that's joke, right?

17
00:01:02.672 --> 00:01:04.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Computer scientists
have bad sense of humor.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.920
So this will take friendsAtYourParty and
increment it by 1.

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.852
You can also do ++friendsAtYourParty,
that also works.

20
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.862
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'll put this back to 1.

21
00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:25.560
All of these do exactly the same thing.

22
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.583
Adds 1, adds 1, adds 1.

23
00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:37.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now I will say that in
JavaScript, I don't see anyone do ++ and

24
00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:40.540
then the name of the variable.

25
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.143
This is just,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No one ever

26
00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:43.800
does it this way.

27
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.330
You can, but people don't.

28
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.521
People always do ++ on the end, postfix.

29
00:01:56.265 --> 00:02:00.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, reason why I show
this is cuz the next example is going to

30
00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:01.055
use this.
