00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:05.375
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here, I'm talking about
what this is can be in other settings,

2
00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:06.003
right?

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:09.252
So that's a console.log like this
is window and that's true, right?

4
00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:13.024
So in this particular case,
whenever I'd call this,

5
00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:15.648
it is referring to the entire window.

6
00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:20.482
And you can see here that
this .scroll which is how far

7
00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:24.467
down on the page scroll
is exactly the same.

8
00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:31.116
In fact, if I change it,
it'll change based on

9
00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:36.783
where I am which is kind of cool, right?

10
00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:39.095
But if I land live in the same place,
it won't change, right?

11
00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:41.159
I'm not scrolling anywhere.

12
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.977
We can see I can access that both on
this .scrollY and we know .scrollY,

13
00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.740
because they are the same thing.

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.050
Yep, so here, I kind of restate that.

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.100
If you're inside an object, a good rule
of thumb that this will be the object.

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.270
If you are not inside of an object
of some sort, this is gonna be

17
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.250
window or whatever the global object
is which for browsers is window.

18
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.558
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH] The attributes
in the objects, do they have names?

19
00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:13.588
How we should, call them?

20
00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:17.728
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
like the keys or properties?

21
00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:20.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Keys, yeah, or just key in.

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.223
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the key.

23
00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:25.479
This is the value and the whole thing
would be called up like a property.

24
00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.366
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A property, okay.

25
00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:31.019
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

26
00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:39.556
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in here, I have links
to Kyle Simpson's which I link here,

27
00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:42.093
JavaScript foundations.

28
00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:46.233
He actually has a whole
section here on learn this.

29
00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:52.793
So it is probably a pretty good place to
go down, if you want understand it better.

30
00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:56.489
If you are doing in job interviews for
JavaScript jobs,

31
00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.742
they love to ask questions about this,
because it is so have to.

32
00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:02.418
I have problems with
JavaScript interviews.

33
00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:06.143
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It feels more like jeopardy

34
00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.992
than if feels like an interview.

35
00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:13.392
So that's actually, probably a pretty
good one to figure out context and

36
00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:16.274
what this is and those sorts of things.
