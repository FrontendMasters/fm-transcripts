00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why doesn't
it execute the else?

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.491
If the first part is true,
why does it just ignore it?

4
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:12.222
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You know what I mean?

5
00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:15.290
Instead of running each line
of code one after another?

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's because we're
doing this if statement, right?

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.210
So that's what these
if statements are for.

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.520
It's like I only wanna execute
one of these two things

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.620
based on some condition, right?

10
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.480
So in this particular case,
this is a dumb condition, right?

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.017
But maybe here,
it would be like const areTheLightsOn =,

12
00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:40.500
and let's say they are for now, right?

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.470
And this would be defined somewhere else.

14
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.460
And someone says, areTheLightsOn,
then you would do something like here.

15
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.280
Turn the lights off, and

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.060
this would have some sort of code
that would be doing that, right?

17
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.530
And then turn the lights on, right?

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.731
These are comments, by the way.

19
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.648
This is just how you leave notes for
yourself in the future.

20
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:10.394
So this allows you to kind of branch
into different paths of logic,

21
00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:16.185
depending on what's happening, right,
depending on the ambient variables.

22
00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:17.807
Does that answer your question?

23
00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:19.181
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think so.

24
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:22.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's just based on
this condition, run this code.

25
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.040
If this is true, then do this.

26
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.910
If it's false, then do that.

27
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What if someone made the
condition where both are true, the if and

28
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.740
the else?

29
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.160
Would it still stop at the first part,
not from the else?

30
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.296
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So they can't both be true.

31
00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:41.820
It's like areTheLightsOn
is either gonna be true and

32
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730
false and there's no middle ground.

33
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.290
It's black or it's white, right?

34
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.270
Does that answer your question?

35
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

36
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.586
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

37
00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:53.721
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I mean, you could write
code where there are multiple conditions,

38
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.730
if maybe not lights are on, but
if 2 plus 2 equals 4, do this.

39
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.180
But if 2 plus 3 equals 5, do this.

40
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.130
And then it wouldn't get to
the second statement, right?

41
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.182
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Correct, so in fact,
my next thing is on else if,

42
00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:09.020
so hold your thought.

43
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.838
[LAUGH] But you're correct.

44
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:18.447
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Suffice to say, only one of
these blocks will ever be executed, and

45
00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:20.195
you can just depend on that fact.

46
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:21.976
One of these is always
going to be executed.

47
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:28.220
Exactly one of these is always going to be
executed, unless there's no else, right?

48
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.587
So if I take the else away here,
this may or may not happen, right?

49
00:02:32.587 --> 00:02:36.768
And if this is false, then it just
skips this and goes on its merry way.

50
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if you have an else,
one of them will definitely be executed.
