00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.212
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna show you
another one with input tag, right?

2
00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:05.732
So something that I can type into and

3
00:00:05.732 --> 00:00:10.210
we're gonna be listening to key up events,
okay?

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.943
So key up event, as you might
imagine is when I press the key,

5
00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:15.567
there is a key down event.

6
00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:19.959
And then as soon as I released the key up,
there is a key event, okay, and

7
00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:21.837
listening to the key up event.

8
00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:25.246
So if I type in here and
say, typing something.

9
00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:30.518
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As soon as I let up
my fingers, if I would like hold

10
00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:34.954
my finger here, notice that it's not gonna
do anything until I let my finger up.

11
00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:38.903
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Reason being
if I did key down on here,

12
00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:42.487
it would capture the event before
the typing had been registered.

13
00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:46.856
So I would be always one character behind,
but

14
00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:50.114
sometimes that's what you want.

15
00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:51.409
So that just depends.

16
00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.988
So if you look, trying to listen to
inputs, you'll listen for key up events.

17
00:00:56.988 --> 00:01:00.453
And here I'm just saying, paragraph and

18
00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:05.799
I'm saying the inner text is
assign the input.value, right?

19
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.862
So the input.value which
this input is this,

20
00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:13.347
it's the input to copy to which is
referring to this one right here.

21
00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:17.052
Whatever the person has typed into
it will always be captured inside

22
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:18.224
input.value here.

23
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or we actually could
have done it this way, as well.

24
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.182
So this takes in an event right here,

25
00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:35.096
right, and then I could have said

26
00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:38.966
event.target.value.

27
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:42.654
So the wherever the event is happening,
right?

28
00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:46.120
So in this case, the event
happens on this input right here.

29
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.482
I can pull that off here off the event.

30
00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:50.801
So that's what the event.target is, right?

31
00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:53.190
It's where the event
actually ended up happening.

32
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.016
So it would be the input
in this particular case and

33
00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.657
then I wouldn't have to
have this part at all.

34
00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:11.768
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here I would say,
documents.getelement or querySelector.

35
00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:16.100
QuerySelector was it called

36
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.241
input-to-copy, input-to-copy.

37
00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.284
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if I type that.

38
00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's weird, console.

39
00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:48.343
Part of that paragraph,
either so console.log('event').

40
00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.523
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Paragraph is not defined.

41
00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:03.194
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's figure
out what's going on with that.

42
00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:12.543
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Paragraph right there,
copy.

43
00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:15.431
There we go.

44
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:19.456
So now if it coming here,
it still is working.

45
00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:20.592
There we go, okay?

46
00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:27.617
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's another way you
can do it is using this event right here,

47
00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:29.099
event.target.value.

48
00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.253
In fact,
you'll probably see that quite frequently.

49
00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:34.657
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz what's nice.

50
00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:36.892
In fact, what I'm gonna show you,
I think on the next one.

51
00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:40.440
Nope, the second to last one is
you can use one event listener for

52
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.291
multiple different downloads.

53
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:43.822
Right now,
we have a one-to-one relationship.

54
00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:47.862
We have one event listener for
one element like one tag, right?

55
00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:51.882
But we can actually use one event
listener for many tags as well,

56
00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:53.307
which is pretty cool.

57
00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:57.439
So it makes sense that whatever is getting
typed into here is getting copied into

58
00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.990
this paragraph tag, right?

59
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.685
And we're doing that by just
overwriting the inner text here with

60
00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:06.705
the event.target.value
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so

61
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:11.913
next thing here we're gonna
be doing a change event.

62
00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:14.909
So a change event is like I've
typed something into an input.

63
00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.439
I'm not listening to the key up anymore.

64
00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.618
I'm listening for
I've typed something in here.

65
00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:24.692
When the user then unfocuses that input,
it's going to fire a change event.

66
00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:26.297
It's something changed, right?

67
00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:31.125
So notice if I type here like Peru,
my favorite color, it hasn't changed yet,

68
00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.444
right, because I'm still focused.

69
00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:34.956
You can see the blue outline there.

70
00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:37.665
That means I'm still
focused on that input.

71
00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:41.326
However, if I click over here,
it's gonna change the color right away.

72
00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:43.558
That's when the change event
actually ends up happening.

73
00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:48.987
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is useful for
thing like validation, right?

74
00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:51.246
Like imagine that you're
building a form and

75
00:04:51.246 --> 00:04:54.225
someone's filling out like
their email address, right?

76
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:55.759
You wanna make sure that they
have a valid email address.

77
00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.677
So as soon as there's a change event,
you'll go through and

78
00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:00.919
make sure it's like is
do they have an ad sign?

79
00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.562
Do they have like a dot com or
dot CEO or net afterwards, right?

80
00:05:04.562 --> 00:05:07.251
You can do all that validation
on the change event.

81
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:08.907
That's when that's gonna be useful to you.

82
00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:14.853
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's also rebeccapurple.

83
00:05:14.853 --> 00:05:15.749
That's another favorite one.

84
00:05:19.398 --> 00:05:25.808
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or mediumaquamarine.

85
00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:27.681
Think that's a color, it is.

86
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:32.679
In case you're wondering that was medium
aquamarine is, it's my favorite interview

87
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:36.450
question to ask someone what's
their favorite names CSS color.

88
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.240
If they say Peru, they just get the job.

89
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.280
[LAUGH]
