00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just gave you a bit of
break to accomplish this task here.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.870
So one of the questions was is,
how do you run JavaScript from CodePen?

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.440
So notice that there's
multiple panes here.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.760
There's the HTML one, the CSS,
and the JavaScript one.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.929
We're just kind of ignoring the other ones
right now, and just looking at JavaScript.

6
00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.290
Java or CodePen will actually run your
code every single time that you type

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.220
something, which for
the most part is convenient, right?

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.940
So you never have to worry about writing
it, because it's always running.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.040
It can be inconvenient if you're
partially done typing a four loop, and

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.300
you accidentally create
an infinite loop in the process.

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.740
So you can either leave it
like it is right now or

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.980
you can come in here to settings, and

13
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.970
I think it's under behavior, so Auto
Updating Preview, this part right here.

14
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.850
Right now it's enabled,
if I click, un-enable it, right?

15
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.720
And I'll say save and close.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.230
Now there's a run button up here, so
I can actually determine when it runs.

17
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.870
So that's often helpful.

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.235
Another thing to mention if i
say console dot.high right here,

19
00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:15.550
right, lol, cuz I'm a 14 year old girl.

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.494
Notice, if I click run right here,
it will show up here.

21
00:01:22.494 --> 00:01:26.910
But notice, there's all this other garbage
coming in from, just like CodePen stuff.

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.610
So, you can actually look down here,
there's a console button.

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.840
It's probably hard to see if it's
in the bottom left of your screen.

24
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.350
If I click that console, so
we have high console here.

25
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.082
So let's go ahead and
do our task here together.

26
00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:49.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I'm going to say,
const character equals F.

27
00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:53.125
Const times to repeat equals 5, and

28
00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:59.320
then you could have done a for
loop, or a while loop here.

29
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.140
I'm gonna do a for loop, because it's
going to do a defined amount of time.

30
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.250
So that's makes sense,
to do a follow up with that.

31
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.830
So I'm gonna do for, let i equals 0.

32
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.798
I is less than times to repeat.

33
00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:17.995
I plus plus.

34
00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:24.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then I'm going
to do above here, let answer or

35
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.450
whatever you wanted to call it.

36
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.910
Empty string.

37
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.834
And I'm gonna say,

38
00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:40.168
answer equals answer plus character.

39
00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:51.981
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then down here
I will say, console.log answer.

40
00:02:55.033 --> 00:03:00.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Wait,
I put the semicolon inside of there.

41
00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:07.469
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see right there,
I have F coming out five times.

42
00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:11.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now remember,

43
00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.820
I showed you plus equal that works
with more than just numbers.

44
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.146
So you can actually do plus equals.

45
00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:20.891
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Character, and
this will still work as well.

46
00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:25.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just another kind
of fun thing you can do, right?

47
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.260
Because it'll concatenate
that f one to the end of it.

48
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.662
But what's cool now is that, since
this is codec but 15 there and s, and

49
00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:35.076
run it again, and I'll have 15 s's.
