00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.631
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There's a question
about the query selector all and

2
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:07.901
the array, how you loop through it?

3
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:12.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure, so let's see,
there's a bunch of h1s on here, right?

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.125
So I think these are,
no these are h2s, I think actually.

5
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.474
So these are h2.

6
00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:20.933
So if I come in here and say.

7
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:32.678
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let h2s =
document.querySelectorAll and

8
00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:37.297
I wanna get all of the h2s.

9
00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:39.426
I'm gonna ask for
just h2 with no period, right?

10
00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.972
That'll give me the tags back.

11
00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:48.325
And so now in h2s,
I have a bunch of h2s like this, right?

12
00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:52.709
First thing you might ask me is that's
not an array, that's a node list.

13
00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:54.163
That would be an astute observation.

14
00:00:54.163 --> 00:00:59.780
So it's not technically an array,
it's array-like and it's annoying.

15
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.548
That's all I can tell you right now is,
it's really annoying, but it's not.

16
00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:09.525
So for example,
if I wanted to do map or forEach,

17
00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.507
it doesn't work on node
lists which is a bummer.

18
00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:16.306
So you have to use a For loop.

19
00:01:16.306 --> 00:01:18.847
So now, I have a node list of these.

20
00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:23.916
So I can say for(let i=0

21
00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:31.066
is less than h2s.length; i++.

22
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:36.702
And then I could say,
h2s(i).styled.color =,

23
00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:41.489
how about, what's another favorite color.

24
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:49.020
How about papayawhip,
that's another favorite color.

25
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.640
I'm not making this up,
these are actual colors in there.

26
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.375
So now I notice they pretty
much dropped off the page,

27
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:04.950
cuz that's the color papayawhip or
you can do red.

28
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.933
So you can actually see it.

29
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:10.495
So hopefully that answers your question
about how to interact with node list

30
00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:13.629
as you just have to use a for
loop to a loop over them and

31
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.069
then you can interact with
them individually like that.

32
00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.607
Other questions?

33
00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:24.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Someone saying you can
use array.from, so you can do for each.

34
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.064
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I didn't know how
deep in that rabbit hole we can go.

35
00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:36.702
So you can do x = Array.from
is really new JavaScript.

36
00:02:36.702 --> 00:02:39.099
And now, x is actually an array.

37
00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:46.018
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now you can do for
each and map, and all that kind of stuff.

38
00:02:46.018 --> 00:02:48.945
Array.from is you give it some
sort of array like thing and

39
00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:50.810
it turns it into a real array for you.

40
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.535
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How common
is doing stuff like this?

41
00:02:55.535 --> 00:03:01.639
Would you often be changing
stuff on a website

42
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:07.753
via JavaScript, every h2 tag or every div?

43
00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:12.773
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna depend on what
technology your website is using it.

44
00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:16.458
For me,
I tend to use a higher level abstraction.

45
00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.323
Something like angular or
react, or view, or

46
00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:22.710
one of these frameworks
that's built in JavaScript.

47
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.631
In which case,
I never do anything like this, right?

48
00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:29.080
Because basically, the framework handles
all of that low-level interaction for you.

49
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.237
This is the JavaScript equivalent
of working on the metal, right?

50
00:03:32.237 --> 00:03:34.208
We're directly interacting
with the browser.

51
00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:37.188
Normally, there's a layer between you and
the browser.

52
00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:38.724
Normally, I don't know if
I want to say normally.

53
00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:42.535
But for example, I know Mark in particular
loves interacting directly with

54
00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:43.675
the browser, right?

55
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:44.837
So he doesn't use any frameworks.

56
00:03:44.837 --> 00:03:48.681
He's just directly in there just
flipping all that stuff himself.

57
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:51.992
So, I'm gonna say,
if you get a job at most bigger companies,

58
00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.258
not night off, not excuse me, not often.

59
00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:56.860
Because in general, you're gonna
be using some sort of framework.

60
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.700
But I will say that I believe it's
quite vital for you to know how to

61
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.110
do these things, because it will
make you a better programmer.
