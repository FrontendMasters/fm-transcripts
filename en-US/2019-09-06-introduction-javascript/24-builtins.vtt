00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now I've showed you how
to write your own functions, right?

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.120
JavaScript has a bunch of them, just kind
of built in for you, which is really nice.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.990
Right?
Stuff that, like, you're going to do so

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.140
many time charts, just like here,
we're just going to write that for you so

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.410
you don't have to do it every damn time.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.850
So like here, const sentence,
this has weird casing in it.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.935
Also known as,
I did not make this up SpongeBob casing.

8
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:27.440
[LAUGH]
Okay?

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.830
console.log(sentence.toLowerCase), right?

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.766
So sentence is a string, right?

11
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:38.744
So you won't expect a string to
have a function on it, but it does.

12
00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:41.110
It has actually quite
a few functions on it.

13
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.570
One of them is toLowerCase,

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.870
that will take all of, everything inside
of your string and make it lowercase.

15
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.240
So that's why when you log this out,
it has everything in lowercase, right?

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.506
Now, you could probably guess,
toUpperCase works as well.

17
00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:03.544
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
there's just a bunch of those on there.

18
00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:06.741
But the things to be aware
of that you can do, right?

19
00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:11.224
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm a big fan of MDN, which stands for

20
00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:15.840
Mozilla Developer Network, which is
made by the same people that do Firefox.

21
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
It's like the definitive reference for
JavaScript.

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.028
So I would recommend getting
very familiar with that website.

23
00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:24.440
MDN.

24
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's developer.mozilla.org.

25
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.040
It's translated into every language
that you possibly want to know, or

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.030
at least, many.

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.590
So I can come in here and I can say,
toUpperCase, search for it.

28
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.104
And the first thing you're gonna see
is String.prototype.toUpperCase().

29
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:47.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's cool.

30
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.818
I don't know they have workable demos now.

31
00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:53.363
It's even better than it used to be,
right.

32
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.560
Now, if I click Run, it will actually
show me the results of that.

33
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.390
But it'll tell you like,
okay, this is what it does,

34
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.040
this is what the return value is.

35
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.530
It's quite technical because
it is technical documentation.

36
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.690
But I'm constantly referencing this.

37
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.500
I would say this is the best for
learning how things work, what exists,

38
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.390
how to get it to work, and such.

39
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.720
They have lots of examples.

40
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.190
It's good.
