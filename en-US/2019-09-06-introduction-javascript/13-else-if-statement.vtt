00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.077
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To just mess everything up,
I just told you.

2
00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:08.630
[LAUGH] We're gonna we're gonna
put it in a third condition here.

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:17.930
So const friendsAtYourParty equals 10.

4
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.965
So if friendsAtYourParty triple equals 0.

5
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.148
Make this a bit bigger for now.

6
00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:33.946
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Console.log, [LAUGH] Cool.

7
00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:40.417
Now I have all the nachos,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To myself.

8
00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:43.791
I was definitely at a bar and
hungry when I was writing this.

9
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:47.433
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

10
00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:48.645
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's not sad, right?

11
00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:51.380
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.814
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then I'm gonna put

13
00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:58.785
an else if,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: FriendsAtYourParty

14
00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:01.084
is greater than or equal to 4.

15
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:09.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Console.log.

16
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:17.175
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Perfect amount
to play some Mario Kart.

17
00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.229
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Else,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Console.log,

18
00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.619
Wooooooo, play the dance music.

19
00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:38.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

20
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.907
So let's dissect here a little bit.

21
00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:45.020
First of all, introduce you to these
comparator operators, as they're called.

22
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.620
Or you're just asking
another question here,

23
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.880
is friendsAtYourParty greater than or
equal to 4?

24
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.867
This is actually incorrect, I wanted
this to be less than or equal to 4.

25
00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
what's gonna happen here?

26
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.460
So first, all this is asking the question,

27
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.310
how many friends do you
have at your party?

28
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.198
If it's less than or equal to four, if
this value is true, then do this, right?

29
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the question you might
ask yourself, if you have zero, right?

30
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.870
Both of these are true, right?

31
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.940
This would be true and
this would be true, right?

32
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.580
But with if statements are guaranteed
that only one of them.

33
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.790
So if this one gets evaluated is true,
it skips the rest of them, right?

34
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.060
So it's never going to
do multiple of them.

35
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.390
It's just going to find the first
one of those that's true and

36
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.950
then skip the rest of them, right?

37
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.140
So if I refresh here, over here.

38
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.080
If I have ten there then it
says play the dance music.

39
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.445
But if I have four there,
what do you think it's gonna do?

40
00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:04.381
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Perfect amount to play
some Mario Kart, and if I have zero.

41
00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:11.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then you have
all the nachos to yourself,

42
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.368
or if I have one,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or five.

43
00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:24.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's what these,
else if statements are useful for.

44
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.100
It will just go down and

45
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.020
you'll keep asking questions until
it either hits an else block.

46
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.070
And if it gets to an else block
then it just does that, right?

47
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.091
Or if none of them are true and

48
00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.145
you don't have an else block
that just skips all of them.

49
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.607
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So before actually,
in my note, I'm noticing here I

50
00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:45.250
actually have this being greater or
equal to four that is a bug, right?

51
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.858
Cuz now I have this kind of strange
condition where if I put this to be three,

52
00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:58.349
it's gonna say play the dance music,
right?

53
00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.020
Because three is not greater than or
equal to four, and so

54
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.110
then it's going to hit this else block,
right?

55
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.600
But then if I put this as five,

56
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.050
that's gonna say Mario Kart because
it is greater than or equal to four.

57
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.822
So that would be a bug.

58
00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:20.983
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Every time that I have to

59
00:04:20.983 --> 00:04:24.153
do comparisons, I have to sit like
stop and sit there for a while,

60
00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:26.819
I was like wait,
what is this actually trying to do?.

61
00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:27.988
[LAUGH].

62
00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:30.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Math is hard.

63
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.780
So those are conditionals, if statements.

64
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.990
You use these all the time in JavaScript,
and in programming in general.
