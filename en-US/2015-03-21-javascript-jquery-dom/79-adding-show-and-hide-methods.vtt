&gt;&gt; Justin: The final thing to
make your tabs widgets work,

3
00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.310
I'm gonna add a hide and show method.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.020
This one is really easy.

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.370
Hide should just set to display to
none and show should make sure that

6
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.320
there is no, display is set to empty,
so it will show itself again.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.000
JQuery's hide and
show is a little bit more advanced.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.620
It can work even if the element style
in the stylesheet had a display none.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.541
Its hide will work or its show will work
to show it, but I'm not gonna do that.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200
So let me make a hide and show and

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.310
this is the last thing before
we hit elements or events.

12
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.901
So hide should just be doing
this.css display, none and

13
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:58.900
show should be doing this.css
display empty string.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.620
So by setting to the empty string,
or wiping out the display, none,

15
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.730
because maybe in the CSS, someone had
display inline block, display block,

16
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.230
we don't want to overwrite it by assuming
they wrote block or something like that.
