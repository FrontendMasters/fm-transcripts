00:00:03.563 --> 00:00:06.405
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: We're going to start
building our own version of jQuery, and

3
00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:10.011
the first thing we're gonna do is start
building a lot of jQuery's functional

4
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:10.628
utilities.

5
00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:15.281
Hopefully a lot of you've used
dollar extend, or dollar proxy or

6
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.010
dollar make array or dollar each.

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.930
We're gonna be building
our own versions of those,

8
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.600
because we'll be needing them for
when we build more complex things like

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.120
jQuery's html function or
things like that.

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.536
So with the end goal again,

11
00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.560
is we're gonna build this cute
tabs widget with this html.

12
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.880
So, all of this stuff you can find in,
let me go through the setup real quick.

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.824
I'll probably have to go through
it tomorrow again anyways, but

14
00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:55.049
we're starting out,
if you go to the exercises Dom,

15
00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.654
you'll find a my jQueryJS
that's going to look like this.

16
00:01:02.182 --> 00:01:05.292
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: And these are the things
we'll start with implementing dollar

17
00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:09.850
extend today and then we'll leave
pretty everything else to tomorrow.

18
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.760
And then, eventually there's a test page,
too, that you can open.

19
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.164
If you open domtest.html.

20
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.920
So I'm gonna change my JS to Dom up here,
and

21
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.050
I'm gonna go to this to
test the additional.

22
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
This will run all of those tests.

23
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.500
So I'm gonna explain the first exercise,

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.410
and then I'll walk
through again the set up.

25
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.309
So, first exercise is implementing
a small version of jQuery's extend.

26
00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:54.520
jQuery's extend takes one object,

27
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.350
one set of properties and
copies them into another object.

28
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.340
So, it takes one object,

29
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.150
goes through all of its properties and
puts them on another object.

30
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.570
So, if I have a target and

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.010
I have a object, if I call extend

32
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.200
object into target, really, is kinda
how you should read, read it backwards.

33
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.355
It's gonna take what's an object and
copy that into target.

34
00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:25.050
So this is you're gonna
be using a for-in loop.

35
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.820
If you've never used one of those,
ask and we'll show you how to write one.

36
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.870
So essentially, as a result of this,
result should be the same as target, so

37
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.310
it kind of returns the target but
also result in target should both have

38
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.618
the same thing in memory, but
now they have that additional property.

39
00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:49.440
So that's the, so why do you use it?

40
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.510
Essentially, a lot of times it's used for
cleaning up things.

41
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.640
Even in our examples,
that we'll be running on jQuery.

42
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.492
It's nice not to always have to
write $.something = function or

43
00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:06.000
$.prototype.text = function.

44
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.560
Instead you can use $.extend
to kinda clean this code up.

45
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.198
So you don't have to always be
writing dollar each time or

46
00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:15.990
dollar.prototype each time.

47
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.490
It's a nice handy reason
to use dollar extend.

48
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.550
And default values, this is used very
commonly, say I have a move function

49
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.520
that animates one item from
one's position to another one.

50
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.530
And if people don't provide options
from and to, I want default values.

51
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.410
Instead of everywhere from and to
are found, and time, having it kinda like

52
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.040
this, where it checks each individual
place what those defaults are.

53
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.780
Extend is commonly used to copy,

54
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.430
to kind of set up the defaults to change
options so it has the default value,

55
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.140
so you can just write from that point on.

56
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.300
You can just read from options,

57
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.390
cuz it will be setup defaults
if the value wasn't provided.
