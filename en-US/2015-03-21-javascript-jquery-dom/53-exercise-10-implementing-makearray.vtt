00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:08.590
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: Next exercise is
makeArray This get something that's

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.270
array like, and converts it into
a true JavaScript array.tin

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.950
This is super useful because there
despite us are making our dollar each be

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.750
cool with if something is array like or
not, and still will iterate through it.

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.830
No matter what you pass it.

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.105
There's a lot of things that
really need an array to work and

8
00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:34.520
$.makeArray will take whatever it is,
and this is in case a no list and

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.770
run through it and
copy it into a real array.

10
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.828
So anything you pass this that's
array like, that's not really array,

11
00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:45.958
dollar array will make it an array.

12
00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.130
So that's our next exercise.

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.220
You can actually use your new dollar
each to make this a little bit easier.

14
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.560
The task essentially just make sure
these things that are array like

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.440
are coming back as arrays.

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.350
You almost could just cheat and
turn your dollar is array to return true.

17
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.400
And then your test would pass,
but don't do it that way.

18
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.770
So any other questions about how we
implement this, again just to to repeat.

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.760
You really just wanna loop through your
thing that's array like and create another

20
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.660
array and you can just push items into
that array or just add items set array.

21
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.540
There's other trickier ways of doing
this too, where you could still arrays

22
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.050
slice methods but
we're not you know how to do it that way.
