2
00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:07.193
&gt;&gt; Justin: I'm gonna go through
the answer to makeArray.

3
00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:11.575
There's a lot of high performance ways
of doing that that I'm not gonna,

4
00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:15.770
faster performing ways of doing it
that I'm not gonna really go into.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.593
I'm gonna do the most simple I
think to understand explanation.

6
00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:27.017
I'm just going to create an array,
&gt;&gt; Justin: Let

7
00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:28.733
me scroll this up to the top here.

8
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:35.033
And I'm gonna use my $.each,
pass it my array like thing.

9
00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.642
&gt;&gt; Justin: And I'm gonna get the index or
the property, which I'm just gonna call I.

10
00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.342
And I'm gonna get the value.

11
00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:49.782
And I'm just gonna push in,
&gt;&gt; Justin: The value,

12
00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:53.478
&gt;&gt; Justin: And I'm gonna return array.

13
00:00:56.577 --> 00:01:01.795
&gt;&gt; Justin: Stephen asked on
the chat room what happens if this

14
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:07.910
is an object and
not something that's array like?

15
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.290
Can anybody answer that, what they
think would happen with this code here?

16
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.322
If let's say I had an object

17
00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:23.518
that looked like,

18
00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:28.780
foo, bar, zed, ted?

19
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.151
Okay
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It will return an array

20
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:30.780
of values.

21
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.538
&gt;&gt; Justin: It would return an array
of values, what would be in there?

22
00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:35.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bar and ted.

23
00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.021
&gt;&gt; Justin: What?

24
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.441
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bar and ted.

25
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:41.162
&gt;&gt; Justin: Bar and ted,
yeah exactly right, good job.

26
00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:44.705
So this works even if
someone passes an object,

27
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:51.160
it'll return an array of all of the values
on the object and none of the properties.

28
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.832
Which might not be what you want but

29
00:01:52.832 --> 00:01:56.704
mostly typically you're using makeArray
with something that's array like.

30
00:01:56.704 --> 00:02:01.845
Any other questions?

31
00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:08.798
Cool, all right, so
&gt;&gt; Justin: Let me make sure my test

32
00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:13.875
is passing that I actually, I'm showing
you guys how to write it right, awesome.

33
00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:17.415
All right, now for $proxy,

34
00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:22.665
last one of these but
a very useful one to understand.
