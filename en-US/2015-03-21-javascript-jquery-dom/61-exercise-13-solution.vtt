2
00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:07.895
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: I'm gonna go
through the answer in a moment but

3
00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:14.577
first again I'm gonna try to explain
the context for what's going on here.

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.430
This is the breed's page that we're
gonna make eventually show tabs and

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:31.185
in this page it has a bunch of links and
a bunch of allies.

6
00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:36.627
[COUGH] And what I wanna show is how

7
00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:42.940
this HTML function should work.

8
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.927
But actually I just realized I
probably should implement it first,

9
00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:48.649
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: Where did that go?

10
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.587
Here it is.

11
00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:55.275
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: So, if I do new a,

12
00:00:55.275 --> 00:01:01.080
it's gonna give me an object
back with each anchor in it.

13
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.717
And let's say I wanted to
change what would jQuery allows

14
00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:06.995
you to do is I am gonna save this as A.

15
00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:11.291
I am gonna save this as dollar A's.

16
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:16.281
It looks like as.

17
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:19.353
You can see each one of these
things is an element and

18
00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:24.085
elements have all of these properties and
values and one of them is innerHTML.

19
00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:30.875
So if I were to do $as0.innerHTML.

20
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:35.189
That's gonna give me the first
anchors innerHTML, and

21
00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.590
I could also set it to Hi there.

22
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.130
So all elements or

23
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.510
all DOM elements have an innerHTML method
that reads and writes the innerHTML.

24
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.680
The HTML content inside that element.

25
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.260
So it's not just text,
you can also provide markup.

26
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.460
If I were to put like a bolder or
a strong that should make there bold.

27
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.620
So, this is what jQueries
HTML function manipulates for

28
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.330
us, is the innerHTML
properties of these elements.

29
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.790
Now, in fact it might
do things a little bit

30
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.270
more complex than what we're doing here.

31
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.210
But this is a good start to understanding
that the most simple manipulation of

32
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.670
the DOM possible setting innerHTML and
reading from it.

33
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.470
So what we're going to do another thing
that jQuery does is let's say had the same

34
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.482
A's and I got them with my new dollar a's.

35
00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:48.250
jQuery behaves differently when you
call functions as a setter or a getter.

36
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.350
So if I just wanted
the first anchors HTML,

37
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.230
I would call the HTML function
in jQuery without any arguments.

38
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.765
And this would return
Doberman like we just saw,

39
00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:08.070
but jQuery if you pass
it make it a setter.

40
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.560
So if I wanna set everything to like,
hello there, what it's gonna do is change.

41
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.307
It's gonna call this function and
it's gonna for

42
00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:22.282
every single element in
this collection it's going

43
00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:25.810
to update its HTML to, Hello there.

44
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.146
So let's make this work.

45
00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:32.410
So this HTML function,
I mean bring back this, this HTML function

46
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.298
is gonna be called with whatever
arguments are passed here and

47
00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:42.380
it's going to be called with
this inside this function.

48
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.450
Is going to be this what's a left hand
side of the dot the, jQuery collection.

49
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.633
So I can iterate through every item in
the collection because we create our

50
00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:54.990
dollar each and I am gonna get every
element and I am gonna handle this setter.

51
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.810
So by checking if there's arguments.link
I make sure that someone actually

52
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.210
passed an argument to this function and
then I'm gonna enter the setter code.

53
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.466
I'm going to go through each element and
set its innerHTML to the new HTML and

54
00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:15.670
then I returned this just
to make sure that chaining

55
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.266
works because jQuery allows
you to set the innerHTML and

56
00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:25.348
then you could do all this other
kind of crazy stuff like I could

57
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:30.958
buying to every Lynx click method,
when it's clicked by the user.

58
00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.850
We'll see how chains used a little bit.

59
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.310
And then I'm going to handle
the case where arguments stat linked

60
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.050
to 0 because nothing was passed in here.

61
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.190
That means we're doing
the getter on the first item.

62
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.024
So I'm just going to return this

63
00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:53.998
0.innerHTML.
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: Cool.

64
00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:58.122
Any questions about this?

65
00:04:58.122 --> 00:04:59.776
No.

66
00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:01.995
All right.

67
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:08.356
So I wanna make sure this works.
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: Let

68
00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:12.517
me test.
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: Get rid of that

69
00:05:12.517 --> 00:05:14.280
breakpoint, get out of here.

70
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.000
I must have broken proxy.

71
00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:23.874
Because I removed the function.

72
00:05:37.793 --> 00:05:39.862
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: There, my HTML works.

73
00:05:39.862 --> 00:05:40.362
Cool.
