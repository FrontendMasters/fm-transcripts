00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:43.411
Alexis and I,
we do JavaScript consulting for Bitovi and

3
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.127
in the last like seven
years I've been doing this.

4
00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:50.732
We've worked for about 30 different
companies and I've seen so much that

5
00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:55.605
people will start to become a JavaScript
developer but they'll never spend time

6
00:00:55.605 --> 00:01:00.634
really learning the fundamentals to be a
jQuery Developer but never learn the DOM.

7
00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:05.130
So this two day training really
tries to change all of that.

8
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.100
I really love questions,
so people kind of online,

9
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.590
people in the room please at any moment,
you have a question concern just ask it.

10
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.460
I really wanna answer it.

11
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.670
So the agenda for today is we're going to

12
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.960
really be covering for most of the day
covering the basics of JavaScript.

13
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.330
We're gonna talk about

14
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.635
like where JavaScript is kind of like
in the environment of the browser,

15
00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:36.860
would be mostly focused on
JavaScript in the client.

16
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.491
We're gonna talk about JavaScript is a
language with kinda command line thing or

17
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:45.611
commands like if switch that thing.

18
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:49.640
But mostly we're gonna be talking about
types and operators in the beginning

19
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.469
really understanding the data
structures that JavaScript provides and

20
00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.178
kind of how it builds those
structures in memory.

21
00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:59.260
We're gonna talk about the difference
between the double equal and

22
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.310
the triple equal operator.

23
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.670
You're really going to understand it,
the difference exactly and precisely.

24
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.315
We'll have lunch which will be great,
talk about closures,

25
00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:15.850
how lots of every language has a stack and
the closures are very similar to stack.

26
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.207
We're going to understand that difference.

27
00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:23.490
And then we'll talk about what
this means which most people, they

28
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.620
think they understand but really don't and
it's much more simple than you think.

29
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.450
And then, finally, talk about principle
inheritance and we will start our DOM and

30
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.275
jQuery stuff at the very end of today.

31
00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:39.435
And tomorrow will all be about that
resulting in us building that tabs

32
00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.704
which I showed from the first slide.

33
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:46.028
So again, we both work for Bitovi,
if you want to follow us on Twitter,

34
00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:47.830
that's where we are.

35
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.419
We like followers.

36
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.387
Justinbmeyer and alexisabril.

37
00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:56.149
And I was just saying we built
a lot of different applications and

38
00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.518
we do JavaScript consulting training.

39
00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:01.040
And, we do a whole bunch
of open source work.

40
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.830
When we're not talking
about JavaScript and

41
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.850
DOM people want to ask
question about this.

42
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.230
Happy to answer a question
about those as well.

43
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.000
So, at this point everybody
should hopefully be set up.

44
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.056
You should open in your
browser tags that HTML.

45
00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:23.680
So exercises/JS/tags.html and
exercises/JS/test.html.

46
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.290
So I have these open, like this.

47
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.570
Tags will just be blank and the test page

48
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.280
should have a bunch of breaking tests.

49
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.540
And then in your IDE you should have

50
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.390
open tags.html, this will be where
we do our first very small exercise,

51
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.370
just kinda like a almost a hello world.

52
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.930
And then we'll be doing everything else,

53
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.440
almost everything else
today in this my JS.

54
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.857
We'll be building kind of our own
implementation of the dot operator,

55
00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:07.550
the instance of operator,

56
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.420
the new operator making sure we really
understand like how JavaScript works.

57
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.520
So with that let's yes just to show.

58
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.246
I've got these is what they look like

59
00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:29.281
tags of HTML and my underscore js, JS.

60
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:30.180
