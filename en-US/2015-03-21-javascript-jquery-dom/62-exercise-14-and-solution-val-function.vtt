[MUSIC].

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.419
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: Now we're going to
implement the val function which works

3
00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.010
just the same.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.950
The difference is that val
operates on input elements.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.270
So let me show the exercise, and

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.790
then I'll explain the value
property of input elements.

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.740
So we're gonna add a val method that gets
and sets the value of an HTML element.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.190
So if I have an input like this,
I can read its value property like this,

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:39.075
and I can also update its value property.
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: So

10
00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:43.655
for those people who were kind of new,
I'm just gonna go over what

11
00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:48.240
an input element looks like, and
that it has a value property.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.801
So if I just create a input here and
I'll give it an id, age or

13
00:00:54.801 --> 00:01:00.202
something, and
I'll give it a value of 100.

14
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.325
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: If I open up my breeds.

15
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:16.632
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: You can see I have that

16
00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:18.710
100 there.

17
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.505
If I get my age element
&gt;&gt; Justin Meyer: You can

18
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:32.920
see has an input in there, and
you can see I could do that value on it.

19
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.770
It's gonna give me 100.

20
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.340
And if I set that to 200,
it updates the element on the left here.

21
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.320
So, basically you're gonna implement
the exacts just like you HTML,

22
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.920
but instead of the HTML function we did,
it's going to change the value property.

23
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.830
Other than that it's
gona look the exact same.

24
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.230
So this should take not very much time.

25
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.650
So if you could put like
six minutes on the board.

26
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.980
Then we'll break for
lunch right after this I think.

27
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.910
The answer is pretty straight forward for
this one,

28
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.740
because all we're doing is instead of
using innerHTML, we're just using val.

29
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.711
So the easiest thing to do here is just
copy the insides of this function,

30
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:28.655
paste it, and then instead of
setting innerHTML to new HTML,

31
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:34.857
we're gonna set value to new value,
and then return the value.

32
00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:40.066
All right, exact same thing a lot of
jQuery code does this getter setter stuff,

33
00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:42.495
text will be a little bit different.

34
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.928
But, attr and css, half of width,

35
00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:50.622
half of some of these other
functions follow this

36
00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:55.670
exact same pattern,
to make jQuery do what it does.
