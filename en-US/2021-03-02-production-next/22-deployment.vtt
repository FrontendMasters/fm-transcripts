WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.742
Well, so pretty much the last section
here, the last technical one, at least,

2
00:00:04.742 --> 00:00:07.400
where we're going to attempt.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.590
No, we,
we are going to deploy this app to Marcel.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.326
So I already have it deployed but I'll run
through a run through exactly what you

5
00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:20.600
have to do to actually get it to plugs.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.140
There's a couple.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.965
Gotchas around the you know,

8
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:29.830
the Oauth with GitHub and
the database with Atlas.

9
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.148
If you haven't done it before,
if you already set up Atlas,

10
00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:33.470
you actually should be good to go.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.913
And then just,
it's just an environment variables,

12
00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:37.660
this just kind of all over the place.

13
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.190
But other than that,
it's pretty straightforward.

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.880
So let's do that.

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.107
So the first thing you want to do is,

16
00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:51.000
make sure you have the code
that you want obviously.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.415
And one thing got, as I'm talking I
wonder if, if I ran deploy here from

18
00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:59.700
Versailles will deploy my dev branch or
will deploy a master branch.

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.520
I don't know how that works.

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400
We're gonna find out.

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.370
So what we want to do is download the
versal CLR if you don't have it already,

22
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.486
and you can either do yarn global
adversarial or NPM dash g for so

23
00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:17.302
you can even use NPM if you don't want
to install it, whatever your flavor

24
00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:22.350
is just do that and they need to login so
easily versatile login.

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.510
So the CLR is authenticated
with your account.

26
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.980
That obviously means you need
to make an account, oversell.

27
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.770
If you haven't made one, it's very simple.

28
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190
You can go on there, sign in with GitHub.

29
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.910
It's pretty simple.

30
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.490
I can show you mine.

31
00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:41.970
I really like a team of versatile team and
the whole team over there.

32
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.860
And Guillermo is a very
talented fellow too.

33
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.060
Yeah, so this is what you
will see on your dashboard.

34
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.710
If you signed up and made an account.

35
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.393
What we're going to do is if you
notice here on the dashboard,

36
00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:59.090
there's an import project button, and
you can import from a git repository.

37
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.690
We're not gonna do that.

38
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.970
Why are we not gonna do that?

39
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.920
Because it's so easy and it's so nice.

40
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.941
I'm gonna show you the other way to do it,
is this,

41
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.210
I don't need to show you this
way this way is really easy.

42
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.763
You just click import and
you click your project and you're done,

43
00:02:11.763 --> 00:02:14.700
you don't do anything, so
you don't need me to show you that.

44
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.564
I'm gonna show you that,
also a very easy way as well,

45
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:22.630
just not as easy as this, so
that's what I'm gonna do.

46
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.050
Once you have your account.

47
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.455
We don't need to make an app or anything
like that rounded off from the COI so

48
00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:29.250
you can just type in for sale like that.

49
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.023
And then you see mine is
already deploying because I

50
00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:38.915
already have a This is already deployed.

51
00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:39.755
So it's already doing it.

52
00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:43.165
So actually what I'm doing to cancel this,
cancel that.

53
00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:47.695
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to delete my, my verse sales stuff here.

54
00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:53.215
I'm just gonna copy it so I can go back
to it actually, just copy it first.

55
00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.665
And then I'm gonna delete this like that.

56
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.541
And then I'm gonna run vercel again after
I logged in, which I already am and

57
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:04.350
you can see right now it's saying,
set up and deploy this project.

58
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.180
Yes or no, I'm gonna hit yes for
the default, which is in there.

59
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.780
What scope do you want to deploy to?

60
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.510
I wanna deploy to my personal account.

61
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.610
Link to an existing project?

62
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.250
I'm just gonna say no.

63
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.150
I'm just gonna deploy another one.

64
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.780
Gonna make another one for scratch list.

65
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.810
Let's get this thing going.

66
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.550
So I'm gonna say no.

67
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.950
What's your project's name?

68
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.730
I'm gonna call this known curriculum,

69
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.530
or known app, whatever.

70
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.910
I forgot what I called the other one,
so I was trying to think of that.

71
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.830
But I think that one's good.

72
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.580
Which directories are co located in?

73
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.600
It's located in the root.

74
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.025
We're good here so we can hit enter.

75
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:43.870
[COUGH] Setting up the project auto
detected that were Next.js, makes sense.

76
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.980
They did make Next.js.

77
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.875
I will hope they would be
able to figure that out,

78
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:48.970
do I wanna override any of
these settings right here?

79
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.580
The build command, the output directory.

80
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.870
Or the development command.

81
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.622
No, that's already there and our package
dot JSON, if we go look at it, and

82
00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:56.450
you can see what it is.

83
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.097
So I think we're good here, so now it's
gonna try to deploy, so let's go and

84
00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:01.680
do this.

85
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.260
You can see right here it
says it linked my app.

86
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.800
So we're good there.

87
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.248
And then I can click this link so
you can double click If you hold down

88
00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:14.935
command on a URL like that and click
it and it will go to it in a terminal,

89
00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.624
if you didn't know that,
depending on what terminal you're using,

90
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:25.120
I'm just using a regular terminal and
OSX or I'm sorry, Mac or IOS.

91
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.602
Let me get that right.I want
Johnny Ive coming up to me.

92
00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.830
Wait, he doesn't work there anymore.

93
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.830
He's got his own design firm.

94
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.330
Now.

95
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.780
That Airbnb just hired.

96
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.500
I didn't think he designed software or
how does that work?

97
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.680
I don't know.

98
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.850
curious to see how that works.

99
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.709
Anyway, so we're watching this thing
attempt to build I would imagine this

100
00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:51.414
isn't going to build because I don't
have any environment variable setup, but

101
00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:52.450
that's okay.

102
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.840
We just did this first build to
actually create the app on our cell.

103
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.040
So it's there.

104
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.067
Now that we actually
have an app that's there,

105
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:02.930
we can go configure their environment
variables and, and things like that.

106
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.760
Okay, so here we go.

107
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.660
We get a nice little preview.

108
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.470
Let's click on it, look at that,
there's our beautiful design, so good.

109
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.320
But you see the URL is, what is that?

110
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.836
I don't know what that is, ao what we're
gonna do now is we're going to deploy this

111
00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:21.670
to production, which it looks like
it already did the first time.

112
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.550
So I'm gonna click on that and
go to the production URL.

113
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.590
So it already copied it to my clipboard.

114
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.030
So let's do look at that,
that that developer experience is amazing.

115
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.206
They had already copied it to my clipboard
before I knew I even needed it, okay.

116
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:39.456
[LAUGH] So here's the production version,

117
00:05:39.456 --> 00:05:42.720
the version we saw before it
was like a preview version.

118
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.980
So not to be confused with the preview
content that we talked about.

119
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.930
But versaille also has preview apps or
preview deployments.

120
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.505
Which, if you just run Versa from
your app, it'll deploy into preview

121
00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:59.480
unless it's the first time like
we just did it did all of them.

122
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.132
And or if you connect to GitHub
every time you do a PR and you and

123
00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:08.170
you add a vertical integration, it will
Build your site on a preview branch.

124
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.705
Then it'll take screenshots of every
page that changed since master and

125
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:17.385
it'll post them in your PR, like here's
the visual changes of the pages,

126
00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:18.820
which is really cool.

127
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.338
And then anyone who's reviewing that
PR can click on the link to look at our

128
00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:24.130
preview of that page.

129
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.170
Which is also very cool.

130
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.830
So that's a different preview than
the previews that we walked through but

131
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.650
also a preview.

132
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.582
Okay, so all this is good, if I click sign
up, I'll et this is just gonna just, yeah,

133
00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:36.190
exactly.

134
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.210
And that's because we don't have
any environment variables or

135
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.600
any of that stuff set up,
so we can do that now.

136
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.650
So let's do that.

137
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.550
So I'll go to, wait, how am I going to do
this without you all seeing it though?

138
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.770
Alright, how to delete that GitHub
app anyway, it's not a big deal.

139
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.543
So here's what we'll do, so what we'll
do is we go to our app, actually,

140
00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:03.710
now we're at the point where we're
going to add an environment rebels.

141
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.964
We can go to the one that already
have since it's already here and

142
00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:07.700
you can kind of see it.

143
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.170
So Basically, you click on the app,
I'm gonna to some that I already have.

144
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.690
And you click on Settings, okay?

145
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.886
You click on Environment Variables,

146
00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:22.580
I would say this Environment Variable
form is actually pretty legit.

147
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.550
But basically, what you can do here
is you gotta add a couple things.

148
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.602
And I listed them Here for better context,
but basically what we need to do is take

149
00:07:31.602 --> 00:07:35.820
the stuff that we have locally added here,
but only specific environments.

150
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.820
Let me go back to where I was here,
so we need a next off URL and

151
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.863
this is going to be only for a production
environment and versatile because

152
00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:49.985
you get to choose what environment you
want to add an environment variable to

153
00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:55.528
production is When you deploy to prod
previews, when you just deploy regularly.

154
00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:59.628
And development is you can actually
pull down vessels environment

155
00:07:59.628 --> 00:08:05.110
that they have on vessels for your project
and run it locally on your computer.

156
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.630
Which is pretty legit, so now everyone in
your team doesn't need to add a .env file.

157
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.264
You can just configure them here and

158
00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:15.180
you can pull down Vercel's environment
on your local machine, run there.

159
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.091
A lot of hosting providers do that, I
think that looks like something like this

160
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:21.860
too, which is pretty legit, so I'm glad
to see that people are doing that.

161
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.120
So then you need to add, like I said,
the next URL, this is for the next author.

162
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.362
And it's really just going to be
the URL of your production app that

163
00:08:31.362 --> 00:08:32.730
Purcell gave you.

164
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.600
So most likely be the name of
your app dot versal dot app.

165
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.494
Basically, they need
the next public next URL,

166
00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:45.820
which is the exact same thing as this, but
we got to put that public prefix on it.

167
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.300
Because we're going to be using it
inside of the client, that's it.

168
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.980
So he got put the next public on it and
that again is only for production.

169
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.278
And then we need to do the same thing,
literally create the same two variables we

170
00:08:57.278 --> 00:09:00.980
did before except for
these go to preview and development.

171
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.411
Instead of hard coding it
to the production one,

172
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:11.130
we're gonna set it equal to whatever the
versal URL system environment variable is.

173
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.790
So whatever that is,
we're gonna point it to that.

174
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.004
And the reason we do that is because
your preview URL can be different every

175
00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:19.330
single time.

176
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.170
It's a dynamic URL.

177
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.910
We don't know what it is, so
we have to say, well, the author URLs,

178
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.229
whatever the current URL is that versal
assigned to us when it's in preview mode

179
00:09:28.229 --> 00:09:29.640
or development mode.

180
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.500
I don't know, Right?

181
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.094
So that's what that is database URL,

182
00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:37.820
I'm just using the same database
URL across all environments.

183
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.974
But if you're going to do this right, you
will probably have a different database

184
00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:43.450
for production a different database for
a preview.

185
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.850
It really depends on your stack.

186
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.890
I kept this simple.

187
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.760
I just added a database URL for
all GitHub secret GitHub ID.

188
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.341
This is where I said,
you have to go to GitHub,

189
00:09:54.341 --> 00:09:59.170
make a entirely new GitHub OAuth client.

190
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.104
And you have to add,
you have to update your callback URL and

191
00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:04.430
actually show you what that looks like.

192
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:10.115
Because it's no longer going to be It's
no longer going to be local host one,

193
00:10:10.115 --> 00:10:11.770
two, three, four.

194
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.693
You can't do that anymore,
so you have to do this.

195
00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:25.860
Developer settings,
OAuth Apps There we go.

196
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.783
So you can see the callback URL is
now gonna be whatever your production

197
00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:34.990
URL that URL gave you,
/app/auth/callback/github.

198
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.550
You have to put that now you have to
put that full thing because now GitHub

199
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.510
isn't gonna be lenient on you because
you're not localhost anymore.

200
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.050
Always lean on us cuz we were localhosts.

201
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.430
And it was like, yeah, localhost, we don't
care, as long as the localhosts are good.

202
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.600
This ain't localhost anymore, so
you've gotta put the full path here.

203
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.310
And this is the path that next
auth URL tells us to put.

204
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.049
If you go look at their docs,

205
00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:02.912
they specifically say it's gonna be
/auth/callback/ whatever provider.

206
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.490
Prefixed by whatever app you're on.

207
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.444
So it's very specific, so you gotta make
it and like I said, you gonna make one of

208
00:11:11.444 --> 00:11:15.620
these for every single post that you
are running your app on the GitHub.

209
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.250
Other providers like Google
know how to do that.

210
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.960
They had a list of these things.

211
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.330
And as long as any one of them works,
we're good.

212
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.255
Not GitHub, maybe they'll get it together,
I don't know, so you've got those.

213
00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:30.739
JWT_SECRET, literally put whatever you
want, I've got cookie_monster here.

214
00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:35.874
And then NEXTAUTH_URL,
which is basically the same thing as,

215
00:11:35.874 --> 00:11:38.486
do I have this in there twice?

216
00:11:38.486 --> 00:11:41.189
No, so this one's for production,
that has a production,

217
00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:43.690
and this one just points
at the VERCEL_URL.

218
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.000
So looks like we're good there.

219
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.350
And then now you should be good to go.

220
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.338
So if I go and actually look at this
thing I don't know what this is gonna

221
00:11:54.338 --> 00:11:58.508
look like I've messed the database up so
much since then.

222
00:11:58.508 --> 00:11:59.690
Wow.

223
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.835
Thank you

224
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.230
Okay, there it is, so yeah, so
it looks like we're still good.

225
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.940
I'm using the same data that
I had on the local database.

226
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.869
So looks like it's all good they're,
staying, or

227
00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:18.980
I don't know, maybe it's not good.

228
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.791
Looks like it's freaking out,
let's refresh that thing, there it is,

229
00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:28.490
yeah, that was the I think that was
the cold start from the lambdas.

230
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.471
So, the first time a lambda starts it,
there's a lot of overhead for

231
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.200
an initial start of a lambda.

232
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.142
So believe it or not one strategy
is to have like a service,

233
00:12:38.142 --> 00:12:42.470
pinging your lambdas on
an interval to keep them warm.

234
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.250
Yeah, that's a thing.

235
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.560
There's actually services you can pay for
that will do that for you.

236
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.582
Anyway, so yeah, looks like here's
that same state that I had locally,

237
00:12:51.582 --> 00:12:53.010
cuz I was using the same database.

238
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:58.070
So yeah, looks like everything
works here pretty good.

239
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.160
And I think that's gonna
be able deployment.

240
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.271
I mean, that's pretty much it, the only
thing I talked about before is if you do,

241
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:06.775
you wanna deploy the prod
after the initial Push,

242
00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:10.000
you have to do dash dash prod
to go to prod with for sale.

243
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.923
But honestly, you should just be
doing the GitHub integration anyway,

244
00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:17.268
the only reason I recommend doing
the wsl one is for instance,

245
00:13:17.268 --> 00:13:20.418
you want a complete nice ci flow
with like GitHub actions or

246
00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:23.664
Travis CI or circle ci or
whatever flavor of ci that you use.

247
00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:28.027
And you have, all your deploy Stuff there
or you have some, you know, team at your

248
00:13:28.027 --> 00:13:32.455
company that handles deploys and it's all
through slack or whatever, then yeah,

249
00:13:32.455 --> 00:13:36.470
you'll probably need to see a live but
this is you and you got that control.

250
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.750
I would just do the GitHub integration
it's way cleaner, way nicer.
