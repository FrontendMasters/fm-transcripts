00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.750
All right, so now, we're gonna go to
one of my favorite things about next.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.230
Yes, I love this one.

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.145
This is such an amazing feature that's
going to be previewing your content or

4
00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:14.603
what I would like to say,
try before you buy.

5
00:00:14.603 --> 00:00:16.055
So.

6
00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:21.075
If this has happened to you
then you can definitely relate.

7
00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.801
Have you ever published or
when I say published,

8
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:28.390
like you pushed something to master,
you merged something in with some content,

9
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.250
maybe in the landing page that
maybe shouldn't been there.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.190
Maybe as a blog post was too early,
some content that wasn't approved yet.

11
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.240
Or maybe you really just,

12
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.249
you're not good at spelling like me
when it comes to spelling and typing and

13
00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.190
it was just really ugly, but whatever it
was Friday afternoon, so you didn't care.

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.949
So, being able to preview
content on your site before that

16
00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.540
content goes live is a beautiful thing.

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.998
And this is again, this is why I was
trying to warm you all up to the concept

18
00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:01.121
of using a CMS and something like Next.js.

19
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:05.490
Because if you look at all their features,
they're all built around using a CMS.

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.597
They're really encouraging you to use
some type of way to manage your content,

21
00:01:09.597 --> 00:01:12.050
because of all the benefits
you get from that and

22
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.090
this preview feature is no different.

23
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.940
In fact, it's literally built for a CMS.

24
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.023
It's what I would call,
I had a name for it here,

25
00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:23.070
I made it up when I was writing it,
so it's not coined yet.

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.580
But it's basically like a feature that
it's not meant for you as a developer.

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.630
It's meant for like a CMS to
implement it so you can use it.

28
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.800
That's what this feature is meant for,
but we're going to use it anyway.

29
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.674
It's just going to be very raw,
we're still going to use it so

30
00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:39.070
you understand how it works.

31
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.860
But the preview feature by design
is meant for a CMS to implement.

32
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.608
So, you can use it through
the CMS because without a GUI,

33
00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:48.350
that preview feature
kind of just falls apart.

34
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.980
But you can build your own GUI.

35
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.510
But if you had a CMS,
the CMS would be your GUI.

36
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.848
Okay, so basically Next.js allows us to
preview content, so you might be asked, so

37
00:01:56.848 --> 00:01:58.240
what does that even mean?

38
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.860
We need preview content on
my contents hard coded.

39
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.760
Well, yeah,
if your content was hard coded,

40
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.679
then this doesn't really help you,
I guess.

41
00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.440
[LAUGH] I mean,
you could still get away with it.

42
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.832
I guess you could, if I'm in preview
show this JSX versus this JSX but

43
00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.960
that's kind of gross.

44
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.580
This is specifically for
previewing content.

45
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.424
And it kind of does this very cleverly,

46
00:02:18.424 --> 00:02:23.200
what it does is you can create
an API route in Next.js.

47
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200
And all you have to do is just use this
little helper function they give you which

48
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.518
basically sets a cookie in your browser
that says, hey, I'm in preview mode.

49
00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:34.330
And that's it, that's really it.

50
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.058
And with that cookie,
we can access that cookie inside of

51
00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:42.145
our server-side functions and
we can do different things.

52
00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.725
Like, wow, this cookie is set to true.

53
00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.985
Maybe now I'll make a request to
my CMS to get draft content and

54
00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:49.625
not publish content, right?

55
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.804
So, just that little Boolean there allows
us to be a little more smart about how we

56
00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:55.535
fetch content from our sources.

57
00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:57.205
So, now I can look for that draft.

58
00:02:57.205 --> 00:03:00.254
So, what we're going to do is we're
going to go back to all the pages.

59
00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:05.620
So, the home index page, the blog
index page, and the slug index page.

60
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.190
And we're going to refactor
them to be aware of previews.

61
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.837
And then, we're also going to
actually create previews in here.

62
00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:14.327
And then, we're going to try them out.

63
00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.633
And you're going to see what I'm
saying why you kind of need a CMS or

64
00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.540
even your own GUI to actually
really get the benefit of it.

65
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.617
Because otherwise you have to
do this stuff very manually, and

66
00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:24.730
it's really not gonna help anybody.

67
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.991
So, let's do that.

68
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.030
Any questions before I start?

69
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.190
&gt;&gt; By the way,
you talked about the preview feature.

70
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.818
Is it possible for anyone to tailor
that feature to use it like in a QA

71
00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:39.477
environment or something like that?

72
00:03:39.477 --> 00:03:44.639
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, like I said,
the missing part is the GUI.

73
00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.770
So, if you wanna build your own GUI for
that allows someone in your organization.

74
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.120
Let's say once you get the authentication,
this will make more sense.

75
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.958
But let's say hey, if someone,

76
00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.899
if I detect that someone from our
organization is logged into this app,

77
00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.198
show them this button right
here that says, QA or preview.

78
00:04:01.198 --> 00:04:06.480
And then, that shows the same page but
with different data that's not public yet.

79
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.182
Yeah, you could totally do that.
