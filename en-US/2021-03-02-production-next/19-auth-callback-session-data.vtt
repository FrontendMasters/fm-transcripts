WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.779
So we just finished setting
up all of the we just

2
00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.424
finished setting up all
of the database calls for

3
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:17.350
our git server side
props inside of our app.

4
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.960
Get serviced by props function.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890
So now what we're gonna do
is basically make this work.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.220
This isn't really gonna work right now.

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.645
Okay, so now what we need to do is we
need to go back to our next off, so

8
00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:31.541
we can set up like some
callback stuff here.

9
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:36.011
That's basically going to set up some
mock for like a brand new getting

10
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.482
Started folder and getting started
document when a new user signs up so

11
00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:46.220
they actually have something on their
account versus nothing on their account.

12
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.530
So let's do that.

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.085
The way we can do that as we can use
what's called callbacks inside the next

14
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.980
auth config, so we have one here
that adds to it to the session,

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.850
which is what we need.

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.467
That's really cool and the other
one is going to basically going to

17
00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:06.850
check to see if it's a new user and
it's going to do this stuff.

18
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.984
It's going to basically
create a new folder and

19
00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:14.070
it's gonna create a document
that's got some content in it.

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.024
I'm actually just gonna copy this content
here because that part is extremely has

21
00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:23.380
nothing to do with code as it's
like how to structure the editor.

22
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.270
See the editor in a minute why
the content looks like that.

23
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.300
It's pretty impressive editor actually,
let's head over to our code.

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.350
So we'll go into the API/uth/Next off.

25
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.533
There we go and then we'll go here and
we'll say callbacks, like that.

26
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:43.239
And the callbacks if you go look
at the docs here, you can see,

27
00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:47.947
you can have callbacks for all these
things sign in redirect session data jwt,

28
00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:52.680
and they kind of tell you for each single
one, we're gonna do one for session.

29
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.051
And the one we're gonna have a session
again, is this going to add the session,

30
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:02.230
or the user id to the session id, the
session id is basically the jwt payload.

31
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.720
So, whatever we put here on this session,
object,

32
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.299
that's gonna get passed to JJ vt object
right here as his first parameter.

33
00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.863
So the session already has like
an email and stuff on it but

34
00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:14.870
we wanna get the user ID.

35
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.630
So that's what we're gonna do, so
I'm gonna say, session like that.

36
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.208
And this is gonna be this session,
which is a jadibooti payload, really,

37
00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:23.940
this is the user.

38
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.280
And then I'm just going to say
session.user.id is that, and

39
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.300
then it's gonna return the session.

40
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.540
So now we have the ID of the user on
our session, or basically jwt here.

41
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.162
So we're good there,
the next one I'm gonna do is jwt, and

42
00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:43.680
this one has a full list
of different things.

43
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.093
We have a token payload, user, account,

44
00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:53.377
profile, and is and
the user so RSA token payload.

45
00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:58.666
User account profile is basically what

46
00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:05.890
we're gonna do here is
we'll connect our database.

47
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.380
So I'll say DB equals await,

48
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.461
connect to the DB like that and

49
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.045
we'll make this sync like that.

50
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:23.668
And then I wanna say
if you are a new user,

51
00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:28.783
if you are a new user is the user
Then I'm gonna go ahead and

52
00:03:28.783 --> 00:03:33.261
create you a folder,
I'm gonna say new folder and

53
00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:37.952
that's gonna equal await
folder.createfolder,

54
00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:40.850
why is this thing freaking out?

55
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.991
Can I give you a modifier?

56
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.780
I thought you were auto importing for
me, I guess not,

57
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.950
like having worked sometimes and
it just doesn't.

58
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.670
Want to work ever?

59
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.319
I don't know why.

60
00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.520
So we got DB/dB.

61
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.710
I think that works and then connects.

62
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.100
Now we got folder, and then we got duck.

63
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.840
Okay, put it in there twice, there we go.

64
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.126
Already, so
we got create folder takes in database and

65
00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:20.192
then it takes in an object
that has a created by and

66
00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:23.540
then a name, so let's do that.

67
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.639
So created by is gonna be the user Id,

68
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.415
all right, I think we can even do.

69
00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:38.856
Let's try that If not,
we'll do a session.user.id either way,

70
00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:45.068
and then name will just be we'll just
call this your getting started folder.

71
00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:48.083
There we go so we got our new folder and
then we'll create a new doc.

72
00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:53.728
So doc, actually I'll need
to get the result of that,

73
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:58.653
so I'll just say doc and
then doc.createdoc.

74
00:04:58.653 --> 00:05:02.404
This takes a db and it actually takes
in a document, which has a created by.

75
00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:06.415
Which will be again user.id and

76
00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:10.710
then it has a folder which
will be a new folder dot ID.

77
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.003
And then we have a name we'll call this,

78
00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:21.763
start here, and
then it has some content and

79
00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:25.820
that content already copied.

80
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.498
This looks weird as content, but
we're using like this rich text editor or

81
00:05:34.498 --> 00:05:38.382
what I would call like a block based
editor where all the content are blocks

82
00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:39.530
just like notion.

83
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.156
It looks and feels like notion but
not as not as good.

84
00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:46.783
So all of them are like representatives
blocks that makes it portable.

85
00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:50.186
So this is actually what content looks
like so I just pasted that in there.

86
00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:54.375
How did I get this, I went into
the editor that you'll see in a minute,

87
00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:58.330
I made some content and
I copied and pasted it here.

88
00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.570
That's how I got this.

89
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.404
The editor that we're gonna be
using is called editor JS and

90
00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:08.466
they have like example
content on their website to

91
00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:12.930
that's you can get the example
concert there as well.

92
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.659
But it kind of looks like this
you could do some crazy stuff and

93
00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.200
the output looks like this.

94
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.130
So I basically can't just
copy some of that, okay.

95
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.556
All right, so now that we got that
listing is telling me to continue,

96
00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:34.716
so I'm just going to delete
my user out of my database.

97
00:06:34.716 --> 00:06:36.765
So that's what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna go to collections.

98
00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:42.170
Let this thing load up.

99
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.430
I'm pretty sure I'm connected to database
because i don't have my local one running.

100
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.940
I didn't look at my secrets because
I don't want y'all still know.

101
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.110
So I don't know what
database I'm connected to.

102
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.346
So I think I'm connected to this one.

103
00:06:51.346 --> 00:06:56.899
You're hacking, alright, so

104
00:06:56.899 --> 00:07:04.930
I'm a delete accounts go ahead and
drop that.

105
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.547
Yeah, get out of here and
then I'm gonna delete these users.

106
00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:10.382
How are you?

107
00:07:10.382 --> 00:07:15.292
All right, so
I'm just gonna just start this thing

108
00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:19.527
again looks like there
was an error anyway.

109
00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:26.225
So let's see what happens
next off 27 can't read fine.

110
00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:30.554
So we'll just say if user we can do that.

111
00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:33.968
Let's see what happens there.

112
00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.310
Okay, boom.

113
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.710
All right so looks like it worked.

114
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.882
We're still seeing hello cuz
I'm pretty sure I've still got

115
00:07:51.882 --> 00:07:53.357
that mock content in there.

116
00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:56.146
So let's go take out that mock content and
actually use those props.

117
00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:57.767
So where am I doing those folders at?

118
00:07:57.767 --> 00:08:03.917
Right here, so I'll get rid of this and
I'll put folders for

119
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:08.017
the sake of not watching me debug this for

120
00:08:08.017 --> 00:08:14.044
the next however long I'm just
going to put what I had here,

121
00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:18.525
which I know is right so
I tested all of this.

122
00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:20.306
Here, there we go.

123
00:08:24.012 --> 00:08:28.015
I don't wanna be sitting here all day
doing this got other stuff to learn?

124
00:08:30.257 --> 00:08:30.912
Okay.

125
00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:36.256
All right, now let's try that.

126
00:08:41.483 --> 00:08:42.354
Hey, there we go.

127
00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.573
Yeah, there was something
wrong in my code somewhere.

128
00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:46.150
Look that did it right that first time.
