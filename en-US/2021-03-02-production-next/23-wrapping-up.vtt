00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.773
Last thing is literally, congrats.

2
00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:05.784
You've made it this far.

3
00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:08.060
This was a hard course.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.149
This was a hard course to make.

5
00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.363
So thanks for sticking with me.

6
00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:17.546
I hope you all learned whatever
you needed to learn to get

7
00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:22.518
your next JS apps out to the world so
people can use it.

8
00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:27.733
I would say, after knowing all of this
stuff, you pretty much know everything

9
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:32.800
you need to know to actually have
a production ready, Next.js app.

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.393
The only thing I would say is
probably they're like testing, and

11
00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:38.940
I was gonna cover testing,
but I just felt like

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.340
there was nothing unique about testing
to Next.js that wasn't really React.

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.310
So I kinda felt like it
just wasn't unique enough.

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.083
So I would say maybe brush
up on some testing there.

15
00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:52.310
Other than that, you know everything.

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.690
I mean, a lot of people don't even
know what the preview feature.

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.181
Y'all know how to make previews now,
so you're good.

18
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:02.054
Last thing I wanna talk about here is just
some cool stuff that I was mentioning

19
00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:03.032
throughout the project.

20
00:01:03.032 --> 00:01:04.633
I talked about SWR.

21
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:08.300
SWR I think it stands for
stale-while revalidate,

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.482
I think that's what it stands for,
yeah, [LAUGH] that's right there.

23
00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:17.850
It's a cache invalidation
strategy popularized by this RFC.

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.784
If you fancy those docs, go look at it.

25
00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:24.433
But basically, the Vercel team made
this as well I'm pretty sure, and

26
00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:29.560
it's a hook that allows you to, it does so
much for you in such a small package.

27
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.540
But basically, it's meant for
client side data fetching.

28
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.280
So in this case, this person is
making a API call to /api/user.

29
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670
But this right here has nothing
to do with the API call.

30
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.650
This is actually just a key to the cache.

31
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.301
And it's smart to just use
the route that you're going to.

32
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:51.740
So basically what's gonna happen is
SWR is gonna execute this function,

33
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.840
get the result of it, and
store it in the cache at this key.

34
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.230
And then anywhere else in your
app if you want to access.

35
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.491
If you have this again, anywhere else in
your app, it'll check the cache first, and

36
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.366
it'll get it and you can change the
policies on how you want that to behave.

37
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:09.032
You can say I want it to always go
to cash, or go to cache first, and

38
00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:12.060
then go to the network,
different things like that.

39
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.130
It also does that thing where you can
focus and not focus on the window.

40
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.530
So if I click away and come back,
let me get it, again, it syncs tabs.

41
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.936
So if you have the same app
opened up in multiple tabs,

42
00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:24.870
it'll sync them all together.

43
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.764
So if one person makes a change here, for
instance, if this query gets updated on

44
00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:32.690
one tab of your app, it's gonna get
updated on all the tabs of your app.

45
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.770
Which is pretty crazy,
really, really insane.

46
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.680
So SWR, a really nice tool.

47
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.384
Another one is react query which is
pretty much the same thing as SWR

48
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:50.800
just a different flavor, but
it tries to accomplish the same thing.

49
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.012
I have more experience with react query.

50
00:02:53.012 --> 00:02:56.765
But I know SWR is also really legit, but
they both kind of do the same thing.

51
00:02:56.765 --> 00:03:00.673
So yeah, highly recommend taking
a look at both of these for

52
00:03:00.673 --> 00:03:04.909
your client side data fetching needs,
also mutations as well.

53
00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.775
React remix, this is something
that's kinda like Next.js, I think,

54
00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:11.622
but I haven't used it yet.

55
00:03:11.622 --> 00:03:15.433
I'm probably just gonna reach out to
Michael Jackson in them to see if I

56
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.400
can actually get a hold of it.

57
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.660
I think I can see dots that he uses, so I
might hit him up and see what he's saying.

58
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.771
But yeah, this is basically,
I looked at the docs a little bit,

59
00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.480
I heard a little bit about it.

60
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.890
But it costs money that's
why I haven't used it.

61
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.020
But I mean, they deserve it.

62
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.880
This is seems like an amazing
piece of technology.

63
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.054
Just from reading it, it kinda seems like
a Next.js approach to building frameworks,

64
00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:43.050
but I think they do some
stuff on the edge too.

65
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.280
So it's like a service and
a framework put together.

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.903
But it's just nice to see what Next.js
did is sparking like a new wave of, wow,

67
00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:52.180
we actually need full stack apps.

68
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.360
We need full stack apps.

69
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.060
Static, I personally
think static is dying.

70
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.774
I would never reach for
a static site generator today.

71
00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.625
I wouldn't do it.

72
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.755
Because it's very,very limiting.

73
00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:07.708
I don't know why I would
only build static today,

74
00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:10.750
when I could do something like this or
in Next.js.

75
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.800
So that's just me.

76
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.130
Yeah, this is some project.

77
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.058
So hey, if you get access to this,
let me know on Twitter how you like it,

78
00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.314
I'm very curious about that.

79
00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:24.033
I just put it there cuz why not?

80
00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:28.615
Obviously I'm gonna talk about my
product type, it's a headless CMS.

81
00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:31.384
Sign up for access, I will put
you on top of the list, you could

82
00:04:31.384 --> 00:04:35.059
pretty much use it literally today if you
sign up for it, just hit me up on Twitter,

83
00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.190
let me know you signed up in your
email and I'll give you access to it.

84
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.790
It only works with Next.js right now.

85
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.337
So we've worked very closely
with the Next.js team and

86
00:04:42.337 --> 00:04:44.350
Vercel to make a really tight integration.

87
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.160
So hopefully It turns out [LAUGH] good.

88
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.580
So yeah,
let me know if you wanna check that out.

89
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.470
And another CMS that I respect and
I think is really legit, is Sanity.

90
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.700
I really like these guys.

91
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.910
The team behind this is
doing a really good job.

92
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.519
So yeah, check them out.

93
00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:07.290
I would say If I wasn't using Type, Sanity
would be the CMS that I would use for

94
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.180
my projects.

95
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.372
So yeah, check them out,
really nice project here.

96
00:05:11.372 --> 00:05:13.343
Every other CMS is pretty good,

97
00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:17.630
but I think Sanity's the only one
that's kinda got it figured out.

98
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.991
Other than that, that's all I got.

99
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:25.093
What I recommend for further learning
towards Next.js, so typically what

100
00:05:25.093 --> 00:05:30.192
I like to do when I wanna really get
comfortable with a framework, Is you have

101
00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:35.635
to set like a goal that's just slightly
out of your reach to accomplish, right?

102
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:39.367
You can't be like,
I just wanna learn something.

103
00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:40.184
And that's your objective.

104
00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:42.170
Your objective should be
to like build something,

105
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.979
it should be some output
that can be measured.

106
00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.542
And the thing that you're trying to build
should be slightly out of your comfort

107
00:05:47.542 --> 00:05:48.190
zone, okay?

108
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.680
Like it shouldn't be so far out of your
comfort zone that you give up on it.

109
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.078
But it should be enough to where it's
gonna require you to research, and

110
00:05:53.078 --> 00:05:54.231
it's gonna require you to think.

111
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:58.264
So I would say, think of an app that's
slightly out of your comfort zone,

112
00:05:58.264 --> 00:06:01.907
something you haven't tried,
something that you wanns try, and

113
00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:03.423
build that with next.js.

114
00:06:03.423 --> 00:06:06.625
And then increase the difficulty and
build it again, you do that three times,

115
00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:09.740
you're gonna feel pretty
comfortable with any technology.

116
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.028
And that's pretty much kind of how I like
to do things when learning, to set that

117
00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:18.198
goal slightly outside of your region,
and then go for it, see what happens.

118
00:06:18.198 --> 00:06:21.917
Eventually you'll learn that technology,
because there's one thing to know like how

119
00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:23.939
something works and
then how to use something.

120
00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.734
I think what's really important is
really knowing how to use something.

121
00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:30.723
If that's all you ever did,
I think you'd go really far.

122
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:35.299
And then when it comes down to
learning how something works,

123
00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:37.013
I think that pays off.

124
00:06:37.013 --> 00:06:40.176
That's what I call likes
it's a quiet superpower.

125
00:06:40.176 --> 00:06:43.065
It doesn't really, no one actually sees
that power that you actually know how

126
00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:46.000
something works cuz you don't really
get to show it off that much.

127
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.214
But it does pay off because all of
a sudden, you seem to fix things that

128
00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:53.858
people can't fix or
you move slightly faster than people.

129
00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:58.440
But they know how to use the technology as
well, they just don't know how it works.

130
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.220
So as long as everything's going smooth,
they're doing pretty good as well.

131
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.135
So I will say probably focus on just
getting really good at using something,

132
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:09.008
and then if you wanna go back
to understand how it works,

133
00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:10.460
do that much later.

134
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.330
Do not get stuck on how something
works before you use it.

135
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.250
None of us had to learn how a car
work before we got our license.

136
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.585
You got your license and you drove, and

137
00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.840
you probably still don't
know how an engine works.

138
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.442
And that's meant by design.

139
00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.413
[LAUGH] It's totally fine.

140
00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:29.500
So learn to use this framework, learn to
be good at it, learn to be productive.

141
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.640
If that's boring to use, you're so good.

142
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.778
Then go back and see how it works.

143
00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:35.915
Go look at the source code, you'll
have way much more context to actually

144
00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:37.495
understand it at that point anyway.

145
00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:40.747
Ask some questions, reach out to the
Vercel team, reach out to the Next team,

146
00:07:40.747 --> 00:07:41.793
ask them how they did it.

147
00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:43.950
They'll show you, but
you kinda wanna be ready for that.

148
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.173
So have the context,
know how to use the framework, and

149
00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:47.320
that will take you very far.

150
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.178
And with that, that's all I got.

151
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.310
So I wanna thank you all for
coming to the course.

152
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.950
I hope you got a lot from it.

153
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.680
And I will see y'all on the next one.

154
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.717
Feel free to reach,

155
00:07:57.717 --> 00:08:01.500
I try to respond to every single
person that hits me up on Twitter.

156
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.940
I literally will hop on and
pair with people.

157
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.030
I do that a lot.

158
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.730
I'll just hop on a pair of people
help them out with random stuff.

159
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.321
Like I had someone mix me up with someone
else, and they thought I was someone else,

160
00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:15.063
and I still hopped on a pair of with them,

161
00:08:15.063 --> 00:08:18.218
to see if I can help him get past some
bugs in a language that I don't know.

162
00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:21.176
And we did not get past it, but I tried.

163
00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:24.061
So if I have time, I'll do it.

164
00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:27.705
So just hit me up if there's something
you need if I didn't get across today or

165
00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:29.791
if the question comes up later, I'm here.

166
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:31.260
I try to respond as much as I can.

167
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.950
And I just like doing that stuff.

168
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.570
Well, all right, like I said,
I am open and willing to answer anything.

169
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.460
Just hit me up, and
again thanks for coming.
