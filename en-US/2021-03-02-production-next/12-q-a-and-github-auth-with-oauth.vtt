1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.277
The question was, is this process
as easy as with other providers?

2
00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:06.677
So the only difference
between what we just did and

3
00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:10.490
what you do other providers is how you
had to go in and make your own app.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.216
So I'm speaking from experience, Githubs
process of making OAuth app that I just

5
00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:19.805
showed you is one of the easiest Google's
process is a little more difficult but

6
00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:24.256
Google's way more flexible as it allows
you to add multiple callback URLs and

7
00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:25.100
not just one.

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.687
So as you'll see when we deploy it, we're
not gonna have to go make another GitHub

9
00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:35.410
for a deployed version coz we can't use
that same one for more than one host.

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.102
So it's kind of not good.

11
00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:40.636
Where it gives us, yeah, you guys made
you want So that was pretty nice.

12
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:45.730
Facebook's Facebook is
a little more difficult.

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.399
Facebook is very involved with their
process, but it's all the same, right?

14
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.480
They're all OAuth.

15
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.840
So you have a client ID,
you have a client secret.

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.800
You go in there you go and
you go on that platform.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.227
You make out the app and
you do what they tell you to do.

18
00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:00.810
And that's it.

19
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.477
Once you got those credentials,
it's the same thing.

20
00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:05.017
&gt;&gt; Just a commentary.

21
00:01:05.017 --> 00:01:08.212
AWS kognito is the most hard one.

22
00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:11.230
I heard the other is is hard man.

23
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.610
If you have to work with
AWS cognito you use

24
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.351
&gt;&gt; Yeah cognito make you suffer.

25
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:19.227
He says worth it.

26
00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:26.688
[LAUGH] Yes cognito will yeah
I remember those cognito days?

27
00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:27.636
Man.

28
00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:31.456
All right, so we're gonna import
some stuff here and sign up and

29
00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.710
that's gonna be from the next auth.

30
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.063
We wanted to sign in functionality
here and then we want the get session.

31
00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:42.086
functionality here.

32
00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:43.136
Okay?

33
00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:48.741
So the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to attempt to get or

34
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.363
maybe use session.

35
00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:51.995
Let's see.

36
00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:53.034
Do you want to get the use session?

37
00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:54.374
Well, yeah, that's what I want to hook.

38
00:01:54.374 --> 00:01:57.897
So we're going to attempt
to get a session.

39
00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:02.800
From our next auth client and session.

40
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.431
In this case really just means a cookie
stored in the browser as a date of its e.

41
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:08.230
Sounds familiar?

42
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.168
It's exactly the preview cookie was.

43
00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:12.905
There was a cookie stored
in a browser with a DWT.

44
00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:15.420
That's literally all they're doing here.

45
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.809
So that's we're gonna do.

46
00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.748
So we're gonna attempt to
get that using the hooks, so

47
00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:25.303
we'll say session here and
then we will say loading like this.

48
00:02:25.303 --> 00:02:26.890
Then we can say use session.

49
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.728
So this will attempt to get a session and
then what we can

50
00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:35.401
do is if I do detect that there is
a session as in someone signed in and

51
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:39.925
this is just this isn't an opinion,
you don't have to do this.

52
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.944
I don't even want them to see this page, I
want them to go straight to the app page.

53
00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:44.580
I'm just gonna send them straight to that.

54
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.791
If you already signed in, you shouldn't
be looking at the sign in page.

55
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:49.670
I'm just gonna send you
straight to the app page.

56
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.622
So that's all I'm gonna do.

57
00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:54.292
So I'm gonna say, okay,
you might want to come in and

58
00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:57.800
say if session but
because we're using a you know,

59
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.780
a function of functional component,
which is basically a render.

60
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.709
It's just a big render.

61
00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.378
We can't really want to come in here and

62
00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:08.120
block the render loop with an if
statement to do stuff like that.

63
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.540
So we probably want to do a use effect.

64
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.440
And I'm going to say use effect.

65
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.437
And then what I want to do is
I want to get the router so

66
00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:20.880
I'm going to say give me the router.

67
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.664
Getting the used router from Next.js.

68
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:35.088
That's a hook from Next.js which is
gonna be from import, Used Router.

69
00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:37.248
I don't know why my auto
completes aren't working,

70
00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:39.025
they were working just fine earlier today.

71
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:43.532
Now there's like no Like that.

72
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.339
Use router, there we go.

73
00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.264
So I'm gonna get the use router.

74
00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:49.800
I'm gonna get the router.

75
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.121
I'm gonna user fact so that I'm going
to say if you do have a session,

76
00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:57.638
which means I need to put
a dependency on a session here.

77
00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:03.559
So if you do have a session, then I'm
gonna say router push to /app like that,

78
00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:07.239
it's called a slash app
if there's a session and

79
00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.188
this thing's freaking out,
cuz it's like, hey,

80
00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:16.300
you use the router too, so
I get that router, okay, there we go.

81
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.209
So this is saying, hey,
do you have a session?

82
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.110
Redirect them to app, pretty simple.

83
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.904
Okay.

84
00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:25.900
Now what we want to do is, and
we have this loading thing here.

85
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.369
This is this going to be true if
it's still loading to get a session.

86
00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:33.575
So you can use this to show a loading
spinner or something like that,

87
00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:37.118
just to say, Hey, we're still trying
to figure out if you're logged in or

88
00:04:37.118 --> 00:04:39.070
not hang tight that's why it's here.

89
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.990
We're not gonna use it but
you can use it if you want to.

90
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.103
The last thing we need to do is just hook
up this onClick handler on this social

91
00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:48.760
button for GitHub to sign in.

92
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.171
So instead of doing nothing,

93
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.543
we're gonna say, sign in to GitHub.

94
00:04:56.543 --> 00:04:57.650
That's it.

95
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.529
That's all we got to do.

96
00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.200
So, if I did this correctly, and

97
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.461
I don't remember what the database I'm
connecting to right now, if I'm local or.

98
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:09.010
OOr not, but we'll see when I run it,
we should be able to sign in.

99
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.096
So let's give it a try.

100
00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:19.510
So I'm gonna go here,
I'm gonna click this GitHub button and.

101
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.641
Yeah, looks like it worked.

102
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:28.124
Obviously your app is broken because
we haven't gotten there yet.

103
00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:33.089
It looks like it's signed in, and
navigating me to slash app here.

104
00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.889
This is obviously this app page is broken,
I can just get it working

105
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.650
record the system just to really show you,
but the fact that I navigated there.

106
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.623
So what ended up what happened was
the flash that you saw was see now if

107
00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:49.155
I tried if I tried to go back to
sign in is not gonna let me right,

108
00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:52.144
because I have that use effect in there.

109
00:05:52.144 --> 00:05:54.263
So he tries to redirect me immediately.

110
00:05:54.263 --> 00:05:56.378
So I'm, signing right now is
is our app doesn't work so

111
00:05:56.378 --> 00:05:59.528
that's why it's redirecting me right now,
right because that's what we have and

112
00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:00.440
there's use effects.

113
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.666
I'm technically signed in And
that's why we're doing that.

114
00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:07.672
But again, it's because the app
this page is, just broken.

115
00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:08.770
We haven't gotten here yet.

116
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.520
Right?
That's what's next.

117
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.763
So that's why we're breaking right now.

118
00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:15.633
But the flash you saw is because
we're doing an OAuth call.

119
00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:19.376
All that's happening in the background,
you didn't see a pop up that says, hey,

120
00:06:19.376 --> 00:06:21.260
GitHub wants to Get access to this right.

121
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.336
You didn't see that because I've
already done it, so I can clear that so

122
00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:26.064
you can kind of see what that looks like.

123
00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:27.817
So this is what I'll do.

124
00:06:27.817 --> 00:06:30.740
Let's go to the full flow so
you can see exactly what you might see.

125
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.828
So I'll clear all of my my sessions,
my CRF, all my stuff here.

126
00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.300
So technically, I'm signed out now.

127
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.092
So now I should be able
to go back to sign in.

128
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.706
Sign in works now.

129
00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:42.980
See how that works, okay?

130
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.922
So then I'll go to GitHub and
I will clear all

131
00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:52.865
my previous authorizations To these apps,

132
00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:57.675
which should be inside of here somewhere,

133
00:06:57.675 --> 00:07:02.364
applications, authorize GitHub apps.

134
00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:03.150
Okay?

135
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.080
They really want me to do this.

136
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.029
Okay, now I'm gonna watch me
fumble on my one password.

137
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.189
Login.

138
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:18.640
I got it, I never get it right
the first time, never, never.

139
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.670
Look, okay, so Authorize Auth Apps,
we're gonna go down to here.

140
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.730
So I'm gonna say revoke that one.

141
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.383
Yes, I understand.

142
00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.722
I don't want them to
have my stuff anymore.

143
00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:34.250
I didn't have a local one,
I'm revoke that one, too.

144
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.319
Get out here.

145
00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:35.970
I don't want them.

146
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.060
I don't wanna use anymore.

147
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.028
So then now if I go log in,
it's gonna give me the whole flow of, hey,

148
00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:45.830
you want them to use your stuff?

149
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.833
And I will say, Okay, yeah.

150
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:53.284
And it's gonna redirect me back to
sign in signing detected a session,

151
00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:54.729
then redirect me back to app.

152
00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.330
All right, so any questions on that?

153
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.461
&gt;&gt; What is inside the session object?

154
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:04.160
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

155
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.363
The question was what's
inside the session object?

156
00:08:06.363 --> 00:08:12.553
Yeah.That's a good question.That's
the first thing I'm always asking.

157
00:08:12.553 --> 00:08:15.470
When I'm building apps,
I'm always just logging stuff.

158
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:21.455
Does log log put wrap the whole
app in a console dot log?

159
00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:25.571
This should be like a try catch log
thing like, like, try this log that,

160
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.678
I'm saying that that would be dope.

161
00:08:27.678 --> 00:08:30.211
I would like that.

162
00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:32.626
All right, so let me see.

163
00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.588
Let's go back to sign in.

164
00:08:35.588 --> 00:08:36.710
Let's see what we got here, right.

165
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.564
So if you look at this session here,

166
00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:43.187
before it breaks right
now it's an expires.

167
00:08:43.187 --> 00:08:46.510
And then you can see I have
a user here that's got my email.

168
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.331
It's got an image, and it's got my name.

169
00:08:48.331 --> 00:08:50.803
This all came from GitHub.

170
00:08:50.803 --> 00:08:55.212
&gt;&gt; So if I am doing some authentication
with just username and password,

171
00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:58.510
can I somehow search
things to this object?

172
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:05.334
&gt;&gt; Yes you can, but you don't have to
because next alt will do it for you.

173
00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:09.116
I'm gonna show you how to customize
a session because we're gonna do it,

174
00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:10.159
cuz I wanna id here.

175
00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:11.543
I don't know why they
would put an ID here.

176
00:09:11.543 --> 00:09:13.603
He think he would need an ID but
they don't.

177
00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:15.400
Well, I know why they don't do it.

178
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.571
Because next auth actually allows you
to use jadibooti mode without having

179
00:09:19.571 --> 00:09:23.288
a database, because they don't
need sessions to store the user.

180
00:09:23.288 --> 00:09:26.350
The user is technically just stored
in the JTF T the entire time.

181
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.089
So if you were just prototyping and
you didn't want to connect the database.

182
00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:33.404
They allow you to use it in jjbt mode,
which because of that,

183
00:09:33.404 --> 00:09:36.329
there's no ID because it's
not using the database.

184
00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:37.710
But we do have a database.

185
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.741
So that's why they do that, but
we're gonna customize it to put ID on it.

186
00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:45.826
And you'll be able to get an example
of what you can do there.Yeah,

187
00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:49.268
they have something pretty,
pretty awesome for that and

188
00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:53.207
I can just give you a preview of
exactly can we get to it for a while,

189
00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:56.171
which is Basically Configuration
&gt; Callback.

190
00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:59.887
So they have something called callbacks,
wich basically allow you to hook into

191
00:09:59.887 --> 00:10:02.380
different states of
the authentication journey.

192
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.855
So you can say,
when someone signs in, do this.

193
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.990
When someone is redirected, do this.

194
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.471
When someone gets a new session, do this.

195
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.030
When a JWT is created, do that.

196
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.643
So you're able to Pretty
much do whatever you want.

197
00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:18.688
So if you wanted to customize it,
this is where you would do it,

198
00:10:18.688 --> 00:10:21.962
you would add it to the session,
and then that gets passed here, and

199
00:10:21.962 --> 00:10:25.077
then you would just add it to your token,
and then you're good.

200
00:10:25.077 --> 00:10:26.130
I think that's what we're gonna do.
