WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
And then the last thing is pages.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.531
So one of the sweet features that
NextAuth gives us is that it will

3
00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:11.800
generate the auth pages for us,
so we don't have to make them.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.860
How many sign in/sign up pages
have you made in your career?

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.430
Probably a lot, and I'm of tired of them,
seriously, why do we have to make them?

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.650
Well, NextAuth makes them for you.

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.153
It will look at the providers that you
have, and it will generate the page for

8
00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:29.439
you that will have all the buttons,
already labeled, that are already

9
00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.093
connected, even email input, literally
everything that you want is there.

10
00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:35.420
The only problem is it
doesn't look that good.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.570
It had those errors and everything.

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.247
So we're not going to use it because
we're trying to take this to the VC, and

13
00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:42.170
we can't walk in there like that.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.720
So we gotta customize it to
make it look a little better.

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.438
So we're going to say, all right,

16
00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.130
don't use your built in sign
in page that you generate,

17
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.320
use our sign in page which is going to be
at /signin, which is actually over here.

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.010
So use this page instead.

19
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.640
So that's what it's going to do.

20
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.049
Because we're opting out of that
page though, we are responsible for

21
00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.000
handling the errors that they put on
the query string and stuff like that.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.290
So we're on the hook for that.

23
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.144
But, it's a price to pay if you
want something to look good.

24
00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:13.916
And that's basically it
as far as the setup goes,

25
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:17.030
now we actually have to
use it to protect things.

26
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.930
So the first thing we're going to do
is let's allow a person to sign up

27
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.630
and sign in.

28
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.017
So the way we can do that is basically,
well, I guess the first thing we need to

29
00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:28.270
do is need to actually set
these environment variables.

30
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.210
So let's do that first,
otherwise we can't do any of this stuff?

31
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.806
So what you need to do,
if you're following along,

32
00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:37.980
is you need to go on
the root of your repo here.

33
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.422
There should be a file called env.local,
okay?

34
00:01:41.422 --> 00:01:43.920
You can copy everything in that file.

35
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.510
You can make a new file and call it
.env.local, that first dot is important.

36
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.608
So I already have it.

37
00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:54.350
I would click on it, but
then you'll see all my secrets.

38
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.379
So I'm not going to click on it.

39
00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:57.020
You almost got me.

40
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.406
But so what you wanna do is you wanna
paste this inside of .env.local,

41
00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:06.000
and you want to fill this stuff out.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.510
So I'm gonna walk you through
how to fill this stuff out.

43
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.010
GitHub ID and GitHub secret,
that's pretty simple.

44
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.272
If you've never done this before,

45
00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:15.550
you're about to learn how to
make an OAuth app on GitHub.

46
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.057
So I could just go to
github.com/yourusername, you actually

47
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:25.210
don't even need to go to yourusername
because it's just on the right.

48
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.735
I'm gonna go there and

49
00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:34.493
I'm going to click on my face there.

50
00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:38.252
Or if you're here on GitHub, you can go
here, you can go to settings, either one,

51
00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:40.140
it will take you to this page.

52
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.656
So once you go to this page,
you click on Developer settings.

53
00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:49.775
Click that and
click on OAuth Apps, click that.

54
00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:52.340
And then what you're gonna do is
you're gonna make a new OAuth App.

55
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.280
So I'll click new OAuth app.

56
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.400
You can name it whatever you want.

57
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.116
This is the name that's gonna pop up that
says this app wants to authorize you to

58
00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.880
give them access to GitHub, right?

59
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.140
This is the name of that app.

60
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.850
I put the name of our app, I put known.

61
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.250
So you can put whatever you want.

62
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.710
But this is what this is.

63
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.872
Homepage URL, this means nothing for now,

64
00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:12.788
you can just literally put google.com
this is just if someone wanted to, hey,

65
00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:15.139
the hell is this app asking me for
information?

66
00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.000
They'll show them a link, they can click
on it to figure out more about this app.

67
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.140
We don't have a homepage URL,
it's not deployed.

68
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.648
But when you deploy this later,
you want to come back and add it,

69
00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:23.640
you wanna get crazy?

70
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.940
Go ahead, go do it.

71
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.940
But you just put google.com.

72
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.300
Don't worry about the description.

73
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.590
This is just telling
the user what this app is.

74
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.800
The important part here is
the authorization callback URL.

75
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.030
So if I was gonna make one here,
and this is my test app.

76
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.750
Homepage URL is https://google.com.

77
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.193
And then the authorization URL,
so luckily for

78
00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:52.260
us, GitHub knows that people
are using this on localhost.

79
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.496
So what we can do is because we're going
to use this on localhost until we deploy,

80
00:03:57.496 --> 00:04:02.050
we can just put http://localhost,
and we just put port 1234.

81
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.235
And I understand your app is not
on port 1234, it doesn't matter,

82
00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:07.922
this is still going to work.

83
00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:11.121
This is what GitHub recommends
you put when you're on localhost.

84
00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:14.813
The way the authorization callback
actually works is when you're doing

85
00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:18.220
the OAuth flow,
you can send up a authorization callback.

86
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.989
If you send up a authorization callback,
as long as that URL of

87
00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.980
that callback has the same host as
the one registered here, that'll be fine.

88
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.608
So we should be good.

89
00:04:28.608 --> 00:04:30.780
If you're on localhost,
they just don't even care.

90
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.460
It's just like it'll always just work,
and that's it.

91
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.690
If you don't send up one,
it'll default to the one that's here.

92
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.691
So NextAuth sends it up, so we're good.

93
00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:40.580
So we're just gonna say
register application.

94
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.480
Once you do that,
you're going to get a client ID.

95
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.280
So that client ID is going
to be your GitHub ID.

96
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.709
And then you're going to click
generate new client secret and,

97
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:54.343
I don't want flight log in right now.

98
00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:58.062
You're gonna generate that client secret
and it's going to give you a secret,

99
00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:59.570
that secret is going to go here.

100
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.130
So once you got all that
you should be good to go.

101
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.639
Now for database URL,

102
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.977
this is basically where if you have Mongo
in your computer, go ahead and start.

103
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:15.423
If you have Mongo 4 or later in your
computer start that, get a URL,

104
00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:20.500
put it there, it's probably 27 or
107 or whatever the port is on Mongo.

105
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.220
I forgot what it is, something like that.

106
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.974
If you don't have one, totally fine.

107
00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:26.381
We're gonna make one real quick.

108
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.510
Go to Atlas.

109
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.916
So you can type in

110
00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:37.908
MongoDB Atlas You can make an account.

111
00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:39.280
Let me just go to mine.

112
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.735
And what you can do, you might be
prompted with some onboarding flow or

113
00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:49.734
whatever, but eventually you
just wanna create a new cluster.

114
00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:55.550
A cluster is exactly what it sounds like,
it's a cluster of databases.

115
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.810
I don't know how to
better say it than that.

116
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.520
You're just gonna make a new cluster, call
it whatever you want, let that provision.

117
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.188
Once that cluster provisions, you'll know
when it's done provisioning because you'll

118
00:06:05.188 --> 00:06:07.050
be able to click on these buttons.

119
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.370
What you want to do is first you
want to create a new database user.

120
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.143
So I go in here, make a new database user,
click on password, give them a name,

121
00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:22.901
type in a password if you want, or
have them generate one for you.

122
00:06:22.901 --> 00:06:27.851
And it just makes sure it is on,
where is it, read and

123
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:31.347
write to any database, that's it.

124
00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:33.650
You don't need admin,
you just need to read and write.

125
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.237
So you can do that, you can add a user.

126
00:06:36.237 --> 00:06:39.294
And then,
the last thing you would wanna do is,

127
00:06:39.294 --> 00:06:43.893
you just need to make sure you allow
all IP addresses for your database.

128
00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:46.650
Otherwise the connection
will just hang forever,

129
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.830
you won't be able to connect to it
because it doesn't allow your IP address.

130
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.060
So you can do that by just
clicking Add IP address.

131
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.428
And for me, there's not a button here,
cuz I already did it, but there should be

132
00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:04.470
a button here on the right, that says
allow any IP address, click that button.

133
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:11.150
If not,
then you can just type in 0.0.0.0/0.

134
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.920
And that will pretty
much say any IP address.

135
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.070
So you got to do that.

136
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.162
That also needs to be provisioned,
so it'll take some time.

137
00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:22.494
Once all that is done,
You can click Connect.

138
00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:27.653
And you can click Connect
to your application.

139
00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:30.366
And we'll just copy that code right there.

140
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.480
That's our URL.

141
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.890
So then you'll have that URL.

142
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.608
And the last thing you got to do is just
replace password with the password of

143
00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:42.290
the user that's here
that you created before.

144
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.582
And give yourself a database name, which
is literally any thing you want here, but

145
00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:48.450
you should put known.

146
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.225
So I'm just going to show you
what my database looks like.

147
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:55.602
Actually, I'll just use this one, right?

148
00:07:55.602 --> 00:08:00.188
So for instance,
this is my database verso and

149
00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:04.892
my password was,
puppyChow, whatever it is,

150
00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:08.668
I don't know, something like that.

151
00:08:08.668 --> 00:08:13.609
And then DB name will just be, make
sure you put known, just put known for

152
00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:15.270
the DB name.

153
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.154
And that's it, that would be your DB URL.

154
00:08:17.154 --> 00:08:20.485
You can leave all this other stuff here,
that's it.

155
00:08:20.485 --> 00:08:23.566
For JWT_SECRET, you could put
whatever you want, doesn't matter.

156
00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:26.297
Just slam on the keyboard,
do whatever you want there.

157
00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:31.036
And then for NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST,
just put the full URL to what

158
00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:35.119
you're actually using,
which in this case is localhost,

159
00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:39.460
I'm port 3000 because that's
the default for next.js.

160
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.670
If you're have a different port, put that.

161
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.548
So once you got all that figured out,
and you got your env set up,

162
00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:48.837
you're good to go, you got a database.

163
00:08:48.837 --> 00:08:49.524
That was a lot.

164
00:08:49.524 --> 00:08:51.328
For anyone who doesn't do
a lot of backend work,

165
00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:54.100
I can understand why some of the stuff
I just showed might be intimidating.

166
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.692
For me, I think a lot of stuff can be
intimidating mostly just because when you

167
00:08:59.692 --> 00:09:03.603
go to something like Atlas,
I mean just look at it, just look at this.

168
00:09:03.603 --> 00:09:05.603
This does not look inviting.

169
00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:07.404
What's a cluster?

170
00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:10.332
What's a data lake?

171
00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:11.904
What's that?

172
00:09:11.904 --> 00:09:13.576
[LAUGH] I don't even know what that is.

173
00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:15.160
So I can understand that.

174
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.785
So I tried to just abstract
all that away from you and

175
00:09:17.785 --> 00:09:22.370
just walk you through the things you need
to do to connect, and that's basically it.

176
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.970
After that you don't
have to do it anymore.

177
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.140
You should be good to go.

178
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:32.141
If you don't wanna do this,
but you don't have it locally,

179
00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:39.163
you can use something called RunRS,
Runes, okay, RunRS.

180
00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:43.470
So RunRS basically,
you just NPM install it globally.

181
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.989
You just type in RunRS with a version 04,
and it'll just download a version 4

182
00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:51.034
MongoDB for you right there and
you can just start it.

183
00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:53.353
All right, it'll download it for
you, you can just start it.

184
00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:56.719
Again, you'll still have to use Atlas when
we deploy if you want to fall off for

185
00:09:56.719 --> 00:09:57.334
deployment.

186
00:09:57.334 --> 00:10:00.975
But for local development, you could just
do RunRS that will download Mongo for

187
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.960
you for the first time,
and you'll be good to go.

188
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.561
So just try that, it's pretty dope.

189
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.223
And then to start it you
just type in RunRS, and

190
00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:13.993
it'll give you a very very long
URL because it uses a replica set.

191
00:10:13.993 --> 00:10:18.478
That's what RS stands for,
replica set is basically a trio or

192
00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:22.287
at least two Mongo databases
talking to each other.

193
00:10:22.287 --> 00:10:27.031
So you can do transactions because Mongo
is not a transactional database until just

194
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:28.550
recently.

195
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.830
In order to do that,
you have to have multiple databases.

196
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.648
So that's what replica set is.

197
00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:34.030
This thing does it for you.

198
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.490
So you'll get a URL that looks like this,

199
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.020
where it's like a whole bunch
of URLs separated by a comma.

200
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.666
And then just make sure you replace
your database name here with known,

201
00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:45.030
that needs to be known.

202
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.042
As long as that's known,
you're good to go.

203
00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:48.985
You can do whatever you want.

204
00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:52.628
You can literally change the name of
the database of Mongo to whatever you want

205
00:10:52.628 --> 00:10:55.037
because you're setting
the name of the database,

206
00:10:55.037 --> 00:10:56.900
so you can put whatever you want there.
