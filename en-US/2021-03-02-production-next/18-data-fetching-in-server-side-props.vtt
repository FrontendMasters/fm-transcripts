WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.663
Okay.
So, now what we wanna do is we wanna use

2
00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:09.190
these methods inside of
our server side prop.

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.202
So, this one's gonna be a little crazy
because and this comes down to a design

4
00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:16.550
decision that you really got to
figure out which is best for you.

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.420
And this is where it's gonna
get maybe a little complicated.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.331
But basically, because of the way that
I created the page for this app page,

7
00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:28.861
right, because it is a common
service should be does,

8
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.580
because it is a catch all optional route.

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.250
Let's think about all the different
states that this page could be in.

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.990
Actually, I wrote them down here.

11
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.565
So, one if you navigate to this page,
if you just navigate to slash app,

12
00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:45.265
you're gonna be in this state, which is,

13
00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:49.240
where's gonna show you all
the folders which looks like this.

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.815
You're gonna be in this state right here.

15
00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.890
Now one folder selected, but
you'll see all them here on the left.

16
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.840
Okay, so they got to handle that.

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.898
But if you navigate to slash app slash,
some ID here of a folder,

18
00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:04.278
then that's gonna handle the state of,
okay, now you're here, but

19
00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:06.200
you clicked on one of these.

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.310
So, I need to show you the content of
that folder here on the right side.

21
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.030
So, you got to handle that state.

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.910
But because this is a catch all,
it can go past that.

23
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.350
So now, the other state is
gonna be app slash 1 slash 2.

24
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.884
And what that's gonna look like is,
you're gonna see all the folders,

25
00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:24.720
you're gonna see
the documents of a folder.

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.257
And then you click on one
of those documents and

27
00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:29.476
now you're inside of a document.

28
00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:30.940
So these to handle that state too.

29
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.420
So, it needs to handle the all folder
state, they show me the documents for

30
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.520
this folder state and
then the editor for the documents.

31
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.280
All in one route.

32
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.090
Now, you might ask yourself,
why would I do that?

33
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.432
Why would I put all of those in one
route and have to figure it out,

34
00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:47.070
up here somewhere?

35
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.804
Well, the reason I decided to do that
was one just to show you the power of

36
00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.236
Git Server side props, and

37
00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:55.740
how it can be pretty amazing
with these catch all routes.

38
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.297
But two,
if you go to another path of okay,

39
00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:01.790
I'm gonna create just a page for
every single one of them.

40
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.490
I'll make a route for slash app, that
would be slash app slash index don't tsx.

41
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.672
Now, I'll make one for slash app ID, so

42
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:14.455
that would be slash app and
then brackets id tsx, no spread.

43
00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:17.223
And then, I'll make one for
this one, right?

44
00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:19.940
Okay, yeah, you could do that.

45
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.500
But if I look at my app,
they're all the same layout.

46
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.230
They're all the same everything.

47
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.800
I mean,
they're all gonna have the same thing,

48
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.300
they all gonna have the same folders.

49
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.020
Everything's exactly the same.

50
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.730
So, I decided that I was gonna do that.

51
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.430
And again,
I wanted to show you all a different way.

52
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.149
The way you coulda got around it is
you still gotta make each route, and

53
00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.060
then you could just make a layup
component that just got all that stuff.

54
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.620
And then that way you
still only wrote it once.

55
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.180
So there's many ways you
could have done this.

56
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.279
Me, I thought it'd be pretty clever just
to make one route that handles all three

57
00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.700
of them and we just figure it out here.

58
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.180
So that's what I'm doing.

59
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.440
All right, so let's do it.

60
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.448
So right now, so far,
our Git session just, I'm sorry,

61
00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:04.050
our Git service, our props,
all it does is get a session.

62
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.550
But what we got to do now is we need
to get all the different states here.

63
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.140
So, if I go look at the props that it's
expecting, it's expecting folders,

64
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.815
an activeFolder, an active
document maybe and then activeDoc.

65
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:20.933
So, let's handle these Gits.

66
00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.192
Let's get all the folders first.

67
00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:23.864
So, how are we gonna do that?

68
00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:25.640
Well, we're not gonna hear API.

69
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.470
So, first of all,
I said well I'll do a fetch.

70
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.784
If you didn't know,
why do we do next as bundle stretch so

71
00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:32.880
it's available to you everywhere.

72
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.620
So you might say, I'll do a fetch
to my API, and just get it well.

73
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.667
One, we didn't create an API for
those handlers,

74
00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.100
those functions that we just made.

75
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.410
We didn't hook them up to an API.

76
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.170
They're just functions.

77
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.750
So no, we're not gonna do that.

78
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.580
And if we did, we still wouldn't use it.

79
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.710
Like I said, in the docs, you're heavily
recommended not to use your own API here.

80
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.920
Why do they say that?

81
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.190
The reason they say that is because
you could put whatever you want here.

82
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.710
And you can put server side logic here.

83
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.266
So there's no point in your application
reaching outside to the internet just to

84
00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:07.899
come back to itself to hit the API, when
you just go straight to the database here.

85
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:12.359
Why waste that network call to go to your
database when you can use your database

86
00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.050
right here.

87
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.510
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

88
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.510
So, we're gonna import our
database functions here.

89
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.256
So, I'm gonna import from db.

90
00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:24.981
Just like that.

91
00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.181
When I import from db, and

92
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:33.870
I'm gonna get folder and
I'm gonna get doc.

93
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.359
Yeah, I'm importing some service site
database stuff in our react component.

94
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.810
Pretty crazy.

95
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.320
I think this also is very trippy and
kind of hard to explain.

96
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.988
But remember, next as is getting rid
of this force on the browser, so

97
00:04:46.988 --> 00:04:47.960
it's not gonna be here.

98
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.500
Otherwise it wouldn't work.

99
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.730
It'll just break.

100
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.693
Okay, so now that we have that.

101
00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.530
Let's start with getting all the folders.

102
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.838
So, first one, how do we determine
what state that we're in?

103
00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:01.657
Why do we have this context here?

104
00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:06.633
This context here is got to tell us what
state that we're in because we can look at

105
00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:12.079
the parameters to decide, if there's no
parameters, then it went to slash app.

106
00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:16.545
If there's one parameter then they
went to slash app slash and folder ID.

107
00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:21.830
If they went to two parameters and
their template editor for a document.

108
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.930
So we know what to do.

109
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.930
So that's how we can
determine what's what.

110
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.360
So regardless, no matter which one you
go in, we got to get all the folders.

111
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.280
So, let's just do that real quick.

112
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.360
So, we'll say folders = await folder dot.

113
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.170
Look at dot get folders.

114
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.860
Okay, but get folders takes into db.

115
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.060
So, where do I get the DB?

116
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.990
Now, not a problem.

117
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.990
We just gotta connect to the db first.

118
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.130
So, let's do that.

119
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.090
So we'll say, actually,
I think I have it in here.

120
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.660
There we go, connectToDB.

121
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.420
So, you gotta love typeScript.

122
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.570
So, I'll say DB = await
connectToDB like that.

123
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.290
So now we got to DB.

124
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.150
And then the getFolders takes the db
like that, and then it takes a user ID.

125
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.920
So, where are we gonna get a user ID?

126
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.096
Look at that.
We've got a session here and

127
00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:24.890
we know the session has
a user property on it, but

128
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.160
that session right now doesn't have
an ID on it, so we're about to fix that.

129
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.990
But that also means we don't really wanna
continue if there is isn't a session.

130
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.417
So, what we'll do is we'll
say if not session, so

131
00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:42.204
there just really isn't a session
here because you're not signed it,

132
00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:46.030
then let's go ahead and
just get out of here.

133
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.155
Cuz the front is gonna handle this anyway
with that modal that we put anyway, so

134
00:06:50.155 --> 00:06:53.730
I'm just gonna say, whatever that is,
no undefined, who cares?

135
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.920
We're just gonna return immediately
because we don't have a session.

136
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.380
So then, I'm gonna say, okay, cool.

137
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.750
We're good here.

138
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.390
Got our database.

139
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:09.512
Let's assume there's a session
dot user dot id, we'll fix that.

140
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:13.440
And then, why is this thing tripping?

141
00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:16.000
Okay, it's a slow.

142
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.820
So we got our folders, so
we can go ahead and put the session there.

143
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.580
Got the folders there.

144
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.910
That's looking good.

145
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.440
Then the next thing is,
we need to just check to see where we are.

146
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.770
What are these props,
what do these params look like?

147
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.170
So, this is what I'll do,
I'll say if context dot params dot,

148
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.840
abd the param I'm looking for
is the same thing over here, id.

149
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.060
So id.

150
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.640
But because it's a catch all,
id is actually gonna be an array.

151
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.933
Okay.
Id is gonna be an array of every single

152
00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.740
parameter in the order that it's coming,
right?

153
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.671
So if I have in this case,
slash 1 slash two,

154
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:57.620
id will be an array with 1 and the first
index and then 2 in the second index.

155
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.756
So, if params,

156
00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:07.252
if ctx dot params dot id dot length

157
00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:12.170
is greater than 0, I guess.

158
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.080
I'll just put this, if that.

159
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.677
So, if there is a length as
there's something in there,

160
00:08:16.677 --> 00:08:18.200
then they're trying to go here.

161
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.212
Okay?
So, let's go ahead and

162
00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:22.870
get the current folder.

163
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.230
So, I'll say get the activeFolder.

164
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.410
ActiveFolder equals,

165
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.950
we got folder dot getFolders.

166
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.624
Okay, so
we already have all the folders, so

167
00:08:38.624 --> 00:08:40.220
we don't need to have the database again.

168
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.640
I could just say folders dot find,
grabbed the matching folder.

169
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.010
Get this dot id.

170
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:51.061
And see if that triple equals ctx

171
00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:55.750
dot params dot id bracket 0.

172
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.963
So, find me the folder that matches
that parameter, which will be here, one.

173
00:09:00.963 --> 00:09:05.030
Okay, so I got that one,
that's activeFolder.

174
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:11.574
We'll go ahead and scope this like that.

175
00:09:13.214 --> 00:09:16.910
ActiveFolder.

176
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.149
Okay?
And then,

177
00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:23.339
what I wanna do is I wanna
check to see if we're here.

178
00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:29.160
See if they added another
parameter that are actually here.

179
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.507
But before I do that,
if I got the activeFolder,

180
00:09:31.507 --> 00:09:34.270
I actually need to get all
the documents for that folder.

181
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.097
All right, I was just going to cover
what I have here because apparently,

182
00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:39.217
that's right, let's see.

183
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.219
All right, let's see what happens.

184
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.450
And we'll keep going forward.

185
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.400
Go back to our page here.

186
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.450
Make sure that's good.

187
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.100
There we go.
Good.

188
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.370
Cuz it's not there, It's nothing.

189
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.110
So it's there, there's something in there.

190
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.880
So, let's get that and
then we'll get the activeDocs.

191
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.640
Which will basically be

192
00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:15.385
Doc awaits Doc dot, what we got?

193
00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.392
GetDocsByFolderId.

194
00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:21.600
There we go, passing the database then

195
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.580
passing the folderId of
activeFolder dot id.

196
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:32.890
So that will give us the activeDocs,
so we're good there.

197
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:42.190
We can pass that down Like that.

198
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.110
And then the last thing we wanna do is

199
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.195
just check to see if ctx dot params dot

200
00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:56.810
id dot length is greater than 1.

201
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.510
So that means they're down here now.

202
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.760
So the down here, then we need
to get the activeDoc singular.

203
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.600
So get that one Doc, this one right here.

204
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.840
Got that one.

205
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.880
So what we can do is we can just say,
yeah, cool.

206
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.607
Yeah, we wanna get that then we can

207
00:11:17.607 --> 00:11:22.584
say activeDoc Equals to.

208
00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:29.776
We already have activeDocs here,
so we can just do a find.

209
00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:35.860
Let me say d dot === ctx dot
params like that, id bracket 2.

210
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.563
Now, we go.

211
00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:45.924
So then now we got all of that,
I think Some of the stuff is null,

212
00:11:45.924 --> 00:11:49.624
so we have to figure that out and
we'll kind of see.

213
00:11:49.624 --> 00:11:50.560
Yeah, it's freaking out right now.

214
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.162
So, serialization of activeFolder returned
from getServers dot Props undefined cannot

215
00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:57.750
be serialized, so null or emit this value.

216
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.370
So, I'll just make an object.

217
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.500
So you'll see that I guess.

218
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.248
So, we'll just say const props.

219
00:12:05.248 --> 00:12:07.292
And that's.

220
00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:13.470
So, then we just come down here and
say, we have to do all that nonsense.

221
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:20.400
I'm gonna say props dot that,
props dot that, props dot that.

222
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.287
This will just be

223
00:12:25.502 --> 00:12:29.930
Props, so like that.

224
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.511
Okay, and this thing is freaking out
because TypeScript doesn't like that.

225
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:35.940
There we go.

226
00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:40.531
Okay.

227
00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:41.031
So, let's try that out.

228
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.200
Okay, cool.

229
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.625
So, obviously we're not gonna see anything
here because we haven't created any

230
00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:52.060
folder, so nothing's gonna show up here.

231
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.330
But the fact that it didn't break and
everything's there, we're good to go.

232
00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:02.793
So what we're gonna do now is, we're going
to make it aware when you sign up for

233
00:13:02.793 --> 00:13:06.990
the first time,
we give you some seed data.
