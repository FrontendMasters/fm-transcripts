00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:04.285
Why you don't use state
management in React anymore?

2
00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:07.615
&gt;&gt; Good question, why don't I use
state management in React anymore?

3
00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.160
Because hooks solve it pretty much.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.671
I mean, you think about the different
types of state that you have.

5
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:17.286
You have state that came from an API,
right, like data.

6
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:21.293
Then you have application state,
like show this model,

7
00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:24.222
this form is loading, things like that.

8
00:00:24.222 --> 00:00:29.076
So stay tuned from API, I would actually
just use a custom library that's

9
00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:34.103
probably hook and I'll talk about those
later on like SWR, or react query.

10
00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:38.072
And that that handles all my, you know,
my API state for me done okay.

11
00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:43.203
Now application state, well i dont use
use state for that right almost never

12
00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:48.512
need to share state across multiple
Instances of components deep in the tree.

13
00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:54.433
And if I do, I'll use a provider and
context and I'll pass that state down.

14
00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.673
And if I'm really just getting fancy, I'll
even do the use reducer hook if I really

15
00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:02.324
want to, you know, do some stuff,
but I haven't had to pull that out.

16
00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:03.923
Other than one time.

17
00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:05.738
So after doing that, I'm just like,

18
00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:08.185
I don't really need a state
management solution.

19
00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.924
I mean, every component is in charge
of its own state using use state.

20
00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:14.325
And if you got to pass something down,

21
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.312
pass it down if you got to pass
it down really far, use context.

22
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.876
And that's kind of what I've been doing,

23
00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:24.594
I haven't had the need to grow
past that since hooks came out.

24
00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:27.353
&gt;&gt; Should I learn state management or
not, I mean,

25
00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:30.402
there are courses,
&gt;&gt; I don't think it's helpful to

26
00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.468
learn one particular
state management library,

27
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.562
I think it's helpful to understand
how to manage state and react.

28
00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:42.726
And just learning one pattern is going
to open up a whole new area of like,

29
00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:46.312
I understand how unidirectional
data flow happens.

30
00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:49.262
I understand how events are handled and
things like that.

31
00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:53.106
And it doesn't really matter what
library you pick whether it's Redux or

32
00:01:53.106 --> 00:01:54.912
whatever is out there these days.

33
00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:58.220
[LAUGH] I don't know there's so many
things out there these days, I don't know.

34
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.701
But just learning just one pattern of how
to manage data it's gonna, you know, it's

35
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:07.074
gonna give you an opinion, which is gonna,
obviously help you out in the long run.

36
00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:09.719
And from there just learn all the other
different patterns that are that

37
00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:10.345
are coming out.

38
00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:16.559
So yeah, I think it's helpful to learn one
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

39
00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.052
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

40
00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:23.736
&gt;&gt; Okay, like I was saying,
this is probably the easiest setup for

41
00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:29.222
oauth authentication I've ever
done on any node thing ever.

42
00:02:29.222 --> 00:02:35.780
I mean, if we look at all the server code
that we wrote, it was this, that was it.

43
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.342
That's all we did.

44
00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:40.878
That's all we did on the server,
we didn't do anything else and

45
00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.330
we got GitHub off, so
I was a big fan of passport.

46
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.926
I'm still a big fan of grant,
which is really nice,

47
00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:51.832
but this right here was just like wow,
okay,

48
00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:56.062
I don't think it gets easier than this so
good job necks off team.

49
00:02:56.062 --> 00:02:59.693
Okay, now that we have the sign up or
sign in working,

50
00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.572
let's see what we got to do next.

51
00:03:02.572 --> 00:03:10.245
The last thing we want to do is we want to
add this provider here to the app page.

52
00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:14.382
So if you can, if you go back to
what I was doing in the sign in you

53
00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.623
see I'm doing this use session.

54
00:03:16.623 --> 00:03:22.343
This use session is using context
inside of it to access a session.

55
00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:26.544
And it's gonna get it cuz it's
gonna happen at times, but

56
00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:30.350
we can speed this up if we
provide its service side.

57
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.565
So when we get to the app page where
we start doing service side props,

58
00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:35.901
we can get the session there and
pass it to the app.

59
00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:39.150
So the rest of the app can actually
benefit of having a session without having

60
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.482
to make additional API calls.

61
00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:41.870
Is this a performance thing?

62
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.909
So we don't have to keep asking
the API over and over again, hey,

63
00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.062
this is a session, they'll just get
it because it was already there

64
00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:52.130
because the page that came before it
already rendered it and pass it along.

65
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.713
So it's a performance thing.

66
00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:57.580
So we're going to do that, and we're going
to do that by going into the app and

67
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.093
you can see I got a whole
bunch of comments in here.

68
00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:03.611
This was a nasty bug, if you're
interested, that was really nasty.

69
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:08.898
We're gonna import Provider here,
and then we're going to just

70
00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:14.153
provide the Provider or
something like that.

71
00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:17.360
And I want to say, what does it take?

72
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.120
session?
That's right.

73
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.562
So it's gonna take session.

74
00:04:20.562 --> 00:04:27.370
And then page props are basically
the props that the page is getting.

75
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.443
So if we think about pages how they get
props, where in the page do we define

76
00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:34.661
the props, or we're in a pace
can we pass props actually,

77
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:36.914
Getstatic props get server side props.

78
00:04:36.914 --> 00:04:40.591
So basically any page, whatever a page
returns and get static props or

79
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:43.783
get service, our props,
that's what's going to be here.

80
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.570
So one of those pages we're going
to use get server side props and

81
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.026
it's going to return a session.

82
00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:49.770
That session is what we're
going to pass in right here.
