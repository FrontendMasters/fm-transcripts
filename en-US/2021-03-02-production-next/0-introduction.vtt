Hello everyone and welcome to
production grade Nick's as with me,

2
00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:08.278
your instructor,
Scott Moss along with front end masters.

3
00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:13.099
Who has always given me this amazing
platform to do what I like to do best,

4
00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.150
which is to teach and explain complicated
things in a way that makes sense to me.

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.417
To help everyone who needs,
help learning something, so

6
00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:24.290
thanks again front end masters.

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.338
This course is basically a follow up on
the previous course that I shot on intro

8
00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:32.132
to next as I think the feedback
there was pretty good and

9
00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:35.862
the demand was pretty high so we decided
to shoot a production grade one.

10
00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:39.931
Because there was just so many questions
in that course that I wanted to answer,

11
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.816
but I was a little timid because I knew
that they was just like a rabbit hole and

12
00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:45.840
I could talk about that stuff for days.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.438
So now we got a whole course for it and

14
00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:54.760
it kind of worked out because since I
released that course next day, ISS had.

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.612
So many new features
either come out of beta or

16
00:00:56.612 --> 00:00:59.800
just new features in general that I'm
gonna be talking about in this course.

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.245
So it's like they're really tying it
together and it couldn't been a more

18
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:07.080
perfect time to really shoot this course,
so I'm super excited.

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.078
Okay, so first thing, let's actually
get everyone the materials they need to

20
00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:16.890
do this course, so what you wanna do
is you wanna head over to My GitHub.

21
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.084
So if you go to github.com,
slash hendrixer, which is my GitHub,

22
00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:26.273
and you can go to my repos,
and you'll see one there for

23
00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:30.670
production grade nextjs, so
you can click on that repo.

24
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.302
And this is where we're going to
be working, but the thing that's

25
00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:39.800
important right now is if you go to the
readme, there's a link for the curriculum.

26
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.351
And I just want you to click that link and

27
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.940
that's going to bring
it to this site here.

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.871
So the URL for this site is
production-grade-next js.versal.app,

29
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.475
and that's going to be where you
can follow along to everything that

30
00:01:53.475 --> 00:01:57.110
we're going to be covering in this course.

31
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.023
So like I said, literally everything I'm
going to cover in this course is going to

32
00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:01.480
be here on this website.

33
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.120
And then the code is going to be in
that repo, so pretty much good here.

34
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.440
So I'm just going to follow along here, so
let's just get here and we'll continue so

35
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.520
I'm clicking on welcome.

36
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.588
And basically it's just
a little intro about myself but

37
00:02:13.588 --> 00:02:15.230
the thing I wanna talk about.

38
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.682
Is really the course and how the format
of this course is going to be,

39
00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:24.451
it's a little different than what I
would normally do, and I think it's

40
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:29.240
because the content is actually very,
in some cases, very advanced.

41
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.143
But also it's, I wanted to keep
it as practical as possible,

42
00:02:33.143 --> 00:02:37.795
I've done a lot of consulting in the past
where I would help companies Move

43
00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:42.370
from scaling this technology over
to something bigger for more users.

44
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.172
And it's always helpful to show like real
world examples versus talk about something

45
00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:49.380
theoretically, because it's
the devils in the details.

46
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.962
So this course is very practical,
but basically, what we're gonna

47
00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:59.410
be doing here is we're gonna take a MVP
app that's been built out by a team.

48
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.040
Unless a team I mean me.And the app
is just not ready for production.

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.240
It's it's missing key features,
some of the things just aren't built out

50
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.600
completely things like authentication,
stuff like that.

51
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.389
It's just not ready for production,
I mean, yeah, the UI is there,

52
00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.300
the styling is there.

53
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.038
And that's really great, but
we couldn't ship this, and

54
00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:24.775
basically the app is kind of
like a notion slash wiki clone,

55
00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:28.890
calling it known,
because that's just what came to mind.

56
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.882
So we're not going to be like rebuilding
all of it from scratch because like I

57
00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:34.734
said, the UI and stuff is basically
done the the stylings done we're not

58
00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:36.630
going to mess with any of that stuff.

59
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.522
We're only going to be trying
to turn this app ready,

60
00:03:39.522 --> 00:03:42.740
like to make it productive
production grade basically.

61
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.680
So just adding things,
tweaking things along the way.

62
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.602
And then we're just gonna be learning
everything in an actual productive

63
00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:53.966
environment, a realistic environment of
what you would probably do with the next

64
00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:55.810
ASF at your company.

65
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.490
So that's basically it.
