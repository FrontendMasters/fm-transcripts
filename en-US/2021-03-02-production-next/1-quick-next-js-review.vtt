00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.735
So the first thing is, what I always
like to do on advance courses is get

2
00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:08.600
a little refresher on what it
is that we're talking about.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.076
Cuz I know some people come here, you
might be like me where sometimes you're

4
00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:16.380
like, I'm just gonna jump into the advance
things without looking at the intro.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.022
Sometimes I might do that,
sometimes I don't, so that's you.

6
00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:22.450
We're just gonna go over next.js
very quick, as quickly as possible.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.315
Just in case you forgot,
just in case you need a reminder,

8
00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.360
just in case some new things
were added that you didn't know.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.031
We're just gonna walk through just
creating a HelloWorld next as app and

10
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.530
talk about the different conventions
there as quickly as possible.

11
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.150
And then we're gonna move
on to the good stuff.

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.899
So what I recommend you do as I go
through this course is, like I said,

13
00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.681
everything's gonna be in
here on the website, but

14
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:49.328
I recommend that you pay attention
to what I'm doing on my screen.

15
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:54.077
Because I'm gonna talk and go into more
detail than what's currently on this

16
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:58.606
website, this website is gonna have
just like everything that you need,

17
00:00:58.606 --> 00:00:59.940
some explanations.

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.819
But, things come to mind as I'm talking,
I might say them differently,

19
00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.638
I might show different examples that
people ask questions on my screen in

20
00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:10.910
my code editor than what actually
exists here on the website.

21
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.692
So just pay attention more to me and then
if you need to go back or if you need to

22
00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:19.000
copy something, then you can go to
the website, and you can copy that.

23
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.385
Okay, cool, so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to open up a terminal here,

24
00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:27.130
I'm going to my code directory here.

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.680
And I'm just going to create a new
Next.js app, so I'm gonna use MDX.

26
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.422
If you never used MDX before, it's
basically like a CLI that allows you to

27
00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:41.183
use other CLIs without having
to install them basically.

28
00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:42.772
So I'm going to say MDX and

29
00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:47.570
then the name of the CLI that I want
to use is called Create Next App.

30
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.744
And then I can pass the argument for
a name of app that I want this to be.

31
00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:54.850
So what do I wanna call this,
I'll just call this app.

32
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.890
So I can do that, and you can see that,
that's going to basically scaffold

33
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.530
out a HelloWorld next js app for
us with the latest versions of React,

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.040
React DOM, and Next,
and it's pretty simple.

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.798
You can see it's telling me it's
got all the scripts and stuff, so

36
00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.140
I'm just gonna CD into the app.

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.148
Open this up and kind of just, again,
just a refresher, just a walk through

38
00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:22.300
what's happening in the next day as app,
just in case you forgot.

39
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.597
So let's talk about some
of the conventions here, so

40
00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:26.129
Next.js is built on conventions,

41
00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.870
some of those biggest conventions
are around this pages directory here.

42
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.390
So all the conventions
are mostly file-based.

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.936
So any file that you create
in the pages directory,

44
00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:40.520
that's the equivalent of
configuring a route on a router.

45
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.304
Whereas the name of the file is
gonna be the actual route inside of

46
00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:48.500
your actual app with some slight nuances.

47
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.320
So for instance, underscore app,
that's not going to create a route.

48
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.216
That's just a way for us to alter
the routes app in our application index,

49
00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:01.320
just indicates the actual
index of a certain path.

50
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.930
So the route won't actually,
be called index.

51
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.440
But everything else is pretty,
pretty much the way you expect it to be.

52
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.240
And then, you'll have API, API here,
is anything that's created here.

53
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.890
It's gonna actually create an API route on
the back end, that we can access anywhere.

54
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.960
And we're going to get to all of that,
of course.

55
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.060
And that's pretty much it.

56
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.533
So then if we talk about the other
conventions as far as fetching data inside

57
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:26.882
of our applications.

58
00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:29.853
Well, this is where next year's shines,
and

59
00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:34.270
we're gonna get really into this
later on this app, but basically,

60
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.810
we have these server side hooks,
you can call them or functions.

61
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.940
So for instance, I can say, export
function getStaticProps like this, right?

62
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.932
And whatever our return
here on the props property,

63
00:03:49.932 --> 00:03:55.570
this is what is gonna be injected into
my component here as a prop, right?

64
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.010
So I can say Name as I called it Name,
Yeah.

65
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.280
So I'll have access to that here.

66
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.753
So basically what that's doing is,
this is doing a couple things is it till

67
00:04:04.753 --> 00:04:08.920
the next day is that I want this
page to be generated at build time.

68
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.940
And then I want it to basically have these
props, this data be passed in statically

69
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.888
and it does like some server sides caching
and then rehydration on a front end with

70
00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:22.927
JSON to make that possible, but
that's basically what that is.

71
00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:24.830
So we're opting into that.

72
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.562
And there's some other functions that we
can use here that I've talked about in

73
00:04:27.562 --> 00:04:30.300
a previous course, and
we'll obviously get to them here as well.

74
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.200
But that's the gist of it.

75
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.294
The other conventions here, the Next js
allows us to do, is like the styling.

76
00:04:36.294 --> 00:04:41.064
So we can use CSS modules here, which are
just basically CSS files with a module and

77
00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.175
the name, and
then we can import those components and

78
00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:47.099
basically that allows us
to have like scoped CSS.

79
00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.724
So that's one way you can do styles,

80
00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:51.408
you can also do global styles
that you add inside of your app.

81
00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:55.850
You can import them there as well,
that's another way you can do styles.

82
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.587
And then of course, any other reacts
flavor of styling that you've probably

83
00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:02.120
ever used, you can do that as well.

84
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.885
So emotion, theme UI, there's so
many I can't even list them.

85
00:05:07.885 --> 00:05:11.685
I mean, I feel like there's a new way
to add CSS and react every single day.

86
00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:14.615
But all those should pretty
much work here as well.

87
00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:19.801
So and I think with Next.js, they add
a support, cuz I believe before you

88
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:25.955
couldn't import CSS files that were not
modules anywhere other than the app.

89
00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:29.307
Whereas, I think with next year's 10,
you can now import CSS files.

90
00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:33.773
Not an app, which is very helpful,
if you have a third-party library that you

91
00:05:33.773 --> 00:05:38.039
install for npm and that libraries
requiring you to and like import some CSS

92
00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.460
and you don't want to import that CSS all
the way on the root of your whole app.

93
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.830
You only wanna import on this
component where it's being used.

94
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.420
I think you could do that now,
that's actually very nice.

95
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.170
So really big feature, that's new since
last time I taught the the intro course
