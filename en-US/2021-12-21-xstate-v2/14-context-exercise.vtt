00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.025
So now, we're gonna be jumping to
an exercise on context, and so

2
00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:10.255
in this exercise we want to do a few
things to actually make our our machine

3
00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:16.670
a little bit more useful than something
that just toggles between play and pause.

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.325
So we're going to add the initial
context first for the song title and

5
00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.224
artist which could be undefined at first.

6
00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:29.339
The total duration of the song which,
again, we don't know so

7
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.454
it starts at 0 the elapsed value
which is how far along we're at

8
00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:39.760
the in the song which can be 0,
the like status which is a string,

9
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.900
and that like status can be either
unliked or it could be liked.

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.200
Oops, liked or it could be disliked.

11
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
And yeah,
there's three different values for that.

12
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.040
And then the volume which is a number.

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.740
So you're going to add that
initial context into there.

14
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.451
And then we are going to
change some of the actions so

15
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.410
that they're actually
assigning to context.

16
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.250
The assigned song data.

17
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.242
We're going to assume that it takes
an events with type loaded in this data in

18
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.235
the payload, and you're going to
assign the title, artist duration, and

19
00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:25.000
you're going to reset
the elastine like status values.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.698
Try to see how many of these assign
actions you could get to, we're gonna

21
00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:34.550
take a short time to do this and if you
don't get to all of them that's fine,

22
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.580
I just want to get you used to
writing these assigned actions.

23
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.548
So yeah, in this assign time is another
action that's going to be reading directly

24
00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:51.613
from the events, just getting you used
to setting the initial context and

25
00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.920
also assigning it via an action.

26
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.062
Keep in mind too,
that when we render this out,

27
00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:02.407
that context is actually read just like
we talked about from states.context and

28
00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:06.575
is used inside the application
to display certain things, and

29
00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.610
we'll talk about that after
we're done with the exercise.
