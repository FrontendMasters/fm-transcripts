00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.027
Let's go to our next exercise,
which is on history states.

2
00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:08.970
Currently, there is a problem
with our application.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.510
Not sure if you notice, but
right now in our application,

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.948
if we press next, and
then we load the song.

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.418
Everything seems to be working.

6
00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:26.481
Now let's say right now this player
is currently in the playing states,

7
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.557
or really it's in the ready playing state.

8
00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:32.010
Let's say that we pause this.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.126
And now let's say that we
skip to the next song.

10
00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:38.168
So now we're loading and
we loaded the song.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.944
Now the next song is going to
immediately start playing.

12
00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:48.827
This can be undesired behavior because
previously, we pause the song, and

13
00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:50.540
then we skipped.

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.143
So what a user would expect to happen
would be that the player should still be

15
00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:59.249
in the paused state,
because that's what we were previously on.

16
00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.820
And we pause the song for a reason.

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.344
So, what we're going to do is we're
going to model this in the state chart,

18
00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:11.151
right now, when the loaded event happens,
we go directly to the ready states and

19
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.410
the ready state.

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.271
The initial state is
always playing right now,

21
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.710
but what we want to do is instead
we want to visit the most

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.073
recently active state in
this ready compound state.

23
00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:30.204
So that if we were on the pause state
when we revisit this ready State, we want

24
00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:35.512
to go back to the paused State instead of
going to the playing state by default.

25
00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.270
So add a sibling history state here.

26
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.113
And, yeah, go ahead and
implement it, by the way,

27
00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:47.861
the way that history states
are defined in X state.

28
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:49.445
So, let me.

29
00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.950
Just go here real quick.

30
00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:03.646
Is that when you have a compound state,
so if we have initial test, states test,

31
00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:09.280
and you would specify the history
state by naming it wherever you want.

32
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.618
Typically I like to name it hist and
then you specify a type of history.

33
00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:20.522
And then by default the history seat is
going to be a shallow history state but

34
00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:25.440
if you want it to be a deep history state,
you give it a history value of deep.

35
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.900
But this is not a common use case, so

36
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.181
typically all you need to do
is specify type as history.
