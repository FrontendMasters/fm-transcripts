>> Getting back to the first exercise. What I want you to do is if you see anything in the player machine, delete it and start over. I want you to recreate that machine and just get a feel for adding initial states, so initial states and adding all the states in the state object and also adding the transitions in each of those states.

[00:00:28]
And so you'll also notice that this is connected to the application. So if we go to 01 states transitions, these buttons, at least a couple of them the play and pause buttons should work. So, ideally, that's what should happen. We already have the code that hooks that up.

[00:00:53]
So, yeah.
