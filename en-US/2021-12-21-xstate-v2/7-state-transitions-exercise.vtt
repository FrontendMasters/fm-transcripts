00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.150
Getting back to the first exercise.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.772
What I want you to do is if you see
anything in the player machine,

3
00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:10.120
delete it and start over.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.039
I want you to recreate that machine and
just get a feel for adding initial states,

5
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.636
so initial states and adding all
the states in the state object and

6
00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:27.250
also adding the transitions
in each of those states.

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.180
And so you'll also notice that this
is connected to the application.

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.798
So if we go to 01 states transitions,
these buttons,

9
00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:46.020
at least a couple of them the play and
pause buttons should work.

10
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.640
So, ideally, that's what should happen.

11
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.570
We already have the code
that hooks that up.

12
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.210
So, yeah.
