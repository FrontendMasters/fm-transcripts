00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.035
All right, let's talk about another
powerful feature of state charts, and

2
00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:05.348
that's history states.

3
00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:08.789
What exactly are history states and
what are they used for?

4
00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.841
History states are not exactly
the same as previous states,

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.926
because a previous state just represents
going arbitrarily back in time and

6
00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:20.880
state machines need to be deterministic.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.434
So if you do wanna go back to some other
state, there needs to be an explicit

8
00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:29.555
transition from your current
states to whatever previous state.

9
00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:32.115
So it sort of needs to be hard coded.

10
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:37.447
History states are actually used in
conjunction with compound states for

11
00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:41.833
revisiting those states with
the previous child states that

12
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.819
the compound state was in.

13
00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:47.546
So let me just describe this in a diagram.

14
00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:52.450
Let's say that we have
a compound state over here and

15
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.473
this compound state has two child states.

16
00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:02.067
So we have A, And we have B.

17
00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:09.659
So let's also say that this
compound state has a sibling state,

18
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.968
and we'll just put this over here, and

19
00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:18.303
it could transition back and
forth between the sibling state.

20
00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:22.049
So we have an arrow going there,
and an arrow or transition,

21
00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.832
whatever you want to call it going there,
of course we need an initial state.

22
00:01:26.832 --> 00:01:29.023
So we're just going to go into A and

23
00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:32.910
pretend that there's like a way
to transition from A to B.

24
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.366
So we have A and B right here.

25
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:43.275
All right, so
let's say that we answer this machine and

26
00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:48.183
we're in the state A and
then a transition is taken out of

27
00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:52.690
this compound state that
goes to this other state.

28
00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.800
And then a transition from the other
states goes back to that compound states.

29
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.557
Well, A is going to be revisited again and
that's going to be the next states and

30
00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:09.510
that's because it is the initial state.

31
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.401
However, let's say that we
transition from A to B.

32
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:16.726
And now B is our current states.

33
00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:20.922
So now when we go to other,
we're in the other state,

34
00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:24.573
so I'm just gonna color
this something else.

35
00:02:24.573 --> 00:02:29.257
And now when we transition back,
I'm gonna color this purple,

36
00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:32.190
what do you think will happen?

37
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.332
Well, since we're entering
this compound states,

38
00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:41.026
we are going to also immediately
enter the initial states and

39
00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:44.920
not the most recent child
state of the states.

40
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.040
So this might not be what we expect or
what we wants to model.

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.160
And so
that's where history states come in handy.

42
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.040
We could have this special,
it's called a pseudo states.

43
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.367
It's defined the same as any other state,
but

44
00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:05.990
it's a state that serves
a special purpose.

45
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.825
And so we're just gonna mark
it with an H over here.

46
00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:12.305
And this is called a history state.

47
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:19.431
So instead of going to this parent
state from this other state,

48
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:24.682
we go from the other
states to a history state.

49
00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:29.154
And this history state is
a child of this parent state,

50
00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:34.110
which means it's also a sibling
of the A and B states.

51
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.442
So what's gonna happen now is if
we're in the B state over here, and

52
00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:40.650
we transition to the other state.

53
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.501
Now, when we transition back, and

54
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:49.730
keep in mind we're transitioning
directly into the history state.

55
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.024
That is actually going to say, all right,

56
00:03:57.024 --> 00:04:01.590
we want to really transition
to the most recent child

57
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.080
state of this parent state,
which is going to be B.

58
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.300
And so that's why history states
are best for remembering what the most

59
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.610
recently visited child state in this
parent state was and going back to it.

60
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.125
So it's not a mechanism for
going back in states.

61
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:29.333
There's completely different
methods of doing that.

62
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:33.117
And you would also typically do that
outside of the state machine itself.

63
00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:37.646
But rather, it's a way for
you to declaratively represent,

64
00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:43.059
I want to go back to the most recently
visited child state in this parents.

65
00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:50.459
So there's also such
thing as deep history.

66
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:55.304
And so let's say that this B state also
has some child states of its own and

67
00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:58.411
let's say that this is
also a compound state.

68
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:02.479
So now instead of having to
have a history state here and

69
00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.787
also have history state here and
if we have deeper levels adding more and

70
00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:12.936
more history states, we could just
represent this as deep history.

71
00:05:12.936 --> 00:05:18.224
And in state chart notation
that's represented with H*.

72
00:05:18.224 --> 00:05:22.688
And so what this deep history
state is gonna do is it's

73
00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:26.668
going to go to the most
recently visited child.

74
00:05:26.668 --> 00:05:31.124
But it's also going to go to that child's
most recently visited children as well.

75
00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:37.772
So it's an infinitely deep, or
a recursive if you will, history state.

76
00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:41.140
And so
that could be useful in many situations.
