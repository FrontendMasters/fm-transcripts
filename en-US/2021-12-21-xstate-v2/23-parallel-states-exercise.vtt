00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
So now we're gonna be doing an exercise
adding parallel states into our machine.

2
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:11.070
Just like we showed in the diagram
right over here, we are gonna

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.191
be splitting up our entire media state
machine into two separate regions.

4
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:21.027
We have the player region and
the volume region.

5
00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:26.114
And so all of our loading and
ready states,

6
00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:31.777
those are going to go
inside the player region.

7
00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:35.822
And then these two states,
unmuted and muted,

8
00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:39.372
are going to go inside the volume region.

9
00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:45.912
So make sure that inside your volume
region you're giving it in initial state

10
00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:52.365
and you could have it be unmuted because
I mean you want to listen to the song.

11
00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:57.101
So unmuted makes sense, and
you want to move this initial

12
00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:01.255
loading transition into
that new player region.

13
00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:03.753
Go ahead and refactor this day chart.

14
00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:08.099
So it has those two player
in volume parallel regions.

15
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.450
And let's see how it goes.
