>> Over here instead of targeting the ready states, we want to target a history state instead so that we can remember what child state of the ready state we were already on. So we currently have the pausing playing state. And now we just need to add a history state here which I'm just gonna call hist.

[00:00:19]
And I'm gonna give it a type of history. And we're going to target that ready hist states, which is represented here by .chaining we have ready .hist so we could target this child state right here. So now just by doing that when we're playing and we skip to the next song.
