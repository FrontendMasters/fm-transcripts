00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.370
In this exercise, we want to do
pretty much what we did over here and

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.870
group the playing and
the paused states in the ready state.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.816
And we're gonna see why this
is useful in future exercises.

4
00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:16.768
But right now it's just to get used to
that grouping states into parents states

5
00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:20.911
and refactoring so that they're
children of that parent state.

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.262
We're gonna call the parent
state the ready state,

7
00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:29.135
and we're gonna specify the initial state,
which could be either paused or

8
00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:33.192
playing depending on what kind
of logic you want to represent.

9
00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:37.524
I think at the beginning,
we said that the song immediately plays.

10
00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:41.037
So if you want the initial
state to be playing,

11
00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:43.751
then you could go ahead and do that.

12
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:49.784
Also, another thing to keep in mind too
is that when we have transitions between

13
00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:56.101
sibling states, like playing and paused,
we could specify the target as the key.

14
00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:00.965
However, when we have a transition
that goes directly from one

15
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:05.202
child state to another
potentially unrelated state.

16
00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:09.369
I guess you could call this an uncle or
an aunt state,

17
00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.607
because it's not directly the parent.

18
00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:18.913
Then we have to give this an ID so that we
could sort of transcend these barriers and

19
00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:23.115
specify the state node from
any arbitrary location.

20
00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.890
And so that's what we're doing over here.

21
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.332
We add this # and
we specify the ID over here.

22
00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:32.422
That's already done for you.

23
00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:35.741
So your only task in this exercise
is to group the paused and

24
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:38.263
playing states in a parent's ready state.
