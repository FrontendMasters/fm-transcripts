00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.140
All right, let's talk about adding
parallel states into our application.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.820
Again, we want it to look like this
where we have player and volume.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.416
All right, so the first thing to
do is to actually have those two

4
00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:17.626
states as the child
states of this machine,

5
00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:22.079
which this machine itself is
going to be the parallel state.

6
00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.593
So we have to first specify type
parallel and then our states.

7
00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:30.587
And I know things are being
duplicated right now, but

8
00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:34.417
that's what happens while
you're refactoring.

9
00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:38.582
So our states are going to be ready,
or sorry, not ready.

10
00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:44.314
Our states are going to be player and
volume.

11
00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:51.342
And so now we can move all of these
states over here, well, not all of them.

12
00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:55.192
But we can move this
initial into there and

13
00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:59.482
then we're going to be
copying the loading and

14
00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.904
ready states over here into states.

15
00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:05.848
So let's just close that up and

16
00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:11.406
now we're gonna be copying
these two states into volume.

17
00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:15.715
The initial state is going to be unmuted,
and so

18
00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:20.652
now we have our states of unmuted and
muted.

19
00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:23.303
Now we have an extra thing over there.

20
00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:28.021
All right, so
now let's test our application and

21
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.852
see what we have, six parallel states.

22
00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:38.738
Okay, so if everything works,
now we should have a volume that mutes and

23
00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:39.408
unmutes.

24
00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:44.224
So we know that that region is working,
and so we also have our play and

25
00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:45.900
pause working as well.

26
00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.578
So we know that these are working.

27
00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:53.333
Now if you want to do something extra,

28
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:58.340
you could also scope these events
to their appropriate reasons.

29
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.900
For example, the skip, like,
unlike, dislike, and audio.time,

30
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.624
these are transitions that
only have actions, except for

31
00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:11.341
this target one which is targeting an ID
so we can move it anywhere anyway.

32
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.573
We can move those to here.

33
00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:21.270
And so now we have everything nice and
organized inside of this player state.

34
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.148
And we could see, okay, the player region
is responsible for these skip, like,

35
00:02:26.148 --> 00:02:28.919
unlike, dislike, and audio.time events.

36
00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.755
And so,
we could do the same thing over here for

37
00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:38.469
the volume controls and
just put it on there.

38
00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:43.380
And so, now we don't need this anymore and
everything should be working the same.
