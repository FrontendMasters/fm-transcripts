00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.530
Over here instead of
targeting the ready states,

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.050
we want to target
a history state instead so

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.470
that we can remember what child state
of the ready state we were already on.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.855
So we currently have
the pausing playing state.

5
00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:19.125
And now we just need to add a history
state here which I'm just gonna call hist.

6
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.235
And I'm gonna give it a type of history.

7
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:28.208
And we're going to target
that ready hist states,

8
00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:33.488
which is represented here by
.chaining we have ready .hist so

9
00:00:33.488 --> 00:00:37.290
we could target this
child state right here.

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.032
So now just by doing that when we're
playing and we skip to the next song.

11
00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:51.279
We're still playing, and so now if we're
paused and we skip to the next song,

12
00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:56.726
now we're paused again, so we see
that our history states still works.
