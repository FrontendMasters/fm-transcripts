00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.657
Now let's go to an exercise
on final states.

2
00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:08.708
Something that was mentioned in the chat
was the facts that we have this sort

3
00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:13.618
of ugly looking transition over here,
because we're targeting an ID.

4
00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:18.450
So it's ugly because we're in
a child state of a parent state, but

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.604
we want this to go directly
to an unrelated parent state.

6
00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:26.058
Like I called it, it's sort of
like an uncle or sibling states.

7
00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:30.080
But we could represent
this more semantically and

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.111
in a cleaner way,
by using final states instead.

9
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:38.813
So what I want you to do is change
this target to go to a finished state,

10
00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:41.652
make this finished state a final state and

11
00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:45.236
observe what happens with
this on done transition.

12
00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:50.030
And test it in your app and make sure
that everything still works the same.
