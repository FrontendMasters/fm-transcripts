00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.820
We're going to be jumping
into the first exercise.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.363
And so, if you go to localhost,

3
00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:11.566
port 3000, /00-modeling,

4
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:18.020
you could also access this by
clicking the link over here.

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.946
You're going to see a media player, and

6
00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:26.710
this doesn't exactly need
to be hooked up just yet.

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.350
It just serves as a visual guide for now.

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.917
What we're gonna be mainly doing
is working in the console itself.

9
00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:40.004
And so, for this exercise, what I want you
to do is, you're gonna see a main.js file.

10
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:46.201
We're going to be creating a simple state
machine that represents the loading,

11
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:51.070
play, and
pause functionality of our media player.

12
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.330
And so, let's first create the state
machine visually over here.

13
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.833
So instead of loading, or
sorry, instead of idle,

14
00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.628
our initial state is going to be loading.

15
00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:06.534
And this represents loading the song,
we're going to have a loaded event.

16
00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:09.766
And so, according to the specification,

17
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:14.250
when the song is loaded,
we're gonna start playing it.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.620
So the state machine goes
to the playing state.

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.032
Now, we could go back and
forth between the playing and

20
00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:26.494
paused states using events.

21
00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:31.958
So we could go from playing
to paused when we pause it.

22
00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.239
And we could go from paused to playing,

23
00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.610
When the play event happens.

24
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.615
So basically,

25
00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:47.809
I want you to represent this state machine
in code without using any libraries.

26
00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:52.254
And yeah, so you could use either
a switch statement or an object.

27
00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:56.951
And just like we did by attaching
the transition function to the window,

28
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:59.728
play around with it, look in the console.

29
00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:03.853
Make sure that all of the transitions
are actually working.

30
00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:08.620
And then if you want to,
find a way to localize that state, so

31
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.028
you have this object that you
could just send events to.

32
00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:17.700
If you don't get that far, then that's
okay, we're gonna be doing it together,

33
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.730
cuz that's gonna be
an important concepts later on.
