00:00:02.724 --> 00:00:03.735
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we have this Redux Store.

2
00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.010
We can now produce new
states of the world.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.740
We need to store that somewhere, right?

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.970
I'm trying to think of the right now,
and if I looked up here for

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.860
where I could store stuff,
I'll create a place to store stuff.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.330
Well, I could use Create Store.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.690
That seems good.

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.210
So I'll go ahead and I'm just gonna
use it, we'll find out what happens.

9
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.800
If I just call createStore,

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.720
I'm not gonna like blow up my console
cuz I know what's gonna happen.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.700
This is gonna blow up.

12
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.250
One does not just create a store,
you also have to give it a reducer.

13
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.880
But turns out, guess what I have?

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.595
I made a reducer just before.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

15
00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:53.930
I hand it this reducer, I save it.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I've got the store.

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.550
And it's a lot for the console right here,

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.680
but it itself only has a few methods,
right?

18
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.251
It's got a dispatch method, it's got
a getState method, there's not a lot

19
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:09.424
necessarily going on with this one either.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

20
00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:12.680
let's play around with some of these.

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.553
We could, for instance,
let's go ahead and let's

22
00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:24.630
create a subscriber, lets subscribe to
the story cause like your state changes.

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.060
We can imagine a world where

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.010
the view layer might want to know that
the state of the world changed, and

25
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.720
listen for it, and receive that new
state of the world and update the view.

26
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.330
That seems rational, right?

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.600
So let's take a look at that.

28
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.210
Again this is, Redux doesn't
have anything to do with reacts,

29
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.500
we're just imagineering right now.

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.630
Cool, so we'll just have a console log
that's gonna be like subscription.

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.948
And, we'll actually say,
we're passing the store and

32
00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:08.311
we'll say getState.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'm just going

33
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.840
to get the result off of that, because
I don't want to blow up this console.

34
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.980
So, we have this subscriber, which is
just a function, that console logs, and

35
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.900
will at any given point log
out the state of the store.

36
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.640
Very cool, and

37
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.580
the next thing we need to do is we have
the store and it has a subscribe method.

38
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.680
I will give it subscriber.

39
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.150
That will return a value, which will be a
function that you can call to unsubscribe.

40
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.210
So I could say
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

41
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.740
then if I called unsubscribe later,
that event scenario would be taken off.

42
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.906
All right, let's try it out.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We've got the store.

43
00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:05.568
And let's store.dispatch which is
our next method to play around with.

44
00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:08.515
We'll say store.dispatch and
we'll give it the

45
00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:14.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Add action, and

46
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.588
you can see that
the subscription rang true and

47
00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:22.550
the current state was 4.

48
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.240
Let's call it again.

49
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.480
Look.
The current state is now eight, right?

50
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.120
So, the store is keeping track of
the current state of the world.

51
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.410
It's receiving, it's dispatching actions
to go into the reducer, which is

52
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.590
then modifying the state of the world and
it's keeping track of that, right?

53
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.530
So all of a sudden,
we have a way to manage state,

54
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.331
we have a way to manipulate state.

55
00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:48.653
Very cool.

56
00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:51.959
Now I could implement subtract,
and multiply, and all those, but

57
00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.787
I'm gonna to spare on that right now
because it's basically means using every

58
00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:59.799
operator on the number of my keyboard,
and that in variants different factions.

59
00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.790
So not necessarily gonna
do that right now.
