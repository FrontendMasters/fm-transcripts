00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:04.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's actually just do
filter real quick just to see it in there.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.040
Cuz I think we can get it done and

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.260
we'll feel good that we
have the entire app done.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.010
I think that it will make us feel
really great, so we have the filter,

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.220
we have items.

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.540
So items is gonna have the search term
cuz it needs to go through the items.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.630
It's going to be given to filter.

8
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.360
So, we have this updated search term which
at this point is already getting past.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.950
But we need to keep
a search term in state, so,

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.060
we'll say search term and
we'll start out as an empty string.

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.150
Because that will actually allow all of
them through because it turns out that

12
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.429
every string has an empty string in it.

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.100
So we'll keep that searchTerm in there.

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.450
And what we'll do is,
when updateSearchTerm happens,

15
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.520
we'll take the searchTerm,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: this.setState,

16
00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:01.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: With the searchTerm.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.660
If you haven't seen this syntax before,
this is just ESX object shorthand.

18
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.650
Which is basically is the same thing as
doing, hey take the searchTerm argument.

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.700
And set it to the key of the searchTerm
object except you type less.

20
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.290
That seems to be the major
theme of [INAUDIBLE] that

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.390
theoretically you never
type function ever again.

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
And you're able to do some
stuff a little bit shorter and

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.790
cleaner which is really great
if you have a very large font.

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.349
Cuz your coding with a hundred
of your best friends.

25
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.030
So have it update the search term and
we have that search term in state.

26
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.860
We just need to pass it down so
we'll say this.state.searchTerm.

27
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.956
I could also put it.

28
00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:42.630
I could deconstruct it here.

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.395
That is the only place I'm using it so
I'm still going to leave it here and

30
00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:51.838
let's try it out
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If/ I can update it,

31
00:01:51.838 --> 00:01:54.860
but it doesn't seem to be doing the thing.

32
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.620
Let's open this up.

33
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.960
It's great when you go for a live coding
bonus, and it doesn't work immediately.

34
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.190
That's always really rewarding.

35
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.362
Cool, so let's take a look at-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

36
00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:09.483
return method if you scroll down.

37
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.075
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What?

38
00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In items,
you need to filter [INAUDIBLE].

39
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.218
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm filtering
all the items right here.

40
00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:21.715
Cuz we gotta find the state.

41
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:30.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: this.state.searchTerm,
to lowercase.

42
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.820
At this point I would probably
pull this out into a variable so

43
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.520
I don't have to type it in both places.

44
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.990
But let's verify that everything works.

45
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.400
Yay, everything works.

46
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.620
We've implemented filter.

47
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.570
We've implemented the ability
to add a new one.

48
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.660
We've implemented the ability to
mark them as packed or unpacked.

49
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.120
To remove them,
to make them all as packed, right?

50
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.680
But we had to pass stuff down a lot,
right?

51
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.760
It would be great if we had
some ways to avoid this, right?

52
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.750
To be able to say,

53
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.020
hey, I have a set of things I would
like to encapsulate this component.

54
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.826
And that's what we'll look
at in the next section.
