&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so,
itâ€™s time to look at Jetsetter.

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.980
And in the last exercise we started
to wire things together and

3
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.640
we know that the react base branch
has the kind of end result there.

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.190
So if you didn't get to get all the test
passing, it's okay, I got you covered.

5
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.900
We're gonna kinda go in and

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.430
we'll be able to, we're just gonna kinda
get one or two of these put together.

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.030
The goal is not necessarily get
the entire application done,

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600
cuz we'll be able to
build on it from there.

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.540
But we probably want to just get a feel.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.260
Again, we wanna get that muscle memory
of writing a connect implementation.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.650
Not an implementation but using
connect to make a container component.

12
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.750
So you may not get it all done.

13
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.528
I would suggest maybe starting
with either like packed or

14
00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:58.340
unpacked list that we can show on
the page and trying to get that in there.

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.830
And so you don't have add yet so you might
wanna go to the initial state file and

16
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.767
just add some items by hand but
try to get maybe one component done and

17
00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.340
we'll implement it together afterwards.

18
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.560
So let's just show where you might
wanna look in here to get you started

19
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.200
on the right foot.

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.980
So this is pizza calculator.

21
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.840
And this is Jetsetter.

22
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.300
Very cool, so
I have all of my filters and reducers.

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.280
If I go into the store,

24
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.610
you can see that I've wired up
everything I was talking about before.

25
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.280
So that's all done for us right now.

26
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.500
And what we're gonna want is
these containers which are blank.

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.330
So I would, for instance, pack maybe
create the packed items container.

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.460
Well, what is the packed
items container need?

29
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.110
Well, it's gonna need the map state
to props and map dispatch to props.

30
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.880
We can start even with
just map state to props,

31
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.890
cuz it's going to pluck the items
off of the state tree and

32
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.910
it's gonna filter through all of
them looking for the packed items.

33
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.950
Right, so
that's like a great place to start.

34
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.910
Dispatch will probably wants to grab
the ability to toggle an item and

35
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.780
remove an item so it can pass
it down to all of its children.

36
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.460
So we can kind of plot those
two things off as dispatch.

37
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
We can pull the one piece of state we need
and filter it and we'll be able to create

38
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.590
this present day of packed items container
that we can go ahead into the application.

39
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.310
And what we'll be able to do is take

40
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.340
this packed items one and swap it out and
we will have one that's connect to redux.

41
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.414
So let's spend about 15
minutes trying that out and

42
00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:36.853
then we'll kind of look over a slightly
completed example where we can see all

43
00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:40.628
of the moving pieces together, and
look at it with the dev tools.
