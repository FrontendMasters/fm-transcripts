1
00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:06.921
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now we've got an item
store, we've got some actions, and

2
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:10.405
we've got a dispatcher,
we are most of the way there.

3
00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:15.981
I'm gonna start on the place
we the most amount of wind,

4
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.737
and that is like the bottom of the tree,
right?

5
00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:25.171
It would be cool if I could remove and
check an item or I'll pack and

6
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:30.027
unpack an item without having to
navigate up and down the tree, right?

7
00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:33.788
So that seems like the most easy place
to get like a quick victory here.

8
00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.862
So I'll go into the individual item and

9
00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:42.184
you can see that onChange it's
whatever onCheckOff has passed in.

10
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:45.724
And, remove that's whatever
onRemove has passed in.

11
00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:50.449
But I have a title now, right?

12
00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.305
I have a Remove.

13
00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:55.016
I can just get this from the store and

14
00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.541
not have to get them from
anywhere in the hierarchy.

15
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:04.733
So we can import,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: ToggleItem and

16
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:09.970
removeItem from the actions.

17
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.189
Okay, so now, I have two choices,
I can make anonymous function,

18
00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.591
I get recreated every time this rerenders.

19
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:22.492
So I can pass the actual item in,
or I can create some methods, so

20
00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:28.301
I'm just gonna do that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

21
00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:32.896
call this one handleChange.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

22
00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:38.488
I'll toggleItem,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: With

23
00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:40.011
the item that was passed in.

24
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:47.495
And we'll say handleRemove,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

25
00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:54.480
that will move the item.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

26
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.441
right now this won't really do anything,

27
00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.400
cuz like the application is
still using the other array.

28
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.603
But let's just cheat for a little bit,
let's just live in a happier world.

29
00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:09.083
And what we'll do is
we'll go into this store,

30
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:14.056
and I just have to wire these up,
so then I can come back in here.

31
00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:18.699
And we'll say this.addItem(action.item).

32
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:25.624
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And here,

33
00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:30.368
we'll say this.removeItem(action.item).

34
00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:39.006
And here was this., oops that's toggle.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: UpdateItem.

35
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.657
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This.updateItem,

36
00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:48.221
this.removeItem
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

37
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:53.066
what we'll say is when we're in the
process of removing item let's console log

38
00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:58.580
to see if it works.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

39
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.299
cuz this is the one that we didn't
pass down the hierarchy but

40
00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.946
we still have all of the different, that
other array and application right now.

41
00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:09.624
So we won't see the change just yet but
it would be interesting to try it out.

42
00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:12.237
All right, so I'm gonna go over.

43
00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:24.637
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll just open my
fifth port today, it'll be fine.

44
00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:39.656
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's hit Remove,

45
00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:41.704
hope it actually works.

46
00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:49.945
That's interesting
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Make

47
00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:59.865
sure we saved our files, nope.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's try that out now.

48
00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:09.681
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oops, still working,

49
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.045
that's interesting because
I didn't replace these.

50
00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:17.083
You make new methods, you don't pass
them in, they don't work, fun fact.

51
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:24.733
This.handleChange.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This.handleRemove.

52
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.959
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, now,

53
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:34.463
we will either see a blowup or
we will see that console log.

54
00:04:34.463 --> 00:04:39.456
Cuz I will pay the price for writing
too much code between checking the UI.

55
00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:45.262
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We got a blow up and

56
00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:47.733
I can't read this top property,
props of undefined.

57
00:04:47.733 --> 00:04:50.056
Anyone wanna take a lucky guess?

58
00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.599
I already know.

59
00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.699
These aren't bound to this,
I didn't use my fancy new syntax.

60
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.949
So I either have to this.handleChange
to bind this, it's because I can't

61
00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.382
find this.props.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Programming

62
00:05:05.382 --> 00:05:13.787
is fun everyone, you should all do it.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If

63
00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:16.332
the stuff was easy it would be data
entry and they wouldn't pay us.

64
00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:16.921
So,

65
00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:28.385
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Or it will stop loading

66
00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:31.577
now?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right now I'm

67
00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:33.072
getting nothing, so let's see.

68
00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:35.521
We've got this handleRemove

69
00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:52.142
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we got,

70
00:05:56.637 --> 00:05:57.137
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so

71
00:05:57.137 --> 00:05:59.491
we're in the item, but let's see,
let's go up to the next step.

72
00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:02.743
So this is the action creator,
so let's go there.

73
00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:23.121
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: My suspicion is we get

74
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.418
there but we're not, we flubbed the string

75
00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:35.896
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
we got into the action creator.

76
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:39.660
Next, we go to the dispatcher,
which is gonna send it to

77
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.728
the store
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If

78
00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:47.089
action type is remove item.

79
00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:03.513
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is from what I

80
00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:06.535
had submit that quit before
that I knew everything was.

81
00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:08.137
This is called a karma.

82
00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:19.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so

83
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.482
we never get there.

84
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.543
So let's go up a level.

85
00:07:31.554 --> 00:07:32.134
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's say we're

86
00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:34.073
in the store and
we'll console out of the action, as well.

87
00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:45.147
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give it a refresh.

88
00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:54.401
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so

89
00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:58.185
we haven't gotten there.

90
00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:02.295
Cool, so I'm trying to figure
out what the issue is.

91
00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:04.745
We've got the appDispatcher and
we're registering with it.

92
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.699
Clearly it looks like that is working for
me but

93
00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.938
I am never receiving the action.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

94
00:08:12.938 --> 00:08:13.707
here we're dispatching.

95
00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:28.994
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We know that we get here.

96
00:08:28.994 --> 00:08:37.934
We've got this REMOVE_ITEM type.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What's up?

97
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.641
No?

98
00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:42.206
[LAUGH] All right, so let's see.

99
00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:52.492
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

100
00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:54.516
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No, if it's just one

101
00:08:54.516 --> 00:09:02.893
argument you can omit it, right in ESX.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

102
00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:06.282
so we have app dispatcher, we're
registering it, we can see that's a thing.

103
00:09:06.282 --> 00:09:08.969
We're not getting the action at all
in here which means that it's not

104
00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:13.609
registering.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We call in the new

105
00:09:13.609 --> 00:09:14.339
items store.

106
00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:16.466
I'm gonna check real quick in
the construction to see if it's actually

107
00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:25.053
building
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so we're

108
00:09:25.053 --> 00:09:28.667
just coming back from a minor technical
issue where we weren't seeing the events.

109
00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:33.600
And the reason for that was we created
the item store in itemstore.js, but

110
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.154
because we never require that file,
it was never evaluated and ran.

111
00:09:38.154 --> 00:09:41.936
Which means this new item store never
executed, which means the constructor

112
00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:45.019
never executed, which means we
never registered the events,

113
00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:47.069
which is why they are getting swallowed.

114
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:51.076
So to fix it, all I did real
quick was I imported it into

115
00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:56.081
application.js where I'm going
to need it eventually anyways.

116
00:09:56.081 --> 00:10:00.041
So now when I flip back over,
if I hit Remove,

117
00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:05.683
you can see that the remove item
is at this point, being called.

118
00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:11.734
So let's actually go and
see that individual item as well.

119
00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:15.548
We can that we're calling remove
item that's happening in the store.

120
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:21.378
This is not getting passed down from
application to item to the item anymore,

121
00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:23.989
this is being pulled directly in.

122
00:10:23.989 --> 00:10:28.098
This could be very far down,
our component hierarchy and

123
00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:32.390
we could still pull in this actions and
this state, right?

124
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.405
And here we only, the action still makes
sense to have that in the application,

125
00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:37.754
because that's where we gonna
filter between the two lists.

126
00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:40.250
But we don't have pass
down that action anymore.

127
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.248
So really other than
receiving the item itself,

128
00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:50.989
everything else is at this point pretty
like self contained, which is very cool.

129
00:10:50.989 --> 00:10:54.226
Cuz like we would need to know what item
it was anyway, so it makes sense for

130
00:10:54.226 --> 00:10:55.912
the thing that maps over it to do that.
