00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:09.218
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
there are fourish major concepts to MobX.

2
00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.558
And it's really, there's three concepts.

3
00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:14.045
But the third one has two, so fourish.

4
00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:14.832
You can count three.

5
00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:18.190
You can count five,
I'm gonna call it four.

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.650
You have observable state.

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.269
You have actions,
which are anything that change that state.

8
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.077
You have computed properties which will,
they're usually like they're lazy.

9
00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:32.461
So like you don't actually do that
computation until you call last name,

10
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.589
unless you're watching for
last name and then that won't change.

11
00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.150
It won't be recomputed,
unless first name or last name changes.

12
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.310
If first name and last name changes, we
now know that the full name is dirty and

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.916
we have to like recompute it.

14
00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:48.943
But if it doesn't change like,
it will memorize that and

15
00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:52.429
you will just get like hey,
this is based on first name last name.

16
00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.459
If those things haven't changed,

17
00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:59.911
then everything should be good and
then reactions.

18
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:01.548
Reactions are side effects.

19
00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:03.479
That was what we do with auto-run.

20
00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.485
That was a reaction.

21
00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:06.899
I changed parts of that object.

22
00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.257
And then all of a sudden,
the DOM rerendered or

23
00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:12.450
like I replaced the inner
text of a document body.

24
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.715
That's obviously a side effect.

25
00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:19.028
And again, side effects are what
can trigger components to rerender.

26
00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:22.769
Side effects are like effectively what
are able to, we can change this object.

27
00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:27.060
It can be isolated, but then the UI can
change based on the object changing.

28
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.440
So computed properties update their
value based on observable data.

29
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.470
Reactions produce side effect.

30
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.940
And so it is an action here would
just be like add guest is technically

31
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.250
an action and
I can annotate that with a add guest.

32
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.640
It's an action whether you annotate it or
not.

33
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.200
There is one reason you will see me
annotating it when we get to doing this

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.634
with react, but I will make you wait.

35
00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:58.216
But here is a version of pizza
calculator that would use observable and

36
00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:03.357
you can see that we are observing the
number of people, the slices per person.

37
00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:06.280
And now, I've added a new
metric which is slices per pie.

38
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.560
In case you live in one of those weird
places that cuts it strange like six or

39
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.360
ten, that's not cool.

40
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.846
It's a square pie, I don't know.

41
00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:16.145
I don't wanna get into this.

42
00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:17.489
It gets me very angry, I'm from New York.

43
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.643
So we have these observable
pieces of data and

44
00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:27.971
we have these computed versions and
like those won't get recomputed,

45
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:33.589
unless you need to, unless you change
any one of those underlying values.

46
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.269
And then add guest as an action,

47
00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.203
which will change the number of people
which will recompute both of those.

48
00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:42.721
Because if you look at pies needed,
that relies on slicesNeeded.

49
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:44.190
What does slicesNeeded rely on?

50
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.521
Number of people.

51
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:51.210
You can actually omit the action notation.

52
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.220
But again, I'll tell you why
in a second you might want it.

53
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.958
Originally, that was for documenting.

54
00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.212
But like I think it will
have some special uses.

55
00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.279
I would recommend that you use it.
