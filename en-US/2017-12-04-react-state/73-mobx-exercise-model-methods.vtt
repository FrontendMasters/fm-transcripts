00:00:02.108 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
we have the ability to add them, right?

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.340
And it gets added to the right list.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.270
I have not implemented the ability
to check or remove yet.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.000
We haven't done that,
we haven't done filtering.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.750
And what I would like you to do is

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.410
add the ability to be able to check and
remove one of these.

7
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.200
So let's talk a little bit about
what's gonna be involved in that.

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.418
You have the item in
the singular item component,

9
00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:33.218
you could literally call remove or
something like that.

10
00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:35.400
You do need to do a little
bit of mechanics.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.260
I would also recommend giving yourself a
method, so that you can just pass that as

12
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.560
the On click, for On the On click,
on either the check box or whatever.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.465
So I'm gonna get you kind
of started in that case and

14
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:48.765
then help you tie it together.

15
00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:52.715
Your major job is gonna be spending a few
minutes just kind of implementing it in

16
00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.065
the UI and getting a feel for this.

17
00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:57.715
And I will push up this
branch before we do that.

18
00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:04.110
So with the item list, really,

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.190
we wanna call remove on an item, but
we want it taken out of the item list.

20
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.550
So what we'll likely do in
this case is we'll go in and

21
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.300
we'll give the item list a remove.

22
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.317
And we'll say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [INAUDIBLE] remove,

23
00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:23.839
let's see.

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We call add item, right?

25
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.596
So we'll say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: removeItem

26
00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:42.142
with a given item and all that's gonna
do is say this.items=this.items.

27
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.412
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I don't even need to
check for an ID, because before they were

28
00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:52.471
different objects in memory and
we used the ID as a way to tell.

29
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.709
What I can do is just point it like
are you literally that item, right?

30
00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.550
Cuz we're back to objects
stored in memory references.

31
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.351
It can change all of those things.

32
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.440
We don't necessarily need to
worry about each of these.

33
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.150
So we can say remove items.

34
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.004
And then what we'll do in the individual
item is we'll give ourselves,

35
00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.936
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: action.bound, and

36
00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:24.852
we'll say remove, nope,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

37
00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:29.446
say this.list,remove(item).

38
00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:35.430
So it will be like hey, when I get
removed I know, this.list.remove(this).

39
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.770
I know when they call remove on me,
tell the list I want out.

40
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.700
And then we should be able
to have it automatically

41
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.050
removed from the list as well.
