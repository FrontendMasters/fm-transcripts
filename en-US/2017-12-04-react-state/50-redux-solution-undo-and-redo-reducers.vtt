1
00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can click these and
you can see the actions are being fired.

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.560
it doesn't do anything yet because I
haven't wired these into a reducer at all.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.643
So I'm gonna need to do that.

4
00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:17.210
These are firing actions that go into
the ether cuz no reducer cares about them.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.432
So we put it on the page, we have it,
we know that it's firing actions.

6
00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:26.402
What we wanna do is we need to, this
is still broken, if I hit any of these,

7
00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.023
it's very angry at me.

8
00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:30.110
We're gonna need to do a few things.

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.563
We're gonna need to always use the present
as our item, so we need to fix those.

10
00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:37.260
And then also, what's the other thing that
we need to do in order to be able to undo?

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.960
We can change the present, but
we also have to remember the past, right?

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.860
So we're gonna take the past and

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.810
we're gonna put it on the array
of all of the past states.

14
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.770
So let's begin to implement that.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.060
So I'm gonna go to the items reducer.

16
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.230
I'm just gonna head start here.

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.765
And I know that it's now,

18
00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:03.324
we'll go through,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

19
00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:04.520
I need to think about this.

20
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.738
I'm going to return.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's pull these and

21
00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:16.586
let's say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Past,

22
00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:20.563
present, future equals the state.

23
00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:27.835
And what we'll do here is,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Return

24
00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:34.310
whatever the current past was,
the present, the future.

25
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.690
And I'm gonna copy this real quick.

26
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.770
And,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.522
this will be the state.present
plus the new item, right?

28
00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.880
And we'll put that in the present.

29
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.623
And then the past is going to be,

30
00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:02.940
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: State.past.

31
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.071
Actually, I wanna put the present in the
beginning, and you'll see why in a second.

32
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:11.912
What's that?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

33
00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:13.877
this will be the current present,

34
00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:18.710
which is now the soon to be past, and then
we're gonna overwrite [LAUGH] the present.

35
00:02:20.122 --> 00:02:23.574
If you've watched Back to the Future
lately, that's fairly helpful for

36
00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:24.922
understanding any of this.

37
00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:29.470
All right, very cool, so past, present,
and future, we'll update those.

38
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.385
Let's keep going along, so
I'm putting the present at the front, and

39
00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:36.752
I'm just gonna use that cuz for
a little help later.

40
00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:38.970
Action type, remove item.

41
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.974
Again, we need to do a little bit of,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll bring this in and

42
00:02:44.974 --> 00:02:45.960
we'll return.

43
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:53.764
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Present is gonna be

44
00:02:53.764 --> 00:03:02.178
present.filter
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

45
00:03:02.178 --> 00:03:07.681
so we'll filter all those.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: State.present,

46
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:11.730
yeah, we need this present
right here as well.

47
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.690
And then the past, again,this is gonna
be the same thing that we had here.

48
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.350
Just take the current state of
the world and put it in the past.

49
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.723
All right, we keep going here,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

50
00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:33.499
we'll grab this, [SOUND],

51
00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:38.496
a little too.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

52
00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:43.504
say present,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Get rid of the semicolon.

53
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll append it

54
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.107
to the stack there.

55
00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:56.460
All right, almost there.

56
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.842
We gotta mark it as unpacked and
then we're done.

57
00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:06.761
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Put that on, and

58
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.210
then we'll grab this,
turn it into the present again.

59
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.860
And then we are going to do
the thing I'm most nervous for,

60
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.209
which is check the code and
make sure that I didn't break anything.

61
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.070
Cuz in a perfect word, we're going
to append stuff into the past, but

62
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.760
we still haven't implemented it yet.

63
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.931
But ideally, my app should work and
not break, in a perfect world.

64
00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:34.531
All right, you see toggle item,
you can now see that the old item is,

65
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:40.923
we have it there in the past.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Present,

66
00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:43.056
all right, very cool.

67
00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:48.060
All right, so now we wanna
implement the undo and the redo.

68
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.558
So we're gonna have two situations
that could happen if the action

69
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:56.270
type,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is undo action

70
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.142
item.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's

71
00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:02.813
a constant cuz I have it assigned.

72
00:05:02.813 --> 00:05:11.155
Yep, I could use the string too.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

73
00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:14.223
Visual Studio Code is now nice enough
apparently to automatically import

74
00:05:14.223 --> 00:05:14.820
stuff for me.

75
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.390
I don't know if that's a plug-in or what,
I will check my plug-ins later to find out

76
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.760
how I've enabled that amazing feature and
share that in a little bit.

77
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.090
Cool, so we wanna undo.

78
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.100
There's a chance that the past
could be empty, right?

79
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.180
If we just start out the app,

80
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.400
we don't wanna grab the first thing out of
the array cuz that's gonna be undefined,

81
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.790
everything's gonna end poorly.

82
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.001
So we'll say if there's nothing
in the past, like literally,

83
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:42.313
just don't do anything.

84
00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:47.260
But if there is,
we'll say the new future is

85
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.271
going to be,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What's currently

86
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:57.334
the present,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Plus whatever is

87
00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:04.140
already in the future, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm

88
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.037
inside other conditional I think.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm getting better about

89
00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:13.603
reading the warning.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so

90
00:06:13.603 --> 00:06:19.070
we got the newFuture, and
then we'll say, the newPresent.

91
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.043
And this syntax is pulling stuff off of
the array that's gonna be the currentPast.

92
00:06:24.043 --> 00:06:29.142
So if you haven't seen the syntax before,
this is gonna pull the first item off

93
00:06:29.142 --> 00:06:34.724
the array and call it the newPresent, and
call everything else on the array newPast.

94
00:06:34.724 --> 00:06:37.474
And that's why I put it on the front,
there's no great syntax for

95
00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:39.450
pulling the last thing off the array.

96
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.530
So Iâ€™m putting it on
the front of each array, so

97
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.460
I can just pull out the first thing on
the array and then I have everything else.

98
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.056
Cool, so then we'll simply return past is

99
00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:57.244
the newPast.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The present,

100
00:06:57.244 --> 00:06:58.050
it the newPresent.

101
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.970
And the future is the newFuture.

102
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.895
Naming things is hard, if you have
better names, I would say go for

103
00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:10.927
that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

104
00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:14.090
I'm gonna just basically do
a few little changes here.

105
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.870
I'm gonna say there's no future,
we're not doing any redo.

106
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.451
And then we're gonna change this
a little bit, which is, let's grab,

107
00:07:21.451 --> 00:07:27.150
let's move this up, and we're grabbing
the present off of the future now.

108
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.486
Anyone confused about
time travel right now?

109
00:07:31.622 --> 00:07:33.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Near future.

110
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.910
I'm basically shuffling
everything across these stacks,

111
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.500
is effectively what's happening.

112
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.819
It's just, yeah, and we'll say the,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Will

113
00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.140
be the present plus what
was ever on the past.

114
00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:54.460
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, I'm excited.

115
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.660
I'm not confident, but I'm excited.

116
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.302
Cuz there was a whole a lot of
[LAUGH] intricate code there.

117
00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:05.440
So we'll say I've packed pants, undo.

118
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.148
It's back.

119
00:08:08.148 --> 00:08:12.063
Undo, undo, undo,

120
00:08:12.063 --> 00:08:16.679
redo, redo.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,

121
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:20.370
we wanna undo it, we wanna redo it.

122
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.353
We wanna undo it, we wanna redo it.

123
00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:22.110
We wanna undo it, we wanna redo it.

124
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.345
So now, it's really awesome
when we have this stature,

125
00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:26.220
we can kind of manage this
stuff with our state.

126
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.520
We can implement features that I think
would have been a really complicated if we

127
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.045
we're just like manipulating
background models, right?

128
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:34.948
But we store each frame of
the state of the world and

129
00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:39.000
we've effectively implemented
time travel in our application.

130
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Literally, with past, present and future.

131
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.330
We've implemented time travel
in our application, and

132
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.810
have a really great way
to add new features.

133
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.660
While it was definitely some extra
steps I had to put in place, I

134
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.140
did implement this feature pretty quickly
on the grand scheme of things, right?

135
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.963
And there's different options that you can
do it, different ways that you can do it

136
00:08:57.963 --> 00:09:01.220
cuz, again, that's the great part
about having objects, right,

137
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.960
that you're moving around and functions,
is that you can implement these things and

138
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.210
it's very granular,
how you go about doing it.

139
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.640
This is something, just FYI,
I would definitely reduce or

140
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.070
test to your friends here, right?

141
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.240
I was not confident as I was
writing that code, right?

142
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.330
So if I was doing it in more than 10,
15 minutes, I'd probably write some unit

143
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.622
tests and make sure that the state of
the word is what I expected each time.

144
00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:28.218
Rather than hoping for the best when I
flipped over in front of 20 people in

145
00:09:28.218 --> 00:09:30.403
the room and 130 people online right now.

146
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.600
But yeah, so
we've implemented undo and redo.
