00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.412
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so we've now set
the context of talking about state,

2
00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:08.300
that was fun, wasn't it?

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.990
We had this heady intellectual
discussion at nine in the morning.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.810
Now we're going to move into
the second phase, which is

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.660
what I like to call An Uncomfortably
Close Look at React Component State.

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.980
Right you're like I signed up for redox!

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.590
I'm like yes, we're starting with
reaction component state, and

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.290
we're gonna look at it and

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.520
kind of like figure out, cuz a lot of
the patterns that we use in react redox.

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.710
Or with any sl libraries,

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.550
you can implement with regular
reaction components right?

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540
And maybe sometimes you should, alright.

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.110
So we're going to look at it,
in the simplest possible case.

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.820
And then begin to keep stepping back, and
looking at it from a wider and wider view.

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.570
So we're going to start with
the world's simplest React component.

16
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.140
And, in the theme of building
our own light sabre,

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.130
we're all going to do it individually.

18
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.540
So that when I get into
that fun quiz time,

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.560
you can validate whether the things
I'm saying are actually true or not.

20
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.250
They are, but
you should definitely use science and

21
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.510
be able to validate those things,
rather than taking my word for it.

22
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.310
Alright, so here's our first exercise.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.700
This'll be a really quick one.

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.079
There's it's called basic-counter, and

25
00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.680
right now if you're on the master branch,
it doesn't really do much.

26
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.340
It doesn't have any say, it's just
a component that renders zero and

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.650
a bunch of buttons that
are completely no ops.

28
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.840
Right, they are just anonymous
functions that eventually just

29
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.380
don't return anything or do anything.

30
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.640
So we're going to start out
by getting that working.

31
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.990
I'll show you the code in one second.

32
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.030
There's a bunch of other files in
there because I have a lesson plan and

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.820
there's a plan to what we're doing.

34
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.560
But, the one you need to
concern yourself with right now

35
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.820
is simply the one that is
the counter-component.

36
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.875
So let's actually take a look at it.

37
00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:09.231
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pull it over,
[SOUND] Cool.

38
00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:13.154
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
let's actually pull up basic counter.

39
00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Here it is.

40
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.620
It's really great.

41
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.320
It has a count that is always set to zero.

42
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.250
That's phenomenal.

43
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.690
It doesn't do the thing.

44
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.370
If you hit any of the buttons they
are just functions that don't do anything.

45
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.530
Our job is to get this wired up so
that it starts with a count.

46
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.440
Starting with zero perhaps but if you
want to start at five, this is your day,

47
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.930
you do what you want.

48
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.910
And then, when they hit the button,

49
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.650
we'll increment by one, unless you
wanna increment by a different number.

50
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.590
This again,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

51
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.400
I gave you an exercise,
you're allowed to do whatever you want.

52
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.290
We wanna get this thing working cuz what
we're gonna do is we're gonna take this

53
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.320
very kinda simple, isolated example.

54
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.580
And then we're gonna look in, when we
get to part three, a bunch of different

55
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.920
patterns for separating out our view
from the management of the state.

56
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.890
So we'll start out by doing
the simplest encapsulated version,

57
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.660
and we'll get that working.

58
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.080
And then we will begin
to like play with it,

59
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.940
and tease it out a little bit
with another example as well.
