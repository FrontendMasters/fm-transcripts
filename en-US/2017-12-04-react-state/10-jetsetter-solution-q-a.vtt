&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
any large questions?

2
00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:08.369
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

3
00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.409
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,

4
00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:19.970
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we have a few choices.

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.180
We have to persist it somewhere.

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.891
So the first question to ask yourself is,
where do you want to persist it?

7
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.950
Step one would be if we want
to save it in local storage.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.592
What we could do is say, we could pass
a callback to all those set states so

9
00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:35.964
that whenever they're changed we
could save it to local storage.

10
00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:40.276
We could parse that local storage
when the component mounts.

11
00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:42.514
Right, and then set the state from there.

12
00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:45.510
Step two would be if we had
a server somewhere, right?

13
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.920
Things get a little more complicated now
because when you have a server somewhere,

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.270
things can go poorly.

15
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.840
There could be no network, right?

16
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.880
The network could be very angry
at you cuz you sent invalid data.

17
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.064
You could get new data back.

18
00:00:57.064 --> 00:01:01.295
So what we'd have to do likely is,
a really great pattern for this is,

19
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:06.133
we might have a state on the given things
that we're submitting, the new item.

20
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.461
Or changing the item to maybe are you
loading or doing like this is what we're

21
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:11.860
talking about communication
stage in the beginning.

22
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.281
We would need communication
state to know whether or

23
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.381
not we're sending something to the server.

24
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.258
And then we would either,
you have two choices.

25
00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:21.260
You can do stuff optimistically, right?

26
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.915
Which I prefer as a pattern, which is
assume that everything is gonna go well,

27
00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:26.417
right?

28
00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:29.440
They check the thing,
move it in the UI, right?

29
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.220
If things didn't go well,
display an error and

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.190
move it back,
versus the user clicks the thing.

31
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.770
Wait till you hear back from the server,
right?

32
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.990
In different situations it
comes down to UI choice,

33
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.826
if it is likely to succeed, right?

34
00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:49.820
At we have APIs where we actually don't
know whether or not the transaction will

35
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.050
succeed for two or three minutes because
it goes on a worker queue, right.

36
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.044
So we just assume that
everything went well, right.

37
00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:59.280
And then if it doesn't,
we deal with it later.

38
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.280
But we would immediately set the state to
show it as removed or toggled or whatever.

39
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.988
Schedule a worker because they most always
succeed because they're set to keep

40
00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:08.850
retrying.

41
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.040
And then if for
some reason after a lot of amount of time

42
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.880
then we would put it back in the database,
right.

43
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.630
So it all really depends.

44
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.800
For local storage,
you do it every time you set the state.

45
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.480
For a network, you're either gonna have to
send the request and then wait until you

46
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.850
hear back positively and then just
do the same setting of the state.

47
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.876
Or do it and then tell the network and
hope everything is okay, right?

48
00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:32.867
And if that promise rejects, you could
move it back and stuff along those lines.
