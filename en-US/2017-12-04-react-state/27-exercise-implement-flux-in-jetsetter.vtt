00:00:02.388 --> 00:00:07.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
what we're gonna do is we're going to try.

2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.790
We have some slides that
have some hints in them.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.134
We're gonna see how far we can get
implementing this in Jetsetter.

4
00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:16.440
We know that we're gonna
have an item store.

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.020
We know that it's gonna add items,
remove items, update items.

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.660
It's gonna do very similar things
that right now happen to exist

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.520
in the application component.

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.225
And for those, we pass them from
application to items, from items to item.

9
00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:38.532
It would be great if I could just,
from an item,

10
00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:41.690
say like, update with a new value of it.

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.910
From the new items component, if I don't
have to tell the application that I wanna

12
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.600
add a new item, I just want to tell
the store which can exist to the side of

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.824
the application,
that a new item has been added.

14
00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:57.070
We wanna start to pull the state out of
that state tree from before lunch when we

15
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.450
had to do it by hand.

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.914
We wanna now pull that out.

17
00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:02.040
And so this is still a very simple tree.

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.520
It's only got three levels to it, but

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.861
we'll just imagine that
it's a much deeper tree.

20
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.333
And so we can pull this out.

21
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.554
We can have the store tell the items list,
or

22
00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:17.270
we can have the individual item say,
hey, I need to be updated.

23
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.560
And it can tell the store directly
without passing stuff back up.

24
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.320
And we can pass the list back in.

25
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.680
You might still wanna pass the entire item
list into the application component and

26
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.210
let it filter the two of them out.

27
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.960
That makes sense.

28
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.570
But it would be great to not have to
pass those actions down two levels.

29
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.408
It would be great not to have
to start out with an action for

30
00:01:34.408 --> 00:01:37.617
creating a new component and
application to pass it to new item.

31
00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:39.740
Like, we donâ€™t want to have to do that.

32
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.400
So do I expect you to
get all the way there?

33
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.820
No, what I expect you to do is
try to get some muscle memory.

34
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.550
Try this out.

35
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.590
Start to implement it.

36
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.550
See where the gaps start to lie, because
this will be your first time implementing

37
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.559
after listening to someone talk for
30 minutes straight.

38
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.530
Is my plan that you will definitely
remember every single part of that?

39
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.970
No, but
we have some slides with some hints.

40
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.120
We have an example that
I'm about to push up.

41
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.348
I'd like you to like at least try
to get some muscle memory, and

42
00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:14.512
then we'll do it together to
reinforce that in about 25 minutes.

43
00:02:14.512 --> 00:02:15.991
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Let's do 30.

44
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:23.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 30,
let's round up to 30, very cool.

45
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.520
Okay, again, so I warned you,
this time we're gonna do it.

46
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.520
There is a flux-base branch, and
that is kind of like the default setup.

47
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.169
There's some files created for you there.

48
00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.350
So you can start on the flux-base
branch rather than whatever live-coding

49
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.344
falf-following along thing that you
might have, cuz that may be hard.

50
00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.560
There is a nice place for you to start.

51
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.567
Just check out flux-base, and

52
00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:51.591
that should be at least some of
the accoutrements there for you.
