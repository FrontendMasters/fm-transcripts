00:00:03.023 --> 00:00:06.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's take
a look at what your mission is.

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.500
So I have a very similar but
different app, right.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.640
Which is a pizza calculator and the pizza
calculator is gonna take two things,

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.010
which is the number of guests and

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.360
the slices per person and it tells you
how many pizzas that you need to order.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.350
Right.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.550
By rounding up because if you
can't order two and a half pizzas.

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.280
That's not a thing.

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.840
And so we can hit reset and
change it back.

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.524
Let's look at the code for
this real quick.

11
00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:35.482
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
the code as it is right now.

12
00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:42.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We've got the application
which is effectively the entire component.

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.720
Which takes an initial state of
the number of people and slices.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.370
And handles it all in that component.

15
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.740
Our goal, and
frankly to keep things simple,

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.600
you don't even have to break this
out into another file, right?

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.460
Let's, we've effectively have
the container in this case.

18
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820
What we wanna do is break out
the presentational component.

19
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.850
So right now, we have this component here,

20
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.690
which is using all of the state,
we wanna pull this out.

21
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.270
We wanna pull this out into
a presentational component.

22
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.790
You can write it as a stateless
functional component,

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.740
you can write it as just a component
that has a render function.

24
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.010
You can pull it out, and effectively be
able to pass in all of the props to it.

25
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.090
Let's go back to the pizza calculator.

26
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.540
Clearly it's got an update
the number of people.

27
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.430
This is to update slice per person.

28
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.670
These are now gonna be
ones that are passed in.

29
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.270
We're gonna rip out,effectively what's
gonna return out of the render method is

30
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.780
simply our pizza calculator component that
is gonna receive everything that it needs.

31
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.020
So this will simply render pizza
calculator, pass it in, all of this state

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.120
and all these methods for modifying
the state in as prompts, sound good?

33
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.260
All right, let's spend 15 minutes and then
we'll round back and we'll do it together.

34
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we actually do 20 so

35
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.140
we can-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 20.

36
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.258
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Evolve the full technical

37
00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:05.957
issue-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 20 minutes.

38
00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:07.951
