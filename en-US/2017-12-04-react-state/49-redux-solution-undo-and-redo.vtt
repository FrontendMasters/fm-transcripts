WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.615
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we're gonna have to
change the way we think about our state

2
00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:08.790
a little bit, and
this is gonna be a fun little exercise.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730
Let's go into that initial states.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.730
This is the shape of our store by default.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.120
And so we have these items,
which is just a big array of items,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.030
as well as the filter text and
the new item value text.

7
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.660
But we're gonna need to separate this out,

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.990
there is now three states
of the item collection.

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.883
There is the present state, there is a
collection of all the past states that we

10
00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:38.570
can undo too, and there is
a collection of all the future states.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.910
Which only existed with used undo, right?

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.780
So if you do undo,
you wanna implement redo.

13
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.160
So you need to keep track
in some kind of order.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.610
So we're gonna have to move
this around a little bit.

15
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.990
And so
what we'll do is change this to items.

16
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.180
This is gonna have three
kind of sub-components.

17
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.990
Which is gonna mean we're gonna
have to change some reducers and

18
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.009
touch a lot of things.

19
00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.378
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we'll have items and we'll have past,

20
00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:11.811
present,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And future.

21
00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:21.059
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And these will be arrays,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That

22
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:22.570
will hold different states in them.

23
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.700
And then it will be, there's only
one present, that will be the items.

24
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.630
All right, very cool.

25
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.380
Now this is gonna break everything.

26
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.490
Right, I can go back over to the app, but
it is not gonna be happy times, he says.

27
00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:41.034
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: One second.

28
00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:53.071
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It will be happy times
if you have two versions of the project

29
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.150
open and you're editing the wrong one.

30
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.020
It's really great then.

31
00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:02.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's just fix that.

32
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:11.985
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
now things are broken.

33
00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:15.140
[LAUGH] This is the first time in our live
coding when we wanted things to be broken,

34
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.180
and we're shocked when they weren't.

35
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.736
So here we are.

36
00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:20.560
[LAUGH] Things are broken,
everything is good.

37
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.869
We are in the desired broken state,
because if we look at the error message.

38
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.313
It's looking for items.filter but

39
00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:29.860
items is now that object that has past,
present, and future.

40
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.670
And so it's like,
yeah you didn't give me an array.

41
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.800
There's no filter.

42
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.810
Everything is horrible.

43
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.630
I don't know what to do.

44
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.530
So fixing this is pretty easy.

45
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.020
And I hope, you should get a code
smell as I do this, right?

46
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.408
And the fact there is some
lack of dryness to my code.

47
00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:48.793
And that's intentional for
simplicity right now but

48
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.885
we'll talk about how we
can make that better.

49
00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:56.838
So it's on the packed items container,
we wanna say .present.

50
00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:04.329
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: On the unpacked items
container, we also wanna say .present.

51
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.880
So there's definitely a lack of
dryness in this code, right?

52
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.980
What you might wanna do as
kind of an exercise for

53
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.210
the reader later is it would be great to
have a function that then produced this,

54
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.440
with the only difference between
being packed and unpacked.

55
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.680
So you could pass it in what property
you were looking for to filter on.

56
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.000
That's a little too in the weeds for
us all to do together.

57
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.090
But if your Spidey sense,
if your code smell Spidey sense went off,

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.320
that is a very valid Spidey sense,
but we're just not going

59
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.830
to do it right now cuz we've effectively,
we're back in a working state.

60
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.123
And we got code to ship.

61
00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:40.889
So,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We have to also fix it on

62
00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.960
the actions as well.

63
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.520
But we'll get to that in a second
because I have that planned.

64
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.100
Let's add two more actions, right?

65
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.460
So, we can have two more constants that
we add, which is undo item action and

66
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.490
redo item action, right?

67
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.240
Those are the two things that a user can
do when we implement this user interface.

68
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.130
So let's go ahead,
let's find our constants.

69
00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we're just gonna add these in.

70
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.998
So we're gonna export the const

71
00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:21.503
UNDO_ITEM_ACTION,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

72
00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:24.660
we'll have another one,
a little bit of copy paste action here.

73
00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:31.280
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: REDO_ITEM_ACTION.

74
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.100
All right, very cool, and we're probably
gonna need item creators as well.

75
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.510
So we'll go ahead and basically we'll just
have one called like UNDO_ITEM_ACTION

76
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.237
that's going to create this event, and
we'll have one called REDO_ITEM_ACTION.

77
00:04:48.128 --> 00:04:50.869
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'm gonna put these
in the item-actions cuz that seems like

78
00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:51.840
a good place for them.

79
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440
I could be convinced that maybe they
should go on their own file but,

80
00:04:58.317 --> 00:04:59.045
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so

81
00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:00.630
I need to pull those in as well.

82
00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll pull
in UNDO_ITEM_ACTION and REDO.

83
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.349
I'm just gonna format
that a little bit better.

84
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.986
Very cool.

85
00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:16.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
we have the action creators.

86
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.220
We've got the action constants, all right.

87
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.510
Next what we probably wanna do is we've
fixed the map state to props in both.

88
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.160
But we also need to go ahead and
what's this other issue that we have?

89
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.646
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We need to fix, so
this, if you look in the items reducer,

90
00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:39.768
we have this problem that
we're gonna need to deal with,

91
00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:42.260
which is we're trying
to map over the items.

92
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.040
But again,
that's items.present every time.

93
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.190
We're going to do some other things in
the reducer, so I'm gonna punt on that for

94
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.670
a little bit until we get deep
into the reducer to figure out,

95
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.500
we'll change all those
state to state.present.

96
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.620
Cuz effectively, what we need to cuz
we move the array one child down.

97
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.570
So we'll get to all of that in a second.

98
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.876
But let's implement the container for
the undo and the redo buttons.

99
00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:10.241
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
I'm gonna just make a undo redo container.

100
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:13.420
If you don't like that name,
you can name it something else.

101
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.380
And we're gonna need to
do a few things in here.

102
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.706
I'm going to import connect
from react-redux and

103
00:06:24.706 --> 00:06:33.100
again I'm likely to mess it up at
least once I call it redux-react.

104
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.230
So, everyone be on guard for that.

105
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.732
We'll also import our undoItemAction, and

106
00:06:41.732 --> 00:06:46.710
redoItemAction from actions/item-actions.

107
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.592
And now what are the two things
that I know I need to make?

108
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: mapStateToPropr
except I don't really have any state.

109
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.020
It's just gonna be two buttons
now that I think about it.

110
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.700
So I don't need to map any StateToProps
cuz there's no state to map to the props.

111
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.330
So I just need a mapDispatchToProps.

112
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.580
And that's going to take the Dispatch.

113
00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:24.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I am going to
immediately return a bind action creators.

114
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.455
Apparently I have a plug-in that
automatically pulled that in.

115
00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:32.955
That's pretty cool.

116
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.643
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I knew that
I had it on my work laptop,

117
00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:40.784
I actually forgot that
I had it on this one.

118
00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:44.470
undoItemAction, redoItemAction and
we'll bind that to the dispatch.

119
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.180
Just one semi colon is enough.

120
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.000
All right, cool.

121
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.040
And so,
I could make a presentation component, but

122
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.260
I'm gonna be a little lazy here.

123
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.491
Don't tell anyone.

124
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.780
He says,
on a recorded thing being live streamed.

125
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.070
We don't have any state
to map to the props.

126
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.220
We do have this mapDispatchToProps, and

127
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.550
we're gonna just give it
a component right here.

128
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.170
We'll use the stateless functional one,
which is gonna take,

129
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.033
let's call these undo and redo,
just to make things easier.

130
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.192
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
I'm just gonna define the presentational

131
00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:27.984
component on the fly here.

132
00:08:30.897 --> 00:08:33.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I could theoretically
put this on variable as well.

133
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.660
I've started typing.

134
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.430
This is the decision that I've made and
I'm gonna go for it for now.

135
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.410
So we'll have undo and redo.

136
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.383
And all we're really
gonna do is make a div

137
00:08:45.383 --> 00:08:50.317
cuz we need one,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Component to

138
00:08:50.317 --> 00:08:50.990
start out with.

139
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.340
I'm gonna use parentheses so
I can just return it immediately.

140
00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:58.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool.

141
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.550
So we've got this div, and
it's gonna have two buttons in it.

142
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.537
It's gonna have,
let's make the buttons first.

143
00:09:07.248 --> 00:09:09.038
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You're
all gonna be shocked and

144
00:09:09.038 --> 00:09:12.170
surprised to find what these
two buttons' labels are.

145
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.210
One of them is gonna be called undo.

146
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.197
The other one is going to be called redo.

147
00:09:17.197 --> 00:09:22.912
And I'll say onClick,

148
00:09:22.912 --> 00:09:27.198
undo, onClick,

149
00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:30.640
we will redo.

150
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.470
I've got a bunch of squiggly red lines.

151
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.270
I feel like I should listen to it which
is saying hey, you wrote some jsx and

152
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.502
you didn't import React.

153
00:09:37.502 --> 00:09:42.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so we have, this is now,

154
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.576
we've got these action
creators bound in there.

155
00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:51.189
And so we've got this presentation or
component.

156
00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:54.530
I'm gonna go ahead and
just implement it into the application.

157
00:09:57.384 --> 00:10:04.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so what I'll do
is I will import, undo, redo container.

158
00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:12.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Containers
undo redo container.

159
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.680
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll just pop it,
let's put it under the new item container.

160
00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
everything loads, there it is.

161
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.400
All right, you're gonna have
to indulge me for a second.

162
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.900
Sorry.

163
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.240
Which is, that's too close to the input
field, and I'm not changing CSS.

164
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.810
I don't live code CSS as a rule.

165
00:10:50.414 --> 00:10:57.504
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oops
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All

166
00:10:57.504 --> 00:10:58.534
right just a little bit better.

167
00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:01.312
I added some margins, so it is not
jammed up against the input field.
