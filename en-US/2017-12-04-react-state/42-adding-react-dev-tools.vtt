00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.069
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what we're gonna
do is we are gonna do a few things.

2
00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.785
We are going to one, add a little bit
more to our connection to the store.

3
00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:14.929
And then we are going to create these
container components that are gonna take

4
00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.392
the store's state and wrap the stateless
components that receive all the props and

5
00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:22.270
we'll be able to use
those in the application.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.920
And what you'll see is that we just bring
in these components, they're gonna be

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.090
wired up completely, and we don't
have to worry about a lot happening.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.656
All right, so
let's go back to this index.js.

9
00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:37.396
We'll create a store with reducer and
the initial state.

10
00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:42.330
I showed you earlier that you might
want to use Middleware at some point.

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.310
And one of the really great use cases
to see every action going through

12
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.780
is hooking up to the redux DevTools.

13
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.960
All right, that’s a really good, and
logging into the console every time, meh.

14
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.460
But hooking up to the DevTools I think is
a much better use case for middleware.

15
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.400
That way you can actually
see all of these.

16
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.115
So what we’ll do is we’ll just
simply say const middleware,

17
00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:10.761
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

18
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.566
We'll start that out as a empty array.

19
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.030
And we'll say count enhancers.

20
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.537
We are actually not gonna
use middleware just yet,

21
00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:19.770
we are actually just gonna use enhancer.

22
00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:33.842
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then composeEnhancers

23
00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:36.946
is going to be really squarely,
bear with me.

24
00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:39.564
I might just tell you right now,
this is something that I copy and

25
00:01:39.564 --> 00:01:40.550
paste all the time.

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.534
So when you see me type this,

27
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:47.167
it's gonna be okay because you
are just gonna copy and paste it from

28
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.743
the docs of the React Redux library.

29
00:01:55.132 --> 00:02:03.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney:
__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE.

30
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.830
What is this?

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.794
If you have the DevTools installed,
this is something that the DevTools have

32
00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:13.560
installed on the Window object in Chrome.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Otherwise,

33
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.729
we're just gonna bring in compose and

34
00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:20.783
we're gonna use the compose from Redux.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So,

35
00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:24.460
if the DevTools are installed,
this will be a truthy value and

36
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.258
we'll use a special version
that'll wire up to the DevTools.

37
00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:31.877
If the DevTools are not installed, we'll
just use that regular compose function

38
00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:35.614
that we saw earlier, that takes the number
of functions and puts them all together.

39
00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:36.412
All right, cool.

40
00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:41.427
So we've got the reducer, we've got
the initial state, which is also going

41
00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:46.421
to add in,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let

42
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:50.880
me change this a little bit to
three lines because my font is

43
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.240
large.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

44
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.816
we'll use this composeEnhancers,
which is either the DevTools one or

45
00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:06.244
just the regular compose.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Any

46
00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:07.637
middlewares that we have right now.

47
00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:11.897
We don't have any middleware but give me
an hour and we'll have some middleware to

48
00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:18.097
install, as well as,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The enhancers.

49
00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:22.273
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] initial state.

50
00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:24.812
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Thank you.

51
00:03:24.812 --> 00:03:26.820
All right, cool.

52
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.120
And I gotta spell things correctly.

53
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.848
And we should be good to go.

54
00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:36.217
What I'm gonna do real quick is just start
this up, and make sure nothing is broken.

55
00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:47.975
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That is obviously an old

56
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:54.083
one.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

57
00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:55.130
so these are the redux tools.

58
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.880
And you can see that the first action
that's been fired is this init,

59
00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.970
which basically sets it up.

60
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.070
There's nothing on the page here,
because I actually,

61
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.780
if we go into application,
there's literally no components in there.

62
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.479
So everything is working as expected,
there are no console errors,

63
00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.450
we are good to go.
