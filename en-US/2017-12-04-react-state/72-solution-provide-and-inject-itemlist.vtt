1
00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:06.643
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

2
00:00:06.643 --> 00:00:10.171
All right so we have these items.

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.828
We have an item list.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that list call list?

4
00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:14.775
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Should be list,

5
00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:15.454
thank you.

6
00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:17.869
It was this from up a level.

7
00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.231
So we have an item list, we can add items
to it, we can filter it automatically.

8
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:30.547
Next thing we wanna do is we wanna
hook it up to our UI, right?

9
00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:33.066
Anyone remember what the first
thing I wanna do is?

10
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:38.187
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Inject?

11
00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:39.598
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I need to inject,

12
00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:42.030
I need to do something
before I can inject.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.992
But your gut is right.

14
00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:45.617
What's that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Observer?

15
00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:47.127
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Observer, what's that?

16
00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:49.205
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Import MobX into index?

17
00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:50.193
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I need to import MobX,

18
00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:52.212
I need to grab the provider.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

19
00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:53.112
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, the provider is

20
00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:56.044
gonna be the one to allow, I can't inject
the store unless I have a provider.

21
00:00:56.044 --> 00:01:00.351
Your senses were all correct, but
there was one extra nuance there.

22
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:04.047
So we'll pull that open and
I don't really need to create like

23
00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:08.536
a whole store file in this case because
there's not really a lot to do here.

24
00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:13.398
Iâ€™ll just say import Provider

25
00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:17.325
from 'mobx-react'.

26
00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:20.110
And then, I need to wrap it.

27
00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:27.454
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's say provider.

28
00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:34.254
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Application.

29
00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:40.535
Close the provider.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool?

30
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:44.773
Now the Provider should
probably provide something.

31
00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:48.599
So item list is a class we just
need an instance of it, so

32
00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.694
let's bring that in as well.

33
00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:12.248
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Did I call it,

34
00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:13.008
I called it models.

35
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.284
I think the React stores
are still in there, I was like,

36
00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:24.079
why'd I call it a store?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

37
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.959
so we'll grab the itemList and
we'll just make a new

38
00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:36.301
one.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

39
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:42.508
we'll provide it in there as itemList.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You

40
00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:43.392
can call it whatever you want.

41
00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:47.364
That's just gonna be what it's
available when we go to inject it.

42
00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:48.895
All right, neat.

43
00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:53.389
So we're gonna kind of keep things
a little bit deliberately simple here.

44
00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.199
I can start breaking out files,
and all those kind of things.

45
00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:00.518
But what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna
do a lot of this in Application.js.

46
00:03:00.518 --> 00:03:03.849
And at one point I will break out
a branch, and I'll push it up, so

47
00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.069
we can see where we are.

48
00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.573
All right, so
I don't need all this default state

49
00:03:08.573 --> 00:03:13.614
anymore.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

50
00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:19.210
we'll get rid of the idea of state in
this case, in the actual application.

51
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.839
I don't need to do all of this
anymore because the actual models can

52
00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.665
handle that themselves.

53
00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:30.638
So all this code can go away.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This

54
00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:33.595
code can pretty much all go away.

55
00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:37.948
I'm gonna get rid of the countdown for

56
00:03:37.948 --> 00:03:42.499
now and,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll put

57
00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:43.661
a no-op in here.

58
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:45.600
We'll re-implement this momentarily.

59
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.943
And I'm gonna pull these two lists out.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

60
00:03:51.943 --> 00:03:54.005
also take this out for a second.

61
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:06.056
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So cuz we'll be able

62
00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:09.197
to inject all this, we don't need to start
the application and we pass it down.

63
00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:11.716
We can inject it to
components that need it.

64
00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:15.205
So what I wanna do, is I wanna
have a packed items component and

65
00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:19.042
I want to have an unpacked items
component, that I can put in there.

66
00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:22.751
So what we'll do is we'll
pull up this items one and

67
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:26.044
we'll use that as kind
of a base in this case.

68
00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:31.029
Again I would probably want to pull
this into its own file right now.

69
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.750
But just for clarity,
I'm keeping everything in one place and

70
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.350
not jumping around between things.

71
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.810
I'm going to say PackedItems.

72
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.634
I need to pull in,

73
00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:49.036
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: An observer.

74
00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:53.249
These are from MobX React,
these are not MobX specific.

75
00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.315
MobX can be used with anything you want.

76
00:04:55.315 --> 00:05:00.019
It does not have to be used with React,
but there are React bindings for

77
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:02.909
it and that is in the mobx-react library.

78
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.637
So here we'll say inject and
we wanna inject the itemList and

79
00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:12.464
that's going to then take a component.

80
00:05:12.464 --> 00:05:16.283
And we wanna also observe,
because we're going to want to have access

81
00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:20.309
to the store and then we're gonna want
to watch it change and re-render.

82
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:21.935
So I'm gonna just give myself a new line

83
00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:26.930
here.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

84
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:35.398
that will get passed in as a prop.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Inject the itemList and

85
00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:40.292
out will come,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This presentational

86
00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:43.495
component.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's gonna change

87
00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:44.125
a little bit here.

88
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:47.597
One, we'll call it Packed Items,
because I copied the wrong one.

89
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:56.060
And this one will start out with
being itemList.packedItems.

90
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:05.159
And really we don't need any of this,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: At this point,

91
00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.864
we should good in that case.

92
00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:10.993
And this should be enough for
me right now, just looking,

93
00:06:10.993 --> 00:06:17.253
I got some squiggly's here.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Print

94
00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:24.174
the little rainbow parentheses,
best Visual Studio code plugin ever.

95
00:06:24.174 --> 00:06:32.509
Cool, and let's just throw in the,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: PackedItems component,

96
00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.685
which is now totally self contained.

97
00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:39.015
It doesn't need anything that says it's
getting the itemsList injected and

98
00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:40.223
it's ready to rock.

99
00:06:40.223 --> 00:06:43.731
Let's do the same thing with
UnpackedItems real quick.

100
00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:02.845
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and whenever those

101
00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:05.038
lists change,
these will be automatically re-rendered.

102
00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:11.003
So we'll go ahead,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say, UnpackedItems.

103
00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:15.798
What's that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In 24, I don't

104
00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:19.943
think it's uppercase, Unpacked, is it?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Unpacked.

105
00:07:19.943 --> 00:07:20.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 24.

106
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 24, nope, you caught me.

107
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.583
I already had that, so
I think it was autocomplete.

108
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.183
Cool.

109
00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:31.069
So here we'll get rid
of that other one and

110
00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.370
this application component is
definitely getting simpler.

111
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.135
So we use both of these.

112
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:41.921
The only thing that we really
need to see any of this in action

113
00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:46.250
is we're probably going to
want to be able to add one.

114
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.672
So let's go ahead, we'll save this
real quick, it probably doesn't work,

115
00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:53.565
I'm not even gonna look in
the browser real quick.

116
00:07:53.565 --> 00:07:54.839
Let's go ahead and

117
00:07:54.839 --> 00:08:00.128
we'll look at this new item over here.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

118
00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:03.032
NewItem, this is more of a regular class.

119
00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:05.261
Let's play around with that one,
I think it's interesting to see.

120
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:06.665
We'll import

121
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:15.005
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Inject from mobx-react.

122
00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:24.059
And we can actually put it right up here.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Inject the ItemList.

123
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:29.302
This is that ephemeral state that we don't
necessarily need to keep in the store.

124
00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:34.998
So I'm gonna leave that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Handle change though,

125
00:08:34.998 --> 00:08:38.428
we don't want to cross the handle
change with the submit,

126
00:08:38.428 --> 00:08:40.892
we don't want to call set state anymore.

127
00:08:40.892 --> 00:08:47.474
We wanna be able to say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Well I

128
00:08:47.474 --> 00:08:50.366
just add it to the store, and we have
that item method so we can do that.

129
00:08:59.129 --> 00:08:59.862
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hold off the props.

130
00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:05.318
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And what we'll just do is

131
00:09:05.318 --> 00:09:13.968
we'll say that we wanna do itemList,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: itemList.addItem.

132
00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:18.996
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will give it,

133
00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:22.164
the value is,
we have it up here actually so.

134
00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:30.675
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And that's it.

135
00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:35.075
We have the store,
the store will add the item to the array,

136
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.979
that will trigger the re-render, and

137
00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:41.143
sparing a live coding boo-boo.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really quick,

138
00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:43.329
your injection string at the top
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes.

139
00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:44.697
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that case,

140
00:09:44.697 --> 00:09:47.583
the case on that?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Thank you,

141
00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.587
[LAUGH] you saved me.

142
00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:02.682
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
let's start it up

143
00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:17.482
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll switch out

144
00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:26.435
the other app with this one.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It

145
00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:31.107
cannot find module item, so that's fine.

146
00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:32.966
Get rid of that calculate time left.

147
00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:43.372
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We pulled some stuff out,

148
00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:48.129
so.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: ItemList in models,

149
00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:51.573
I think I have a lower case I on there by

150
00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:56.475
accident.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

151
00:11:07.887 --> 00:11:09.563
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I gotta prevent that

152
00:11:09.563 --> 00:11:13.632
default.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now I'm in

153
00:11:13.632 --> 00:11:14.389
charge of that.

154
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:17.123
Since I had the on submit
preventing the default, but

155
00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.510
I ripped that out and
I just do it immediately.

156
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.794
So I am now, that's on my shoulders,
so I'll just quickly say,
