00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.373
&gt;&gt; Steve: I'm gonna head over to this JS
bin, and I'm gonna do some live coding.

2
00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:08.133
And you should be able to open it
yourself and see what's going on or

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:12.732
you can just watch on the screen,
whatever makes you happiest.

4
00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:16.242
&gt;&gt; Steve: I'll flip over.

5
00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:25.733
&gt;&gt; Steve: So this is the five
methods on the Redux library.

6
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.405
If it looks slightly different it's
because I have Redux as a global and

7
00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:30.020
I'm just pulling those five methods off.

8
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.951
If I was using this in a Webpack build,

9
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.202
it would be like import
from the Redux library, but

10
00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:32.999
I'm not in that zone right now.

11
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:41.724
So let's start to pick off these five.

12
00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:45.101
The easiest one to start with is compose,

13
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:49.460
because compose is not
actually Redux specific.

14
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.060
If you've ever used composition
with functional programing or

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.589
the pipe operator, it's just a way to
take a bunch of functions and chain them.

16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.730
Redux uses it, we can use it when putting
together middleware, but we don't

17
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.780
necessarily, it's not for Redux, it's
just a helper method that's available.

18
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.270
And so let's explore that one first.

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.215
So let's say we had a few functions,
we have a function called makeLouder,

20
00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.079
and that'll take a string.

21
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.899
And returns string.toUpperCase.

22
00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:27.429
&gt;&gt; Steve: And we'll make another function.

23
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.107
We'll call it repeatThreeTimes.

24
00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:38.934
&gt;&gt; Steve: No, I didn't pull up
the MDM documentation on string and

25
00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:40.386
pick three random methods.

26
00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:41.473
That's definitely not what happened.

27
00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.851
&gt;&gt; Steve: So we'll repeat that 3 times.

28
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:49.612
And let's have one more,
this one's gonna be called embolden.

29
00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:56.034
&gt;&gt; Steve: This is gonna be
a fun string prototype fact.

30
00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:57.529
We can also call string.bold.

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.180
So these are all things that
I can do with a string.

32
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.410
And, ideally, what I would like to do is
have a function called makeLouder and

33
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.440
bold and repeat three times.

34
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.400
Now I could write that function.

35
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.127
I could have a function that takes
a string and does something like,

36
00:02:18.853 --> 00:02:21.663
&gt;&gt; Steve: makeLouder(string) and then I

37
00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:27.089
can pass that into repeatThreeTimes,
and then I can pass that.

38
00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:35.740
&gt;&gt; Steve: I copy that line.

39
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.360
This is the important part of live coding,
right?

40
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.262
embolden, that will, theoretically,
if I had a function that took a string and

41
00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:43.099
did that, but
it's kinda hard to read that backwards.

42
00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.714
We don't really want to do that.

43
00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:49.548
All compose does is it takes a bunch of
functions and returns a new function that,

44
00:02:49.548 --> 00:02:54.114
it waits for a value and passes it through
all the functions that you gave it.

45
00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:56.720
Let's use actual code cuz words are hard.

46
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.171
So we'll bring back that, say,

47
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:10.551
const
makeLouderAndBoldAndRepeatThreeTimes.

48
00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:15.671
And all we're gonna do is use compose and
we're gonna pass it makeLouder and

49
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.917
we'll pass in embolden and
we'll pass it RepeatThreeTimes.

50
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:31.370
&gt;&gt; Steve: And so I grab that,
I'll see that I have a function and

51
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.986
if I pass it a string,
&gt;&gt; Steve: You

52
00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:43.190
can see that inside of a bold B tag I get
HELLO three times, all capital, right?

53
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.370
That's it, that's all compose does,
we're done.

54
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.900
So now we're down to four methods,
so that's going pretty well.
