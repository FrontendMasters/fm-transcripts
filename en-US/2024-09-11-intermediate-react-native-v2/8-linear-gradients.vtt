00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.259
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's make our own voting
screen a little bit more interesting.

2
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.988
I want to show you another
library that you can use,

3
00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:09.694
which is a linear gradient library.

4
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:13.767
So a linear gradient
is an image consisting

5
00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.959
a transition of between two or
more colors.

6
00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.256
It's pretty popular in your eyes and
looks quite pretty.

7
00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.086
So, we're going to add it
to our onboarding screen.

8
00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:28.388
So, let's install Expo linear gradient.

9
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.096
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And I've added a couple
more greens, so let's copy these.

10
00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:54.179
We've got an apple green and
a lime green, so

11
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.114
let's fit these in our theme file as well.

12
00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:07.576
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
let's open our onboarding screen.

13
00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:14.194
And instead of this view, we can
actually pass in the linear gradient.

14
00:01:14.194 --> 00:01:20.331
So this is the import or
export from exporting your gradient.

15
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.205
Give the styles as they are, but

16
00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:29.175
we do need to define what colors
we're going to gradient between.

17
00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:31.795
So let's add the colors.

18
00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:36.312
So this will be an array,
and we can do color green.

19
00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.479
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
let's do the apple green.

20
00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:50.787
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And the lime green.

21
00:01:55.156 --> 00:02:00.344
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay and
we have a beautiful gradient.

22
00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:06.543
Actually, so you can change the start and
end values of the linear gradient.

23
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:11.079
So we do start, so
start with x0 and y0 and

24
00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:17.253
end with x1 and y1 and there you go so
we go from up to down so

25
00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:23.814
you could play around with these so
if we do let's say 0.5.

26
00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:30.041
So you could play around with these and

27
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:34.905
then do them diagonally etc so

28
00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:40.751
this is just a nice little default.

29
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:44.813
And one thing that I was spotted here is
that our status spa, I don't think it

30
00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.835
really goes with our app anymore
because we're gonna have dark contents.

31
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.174
I think a light status spa
would look nicer here and

32
00:02:52.174 --> 00:02:54.727
we can use the status bar components.

33
00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:58.769
So there's actually installed by
default in the types template so

34
00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.159
you should have it already installed.

35
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.665
If you don't you can mpx expo
install the expo status bar but

36
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:11.087
basically in the screen
we'll do a status bar.

37
00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:17.143
So this doesn't render anything but
you can define a status bar for

38
00:03:17.143 --> 00:03:22.026
any screen that you want and
we'll do style, light.

39
00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:26.687
So this will be the content,
so light content.

40
00:03:26.687 --> 00:03:29.847
So if I do this,
the status bar goes to light and

41
00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:33.343
you can actually define
many of these status bars.

42
00:03:33.343 --> 00:03:39.224
They kind of collate between each other,
but you can have a status bar per screen.

43
00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:41.713
So you can have a different color,
you can go from dark to light.

44
00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:46.158
So now if I go to, let me in
the status bar actually goes to dark.
