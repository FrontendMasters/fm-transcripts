00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.464
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Now we want to
create a form to add our new plant.

2
00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:08.442
And if you fancy a challenge,
look at the screenshots below, and

3
00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:11.780
you can try to create this UI for
yourself.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.376
I'm not going to live code it because
it's quite a lot of code, and

5
00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:17.636
we have lots of exciting things to get to.

6
00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:21.923
So, try to build it for
yourself and check Your work or

7
00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:26.511
do as I do, and you can copy
this new color from our theme.

8
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:29.957
So in a theme,
we're going to add a light gray color.

9
00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:36.057
So you know how there's colors that
you like just tend to use as default,

10
00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:42.367
so I find this e light gray, it's quite
pleasant, so I tend to use it a lot.

11
00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:46.800
So I tend to use pink for debugging,
but this is a nice one, and

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.974
we're going to use it for
the input border.

13
00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:53.779
And then for this new,
you can copy this entire file and

14
00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:57.607
then replace the contents of
our new screen with this.

15
00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:06.821
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So now if we open, we
have our new plot modal with two inputs.

16
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.553
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And just walking through
the code because I did copy it, so

17
00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:15.816
what do we have?

18
00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:20.737
We have two useState Hooks,
these are from react.

19
00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:27.751
And they are going to store the name and
how often you need to water the plant.

20
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:31.970
So in react native,

21
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.761
you don't have a form element
the same way you would do on the web.

22
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.623
So each of the inputs
are handled independently.

23
00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:47.697
So you can use a form management library
like Redux form or React hook form, etc.

24
00:01:47.697 --> 00:01:52.578
But here, because it's just two inputs,
I've used state values both.

25
00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:55.563
Then I rendered this into a scroll view.

26
00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:59.817
So probably there will going to be enough
space to render it at all screens, but

27
00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:02.988
let's not take any Chances to
run this in this worldview.

28
00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:06.404
And if you recall from before,
we had scroll views and that list.

29
00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:10.074
So this is actually a great example
of whence the scroll view is

30
00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:11.345
appropriate to use so

31
00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:16.388
there's no items here that we want to
map over to make an arbitrary long list.

32
00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:19.976
So in this case scroll view
is the perfect, [INAUDIBLE].

33
00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:26.244
And we have our plant image and
we have our two text inputs.

34
00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:30.548
And notice that this text input is a text,
and

35
00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:35.543
here we're actually expecting
this to be a number.

36
00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:42.754
And let me open the keyboard
in my Simulator, there you go.

37
00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:47.416
So if I now focus on this text input,
it will open a text keyboard.

38
00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:51.564
You'll focus on the other text
input will open on the keyboard.

39
00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:54.794
And that's because of this
keyboard type property here.

40
00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:59.017
I've also added some simple validation,
so I didn't do a validation UI.

41
00:02:59.017 --> 00:03:01.545
So it's just If you leave these empty,

42
00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:06.802
it's going to give you just an alert
saying, no, that's a validation.

43
00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:11.682
So in a real-world app, you would probably
do a validation UI where it has an error,

44
00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:13.837
and you displayed an error on the UI.

45
00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:18.782
But for our purposes, this is enough to
make sure that we don't get garbage data.

46
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.827
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone's asking
if touchableopacity, and

47
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.706
button also have a hit prop.

48
00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:29.420
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I think they do,
so we can try it.

49
00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:40.249
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Yes, so touchableopacity,
what was the other one?

50
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.374
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just the button.

51
00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:42.027
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Button?

52
00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:48.088
Ooh, button actually might not, It's very
bare buttons, yeah, no hit prop on button.

53
00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:49.922
But the touchable elements do have it.

54
00:03:56.748 --> 00:04:00.073
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, and
let me just open this on my phone.

55
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.518
Phone so i use an iPhone for
my daily use and

56
00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:09.354
like one of the most
useful things in my team.

57
00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:14.092
When we're building apps is to have
team members who use an android

58
00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:16.049
phone as their main phone.

59
00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.039
They are worth their weight in gold really
because it was really great to have To

60
00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.219
have a native Android developer,
like actually like look at the UX.

61
00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.107
And then the other thing
that was really useful for

62
00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:29.868
me is actually getting
a proper Android phone.

63
00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:34.629
So this is a Pixel six or seven,
but it's a good Android phone.

64
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.737
And I always develop because
I'm an iOS user, iPhone user.

65
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:42.684
Tend to develop an ios simulator
because it's easier to use and

66
00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:44.336
then I have an iphone.

67
00:04:44.336 --> 00:04:48.516
And you end up thinking that
Android phones aren't very good.

68
00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:49.159
Or testing for

69
00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.758
Android is this afterthought because a lot
of the time we have a testing device.

70
00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:57.692
That's really old because you just
buy a cheap Android phone for

71
00:04:57.692 --> 00:05:00.683
testing to make sure that It works.

72
00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:05.083
And actually having a good Android phone
and then using it for web creative apps.

73
00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:09.573
Android is pretty damn amazing,
I am very impressed.

74
00:05:10.573 --> 00:05:13.488
So getting a proper, if it's possible,

75
00:05:13.488 --> 00:05:17.668
get your work to get you a proper
Android phone for testing.

76
00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:19.543
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I agree with you.

77
00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:22.574
I've got teams that where they all say,
my stuff's working.

78
00:05:22.574 --> 00:05:23.803
Okay, did you test Android?

79
00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:25.538
No, because they're on an iPhone.

80
00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:28.341
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: [LAUGH]
Why would we do that?

81
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:30.227
And I've actually spotted a bug.

82
00:05:30.227 --> 00:05:34.023
I think I missed this because,
again, I didn't test on Android.

83
00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:40.516
And this screen, this text is like right
to the edges of my screen on onboarding.

84
00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:47.172
So we can actually fix that real quick,
if we go to onboarding and

85
00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:52.488
just add some,
add some padding to the container.

86
00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:57.099
Let's do maybe a padding horizontal,
I don't know,

87
00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.914
I guess we don't need that much.

88
00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:00.842
Maybe eight.

89
00:06:00.842 --> 00:06:04.444
Yeah, I think that's better, so
it's not stuck to the screen.

90
00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:10.541
See, this is already showing me, I should
have looked this up on my Android phone.

91
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:13.983
All right, so let me in, beautiful.

92
00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:18.306
Again, so
this opens the normal keyboard and

93
00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:22.874
this opens The text keyboard,
which is great.

94
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:29.202
And something I wanted to show
you about the submit button.

95
00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:39.070
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: If we open the screen,
so something that I added here

96
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.675
in the scroll view,
is this keyboard should persist taps.

97
00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:46.971
So let me show you what
happens if I don't add it.

98
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:51.739
So now I'm focusing on the name input, and

99
00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:57.710
then if I now press on add plant,
the keyboard hides.

100
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.462
And then I have to actually press it again
for this form to actually submit, right?

101
00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:05.038
So what this keyboard strategy,

102
00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:10.654
persist steps does that if we focus on
here and then we tap on Add, plant.

103
00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:13.892
Notice that it didn't hide the keyboard,
I don't need to press it twice.

104
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:18.975
It automatically supports [INAUDIBLE].

105
00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:23.752
And the other thing I've noticed is that
That my button doesn't have text center

106
00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:25.073
aligned.

107
00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:29.194
So [INAUDIBLE] our button and
for the text,

108
00:07:29.194 --> 00:07:32.741
let's just do a text align center.

109
00:07:39.198 --> 00:07:47.371
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right,

110
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:50.014
and then this is kind of an FYI,

111
00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:55.010
so in our form, I think the inputs
are going to be visible.

112
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.576
Let me just look at my iPhone,

113
00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:02.865
because I feel like it was
slightly overshadowed there.

114
00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:08.961
So on iOS, I do have some,
I'd like to be able to do this,

115
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:13.044
gets rendered underneath the input.

116
00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:16.923
And to make sure that your input is
always visible, you can use a keyboard,

117
00:08:16.923 --> 00:08:18.175
avoiding view.

118
00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:20.457
So there's a couple of
different ways that you can.

119
00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:23.478
Do keyboard avoiding view, so
a couple different libraries,

120
00:08:23.478 --> 00:08:26.691
there is a built in keyboard
avoiding view as well.

121
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.959
Just in the projects that I've built,

122
00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:35.222
I've usually ended up using this
keyboard aware scroll view.

123
00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:37.696
I'm not saying it is
the best thing to use, but

124
00:08:37.696 --> 00:08:39.731
it is what I've usually end up using.

125
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:42.026
So let's install it here,

126
00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:53.886
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So, I started with Bundler

127
00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:55.638
in a different tab.

128
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:04.909
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay,
so let's do here we go.

129
00:09:04.909 --> 00:09:08.874
EMP Expo install our
keyboard avoiding view.

130
00:09:08.874 --> 00:09:14.109
And then we start expose
start the bundler again.

131
00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:18.194
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And reload the app.

132
00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:25.185
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So, now in our new screen,

133
00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:30.194
instead of a scroll view, we could

134
00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:36.264
render a keyboard avoiding scroll view.

135
00:09:36.264 --> 00:09:42.270
Keyboard avoiding scroll view.

136
00:09:48.448 --> 00:09:55.258
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Should

137
00:09:55.258 --> 00:09:56.640
install the package.

138
00:09:57.872 --> 00:09:59.532
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Where it is here.

139
00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.737
Okay, so it's keyboard or waistcoat view.

140
00:10:03.344 --> 00:10:08.293
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay,
keyboard aware scroll view, there we go.

141
00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:11.814
So this hopefully automatically
enforce it, lovely.

142
00:10:12.944 --> 00:10:15.118
And click change the closing tag as well.

143
00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:22.375
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so
now when I go to watching your frequency,

144
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:25.894
you can see that it slides
this input slightly up.

145
00:10:25.894 --> 00:10:28.306
So we'll have the same
effect on a real device.
