00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.171
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So, now that we're using
a development build and not Expo Go,

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:08.791
it is definitely time to customize
the splash screen and your app icon.

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:12.701
So previously, if anyone's ever done
this manually, it is a long and

4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:17.036
cumbersome process of generating the right
size images for iOS and Android.

5
00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.291
And then copying them into the right
folders, and then kind of hoping for

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:21.932
the best.

7
00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:23.083
But luckily for us,

8
00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:28.178
our native projects are ephemeral because
we're using prebuilt, they are throwaway.

9
00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:34.513
There's no need to configure the updated
assets in Xcode or Android Studio,

10
00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:40.465
we just configure them in our app JSON,
and we regenerate our projects.

11
00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:44.388
So, the easiest way to generate
your own app icon as fresh screen,

12
00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:46.710
I usually use a design tool like Figma.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.984
And we actually have this Figma
template as well that we can use that

14
00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:58.406
has the correct sizes that you need to
generate, so it's a nice starting point.

15
00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:02.092
And you can also, what you can do
is if you go the Assets folder and

16
00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:05.036
look at these default
assets that are configured.

17
00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:07.076
And you can look at the sizes here and

18
00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:11.240
that's basically the size of assets
that you need to ideally generate.

19
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.563
So, let's start with the splash screen,
so a splash screen is a PNG and

20
00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:21.711
it is the full screen page that will
be displayed when you upload first

21
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:26.456
launches and while the app content
is still natively loading.

22
00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:29.615
So, I've created one for

23
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:34.645
us which is here, so let's download it.

24
00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:45.644
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And in our assets,
we'll delete the existing one and

25
00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:50.144
paste this in and in our app JSON, so

26
00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:55.103
this is where the splash image is used.

27
00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:59.645
So, we can pass in any file here,
we're gonna reuse the file name, but

28
00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:02.006
this is where the Image is passed in.

29
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:06.129
You can also set the resize mode, and
you can also if you use transparency,

30
00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:08.174
you can use a background color here.

31
00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:12.799
Next up we want the iOS app icon,
so this is a 2024,

32
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.332
this is a square 1024 PNG, and
no transparency is allowed and

33
00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:21.969
definitely don't have squared corners.

34
00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.415
I've had that from designers before,

35
00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.686
because all the IOS app
icons have squared corners.

36
00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:31.706
So previously, I've had a couple
of times where I get designs

37
00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:36.512
of app icons with squared corners,
so no squared corners are necessary.

38
00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:40.204
And here's one I made earlier,
so let's download this.

39
00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.146
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And here's our icon and
we can replace this icon.

40
00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.155
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: With the new one.

41
00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:03.034
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And in our app.json,
this is where the icon is used.

42
00:03:03.034 --> 00:03:08.788
And finally for Android,
we also need a 1024 by 1024 PNG,

43
00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:14.976
but it is expected to have either
a transparency or a solid background.

44
00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:20.938
So, just so it would look good on
the various Android launcher home screens.

45
00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:25.178
So, for this one you actually,
if I copy this,

46
00:03:25.178 --> 00:03:31.008
you will notice that it's got a lot
more padding than the iOS one,

47
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:33.979
so let's delete the adapt icon.

48
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.182
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I guess, so this is
the Android one, this is the iOS one.

49
00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:47.415
And I'm giving it the transparent
background and I've also made it much

50
00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:52.389
smaller because on a lot of the Android
devices this ends up being like

51
00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.395
a circle or a square, so you need
a little bit more space on the sides.

52
00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:02.368
And also if you go to the Appj.son,
where it's passed in,

53
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:06.546
so we're passing it in as
the foreground image and

54
00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:09.743
we're giving it a background color.

55
00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:12.383
So, by default this is white, so
I'm pretty happy with that, so

56
00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:13.545
I'll just keep it as white.

57
00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:20.462
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And finally,

58
00:04:20.462 --> 00:04:25.377
because we have been supporting web we
can also add our little web favicon.

59
00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:30.160
And I've forgotten to add a link to it,
but I'm pretty sure we can figure it out

60
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.526
so it's in assets, favicon,
teeny tiny plant, let's download it.

61
00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:44.560
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So, get our favicon,
delete this file and

62
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.414
place the new one, lovely.

63
00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:01.105
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And finally, while we're
at it, let's also update the app name.

64
00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:06.448
So, by default, the app name is the same
as our folder name, which is in lowercase,

65
00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:10.690
but I think app names look better
with a capitalized first letter.

66
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.928
So, in our app.json, on the app name,

67
00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:19.427
let's call this Plantly with a capital P.

68
00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:25.794
So, this is another thing that needs a
NativeAppRefresh in order to take effect.

69
00:05:25.794 --> 00:05:31.027
So, now that we've done all our changes,
we need to regenerate our native projects.

70
00:05:31.027 --> 00:05:34.316
And I wanted to show you,
just to demonstrate,

71
00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:37.862
all the things that we
don't need to add manually.

72
00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:44.580
So, let's,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So,

73
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.037
just before I do prebuild, so
this id what I'm a purpose is, so

74
00:05:48.037 --> 00:05:50.408
you don't need to follow along with a bit.

75
00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:56.062
So, I'm going to remove these from
git ignore, so you keep yours.

76
00:05:56.062 --> 00:06:00.912
And I'm gonna stage, all these changes, so

77
00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:07.560
then can see all the files that
change when we do a pre-build.

78
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.430
So, NPX Expo pre-built platform Android,

79
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.053
oops actually, there's another thing.

80
00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:21.133
So, because we already have
an Android directory, we want to

81
00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:26.084
do a pre-build with dash, dash clean,
so it is better to do this than RMF.

82
00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:29.539
The Android directory because it doesn't
generate things that don't need to be

83
00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:30.112
generated.

84
00:06:30.112 --> 00:06:34.974
So, if you need to change something,
you need to do prebuild and

85
00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:39.037
you already had an Android
folder do dash dash clean.

86
00:06:39.037 --> 00:06:43.808
So, it will tell me working,
yes, I want to continue.

87
00:06:48.113 --> 00:06:51.025
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so
let's look at SourceTree, so

88
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:54.462
these are all the changes
to my native project.

89
00:06:54.462 --> 00:06:57.879
How happy are you that we
didn't do these manually?

90
00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.407
So, we've changed the app name, and

91
00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:06.478
then these are all the different
sizes if you see it, so

92
00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:11.451
we've got hdpi, mdpi,
xhdpi of the splash screen.

93
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:16.118
Different size of the foreground
image the lawn chair etc.

94
00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:19.717
So, all of these there are tools to
generate these for you, but it is so

95
00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:21.793
nice to just do it with a single command.

96
00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:27.198
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
let's do the same for iOS.

97
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.125
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So, every time you do a
pre-build with iOS, it installs CocoaPods,

98
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.652
so that's why the iOS
pre-build always takes longer.

99
00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:45.779
Actually, so
because we changed the app name,

100
00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:49.152
it actually changes this
target here to a capital.

101
00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:54.006
And the app name is changed here, and

102
00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:58.861
these are all these like dynamically

103
00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:03.411
generated files and we have here.

104
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:06.793
So okay, so this is where I pycon was
actually added, so I've bike on and

105
00:08:06.793 --> 00:08:09.967
splash screen and they're actually
configured into the project.

106
00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:12.911
So, all the files need to
be linked natively for

107
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.273
them to be available later projects.

108
00:08:15.273 --> 00:08:17.971
So, these are all the things
that we do need to

109
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:21.817
worry about it because we generated
this which is pretty handy.

110
00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:25.900
Now that I'm done with it,
I will add these back into gitignore.

111
00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:30.710
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
these are all the changes we had.

112
00:08:40.268 --> 00:08:47.133
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So, now let's actually
rebuild, so npx expo run android.

113
00:08:51.642 --> 00:08:54.458
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
I'm gonna do npx expo run iOS as well.

114
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:02.405
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, I think
the Android build already finished, so

115
00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:05.786
now, if I go to my Android Simulator,

116
00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:10.668
there we go, we have a little app icon,
it's so cute.

117
00:09:10.668 --> 00:09:17.331
There you go, and then if I open this,
we should get our splash screen,

118
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:22.342
which is lovely, and
also the app name is now Planky.

119
00:09:22.342 --> 00:09:26.670
And notice that I made the app icon for
Android much smaller.

120
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.543
And even so, like, it just about
fits in this little circle, so

121
00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:30.995
it was definitely worth doing.

122
00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:34.547
It's kind of a trial and
error when you're building these,

123
00:09:34.547 --> 00:09:38.530
the first iteration of it was quite
hilarious, the plant was like.

124
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.492
[LAUGH] Straight in there.

125
00:09:41.492 --> 00:09:46.539
All right, so it's finished on our
iOS build as well, so you can notice

126
00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:52.285
that our app name has changed, our app
icon has changed, and the splash screen.

127
00:09:52.285 --> 00:09:56.595
If the splash screen doesn't update
straight away, then it's a caching issue,

128
00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:59.668
so if you close your simulator,
reopen it, it will work.

129
00:09:59.668 --> 00:10:03.740
But we can see it, so
do you have a question?

130
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.835
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm getting late to my
brain might be tired, but I'm trying to

131
00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:10.515
distinguish between the difference between
prebuild and just the regular build.

132
00:10:10.515 --> 00:10:12.854
The prebuild is so
you can run it locally, so

133
00:10:12.854 --> 00:10:15.013
you can test the build before it goes or?

134
00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:19.052
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: The Prebuild generates
the iOS and Android directories,

135
00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:21.943
it is a prerequisite of the native build.

136
00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:27.143
Because you can't do a native build
if you don't have your native code.

137
00:10:27.143 --> 00:10:28.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thank you.

138
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.106
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: No worries, yeah, we left
the hardest thing to the end of the day.

139
00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:38.585
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, another thing
that I wanted to just quickly show you,

140
00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:41.395
now that we have our
beautiful splash screen.

141
00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:45.131
The trick to doing things like
getting auth from storage or

142
00:10:45.131 --> 00:10:49.949
doing things before you let user in
the app is actually this splash screen.

143
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:53.971
So, in our layout file,
and I can even do this,

144
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:58.311
I think I can do this in
a nested layout file as well.

145
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:03.055
We can, let's do it in root one,
we can do SplashScreen, so

146
00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:08.264
this is part of 'expo-routers',
so it's exported from here,

147
00:11:08.264 --> 00:11:12.092
and we can do
SplashScreen.preventAutoHide.

148
00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:17.819
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I think I've just gone for
an Estonian keyboard.

149
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:26.447
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: preventAutoHide, so now
if I open this so the app is ready to go,

150
00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:30.371
but our splash screen isn't disappearing.

151
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:35.135
And that's because we are manually
preventing this from auto hiding.

152
00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:40.510
And then what you can do is remember
we have this onboarding state here,

153
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.438
so I mentioned before that you could
use the same kind of mechanism

154
00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.155
to do auth in your app.

155
00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:54.241
So, what you would actually do is you
could have an async operation here.

156
00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:59.011
So, you could asynchronously
get something from storage and

157
00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:02.874
check the validity of token or
whatever you want.

158
00:12:02.874 --> 00:12:08.007
And then when you're ready,
redirect the user

159
00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:12.497
to wherever you decided
they need to go and

160
00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:16.601
only then hide your splash screen, so

161
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:22.140
it will be SplashScreen.hideAsync(), okay?

162
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.880
So, only when you're ready you hide it,
so that way you can do some navigation or

163
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.484
whatever you want, before actually
showing the users you don't get this like

164
00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:35.485
loading state or navigating state
that you don't wanna show them.
