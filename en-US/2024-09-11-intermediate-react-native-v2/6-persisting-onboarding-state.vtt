00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.316
I said that we're using a state management
library because we want to persist our

2
00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:04.118
onboarding state.

3
00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:09.140
So right now, we are not persisting our
onboarding state, it is still in memory.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.821
So, if we refresh or reload the app,

5
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.500
it's going to reset back to
the default value in our userStore.

6
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.638
We want to use AsyncStorage to
persist this across app launches.

7
00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:27.978
And most state management libraries,
I would dare say all state management

8
00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:33.070
libraries, that work with React Native
have some kind of an adapter that

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.838
allows you to use AsyncStorage,
to persist the state across app launches.

10
00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:43.142
And this is the case with Redux,
with the stand with your tie, so

11
00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:45.311
let's install AsyncStorage.

12
00:00:59.178 --> 00:01:03.766
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I will just start
my bundle again, npx expo start.

13
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.856
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so in our userStore,

14
00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:13.790
we need to update this
to add the persister.

15
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.033
And one thing that I'll say about Zustand,

16
00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.810
I find this API very
difficult to add dynamically.

17
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.057
But basically we need
to import AsyncStorage,

18
00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:29.844
I will copy this import cuz
I`m not gonna type it out.

19
00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:37.154
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so
import AsyncStorage, and

20
00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:44.750
then we need to import persist and
createJSONStorage.

21
00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:56.720
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: From,
this is ``zustand/middleware``, okay?

22
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.416
So the way this is added here
is a little bit confusing, but,

23
00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:06.035
basically, I'm gonna remove
this type from here for now.

24
00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:14.999
So, the persist will be a function around
this function that we passed into create.

25
00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:19.627
So, let's do persist instead, and

26
00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:25.912
we'll need a brace, and
we'll close the brace.

27
00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:34.407
And the type of UserStore now goes into
brackets next to persist, there we go.

28
00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:42.670
And now, this persist actually takes two
arguments, one is the store, and then

29
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.353
the second is a config object describing
how to persist it across launches.

30
00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:55.172
So here, we've got the right bracket,
I think it's here,

31
00:02:55.172 --> 00:03:00.132
we'll do an object, so
we'll give it a name.

32
00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:02.785
So this is the same as if
you did the inter-course,

33
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.332
we use the key to persist in AsyncStorage.

34
00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:10.543
This is exactly the same, so this is
the key that's going to be passed into

35
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:15.855
the AsyncStorage, so,
let's call it ``plantly-user-store``.

36
00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:20.614
And then storage,
this is where we're going to use our

37
00:03:20.614 --> 00:03:24.453
AsyncStorage, so we createJSONStorage.

38
00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:29.517
So this was the import from
the Zustand/middleware,

39
00:03:29.517 --> 00:03:35.582
and this will be a function and
we just call AsyncStorage, okay?

40
00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:41.105
Hopefully I got this right, I will say
this against Zustand, I find making

41
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:47.804
this into a persister quite tedious,
there's a lot of prepping and brackets.

42
00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:53.081
Anyway, now it is done, so
our default value is false, so

43
00:03:53.081 --> 00:04:00.514
let's finish onboarding, and
now if I reload, I'm still in the app.

44
00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:04.615
So, now if I go back to onboarding and
then reload, you can see that it's

45
00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:08.732
persisted this bullion for whether or
not we've finished onboarding.

46
00:04:08.732 --> 00:04:10.507
So it's saved on your device storage.
