1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.460
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Next up, we're going
to install a navigation library.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.430
So React Native doesn't come
with navigation by default, so

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.550
we need to choose one, and we're going
to use Expo Router for navigation.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.828
Expo Router is a file system-based
navigation library, and

5
00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:17.530
it's built on top of React navigation.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.574
So if you're familiar with Next.js then,
or libraries like that.

7
00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.374
And you probably already understand
what file system based routing is.

8
00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:28.787
But basically it means that
your file system defines

9
00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:31.974
the screens that exist in your app.

10
00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:35.076
Is that the industry standard
as Expo Router or are there

11
00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:39.384
other routers that have generally
been used in production applications?

12
00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:44.966
So there's three navigation libraries for
React Native.

13
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.926
This React navigation.

14
00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:52.446
There's React Native navigation,
which I think is less popular these days.

15
00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:56.176
And then there's Expo Router,
which is built on top of React navigation.

16
00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:59.707
So the main two ones
that are used right now,

17
00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:04.888
as far as I'm aware are Expo Router and
then React navigation.

18
00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:10.131
React navigation, if you don't
want file system based routing,

19
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.825
but Expo Router is the future,
in my biased opinion [LAUGH].

20
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:19.165
So I've linked to the getting
started docs here, and

21
00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:22.932
I've also copied the steps
that we need to do.

22
00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:27.332
So first we install a bunch of libraries.

23
00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:29.322
So let's install these.

24
00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:35.902
So we'll need Expo Router,
this React Native safe area context.

25
00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:38.872
So this is to have the safe
area on your screen.

26
00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:41.401
So this is handled automatically
by the navigation library.

27
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:46.029
So on iOS when you have the bottom and top
of your screen where you can't actually

28
00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:50.105
put content because you have your
status bar and your little notch, so

29
00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:54.828
this protects against that so you're only
putting content in the visible area.

30
00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:57.938
And distracting the screens,
there's Expo linking, so

31
00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:01.746
this is because one of the good things,
like amazing things actually,

32
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.635
about React Navigation is that you
get deep linking basically for free.

33
00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:09.495
It's a side effect, it's a benefit
of doing file system based routing.

34
00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:14.464
You don't need to configure the routes
because they are implicit from the file

35
00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:18.828
system, so deep linking for
the first time in React Native becomes,

36
00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:22.384
I don't wanna say easy, but
I'm kinda wanna say easy.

37
00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:25.515
And we also have expo constants and
an expo status bar.

38
00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:29.205
Now we need to set up
the entry point of our app.

39
00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:31.535
So if you go to the package, JSON.

40
00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:37.212
So, if you have any JavaScript
project that has a package JSON,

41
00:02:37.212 --> 00:02:39.054
it has this main field here.

42
00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:43.929
And the main is the main entry point for
this application, for this library,

43
00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.058
for this whatever.

44
00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:51.258
And by default, this is actually
a link to a file in your node modules.

45
00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:57.622
So if you go to Expo and
then app entry cde Expo and

46
00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:03.643
then app entry,
just to see what this does.

47
00:03:03.643 --> 00:03:08.137
And basically all it does is
it requires your main file, so

48
00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:13.913
your app.tsx, and then it calls
register root component with it.

49
00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:16.134
So if you used React Native CLI,

50
00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:20.801
if you use React Native to commute
to cli to create a project.

51
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.546
You've probably seen this, and
it was in this index.js file, and

52
00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:27.691
then the main would point to index.js.

53
00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:31.678
And it's just a convenience that
is just like abstracted the way so

54
00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.109
you don't have to have your index file.

55
00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.791
It is only to know that this exists
because there are some React Native

56
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:42.376
libraries that require you to do something
before calling register root component.

57
00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:46.488
In which case you could copy this
content into an index file and

58
00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:52.282
then change your main entry point to your
local file and then do additional things.

59
00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:55.728
This is just an FYI of what's
happening behind the scenes, and

60
00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:59.449
we need to change this into,
I didn't actually copy this.

61
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:05.039
We need to change this into expo
router/entry, which is this, and

62
00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:10.745
in this entry point we go to our node
modules and look for expo router,

63
00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:18.148
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Expo router, and entry.

64
00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:21.627
So, you can see that this actually
does some additional things.

65
00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:26.617
So the root of our app will
change to be our app folder.

66
00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:31.957
And this does some additional things
to pass the initial screen for us.

67
00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:35.727
But in the end,
it also calls the render root component.

68
00:04:35.727 --> 00:04:38.299
So again, if for
some reason you needed to change this,

69
00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:41.364
you could move this into an index
file in your application, but for

70
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.460
now it is handy to have
this abstracted away.

71
00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:52.030
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Next, we'll need to update
our project config to provide a scheme.

72
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.220
So if we open our app JSON.

73
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.452
So this is a config file for
your app and we'll add a scheme field,

74
00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:04.876
and a scheme is basically,
the reason this is required is because,

75
00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:10.324
as I mentioned, deep linking is set
up by default with expo router.

76
00:05:10.324 --> 00:05:15.245
And deep linking is basically linking
into your app to a specific screen.

77
00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:21.485
And the way deep linking works on mobile
applications is basically that your mobile

78
00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:25.962
app registers to listen to
let's say a particular keyword.

79
00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:32.030
So when a link comes in, so there will be
like plantly:// then your phone will go,

80
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.382
okay, as anyone want to handle this link.

81
00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:40.159
And if your application has registered to
handle this scheme, then it will say yes,

82
00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.216
can you give it to me, and basically
that's why we need to handle this.

83
00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:48.863
So this can be anything you would want
to make this probably like relevant to

84
00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:49.538
your app.

85
00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:52.001
So you want to make this
as unique as possible but

86
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:56.322
it is not possible like multiple apps can
have can be registered to the same scheme.

87
00:05:56.322 --> 00:06:01.067
So for example if you open,
you see it more on Android actually.

88
00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:04.725
So on Android, if you open something
that should open a web browser and

89
00:06:04.725 --> 00:06:09.437
you have multiple web browsers installed,
you might have seen this pop up that says,

90
00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.987
do you want to open this with this,
this or this?

91
00:06:11.987 --> 00:06:16.829
And then that's because it's
multiple apps are registered to

92
00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:20.738
use the same scheme,
so you need to choose.

93
00:06:20.738 --> 00:06:25.258
And on iOS, this is unfortunately
handled kind of mysteriously in

94
00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:29.848
the background where iOS just
chooses an app for you to open.

95
00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.591
So this step is optional, and

96
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:35.078
we're not going to be focusing
on web in this workshop, but

97
00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:39.427
I wanted to show you that reconning
into web is actually set up by default.

98
00:06:39.427 --> 00:06:43.157
So you can run everything that
we're building on the web.

99
00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:47.557
So you do wanna try this,
let's install these libraries.

100
00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:52.815
So we want React Native to web and
react on, and also in our app JSON,

101
00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:58.509
we want to make sure that the bundler
is set through set to metro.

102
00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:04.026
So if we, open our app JSON,
and then under web,

103
00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:08.071
make sure that we're using metro.

104
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:14.198
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely,
and now we removed, so

105
00:07:14.198 --> 00:07:17.461
we changed our main entry point.

106
00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:22.420
So we now also need to change where
our app components are rendered.

107
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.740
So let's create a new folder called app.

108
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.150
So this is non-negotiable.

109
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.160
If you're using Expo Router,
the root of your app is the app folder.

110
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.746
And in particular, let's move this app.TSX

111
00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:43.340
into our app folder and
rename it index.tsx.

112
00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:49.403
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So
the root, the main screen,

113
00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:54.318
the first screen that your app
opens if you're using Expo Router,

114
00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:58.724
is the route`s label index
file in your app folder.

115
00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:00.900
So if you don't like using index files,

116
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.191
you can actually get around
without using most of them.

117
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:08.401
The only one that you absolutely
need is this root index file.

118
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:11.420
Let's npx expo start again.

119
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:26.530
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely, okay, so
if you've done everything correctly,

120
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.553
everything should look exactly the same.

121
00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:30.183
And this is great.

122
00:08:30.183 --> 00:08:34.653
And the reason it's looking
exactly the same is that

123
00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:37.713
we've not added a layout file.

124
00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:39.750
So if we add a layout file,
we can actually get a little header.

125
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:47.397
So let's do an _layout.tsx.

126
00:08:47.397 --> 00:08:53.607
And let's import stack.

127
00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:56.073
This is from Expo router.

128
00:08:56.073 --> 00:08:57.240
So all the screens, so

129
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.728
there's two kinds of things that
you can have in your app folder.

130
00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:05.178
You can have screen files and
layout files.

131
00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:09.808
And for each of them,
you always have to use default exports.

132
00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:13.818
So I'm going to use
export default function.

133
00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:16.036
This can be a constant
function if you like, and

134
00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:19.926
you can name it whatever you like because
it's the default, I will name it layout.

135
00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:26.610
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
here we're going to return a stack.

136
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.560
And inside the stack we're
gonna define our screen.

137
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.621
So let's do stack.screen.

138
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:41.161
And the name will be the filename,
so the index.

139
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:48.661
So if I save that, you can see that
I get a nice little header here.

140
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:52.731
And by default, the name on
the header will be the filename.

141
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:56.301
But we can customise it
using this options prop.

142
00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:00.552
And with options title,

143
00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:04.574
we can set it to whatever we
want in this case let's do home.

144
00:10:04.574 --> 00:10:09.026
All right, so this is on iOS, and

145
00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:13.800
you just also open this on Android.

146
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:33.598
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: There we go,
we got the same thing on android.

147
00:10:33.598 --> 00:10:38.711
You notice that on android, the header
bar looks slightly different, so

148
00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:44.854
we got a slightly different elevation
here and also the text is floated left.

149
00:10:44.854 --> 00:10:48.574
And that is not a bug or
a mistake, that is on purpose.

150
00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:52.474
So the navigation library uses
platform specific defaults.

151
00:10:52.474 --> 00:10:55.913
So you can change these defaults and
you can make your apps look the same, but

152
00:10:55.913 --> 00:10:59.273
by default it will use things that
are more appropriate for the platform.

153
00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:02.613
And lastly, we set up all our web stuff.

154
00:11:02.613 --> 00:11:07.447
So in your terminal, if you type w,

155
00:11:07.447 --> 00:11:11.482
it should open a web browser.

156
00:11:11.482 --> 00:11:15.257
And this is the app that you are building,
the same thing,

157
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:18.431
using interactive web
running in a web browser.
