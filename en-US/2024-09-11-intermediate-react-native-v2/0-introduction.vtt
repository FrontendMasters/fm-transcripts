00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.346
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Welcome to this
Intermediate React Native course, you've

2
00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:08.180
learned the fundamentals of React Native,
so your views, your text, your components,

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.786
you know the fundamental building blocks,
and you are interested in learning more.

4
00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:17.422
And that's awesome, so welcome back and
in this intermediate course,

5
00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:20.310
we're going to go beyond
the basing building

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.861
block of React Native development and
beyond Expo Go.

7
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:25.359
By the end of this course,

8
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.654
I hope that you're going to feel that
you have all the tools, resources and

9
00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:34.451
knowledge at your disposal for building
production video apps with React Native.

10
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:41.113
So material wise, this course will
follow up from the introduction course,

11
00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:44.666
but we will be building
a brand-new app from scratch.

12
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.390
In this course, we're going to cover some
additional topics that didn't make it into

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.546
the intro course.

14
00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:52.486
And halfway through,
we're actually going to also leave

15
00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.726
behind the Expo Go sandbox and
work with development builds, so

16
00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:59.376
I had a couple of features that
wouldn't otherwise be possible.

17
00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:03.113
I just mentioned that it is possible
to bypass setting up your local

18
00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:07.453
build environment for development builds
and building the clouds with EIS,

19
00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:12.134
but for this course, we're going to
build our development client locally.

20
00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:15.881
It is incredibly useful to know how to
do this even if you are using EIS for

21
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:20.253
your development builds because it will
help you debug more complex functionality

22
00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:23.689
down the line or if you ever want
to create your own native module,

23
00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.509
it will be easier to iterate on it.

24
00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.541
So for this workshop, you will need to
have your native dev environment set up

25
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.239
for at least one platform.

26
00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:35.723
Just a quick introduction, well [LAUGH]
just a quick hi from me, so hi,

27
00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:37.015
my name is Kadi, and

28
00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:41.955
I was really fortunate to actually get
into React Native really early on, and

29
00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:47.702
I have remained a huge fan of building
mobile apps and React Native in general.

30
00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:52.407
I've been really fortunate, I've worked on
a lot of interesting projects, I guess one

31
00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:56.122
notable one was I was a tech lead on
building the Puma app from scratch.

32
00:01:57.192 --> 00:01:58.845
And aside from consultancy work,

33
00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:01.695
I've been an active member of
the React Native Community,

34
00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:05.923
I've contributed to some Open Source, and
I've also presented in some conferences.

35
00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.433
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I also spearheaded
building the React Conf app, so

36
00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.735
this was the conference app for
React Conf in 2024, and

37
00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:17.503
we built it actually as an end-to-end
example that's in stores,

38
00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:20.938
that's also Open Source,
that you can go and pick through and

39
00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:24.801
see what building a production app
with expert actually looks like.

40
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.385
I currently work at Expo and hoping to
bring more people into the amazing world

41
00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:32.911
of building mobile apps with React Native.

42
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:37.193
So for this course, to follow along,
you will need a Mac Windows or

43
00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:40.615
Linux machine with Node.js installed.

44
00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:44.092
And we're going to start with Expo Go,
so you should have an iOS or

45
00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:45.495
an Android phone as well.

46
00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:52.196
And finally, you will need to set up your
development environment for either iOS or

47
00:02:52.196 --> 00:02:56.155
Android or both, but
I recommend using one to begin with.

48
00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:59.681
And just for a bit of housekeeping for
the course format, we have

49
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:04.272
this course website, which you hopefully
have access to, it's on GitHub pages.

50
00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:09.220
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And in this course, we're
going to be learning by doing, I mean,

51
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.920
that's my preferred way to learn.

52
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.562
So we're going to build a little
app completely from scratch, and

53
00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:17.670
it's gonna be an app to remind
you to water your plants.

54
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.498
I don't know about you,
but I always forget, so

55
00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:20.935
I definitely need to remind for that.

56
00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:24.807
And we're going to build
this incrementally and

57
00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:28.075
introduce things that we didn't
cover in the intro course, and

58
00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:31.665
I'm going to point out various
concepts and common patterns as we go.

59
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:37.594
This app will also have an on-boarding
step after which you can add some plants

60
00:03:37.594 --> 00:03:41.465
to look after, and we'll explore
some new concepts underway, so for

61
00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:46.421
example, dynamic routes, quick actions,
gradients, and build signing.

62
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:50.246
On this course website, I'm going to
follow a consistent structure, so

63
00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:54.271
everything that I'm going to cover is
also available on the course website.

64
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.785
So if you fall behind, or you feel like
you want some additional information,

65
00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:00.726
there's plenty of links and
resources here.

66
00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:05.926
All the bash commands that you'll
need to run in your terminal

67
00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:10.926
will be here in a code block,
and everything that I code will

68
00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:17.306
be in these collapsible drawers as
either diffs or full components.

69
00:04:17.306 --> 00:04:22.202
And at the end of each section, where
we've added any code to our app, I'll also

70
00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:26.666
add this checkpoint, and the checkpoint
will point to a commit in the core

71
00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:31.992
solutions repo, which will just have
a diff of all the things that we've added.

72
00:04:31.992 --> 00:04:37.582
So if you look at the history of
the commits, it will be a commit for

73
00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:44.007
each section, so if you get lost you
can pick up from the relevant section.

74
00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:47.564
I also have some annotations here,
so I might use a tip or

75
00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:51.046
a warning annotation, so
tip is just to highlight some

76
00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:55.244
useful information related
to the lesson that we're on.

77
00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.053
And a warning is usually to
offer some debugging tips or

78
00:04:58.053 --> 00:05:00.323
cautions against common anti-patterns.

79
00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:03.967
I think that's it for housekeeping,
I hope you will enjoy the course.
