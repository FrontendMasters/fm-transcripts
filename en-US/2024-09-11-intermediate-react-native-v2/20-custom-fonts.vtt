00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.769
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So far we've been
using the default system font, or

2
00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.574
whatever the user has configured.

3
00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:08.529
So that is San Francisco for
iOS and Roboto for Android, so

4
00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.559
all of our text is using that.

5
00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.765
In order to use a custom font,

6
00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.840
we need to bundle the font
files with our application.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.545
There are two ways to do this,
to do custom fonts using Expo,

8
00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:26.174
you could load the font at
runtime using the usefont hooks.

9
00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:30.952
So this mostly exists to make
custom fonts available to Expo Go,

10
00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:34.493
and the font loads
asynchronously at runtime.

11
00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:39.138
So actually the way we do it is using
this splash screen hack or workaround or

12
00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:42.250
basically, but
using the splash screen to do it.

13
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.032
So usually what you would do to prevent
the font from like flickering from one to

14
00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:47.536
the other or like not working.

15
00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:51.767
Is that you would prevent
the splash screen from hiding,

16
00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:57.245
you fetch the font, you load the font and
then you show the splash screen.

17
00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.556
Or you can use the expo-fontconfig plugin,
and

18
00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:04.192
this is only available with
development builds, and

19
00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:09.627
this bundles the font files in the native
bundle so they're always available.

20
00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:15.373
As we are on team development build now,
we will go with this option number two.

21
00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:20.683
Otherwise if you are using fonts and
you have both OTF and TTF options,

22
00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:26.096
choose OTF because they tend to be
smaller, but both of them pull back.

23
00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:30.350
So I mentioned a conflict plugin,
so plugins and

24
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.220
mods are the key to making changes in
your native projects during pre-build.

25
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.099
So right now our iOS and Android projects
are ephemeral, so they are throwaway,

26
00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.867
we are generating them only so
we could build our native project.

27
00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:53.333
And if I make any changes here manually,
they will be wiped with the next prebuilt.

28
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.815
So what if I want to install a library or

29
00:01:55.815 --> 00:02:00.779
I want to make some change that requires
like changing this safe directory,

30
00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:05.458
but I don't want to opt out of this
preamble photo because it's handy.

31
00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.174
And the key to that are plugins and
mods, so

32
00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:12.797
they are little JavaScript functions
that get a run during pre-built.

33
00:02:12.797 --> 00:02:17.165
And then you can change the files
you need to a directory or

34
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:21.719
you can change context, so
there's little example here.

35
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.368
And most complicated libraries
that require additional

36
00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:31.595
native configuration will use
a config plugin to achieve that,

37
00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:36.066
so the config plugin will be
shipped with the library.

38
00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:39.744
So config plugins aren't available
with expo go because they're changing

39
00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:40.724
the native direct.

40
00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:45.277
So if you need to use a config plugin,
you have to use a development build.

41
00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:51.230
So Google Fonts has a huge amount of
fonts available, it's pretty handy and

42
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.431
they are all free to use,
which is also pretty handy.

43
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:57.835
So if you're building client projects,

44
00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:02.377
then a lot of times they will provide you
with font files, so you can use those.

45
00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:05.305
But if you're building for
smaller projects or for

46
00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:08.377
yourself, then Google Fonts
is often a good option.

47
00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:12.248
Let's for example, take this font Caveat,
I know handwriting fonts,

48
00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:16.382
doing your whole app in handwriting in
fonts would probably be a bit intense.

49
00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:20.558
But I think it's pretty nice to use this,
for example for

50
00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:23.961
our little tagline on
the on boarding screen.

51
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.009
So we also have these
convenient libraries, so

52
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.998
you could download this font.

53
00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:32.464
So you could go to get font and

54
00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:37.668
then download it and include it manually.

55
00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:41.527
If you're using a Google font,
we also have libraries for

56
00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:43.968
all the Google fonts that you could,

57
00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:48.486
npx expo install them instead of
having to manually download them.

58
00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:54.662
So, that's npx expo install expo-font and

59
00:03:54.662 --> 00:04:01.496
this Google font for
Caveat, gonna do this here.

60
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.179
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And now, we need to add
the config plug-in to include this font

61
00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.494
file in our native projects.

62
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.288
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, so this will
be in our app.json and there we go, so

63
00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:31.358
our plugins are here, so we already
had a little plugin for Expo Router.

64
00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:34.078
So to pass in additional
options to our plugin,

65
00:04:34.078 --> 00:04:36.465
I'm going to convert this into an array.

66
00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:41.567
Yes, so I'm going to convert
this into an array and

67
00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:48.803
the first element of the array is It's
going to be the name of the plugin,

68
00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:53.091
and the second one is
an object with fonts.

69
00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:58.801
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And this will be an array
of fonts, so the font that we chos,

70
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:00.830
we installed a library for it.

71
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.945
So it's actually look so
it'll be expo-google-fonts/caveats,

72
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:11.067
so if we go to our node modules,
expo-google-fonts, there you go.

73
00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:17.332
So these are all of our
font files [COUGH] and

74
00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:21.994
I think I chose the 400 one.

75
00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:25.044
So, if you had your own OTF or TTF file,

76
00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:30.693
you could put it in your assets directory
and then link from it from here.

77
00:05:30.693 --> 00:05:34.279
Because this is in my node modules,

78
00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.349
I'll just copy the path and add it here.

79
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:49.272
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay and now all
that's left to do is to rebuild, so

80
00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:55.975
I'm gonna do my same trick again just
to remove this from gitignore so

81
00:05:55.975 --> 00:06:01.544
we could just see all the things
that prebuild is adding.

82
00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:06.166
And let me npx here expo prebuilt, and

83
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:14.119
I'm gonna just do -- clean to do
both projects at the same time.

84
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.188
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, and now if you
look at what's changed in the Android

85
00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:40.915
directory, the Caveat font has
been added to the fonts directory.

86
00:06:40.915 --> 00:06:46.428
And on iOS,
it's listed in our info P list,

87
00:06:46.428 --> 00:06:54.921
and I think there's gonna be a link
to it in the in the x code project,

88
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:59.696
so these are the things that changed.

89
00:06:59.696 --> 00:07:05.708
And finally,
let me just add these back into gitignore,

90
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:13.098
do wanna accidentally commit that
because that would be a nightmare,

91
00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:18.003
and let's rebuild for
an Android and run iOS.

92
00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.573
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And now we wait,
it shouldn't be too long.

93
00:07:34.472 --> 00:07:36.850
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: While I wait
I'm going to add some plants.

94
00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:51.294
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you ever
add a seeding script, so

95
00:07:51.294 --> 00:07:54.977
you don't have to do this every time
you do a pre-build to add data?

96
00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:56.526
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: A seeding script like for
the data?

97
00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:59.294
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like a seeding script yeah,
you wouldn't have to go in and

98
00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:00.717
add Sophie the spider plant.

99
00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:03.828
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that a thing with mold

100
00:08:03.828 --> 00:08:05.384
development?

101
00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:08.398
With Prisma Database, there's
a seeding ability where you can say,

102
00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:11.323
hey, this is some mock data for
maybe an environment or something.

103
00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:16.196
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Yes, I see what you mean,
so I haven't built a lot of apps where all

104
00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:20.477
the data is stored locally,
tends to be stored remotely.

105
00:08:20.477 --> 00:08:24.150
So you would have a mock API
where you would load it from,

106
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.959
that would be very common.

107
00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:30.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We use markdown, you just
build a markdown and you just say when you

108
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.610
get a 200, respond with this and
then you point to a local dev URL.

109
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.149
Okay, so
it's dependent on the app kind of mock.

110
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:44.103
Yeah, you just you change your
local environment to say when you

111
00:08:44.103 --> 00:08:45.946
want to call mock data.

112
00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:48.141
You started with mock server, koon server.

113
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:50.046
Interesting, I gotcha.

114
00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:53.195
That's how we do it.

115
00:08:53.195 --> 00:08:53.832
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Yeah, so

116
00:08:53.832 --> 00:08:58.693
thankfully you don't have to rebuild
very often in day-to-day life,

117
00:08:58.693 --> 00:09:03.406
so you would rebuild, go and
have a cup of coffee, it's a nice break.

118
00:09:03.406 --> 00:09:07.016
It's a little bit more tedious
in a workshop setting.

119
00:09:07.016 --> 00:09:11.347
Okay, our field is done, so
this should now include,

120
00:09:11.347 --> 00:09:15.219
let me just add the same,
my two favorite plans.

121
00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:18.626
Okay and then let's go to onboarding,

122
00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:24.718
cuz what we wanted to do is change
this onboarding the sub the call out,

123
00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:28.242
keep your plants healthy and hydrated.

124
00:09:28.242 --> 00:09:32.213
Let's change this to a handwriting font,
I think that would look quite nice.

125
00:09:32.213 --> 00:09:36.715
So the font that we added,

126
00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:39.990
the file name was,

127
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.492
it was Caveat regular, so

128
00:09:44.492 --> 00:09:49.404
let's copy this and go to our

129
00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:54.521
onboarding file, tagline,

130
00:09:54.521 --> 00:10:00.062
fontFamily, Caveat Regular.

131
00:10:00.062 --> 00:10:06.547
Okay, and let's make this slightly
bigger as well, I think 34 will do it.

132
00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:14.709
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so you've noticed
that it's updated immediately on Android,

133
00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:17.928
but it's not updated on IOS, why is that?

134
00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:22.716
The reason is on Android,
the file name of the font file is used as

135
00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:27.519
the font family and this makes sense,
it's really easy to see.

136
00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:31.507
We passed in the Caveat
400 regular into here and

137
00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:36.711
then that's why we're doing
font family Caveat 400 regular.

138
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:41.721
On ios, it's actually using
a postscript name of the font,

139
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:45.960
which is not necessarily
the same as the filename.

140
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.944
So the way that you find out
the postscript name is you

141
00:10:50.944 --> 00:10:55.483
have to load the font into
your font book on Mac.

142
00:10:55.483 --> 00:11:02.020
So if you go to your node module,
extra legal font, Caveat_400Regular.

143
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.965
And if you basically
navigate to this folder and

144
00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:09.167
double click on it, it will open it
you can open it in your font book.

145
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:13.922
So it will be font book, so
open it on here and actually,

146
00:11:13.922 --> 00:11:19.101
I've already loaded this one,
but you could search for it.

147
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:24.785
So this is all the fonts that
are installed on my Mac are here,

148
00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.243
thats Caveat.

149
00:11:26.243 --> 00:11:30.429
And here you can see the postscript
name of the font, so

150
00:11:30.429 --> 00:11:35.707
you'll see that even though my
file name was Caveat400Regular,

151
00:11:35.707 --> 00:11:39.531
the postscript name is
actually Caveat Regular.

152
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:46.304
So if I go to onboarding and
change this to Caveat Regular,

153
00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:49.899
then Android stops working and

154
00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:55.306
iOS starts working,
it's like whack a mole.

155
00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:59.896
Well, thankfully we have utility
functions to handle this, so

156
00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:05.508
we have platform, which is from React
Native, so we use platform ios before.

157
00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:10.596
But there's actually another
handy utility function,

158
00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:16.745
where you can do platform select,
and here you can pass in an object.

159
00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:23.594
So on ios, we will choose Caveat Regular,

160
00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:28.159
and on Android, we will do it

161
00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:33.109
was Caveat_400Regular,

162
00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:37.124
which was the file name.

163
00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:38.420
Now it works on both.
