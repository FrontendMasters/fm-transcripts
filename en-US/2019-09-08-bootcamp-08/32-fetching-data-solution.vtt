00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We left it in
kind of estate yesterday.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.580
As you can see here,
that if I change the drop down,

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.910
it will log out the correct URL, right?

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.572
So, let's go ahead and start from
that point, and we'll get going.

5
00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.275
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
all this can stay the same.

6
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.862
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're going to
relatively reuse some of this logic here

7
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.350
that we had from the addDoggo
Go button up here.

8
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.964
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But there's a couple of
ways that you could have solved this.

9
00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:42.429
The way that we were doing with add-doggo
button is we're creating a new image tag

10
00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:43.538
every single time.

11
00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.821
What I'm going to do here is, I'm just
going to put an image tag in the HTML, and

12
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:49.339
then I'm just going to change
the source every single time.

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.284
Okay, so rather than have like dogs and

14
00:00:55.284 --> 00:01:00.839
a pen child in here,
I'm just going to put here and

15
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.806
just have like my dog image in here,

16
00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:09.327
and then I'll just change it from here.

17
00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:14.255
Let's go ahead and have to start
out being some sort of picture from

18
00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:18.834
like place corgi or
something like that, placecorgi.com.

19
00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:21.591
I'm just going to grab a URL from here.

20
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:27.310
This is the best website by the way,
you are never disappointed by this site.

21
00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:33.169
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and put that there.

22
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.500
But I don't really care what it is as long
as they have some image to kind of so

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.360
that the user immediately sees something.

24
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.550
And this is going to be a doggo.

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.160
Okay, and I'm going to get rid of the
button because we don't need that anymore.

26
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.310
It's coming back over here, now you
can see that there's a corgi picture.

27
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.520
Let's actually put that up underneath
the selector, I think that will be better.

28
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.857
Okay, let's save that and refresh.

29
00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:17.694
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whatever,
not going for CSS today,

30
00:02:17.694 --> 00:02:20.975
so
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next thing,

31
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:25.102
we want to do is if when I change this to
be something I wanted to change whatever

32
00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:26.190
pictures in there.

33
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.440
So, what I'm going to do is just get
doggo, well, we'll just rewrite it.

34
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.700
I think that's fine, we'll rewrite it.

35
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.216
So, I'm going to write
a function down here

36
00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:48.320
called get doggo function Get doggo.

37
00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:53.480
It's going to take in a URL because we're
already constructing it up here, so

38
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.250
we might as well use it.

39
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.998
And from here,
we're going to fetch that URL.

40
00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:11.512
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then,
we're going to take that data and

41
00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:15.531
we're going to function, data, or

42
00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:20.078
response, whatever you want to call it.

43
00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:23.649
We're going to return response.json.

44
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:29.527
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then,
we're going to get our data back.

45
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:36.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [INAUDIBLE] so
now yeah, go on.

46
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, remind me
the response that JSON that converts

47
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.260
whatever the response is to JSON,

48
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.120
if it's not already
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so just so you know,

49
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.110
if I hit response dot,

50
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.660
you can see here that it actually
has quite a few things in here.

51
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.110
It could be a blog that's one
of the things that could be.

52
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.115
Blobs are going to be things like images,
they're going to be basically some,

53
00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:02.089
just a blob of data,
some in-specific thing, often images.

54
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.420
It could just be normal text, right?

55
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.670
It could be several things,
most are going to be JSON though, yeah.

56
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And response, is that a key
word like function that's just there?

57
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope,
it can be whatever you want.

58
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.150
Often-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You can put anything there?

59
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so often, I will
shorten this to res, because I'm lazy.

60
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.227
So, as long as it matches the parameters,
and

61
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:34.037
when you see parameters in functions
it never matters what they are.

62
00:04:34.037 --> 00:04:37.383
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is
literally variable name.

63
00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:39.246
Just like you can call your variable
whatever you want you can call your

64
00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.110
parameters whatever you want.

65
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.860
That answer your question?

66
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.360
Cool.

67
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.310
Once we have that data,
I'm going to go up here and

68
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.360
get a hold of my image of contest.

69
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.300
Image equals document,
get a query selector

70
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.010
like what I call dog dash image
said sound right to someone.

71
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.522
Dog dash image
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

72
00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:10.449
once I had that data back so data dot
message now is going to be whatever

73
00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.970
my image is going to
whatever I want it to be.

74
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.577
So, I should be able to say
image.src = data.message.

75
00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:25.129
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right only because I
haven't done a loading spinner yet, and

76
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.240
I'll show you how to do
that here in just a second.

77
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.743
But.

78
00:05:29.478 --> 00:05:32.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They should at least now
every time that we call get dog with

79
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.226
the correct URL, it should go out and
get the correct image.

80
00:05:36.226 --> 00:05:40.337
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, now we have to call
get dog from our event listener up here.

81
00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:44.472
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I called this just get dog hope somewhere.

82
00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:49.108
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Change that and

83
00:05:49.108 --> 00:05:53.950
URL is going to be this.

84
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.975
Okay, so now I should be

85
00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:09.485
able to refresh over here.

86
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:15.526
And hopefully, if I change this,
it is changing this

87
00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:21.611
image is
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How

88
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:23.130
do we feel about that so far, look good?

89
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:34.200
So, if you remember up here we construct a
select using the information for the API.

90
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.940
Here we are the event listener for
change, to call this function.

91
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.150
So, anytime that someone selects a beagle,
or something like that,

92
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.608
event or target that value,
this right here is going to be beagle.

93
00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:50.240
It's going to be whatever
the user selected, okay?

94
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.300
So, that constructs our URL to go out
to the dog API to get a random image.

95
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.770
We pass that URL we can construct
right there into getDoggo, okay?

96
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.410
We go down to getDoggo right there
with that URL being pass into it.

97
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.965
We then call the dog API again,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Transform

98
00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:18.650
that into like a usable JavaScript object
here, which it ends up here as data.

99
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:25.173
And then, we know that data.message
is fact if you want to see that

100
00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:32.672
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Call African or

101
00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:35.275
something like that, you can see there.

102
00:07:35.275 --> 00:07:38.360
It comes back as images.dog.ceo.

103
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.318
And that's the message which is what
data.message corresponds to that object

104
00:07:43.318 --> 00:07:44.211
right there.
