00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:03.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
gonna be your project, but

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:05.980
I'm gonna help you get started today.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.964
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question on this.

4
00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:11.384
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is the Ajax then?

5
00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The Ajax is the actual,
it's like the Fetch part.

6
00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:14.586
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

7
00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:16.946
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When you are doing
Fetch you are doing Ajax.

8
00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:17.782
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

9
00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:19.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this is the newer way of doing it.

10
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.760
There was an old way that was
9000 times more complicated.

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.372
I have to copy and paste stuff
every single time I had to do it.

12
00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:31.901
Fetch came out, maybe, it was
probably was invented 8 years ago but

13
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:35.193
we could really only use it like 4 or
5 years ago.

14
00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:37.143
It made this like tons easier.

15
00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:41.398
Yeah, when you're doing
Fetch your doing Ajax.

16
00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:45.492
So the next thing we're gonna
be doing is I want you to,

17
00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:51.812
I wanna show you a little bit how to read
API documentation because that's something

18
00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:57.967
inevitably you're gonna have to do if
you're gonna be doing anything like this.

19
00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:02.499
They're actually quite impressed
with their documentation

20
00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.207
because it's not always this good.

21
00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:10.685
Here it says like, hey, if you request
this it's gonna look something like this.

22
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.989
And actually, this one, it literally
shows you what it's gonna look like.

23
00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:22.008
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in fact,
if you just copy and paste this,

24
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:29.132
this little URL right here,
you get all of these dogs back.

25
00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:31.528
And some of them have breeds and
sub breeds.

26
00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.806
For now, you can just go ahead and
ignore the sub breeds.

27
00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:40.077
We're just gonna focus on the breeds,
just like the overarching breeds.

28
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.567
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't think they
even have harmonies on here.

29
00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:45.342
That's what Luna is.

30
00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:47.889
She's a harmonies and
that's very important.

31
00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.646
I feel like you need to know that.

32
00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:54.032
Anyway, so what we're gonna do here for

33
00:01:54.032 --> 00:01:58.547
the exercise,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

34
00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:02.995
want you to make something like that.

35
00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:07.727
And then up here is a drop down of
all the various dog breeds that

36
00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.737
you're gonna have to get from the API.

37
00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:15.003
And then whenever I select one
of these like a Pomeranian,

38
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.845
it'll change this to show
you a little Pomeranian.

39
00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:26.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that dog doesn't look happy.

40
00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:30.775
[LAUGH] So I'm gonna show
you a couple of things here.

41
00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.943
So one of the things I want you to work on
cuz I think they are cool is notice that

42
00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:38.019
whenever I change this is
a little dog spinner, right?

43
00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.095
That's kinda cool, right?

44
00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:43.224
It's just an emoji that I have a CSS
animation that just makes it rotate.

45
00:02:43.224 --> 00:02:45.803
That's all it is.

46
00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:47.316
So we're gonna show you a couple things.

47
00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.822
So you're able to do that.

48
00:02:56.952 --> 00:03:01.428
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna have
you first request a list of all

49
00:03:01.428 --> 00:03:03.354
breeds from the API.

50
00:03:03.354 --> 00:03:07.411
What you're gonna do is that's
gonna give you back this, right,

51
00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:09.230
all of these various breeds.
