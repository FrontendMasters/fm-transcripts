00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.289
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Create a new file in here,
call it my Gallery or

2
00:00:02.289 --> 00:00:04.535
whatever you chose to
call your JavaScript.

3
00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:08.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna come in here,
and we're going to use.

4
00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:17.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Open the styles,
CSS, that you just copied over.

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.009
And I'm just gonna put these
stuff down at the bottom here.

6
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.238
We just need to add a couple more things.

7
00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:28.015
So a swiper slide, we're just gonna
give it a text align of center,

8
00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:31.615
otherwise our pictures are gonna be off,
so text align center.

9
00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:37.872
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then the images in there,

10
00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:40.255
we're just gonna give them
a height of 600 pixels.

11
00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.288
So image height, 600 pixels.

12
00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Only two things
I added there were these.

13
00:00:56.352 --> 00:00:59.475
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, open your my dash
gallery.js that we just created here.

14
00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:03.397
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Real simple here.

15
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:06.041
So we're gonna say new Swiper.

16
00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:14.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .swiper dash container,
like that.

17
00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:20.704
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Comma, and then we're
gonna give it an object as well.

18
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.748
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I could do this all in one line,

19
00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:27.078
I'm gonna do it on multiple lines
cuz it gets pretty dense otherwise.

20
00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:31.375
So I'm gonna hit enter there, and
put it on multiple lines here.

21
00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:36.942
Speed:400, this is how fast
things swipe between each other.

22
00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:40.490
I don't know what 400 necessarily
represents, but it represents a thing.

23
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.677
You can make it go up and
down, and play with it.

24
00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:48.511
SpaceBetween, I think this
is the space between photos,

25
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.889
it's a hundred pixels,
is what that represents.

26
00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:53.619
And then navigation.

27
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:05.887
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna say, the next
button is going to be Starts wiper,

28
00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:10.646
dash button dash next and the prev L.

29
00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:18.214
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is .swiper
dash button dash prev.

30
00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:24.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We forgot
to do the buttons.

31
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.077
We'll go to do the buttons
here in just a second.

32
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you might be looking at this,

33
00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:34.966
I don't really understand
what this is doing.

34
00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:38.968
And that's kind of, par for the course
with working with someone else’s

35
00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:42.867
You don’t really have to understand
what is happening underneath it, right?

36
00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:45.592
You are just gonna play around with
the parameters that you passed to it,

37
00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:47.928
until eventually,
it looks the way that you’re happy with.

38
00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:52.451
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that’s literally
all that I did here as well.

39
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:57.113
So this is almost exactly what you
copy and paste off of their tutorial.

40
00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:01.008
Let’s talk about new for a second,
because we have not seen that before.

41
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:08.307
The one blind version of what news is,
you don't have to care.

42
00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:09.604
[LAUGH] The three line version is,

43
00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:11.791
there's a thing called
object oriented programming.

44
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:16.740
Where you can actually, you can
create an abstract, animal class, and

45
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.785
then you can have a dog class that
inherits from the animal class, right?

46
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:26.286
And new is kind of the thing that allows
you to establish those relationships.

47
00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:29.821
Don't do it in JavaScript,
because it's really messy,

48
00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:32.573
other languages like
Java do it really well.

49
00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:34.645
But, with javaScript, it just a mess.

50
00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:37.437
So, I just suggest,
unless some tells you to use new,

51
00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:39.824
like this particular library does, don't.

52
00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:45.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, in other words,
you don't have to mind it.

53
00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.495
I wanted you to know what it is,
at least enough to know it's,

54
00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.290
I don't want to touch that.

55
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.440
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

56
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.838
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One question.

57
00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:54.395
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

58
00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:59.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In the documentation,
they talk about creating a variable,

59
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.132
mySwiper, why are we not doing that?

60
00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:05.482
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can't do this,
and that's exactly what this does,

61
00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:07.770
it returns a new instance of the Swiper.

62
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.384
Because you can have you can have
five swipers on one page and

63
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:16.369
you can have them keep several of them,
since we're never referencing it later,

64
00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:19.207
we don't necessarily
have to keep it around.

65
00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:19.892
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

66
00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:24.169
if if you want it to later
programmatically manipulate it,

67
00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.742
then you would have to hold on to it.

68
00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:30.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So this will get called,
automatically, essentially.

69
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.466
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so this is
still basically invoking a function.

70
00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:39.252
In fact, that's literally what it's doing,
it is invoking a function.
