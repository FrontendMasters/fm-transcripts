00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.868
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the way that
we're gonna show and hide images,

2
00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.815
is that we're gonna be using CSS classes,
right?

3
00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:10.430
We're gonna take advantage of
the fact that we can add and

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.670
subtract classes from image
elements very simply.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.290
And so, let's go ahead and
create another CSS file here.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.435
And call it, I'm gonna call it styles.css,
just cuz I'm not creative and

7
00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:31.690
that's what I call my CSS files, but
feel free to call what you wanna call it.

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.806
And we're just gonna put in it
just a handful of CSS here.

9
00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.550
Did Jen talk about box sizing border box?

10
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.409
So did she ever do anything like this?

11
00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:50.611
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Kind of skimmed it.

12
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:54.884
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, this is literally the
first thing I put in every CSS file that

13
00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:55.428
I open.

14
00:00:55.428 --> 00:01:00.312
This makes doing measurements
with padding, and borders, and

15
00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:01.950
margins, and such.

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.985
Just 1,000 times simpler to do.

17
00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:08.811
So I'm going to suggest
that you should do this.

18
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:11.991
And I would say that's
a common practice to do.

19
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:14.886
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the asterisk mean
that applies to everything on the page?

20
00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:18.008
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so if I save this.

21
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:21.393
I'm gonna come back over here to my
index.html, I have to link this, as well.

22
00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:26.419
So I'm gonna say, link./styles.css.

23
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I just added line eight there.

24
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:36.547
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
cuz I need to link the two together.

25
00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:44.267
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If I inspect element here
on Luna, and refresh my page over here,

26
00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:50.431
you can see that it's literally gonna show
up on every single element right there.

27
00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:57.791
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's called the wild
card selector, cuz it selects everything.

28
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.733
I'm going to go ahead and
say with the wild card selector,

29
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.044
this is the only thing you
should ever do with it.

30
00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:08.172
Never do anything else with
the wild card selector, or

31
00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:10.488
it's not gonna do what you want it to do.

32
00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:11.776
Then, you can actually sort on your page.

33
00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:17.310
Because, as you might imagine applying
the same style to everything,

34
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.459
can be quite burdensome on the browser.

35
00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.040
Okay, good?

36
00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:28.604
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
we're gonna do gallery image here.

37
00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:32.096
This is gonna apply to all
of this image tags here.

38
00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:35.425
The first thing we wanna do,
is we wanna make them display none.

39
00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:39.549
So by default, all the images
are not going to show up, okay?

40
00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.718
And then,
we're going to add an active class,

41
00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:47.167
which we put in here right here,
this active one here on line 12.

42
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.769
When it's the active image,
that's when it's gonna show up, right?

43
00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.174
And then, all the rest ones
are not gonna show up until

44
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.681
you put that active class on it, okay?

45
00:02:56.681 --> 00:03:01.231
So gallery image gets displayed on, and
then, I'm gonna give it a max height

46
00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:05.921
of 600 pixels, so that, if the image
is smaller than 600 pixels, then,

47
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.014
it's gonna go ahead and
shrink down to that height.

48
00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:13.467
Otherwise, it's going to not let
it expand beyond 600 pixels.

49
00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:19.257
Now, underneath this,
I'm gonna put .active as a display, block.

50
00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.733
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, something has both
gallery image and .active, right?

51
00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:32.531
Like my first picture of Luna there,
is it gonna be display block, or

52
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.699
is it gonna be displayed none?

53
00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:41.504
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna block, yeah,
correct, reason being, is that they're

54
00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:45.363
gonna have equal specificity, right,
they're both gonna have one class.

55
00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:48.579
So what it's gonna do, is it's gonna
look for the ones lower on the page.

56
00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.827
So this one came last, so
therefore, that one wins.

57
00:03:53.827 --> 00:03:54.520
Make sense?

58
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.522
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
we're in the CSS page, right?

59
00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:57.361
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, yeah.

60
00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:03.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so next, we gonna do,

61
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.304
image gallery,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is gonna be like

62
00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:10.404
everything around it, with 100%,

63
00:04:10.404 --> 00:04:15.884
it's gonna take up the whole page,
wanna make it flex, display flex.

64
00:04:15.884 --> 00:04:18.529
Cuz what I want it to be,
is I want it to be centered on the page.

65
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.498
So I'm gonna say display flex,

66
00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:28.825
justify content center,
and align items center.

67
00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:33.467
These three things together, display flex,
justify content, and align items center,

68
00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:37.210
that's a really easy way for
you to center content inside of something.

69
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.174
So the image gallery is gonna take up 100%
of the page, it's gonna have some amount

70
00:04:42.174 --> 00:04:45.985
of height, and it's going to center
whatever it has inside of it.

71
00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:50.724
In other words,
I use these three things together a lot.

72
00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.276
Okay, we have some buttons down at
the bottom that will code up here in

73
00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:53.848
just a second.

74
00:04:53.848 --> 00:04:59.080
These buttons are going to have,
with 100%,

75
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.436
and the same thing from up here,
the display flex,

76
00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:09.432
justify content center,
a line items center.

77
00:05:16.407 --> 00:05:19.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Justify content,
if you remember, is horizontally,

78
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:20.602
what it's gonna do with it.

79
00:05:20.602 --> 00:05:23.610
So if you wanna space mount easier,
you can do like space round, or

80
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.834
space between, or space evenly across
the page, or you can do center,

81
00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:29.227
which is just squished
everything into the center.

82
00:05:29.227 --> 00:05:30.983
And then,
the line item sets it vertically.

83
00:05:33.383 --> 00:05:36.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this I want this to be center for now.

84
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.596
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, we wanna give
our buttons a little bit of style, so

85
00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:47.710
our buttons are gonna
have background color.

86
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.752
And you can choose whatever background
color that suits your fancy.

87
00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:56.890
I chose this nice shade of blue

88
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.210
which was 0074D9.

89
00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:06.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see there,
it's kinda a nice blue.

90
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.907
Okay, color, white, font size,

91
00:06:10.907 --> 00:06:15.792
I gave it like the size of 20 pixels.

92
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.944
All of this is up to your interpretation.

93
00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:22.304
If you wanna get creative and do your
own thing here, I'm 100% okay with that.

94
00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:26.162
Padding, when you're making buttons,
typically, you want them

95
00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:30.502
to have just a little bit of vertical
spacing, but a lot of space on the side.

96
00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:34.537
So you're gonna do five pixels for
up and down padding.

97
00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:38.007
And then, for left and right spacing, you
want a lot, so you're gonna put 20 pixels,

98
00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:38.993
or something like that.

99
00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:47.473
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, border color, buttons
come inherently with a border color, so

100
00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:51.603
I'm gonna make that transparent, so
that we don't have to deal with it.

101
00:06:54.182 --> 00:06:57.639
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Border radius,
everyone likes rounded corners, right?

102
00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.044
So we need just a nice
kind of soft corner there.

103
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then,
when you put your mouse over it,

104
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:11.971
we want it to look like you can click it,
so that you do that with cursor pointer.

105
00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:14.899
That's how you make something look
clickable when someone mouse is over it.

106
00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:19.635
Okay, .previous step, and
we want to have a little bit of separation

107
00:07:19.635 --> 00:07:24.231
from each other, so
we're gonna do margin, right, 15 pixels.

108
00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:31.172
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, if you remember
on this one over here, if I come over

109
00:07:31.172 --> 00:07:36.087
here, notice that when it's disabled here,
the background changes color.

110
00:07:36.087 --> 00:07:39.060
So you want it, when it's disabled,
to change the background color.

111
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.015
And also, notice that my mouse there,
it goes to not allowed.

112
00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:47.633
That's another nice indicator to someone
that you can't click on this, so

113
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.888
we'll do that, as well.

114
00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:57.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So btn, and
then, you'll do :disabled.

115
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.746
And this is saying a button
that has been disabled,

116
00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:05.384
apply these styles to it.

117
00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:12.323
So background color,
I gave it something like 666,

118
00:08:12.323 --> 00:08:16.321
maybe, let's just do 777.

119
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:19.306
And cursor not-allowed,

120
00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:25.155
that's how you get that nice,
you can click on that.
