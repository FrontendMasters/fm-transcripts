00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.419
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
it has that weird flash, right?

2
00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:08.140
So if I load another carn right here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.090
shows the old image first, and then it
quickly switches over to the new image.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.804
It should be preferable if
they didn't do that, right?

5
00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.291
It would be preferable if
just the new image showed up.

6
00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:20.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So how can we do that?

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.540
First of all, before we get to that,

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.190
does anyone have any
questions about this so far?

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is the benefit to
making a show class versus changing

10
00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.035
the style to display none or
display block for each of those things?

11
00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:40.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure,
you could totally do spinner.style.display

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.813
=,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: block right here,

13
00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.660
and then change it to none down here.

14
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.010
I think, one,
it's just personal preference.

15
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.750
There are lots of people that
would definitely do it that way.

16
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.220
For me, the code here feels a little
bit cleaner to do it with classes.

17
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.537
Cuz let's say later, I wanna do
animations, where it fades out and

18
00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:08.533
fades back in.

19
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.800
That's really easy to do with classes and
it would be horrendous to do it with this.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.871
If you're changing one property,
I don't really care.

21
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:18.370
But if you're changing
a lot of properties,

22
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.490
then it becomes terrible and unruly.

23
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.000
So I only wanna hide the spinner after
the image has actually been loaded.

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.265
So what I'm gonna do here instead
is rather than immediately show and

25
00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.368
hide these divs,

26
00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:35.091
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually
add an event list here on the image.

27
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.780
Let's just do it down here.

28
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.840
And we're gonna say img.addEventListener.

29
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.330
And whenever a load event happens, and

30
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.407
a load event is fired whenever
a image successfully loads

31
00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:55.761
its,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Its source,

32
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:59.460
so whenever that happens,
that's what we're gonna do.

33
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna remove show and
add show,

34
00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:10.330
remove show from the spinner and
add show from the classList.

35
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.930
I'm gonna comment that out of there.

36
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.360
So now, hopefully,
if you say beagle, there we go.

37
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.639
Now that looks a lot cleaner, doesn't it?

38
00:02:29.987 --> 00:02:32.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
just to kind of recap what happened here.

39
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.140
Before, once we got
the data back from the API,

40
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.450
right, all the API gives you
back is a URL to the image.

41
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.520
It doesn't actually give you the image,
right?

42
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.410
There's a difference, right?

43
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.110
It's like it doesn't give you the house,

44
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.460
it just gives you the address
of the house, right?

45
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.130
And we actually only wanna show it when
we actually have the actual image itself.

46
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.211
So if you immediately show the image after
you just get the address, you still have

47
00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:04.335
to get the time that it takes you to get
to the house, right, overextended analogy.

48
00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:07.345
[LAUGH] So that's what we're doing here.

49
00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:11.705
We're basically saying, cool,
change the source of this image, but

50
00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:15.133
wait until the image arrives
back to me from the server.

51
00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's what the event
listener here is doing is wait until

52
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.772
this load event happens.

53
00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:29.762
Once that load event happens,
then remove the show

54
00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:34.184
from the spinner and
then add it to the image.

55
00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:41.512
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
mine still shows the placeholder corgi,

56
00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:45.490
but my underneath it.

57
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.637
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's

58
00:03:51.637 --> 00:03:53.614
what you have to do there.

59
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.025
Basically in some fashion,
you have to hide the image.

60
00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:05.565
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
other people here have been doing

61
00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:10.502
img.style.display = none, right?

62
00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:12.110
And that would totally work as well.

63
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.272
You can either do it with classes or

64
00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:19.437
you can do it with directly
manipulating the styles.

65
00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:21.934
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

66
00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:26.171
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, then you just have
to make sure to show it again afterwards.
