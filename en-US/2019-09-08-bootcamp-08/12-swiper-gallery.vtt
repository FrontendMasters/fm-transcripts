00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.872
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna create
another folder here called gallery2.

2
00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:06.481
You can call it gallery library version,
or something like that,

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.001
just as long as it's
different than gallery.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.721
Or you can overwrite your old code
if you're not attached to it, but

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.081
I would suggest keeping it around, okay.

6
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.731
And then I'm going to
open this with VS Code.

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.355
I can actually just,
where did Spotify come from?

8
00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.283
Gallery, and then you can just drag and
drop that onto VS Code, and

9
00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:26.976
it'll open that in VS Code.

10
00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:30.740
So now I have gallery2
open here in my editor.

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.776
I'm gonna minimize this.

12
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.506
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
I'm gonna put that in here.

13
00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.078
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
I'm going to create another new file, and

14
00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:52.375
I'm gonna call this index.html, in here.

15
00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:59.096
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm gonna create another HTML document.

16
00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.566
This one is gonna be
called Swiper Gallery.

17
00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.064
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then here, I'm gonna say,

18
00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:18.590
the first thing I'm gonna
need to load is from Swiper.

19
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.850
And I'm gonna go link, and I can actually
load this directly off the Internet.

20
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.306
I don't even have to download it,

21
00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:27.576
I can just download this
directly from the Internet.

22
00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.708
So I'm gonna put,
that's a lot of things to write, so

23
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:33.239
let's just go copy it
off of their website.

24
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.653
I think they have it on here.

25
00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:41.331
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where is
their API documentation?

26
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.108
There it is.

27
00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:44.825
Okay, so scroll down on the website.

28
00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:48.733
There's a little API button here,
or actually let's go with Download.

29
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:54.221
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope,
that's not the one I want.

30
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:55.109
Get Started.

31
00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.176
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There it is, okay.

32
00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.492
So go to Swiper, scroll down.

33
00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:06.014
Find Get Started With Swiper,
down here, under, And It Is Free.

34
00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:11.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then we're
gonna scroll down here, it says,

35
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.508
Use Swiper from CDN, here on 1b.

36
00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:19.173
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
then I'm gonna grab the top one here,

37
00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:22.147
link stylesheet here, Swiper CSS.

38
00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:24.785
I'm just gonna copy that
whole thing right there.

39
00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:28.168
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm gonna put that in the head.

40
00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:35.079
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So why am I grabbing this
one and not the min one underneath it?

41
00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.696
So this one, the minimized one is,
it's all crunched together, and

42
00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:40.488
it's made to be very, very tiny.

43
00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:44.437
So it's the smallest it can be, so that
if you put it on your production website,

44
00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:48.758
your real website, it's just a little bit
smaller, so people can download it faster.

45
00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:51.962
However, we're doing
the development stuff, and so

46
00:02:51.962 --> 00:02:55.803
it's easier if it's a little bit
more spacious and easy to read.

47
00:02:55.803 --> 00:03:00.744
If you wanna see what that looks like,
you can actually just copy and

48
00:03:00.744 --> 00:03:03.267
paste this URL into your browser.

49
00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:10.255
So what you need to do here, where it
says 4.x.x, you're gonna say 4.4.2.

50
00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:14.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now we should be able to pull that out.

51
00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:23.751
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now if we copy and
paste line 8 here of Swiper 4.4.2,

52
00:03:23.751 --> 00:03:27.545
you can see here that
it's just a lot of CSS.

53
00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:29.231
Now, if you look at that and say,

54
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:33.472
they're doing a bunch of stuff there that
I don't know what it does, neither do I.

55
00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:37.639
But that's kind of the magic of using
open source libraries like this,

56
00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.076
is it's relatively a black box, right?

57
00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:42.767
They say, if you touch these buttons,
it's gonna do these things right?

58
00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:46.385
So same thing with your computer, when I
touch my keyboard I don't know what it is

59
00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.648
doing, but magic things happen on
my screen, so that's cool, right?

60
00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:52.284
Relatively the same thing here is that,

61
00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:57.641
as long as I adhere to their documentation
it's gonna do the things I want it to do.

62
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:59.735
Okay, so
we have to load some CSS to do it, and

63
00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:03.225
then we also are gonna need to load
some JavaScript here down at the bottom.

64
00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:09.315
So going back here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm

65
00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.347
going to grab here the one
that's just the top one.

66
00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:17.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again, we're gonna
grab the debugging version here.

67
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.695
So this one says Swiper 4.x.x,
not with the min and not with the esm.

68
00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:25.825
So, grab that top one.

69
00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:32.949
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then down at the bottom
of your body, we're gonna put that in

70
00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.240
there as well, and we also have to
change that to be 4.4.2, like that.

71
00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.185
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again,
we should be able to go in over here and

72
00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:50.707
say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see here,

73
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:56.139
if we paste this in here,
it's actually a lot of JavaScript,

74
00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.971
you can see a lot of JavaScript.

75
00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:06.958
So now, what's gonna be interesting,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where is,

76
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.082
what did I call this Swiper gallery?

77
00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.239
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna open this in gallery2.

78
00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:15.773
I'm gonna open that, Open.

79
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:20.655
So you shouldn't see anything, right, cuz
we haven't put anything into our HTML yet.

80
00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.875
But what's gonna be interesting,

81
00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:27.357
if I come in here to my console,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now I have this

82
00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:28.676
Swiper thing available.

83
00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:34.388
So now that's loading this new Swiper
object that's now globally available for

84
00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:36.076
me to mess around with.

85
00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:39.528
That's what these two things are doing.

86
00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:43.306
Swiper's the CSS that runs the gallery,
but this Swiper JS thing now

87
00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:47.034
makes this Swiper thing available so
that I can play around with it.

88
00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:49.408
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

89
00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:55.872
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
now I'm gonna come in here and

90
00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:58.880
I'm gonna write the HTML in
the way that the docs tell me to.

91
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.294
So just so you know, the way that
I did this, and the way that you

92
00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:06.367
will eventually have to do it, if you
go into Swiper and say, Get Started.

93
00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:12.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna give you
step by step documentation of,

94
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.057
do this to your code, do this to
your code, do this to your code.

95
00:06:17.057 --> 00:06:22.640
And it's gonna help you kind of go step
by step to get what they want you to do.

96
00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.217
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But we're gonna walk
through all that stuff together, so

97
00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:28.547
you can see what it's like.
