00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.417
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now that we have all
of our HTML kind of in place here,

2
00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.230
let's go write the JavaScript.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna create a new
JavaScript file, let's call it something,

4
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:13.444
gallery.js or something like that,
whatever you want to call it.

5
00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:17.918
And then the first thing we need to do
here at the bottom of the index.HTML,

6
00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:20.204
we're going to load the JavaScript.

7
00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:25.330
So we're gonna put script underneath,
inside of the body,

8
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.158
underneath the last HTML part, put script.

9
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:34.639
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Source
equals.slash gallery.

10
00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:38.655
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or
just gallery without it, either way.

11
00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:46.936
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now you
may ask the question,

12
00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:49.313
why am I putting this
the last thing on the page?

13
00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:52.582
Why don't we put it in the head or
anything like that?

14
00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:56.580
Well, the way that the browser works is,
it is going to download your HTML and

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.825
the browser gonna start reading it line
by line, and it's going to hit this link,

16
00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:03.614
it's going to pause doing
everything with the HTML.

17
00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:08.798
It's going to wait to download that CSS,
apply all that CSS.

18
00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:10.913
And then it will continue going down.

19
00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:12.854
In general, this is a good idea with CSS,

20
00:01:12.854 --> 00:01:15.080
because you want your
things to show up styled.

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.003
If I put this at the end of the document,

22
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:23.771
it's gonna show up all garbage looking,
and then it's gonna apply the CSS.

23
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.720
So it's good with CSS to put in the head.

24
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.858
However, when it rise to
this script tag right here,

25
00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.311
it's going to download the JavaScript.

26
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.272
Well, it's gonna pause the HTML,
parsing and applying,

27
00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:39.240
it's going to download the JavaScript,
it's going to parse the JavaScript,

28
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.567
and then it's gonna
execute the JavaScript.

29
00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.545
Might imagine,
that's a decently slow process.

30
00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:48.745
So you don't want to prevent the user
from seeing things on the page.

31
00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:51.854
So that's why we put it
all the way at the bottom.

32
00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:56.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another advantage of
putting it down here at the bottom.

33
00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:59.350
Let's say I just put it here,
for some dumb reason.

34
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.706
If inside of this gallery.js, I tried
to refer to this div, the class buttons

35
00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:09.980
right there, I would not be able to,
because this hasn't been created yet,

36
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.225
because this is being downloaded and
executed here, right?

37
00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:17.272
So that's why I have to put it down here,
so

38
00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:22.620
that way everything above is guaranteed
to exist by the time this gets run.

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.745
Make sense?

40
00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.457
So, that's a long explanation for.

41
00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:29.988
What I'm trying to tell you is,

42
00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:32.727
that always put your JavaScript
at the bottom, always.

43
00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:38.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
let's go to our gallery.js.

44
00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:42.652
So, what we wanna do is,
anytime someone clicks Next,

45
00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:47.530
we want to take away the active
class from this picture, and

46
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.940
we want to apply the active
class to the next picture.

47
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.810
So let's go ahead and go down here.

48
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.897
I'm gonna pull out the previous button, so

49
00:02:57.897 --> 00:03:03.973
const prev button equals documents,
that Elements by,

50
00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:09.939
let's do query selector,
query selector.prev, like that,

51
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.807
right, and would do the same thing for
next button.

52
00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:16.501
So next button.

53
00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:20.816
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just make this vtm,
because I'm lazy and

54
00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:22.708
I don't wanna type that much.

55
00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:23.652
Next.

56
00:03:26.177 --> 00:03:27.051
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

57
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.498
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're going
to add event listeners to this,

58
00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:42.278
we're going to prevBtn.addEventListener.

59
00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:44.723
On click.

60
00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:47.001
I'm gonna run some sort of function her,
right?

61
00:03:48.618 --> 00:03:50.834
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same
thing with next button.

62
00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:52.614
So let's just focus on next button first,
and

63
00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:54.267
then we'll come back to previous button.

64
00:03:55.476 --> 00:04:02.958
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So next button,
let's say, we'll come back to you.
