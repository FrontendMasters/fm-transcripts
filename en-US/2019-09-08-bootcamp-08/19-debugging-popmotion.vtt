00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.202
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk
about what I did then.

2
00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:05.175
Let's go to styles.css.

3
00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.208
The only thing I did here is on .brand,
right?

4
00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.845
There is z-index 10, right?

5
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:21.882
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, that .brand
corresponds to the h1 here, right?

6
00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:26.072
The h1 of class brand,
so not the main nav.

7
00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:30.424
That's important, but the brand
is the one that gets the z index.

8
00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:34.645
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it still goes behind.

9
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.241
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll try making it
a larger number, see what happens.

10
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:46.136
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What browser are you using?

11
00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:48.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Firefox.

12
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.421
I'll try it in Chrome.

13
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.928
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Of course, me in Chrome.

14
00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:57.519
Of course, I can't navigate the pictures.

15
00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] Getting
the important things, right?

16
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just lay there.

17
00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:09.867
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Look,
it does go behind in Chrome.

18
00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:13.945
So the moral of the story here is,
use Firefox?

19
00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a joke,

20
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.814
that's a joke.

21
00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:20.427
Cool, well,
then let's figure out why that's, now,

22
00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:23.454
it's just disappearing, that's fine.

23
00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:28.653
And it looks like it doesn't
like the cursor either, does it?

24
00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:33.263
So I think that, then, it would be
WebKit grab, and then, that way,

25
00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:36.170
you'll keep the cursor that way, as well.

26
00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:40.118
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If it changes.

27
00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:43.148
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this position's relative.

28
00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:48.509
If I get a z-index of zero,
let's see what happens with that.

29
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.281
Z-index one, zero.

30
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.747
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And let's try making this,

31
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:07.039
let's see it backs off.

32
00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:15.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go, okay.

33
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.133
So CSS strikes again.

34
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:22.470
My methodology was CSS's spray and
pray, or guess and

35
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.468
check, depending on how
you wanna think about it.

36
00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:31.797
So I think here,
if you come to the main nav, and

37
00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:37.774
I think if you give this a position
of relative, hopefully, no.

38
00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:43.821
And then, I think you have to
give that a z-index, as well.

39
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:45.032
See, index of, say five.

40
00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:48.588
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, okay.

41
00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:51.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
you did that on the main nav?

42
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.733
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: On the main nav.

43
00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:57.723
Let's go in and fix it for
everyone in our code.

44
00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.044
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you leave
the z-index on brand?

45
00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:04.613
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the z-index here is 10.

46
00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:07.463
So z-index is always a relative number.

47
00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:14.247
It's just checking to see if
this one's bigger than that one.

48
00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:17.691
It's not the z-index 1,000 is
any different from z-index 10,

49
00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:19.110
it's just a relative thing.

50
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.569
So hear in this a position
relative on main nav,

51
00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.802
and I'm gonna say z-index of five.

52
00:03:28.802 --> 00:03:34.257
So as front end developers, but
you are pretty much by now,

53
00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:37.979
all, you all are front end developers.

54
00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.169
This is a problem you're going to have for

55
00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.192
the rest of your life [LAUGH] of
this works in this browser this way.

56
00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.622
This works in this browser this other way,
and

57
00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:51.691
I have to make it look relatively
the same in both, right?

58
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:55.932
And it's just kind of the fact of
the matter that Firefox is a fundamentally

59
00:03:55.932 --> 00:04:00.373
different program than Chrome,
than is Edge, than is Internet Explorer 6,

60
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.355
is than everything else, right?

61
00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:06.135
And you have to make it work across all
of these kind of different programs, and

62
00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:07.177
it's hard, right?

63
00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:11.839
Some of these interact in different ways,
and some of these things interpret

64
00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.499
things different ways, and I don't know
who's right here, one of them that

65
00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:21.466
feels like it should be defined behavior,
and I don't know which one is correct.

66
00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:26.014
But in this case, if we do it this way,
both of them work the way we want to.

67
00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:28.771
Also, if you wanna make
grab work in Chrome,

68
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:34.009
you're gonna have to put cursor in here
twice, and put -webkit-grab, like that.

69
00:04:35.203 --> 00:04:37.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did Jen
talk about prefixing?

70
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.740
Vendor prefixes?

71
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.131
Okay, so
I don't wanna get too much into it,

72
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:47.612
cuz it's not really that much
an interesting of a subject.

73
00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:49.441
But sometimes, browsers will say,

74
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:52.514
I wanna preview this feature
before I release it to everyone.

75
00:04:52.514 --> 00:04:54.720
So I'm gonna release
it prefixed like this.

76
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.167
So this is for WebKit based browsers,
which Chrome used to be.

77
00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:02.071
It's not anymore, but they still use it.

78
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:07.244
WebKit is actually what Safari is
based on, if we wanna get technical.

79
00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:12.146
And if it's for Firefox,
it'll look like this -moz-grab.

80
00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:15.704
So now,
that we have both of these in there,

81
00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:20.421
Browsers that understand
-webkit-grab will use this,

82
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.864
and browsers that understand
grab will just use that.

83
00:05:24.864 --> 00:05:26.973
Did it?

84
00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:34.039
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mine did not,

85
00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.727
so that's why I put it in there.

86
00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:41.981
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, see here,
mine says, I don't know what that is.

87
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:43.529
So then, it looks like this.

88
00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.311
I think it's text.

89
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In any case,
if you put those in it, that's working for

90
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:51.537
everyone now, right?
