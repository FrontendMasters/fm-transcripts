00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.778
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about CSS?

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.263
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the difference
between background and background-color?

3
00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:07.787
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

4
00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:10.304
So background, if I do like this,
it's a shorthand,

5
00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:12.455
you can put a bunch of
stuff in the background.

6
00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In general, let's see if
it'll actually tell me, shorthand property

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.727
for, you can put background layers,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway,

8
00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.015
there's some documentation
there that I can read.

9
00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:31.094
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you can use that to
change the color or do some other stuff?

10
00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:31.665
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

11
00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.213
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But
background-color is just for the color?

12
00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:35.598
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Precisely, yeah.

13
00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:40.477
So the reason why I choose not
to do background, generally.

14
00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.196
One, I don't remember all of
the properties for it, and

15
00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:44.451
it's really easy, too.

16
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:49.553
So, if I did background like this and
then I try to do

17
00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:55.675
background,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Image, something like this.

18
00:00:59.169 --> 00:01:00.194
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or maybe like this.

19
00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:00.887
Yeah, like this.

20
00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:07.459
Then I put some sort of dot index,
like that.

21
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.520
So this is something totally
valid that you may wanna do which

22
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.050
is if you can load the image,
then load the image.

23
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.496
And if not, then show the color.

24
00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:18.441
However, if you do it like this,

25
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:23.382
because background also encompasses
background-image, you would override it.

26
00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:24.862
And it's not obvious.

27
00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:27.229
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because it
comes later in the CSS.

28
00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:27.732
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

29
00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:30.127
However, if you do
background-color like this,

30
00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.195
then what we were talking
about would work.

31
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:37.320
Or if I had it the other way, which was
this one comes last would work as well.

32
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.882
So that's why generally like not to do it,
but that's just a personal preference.

33
00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.303
Does that answer your question?

34
00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:43.881
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

35
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.574
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, yeah.

36
00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:50.936
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There is a question in chat
that's asking if the cursor: not-allowed,

37
00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:55.271
if it works on other things
besides a button, like a field.

38
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:56.583
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, works on anything.

39
00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.582
It's a good question.

40
00:01:58.582 --> 00:02:03.806
So for example,
if I wanted to, I don't know,

41
00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:08.785
you could do body, cursor: not-allowed.

42
00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:12.373
If you wanted to be a little
saucy to your users,

43
00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:17.694
you can't click any of this,
then you could on the other one, right?

44
00:02:17.694 --> 00:02:21.008
And now nothing looks clickable
on my particular page.

45
00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:27.654
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, works on anything.

46
00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:32.453
Something to keep in mind though is
we're in the sort of world now that

47
00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:37.022
a lot of people will be viewing
your website from mobile, right?

48
00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:39.370
And there's no hover events on a phone,
right?

49
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.200
You can't hover on your phone,
you can either tap or not tap.

50
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.064
So, when you do things like cursors and
things like that, it should be

51
00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:50.204
the sprinkling on top, it shouldn't
necessarily be the focus of your UI.

52
00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:53.249
So that's why it's good that we have,
if we come back here,

53
00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.497
both that it's grayed out and
there's not-allowed, right?

54
00:02:56.497 --> 00:02:59.182
You need it to also work on mobile.
