00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
we built an image gallery together.

2
00:00:04.313 --> 00:00:04.938
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this works.

3
00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.563
This is something you could
totally drop into your website.

4
00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:11.473
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's things that
you could do to make this better.

5
00:00:11.473 --> 00:00:16.710
For example, if you wanted to make an auto
advance, you definitely could do that.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.952
If you wanted to make it,
have different functionality,

7
00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.940
if you wanted to put the buttons
in different places.

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.830
All these things are definitely
possibilities that you can

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.990
run wild with your imagination with.

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.030
I saw one of the students here,
actually showing and

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.670
hiding entire dibs, rather than
just hiding just images, right?

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.095
So, your imagination is
kind of the limit here.

13
00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:42.700
[COUGH] There's nothing
special about showing and

14
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.350
hiding images that you can't do with
entire pieces of your DOM, right?

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.939
Or pieces of your application.
