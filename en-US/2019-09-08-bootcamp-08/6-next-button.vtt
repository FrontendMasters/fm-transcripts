00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How are we gonna do this,
right?

2
00:00:04.023 --> 00:00:07.709
We have, we know 12 images but we wanna
make this flexible enough that if I

3
00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.942
add more images, I don't have
to go re-write the code, right?

4
00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:14.431
That would be really nice if I
could subtract and add images.

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:19.338
So a really nice thing that we could do,
is we could go grab all the images out of

6
00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:22.521
the dom, and
then just work on that list, right?

7
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.231
In that way that number
would always be correct.

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.821
So why don't we do something like,

9
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:33.727
let's go grab all the image tags or
whatever, or

10
00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:39.522
gallery images, gallery,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:43.072
we're gonna do document.querySelectorAll.

12
00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:48.116
This one, so this one is our query
selector cuz we wanted one image, and

13
00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:52.927
this we wanna grab all of them,
so we're doing querySelectorAll.

14
00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:57.745
And we're do .gallery-image, right?

15
00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.206
Cuz that's the name of the CSS
class that we put on there.

16
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:12.506
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It is like you have a typo
in the there, galley instead of gallery.

17
00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.988
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, thank you.

18
00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:17.053
We could do pirate photos too.

19
00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:19.653
So, okay, so now what is gallery images?

20
00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:23.497
Gallery images is node list,

21
00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:28.424
a pseudo array of image text, right.

22
00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:34.015
So when someone clicks next
what do we have to do?

23
00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:39.536
We have to add a hide,
something to hide this current image and

24
00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.521
we have to unhide the next image.

25
00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:48.568
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it'd be really nice if
we had some sort of number keeping track

26
00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:49.866
of where we are in the list.

27
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.529
So let's go ahead and
add something like that too.

28
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:56.461
So, let currently selected equal zero,
right?

29
00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:01.540
Because right now the zero with
an element, the first element is selected.

30
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:07.375
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

31
00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:11.611
So the first thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna say gallery images,

32
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:14.969
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: At currently selected.

33
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.155
So if a user clicks a button first thing
we're gonna do is we're gonna hide

34
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.312
the current image.

35
00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:22.401
So that is going to be

36
00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:29.118
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .remove("active").

37
00:02:29.118 --> 00:02:36.267
Oop, sorry, .classList.remove,
.classList.remove("active").

38
00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.162
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So classList lets you add,
remove Class is really easily from

39
00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.862
an element, and here we're just
gonna remove the active element.

40
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.182
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact, if you want to,
you can refresh the page here.

41
00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:51.982
If I click next,

42
00:02:51.982 --> 00:02:56.113
the only thing that's gonna happen
is the image should disappear.

43
00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:58.037
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, good so far, right?

44
00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:00.397
About halfway there.

45
00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:05.995
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, the next thing you

46
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:10.344
wanna do is we wanna move currently select
cuz like the user, click next, right?

47
00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:13.632
So we wanna move so the currently
selected image is the next one.

48
00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:17.455
So we're gonna say currently selected,
plus plus.

49
00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:24.515
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
if you remember that is the same as,

50
00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:31.025
Currently selected equals
currently selected plus one.

51
00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:31.855
Same thing.

52
00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now if this was zero before,

53
00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.528
currently selected is now one, right?

54
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.957
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now we're gonna go to gallery,

55
00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:52.583
images [currentlySelected].classList.what.

56
00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.872
Exactly, add.

57
00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:57.440
All right, we're gonna add a class,
and we're gonna add active.

58
00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this might weird you out.

59
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.024
Line 11 here, I got currentlySelected.

60
00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:11.788
On line 13 I have currentlySelected.

61
00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:16.351
But remember between these two on line 12,
I'm incrementing it, so

62
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:18.109
the number changes there.

63
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.684
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if I refresh
over here and I click next,

64
00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:28.132
it is actually moving the image forward,
right?

65
00:04:28.132 --> 00:04:31.297
That's pretty cool, right?

66
00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:33.856
I think it's cool.

67
00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.302
You can disagree with me.

68
00:04:35.302 --> 00:04:38.236
You'd just be wrong.

69
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:42.511
Okay, so
let us tackle our next issue here.

70
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.435
If I click next,
previous should light up, right,

71
00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:48.765
because you should be able to
go back at that point, right.

72
00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:52.562
So, let's think about this for a second.

73
00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:53.803
If someone clicks next,

74
00:04:53.803 --> 00:04:57.653
wouldn't previous always be available
after someone clicks next, right?

75
00:04:57.653 --> 00:04:59.715
Because inherently, when you click next,

76
00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:03.068
that means there's always gonna be
something previous to it, right?

77
00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:04.559
So, if I go from zero to one,

78
00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.982
that inherently means I can go back
to zero because I was on zero and

79
00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:11.611
zero was a valid number, every time,
a hundred percent of the time.

80
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:14.025
That's unexceptionally true.

81
00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:19.278
So, what happens if

82
00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:24.222
I do something like

83
00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:32.261
prevBtn,disabled = false.

84
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:38.201
Now, you might be wondering,
it's like what happen if I'm on five and

85
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.174
it wasn't disabled to begin with.

86
00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.880
Well, this does no harm, right?

87
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.201
It doesn't do anything in that particular
case, that means it's totally fine to do.

88
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:52.312
You could do some sort of like false
check to say, if prevbutton.disabled,

89
00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:57.676
then do only do it in that particular
case, but it doesn't matter.

90
00:05:57.676 --> 00:05:59.677
So now hopefully if we click next,

91
00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:04.377
now you can see
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If I hit next,

92
00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:06.717
the button lights up now.
