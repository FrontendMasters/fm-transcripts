WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.893
Cuz, I wonder where is that
line of being authentic but

2
00:00:05.893 --> 00:00:08.967
staying positive, like for

3
00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:14.235
an engineer trying to
get the first-time role.

4
00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:20.123
Cuz to be honest, it is like all doom and
gloom, but nobody, you can only say it.

5
00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:23.064
Or hear it for so long before it's like,

6
00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:27.835
yeah, everybody knows that, and
it does suck, but okay [LAUGH].

7
00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:31.447
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah,
it's interesting you asked that because I

8
00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:37.302
definitely know what you're talking about,
especially in public platforms.

9
00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:41.201
When engineers feel really,
really frustrated, and

10
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.431
then it turns into anger
at their situation.

11
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:47.255
They talk about it with
that full anger and

12
00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:52.429
on public platforms like LinkedIn,
and it doesn't reflect well, right?

13
00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.463
It's really bad,
I do not suggest you do that [LAUGH].

14
00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:01.720
So, don't do that in public platforms but

15
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.522
I think being authentic doesn't
mean fully ranting about it.

16
00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:11.594
But you could see if someone
wanted to hear a bit more,

17
00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:16.555
I guess you could open up
if they're giving you clues

18
00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:20.636
that they do want to hear about it, right?

19
00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:21.317
Like how tough.

20
00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:24.040
&gt;&gt; Tom: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Is not an emotion,

21
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.370
[LAUGH] I'd love to
hear a little bit more.

22
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.082
So, I think you can wait for

23
00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:34.159
the other person's cues to see if they do
want to hear a little bit more about you.

24
00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.982
It's a two-way street, yeah.

25
00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:38.330
&gt;&gt; Tom: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: What do you think,

26
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.575
think about that?

27
00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:43.868
How was this exercise for you guys?

28
00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:46.034
I know it was a little hard.

29
00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:50.014
&gt;&gt; Tom: I enjoyed the communication
exercise more than I initially thought

30
00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:50.580
I would.

31
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.550
But now I'm thinking about
how I'll remember to try and

32
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.886
get to the emotions and try and get
the person to talk about their feelings.

33
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.987
When I'm in the moment and
in a conversation which is like all

34
00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:10.498
new habits that we try and pick up but
do you have any tips for that?

35
00:02:10.498 --> 00:02:11.145
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You got an acronym?

36
00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:11.992
&gt;&gt; Tom: [LAUGH].

37
00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:15.683
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I just remember
my glacier, [LAUGH], diagram just like

38
00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:21.061
emotions deep, but I think when you
feel like you've connected with someone,

39
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:24.915
and then you have a conversation
with somebody else, and

40
00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.910
it's all about what, what, what, what?

41
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.710
You'll feel it,
you can feel it, you're like,

42
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.522
I don't feel like I'm actually
getting to know this person [LAUGH].

43
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:39.433
Like I don't actually know who this person
is, and I think when you sense that inside

44
00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:44.293
of yourself, that's your clue to wait,
what was I am supposed to ask about again?

45
00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:47.865
Let me see if I can try to
deepen it a little bit.

46
00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:50.865
Just turn the conversation
a little deeper.

47
00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:55.469
&gt;&gt; Tom: And I guess when I'm in a
conversation where it's just, what, what,

48
00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.328
what, I run out of what's.

49
00:02:57.328 --> 00:02:58.325
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

50
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.696
&gt;&gt; Tom: Sometimes it's pretty quick,
you run on conversation just ends.

51
00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:06.409
But maybe if I can see that
as the opportunity to start

52
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.598
asking the why, and
then the feeling, yeah.

53
00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.828
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Going from wise to
emotions will help you a little bit, yeah.

54
00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:14.954
&gt;&gt; Tom: Yeah.

55
00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:17.385
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah, go ahead.

56
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:21.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have my own personal
anecdote when it comes to his question

57
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.560
about realism, or
pessimism versus optimism.

58
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.554
I feel I struggle with this all the time,
so what I end up doing is I go to what I'd

59
00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:35.971
say, like the pit of despair, which is the
worst possible thing that could happen.

60
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:41.542
And I just sit with that and what lessons
can I draw from that, what's the plan?

61
00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:45.410
If this horrible thing actually happened,
what would be the plan?

62
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.382
And somehow putting a plan in place helps
me then turn to the positive and say,

63
00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:53.747
okay, if I work really hard
day after day after day,

64
00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:56.748
then maybe these positive
things can happen.

65
00:03:56.748 --> 00:04:02.262
But they don't happen if I don't, but
somehow putting the plan in place for

66
00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:05.724
the negative side helps
me sort of ground that.

67
00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:09.793
Okay, I do have an option if
these bad things do happen,

68
00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:11.968
I do have things that I can do.

69
00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:16.203
And the reality is it never goes
usually to the worst-case scenario,

70
00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:18.212
but I think it's like stoicism or

71
00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:22.190
something, you have to be realistic
that bad things can happen.

72
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.484
And you have to plan for
them accordingly, but if they don't,

73
00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:30.048
obviously you can keep
going towards the positive,

74
00:04:30.048 --> 00:04:34.031
going towards the things that
could potentially happen.

75
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:38.948
If you work hard at it and I think those
positive things do end up happening,

76
00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:42.241
it just usually takes a lot
longer than you think.

77
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:46.705
And so, you do have to have a realistic
plan in place to keep working

78
00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:48.800
towards those bigger things.

79
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.731
So, I don't know if that helps at all,
but you're sitting with the bad thing,

80
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:55.216
drawing a plan, okay?

81
00:04:55.216 --> 00:05:01.763
But then pursuing the positive things
day to day, you're not dwelling on or

82
00:05:01.763 --> 00:05:06.378
not worried about it every
single night going to bed.

83
00:05:06.378 --> 00:05:08.496
That makes sense, I don't know.

84
00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:13.670
&gt;&gt; Tom: And speaking on that I can
relate to sometimes I'm just instantly

85
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.705
honest with people, and so sometimes
people will just ask how's it going.

86
00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:25.192
And sometimes I might just
offer something that's

87
00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:29.920
very real and they weren't ready for that.

88
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.248
So, I'm trying to suss that out
now because I wanna be genuine and

89
00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:37.094
sometimes I'm going through a hard time.

90
00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:41.477
But sometimes people, they aren't
interested, they just want to hear, good,

91
00:05:41.477 --> 00:05:44.073
and it's just kind of a cordial,
friendly thing.

92
00:05:44.073 --> 00:05:47.197
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Well, then you'll
know now that you're like, well,

93
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:48.799
not with this person [LAUGH].

94
00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:49.742
&gt;&gt; Tom: Yeah [LAUGH].

95
00:05:49.742 --> 00:05:50.506
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They learn their lesson.

96
00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:54.255
&gt;&gt; Tom: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So, we covered a lot

97
00:05:54.255 --> 00:06:00.623
today, so we're gonna wrap up and
reflect on the key takeaways overall.

98
00:06:00.623 --> 00:06:05.220
We started by discussing how to prepare
effectively as software engineers,

99
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.334
from delivering quickly writing
maintainable code and using test.

100
00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:14.982
We also touched on handling task execution
problems and preparing for promotions.

101
00:06:14.982 --> 00:06:20.007
But hopefully, you saw that preparational
loan is not enough, we also talked about

102
00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:25.276
seizing opportunities to accelerate your
growth by building relationships of trust.

103
00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:30.602
By caring about others and
understanding how your work impacts them,

104
00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:33.589
you become a more effective engineer.

105
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.170
So, as we conclude today, remember,

106
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.262
combining thorough preparation with
intentional relationship building,

107
00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:44.800
with all of this,
you can now truly own your success.

108
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.881
It's not just about the technical
skills as a software engineer.

109
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:53.412
Adding empathy and
care really makes us truly impactful and

110
00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:56.319
successful as software developers.

111
00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.134
Thank you for going on this journey
with me, it's been a pleasure.

112
00:07:02.134 --> 00:07:05.737
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
