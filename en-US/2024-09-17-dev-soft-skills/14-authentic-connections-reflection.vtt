00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.455
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: You guys are
actually pretty good at this, I gotta say.

2
00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:05.625
[LAUGH] I've done this
exercise a few times, and

3
00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:11.100
sometimes it takes a little bit more
prodding, but yeah, you guys are great.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.110
So I will wrap up this exercise.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.083
Hopefully, if we did this right, [LAUGH]
we were all starting to form at least

6
00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:24.744
a bit of a connection to each other,
maybe not like we're friends, but

7
00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:28.986
like you could feel we saw each
other as more of humans, right?

8
00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:31.501
So some takeaways here, hopefully,

9
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.048
was a little more clear
once you've experienced it.

10
00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:40.113
But when we share something and
feel the other person's genuine desire,

11
00:00:40.113 --> 00:00:45.762
to hear and understand us, that is what
starts fostering the seat of connection.

12
00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:52.591
Trying to move conversations to why, and
most importantly, the emotions generates,

13
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:57.332
the most connection-filled conversations
and relationship building.

14
00:00:57.332 --> 00:00:59.578
So what is great for
information gathering, but

15
00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:02.386
it's not great when you're
trying to get to know somebody.

16
00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.985
To be authentic is to be vulnerable, so

17
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:10.206
people will only share
if it's a safe space.

18
00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:15.033
You gotta create it by you gotta filter
out all of your negative emotions and

19
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.107
just focus on the other person.

20
00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:21.795
And remember that the act of listening
techniques is used to tell the other

21
00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:23.986
person that we do want to hear you,

22
00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:28.694
we want to understand you, and
we're providing you more space to share.

23
00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.321
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: And
the last takeaway here is just authentic

24
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:39.013
connections with others create lasting
positive impressions and opens doors for

25
00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:40.245
new opportunities.

26
00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:43.069
So if you forgot, why are we doing
authentic [LAUGH] connections?

27
00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.397
This is why [LAUGH],
this is meant to help you actually be able

28
00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:54.047
to show up better in the relationships
that you want to create,

29
00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.688
which will then lead to opportunities.
