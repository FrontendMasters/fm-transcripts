>> Francesca Sadikin: You guys are actually pretty good at this, I gotta say. [LAUGH] I've done this exercise a few times, and sometimes it takes a little bit more prodding, but yeah, you guys are great. So I will wrap up this exercise. Hopefully, if we did this right, [LAUGH] we were all starting to form at least a bit of a connection to each other, maybe not like we're friends, but like you could feel we saw each other as more of humans, right?

[00:00:28]
So some takeaways here, hopefully, was a little more clear once you've experienced it. But when we share something and feel the other person's genuine desire, to hear and understand us, that is what starts fostering the seat of connection. Trying to move conversations to why, and most importantly, the emotions generates, the most connection-filled conversations and relationship building.

[00:00:57]
So what is great for information gathering, but it's not great when you're trying to get to know somebody. To be authentic is to be vulnerable, so people will only share if it's a safe space. You gotta create it by you gotta filter out all of your negative emotions and just focus on the other person.

[00:01:17]
And remember that the act of listening techniques is used to tell the other person that we do want to hear you, we want to understand you, and we're providing you more space to share.
>> Francesca Sadikin: And the last takeaway here is just authentic connections with others create lasting positive impressions and opens doors for new opportunities.

[00:01:40]
So if you forgot, why are we doing authentic [LAUGH] connections? This is why [LAUGH], this is meant to help you actually be able to show up better in the relationships that you want to create, which will then lead to opportunities.
