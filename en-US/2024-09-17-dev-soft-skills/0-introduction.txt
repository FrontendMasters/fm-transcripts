>> Francesca Sadikin: Hello everyone? And welcome to today's workshop on achieving success as a software developer. I'm Francesca Sadikin, and I'm thrilled to have you all here. Just a bit about myself, I'm a self-taught engineer and I've had the incredible opportunity to grow my career to the point where I'm now a senior engineer at Netflix.

This course is the designed for anybody interested in understanding what it takes to succeed in the software engineering field beyond just technical skills. Whether you're a budding developer or a seasoned engineer, this workshop has something valuable for you. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with some superstar engineers and I've learned a lot from their habits, techniques, and mindsets.

Today I'm excited to share with you my observations and tips that have not only helped me in my journey, that can hopefully help you excel in your own careers too. So I'm gonna start with a quote that has guided me throughout my career. Luck is when opportunity meets preparation.

So we're gonna break this course down into two parts. First, talking all about preparation, how we can equip ourselves to not just meet expectations but to exceed them. This is going to be more than just technical skills, which we will still cover, but it's also about the mindset and soft skills that will set you up for long term success.

Then we're gonna go into opportunities. We'll explore why opportunities are critical for growth and how to create and seize opportunities that can accelerate your career.
