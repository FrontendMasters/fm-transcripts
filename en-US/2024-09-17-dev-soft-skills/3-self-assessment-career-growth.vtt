00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.128
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: All right,
Feedback Loops.

2
00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.061
To ensure you're still growing,

3
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:08.669
it is important to create feedback
loops from those around you.

4
00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.293
You cannot rely on your manager, like
waiting to see if your manager just gives

5
00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:16.446
you feedback every so often,
because sometimes your

6
00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:20.528
managers are not people managers
who are trained in growing people.

7
00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:22.447
And other times they're just busy, right?

8
00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:26.039
Sometimes you're gonna
have to just ask for this.

9
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.426
You want to be aiming for weekly or
bi-weekly, so every two weeks,

10
00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:36.451
feedback sessions, and
you're aiming for timely feedback.

11
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:39.131
So that you can address it early and

12
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:45.059
often preventing these issues from
snowballing into really big problems.

13
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.773
I find that just asking your manager,
how am I doing?

14
00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:51.557
Do you have feedback
from me is not helpful?

15
00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:54.415
They have a very hard time answering that.

16
00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:58.732
So I recommend asking
very specific questions.

17
00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:03.474
For example, is there something I
could have done for this task better?

18
00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:07.936
What areas do you think I
could have improved upon?

19
00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:12.876
When you're thinking about trying
to go for promotions and stuff,

20
00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:16.083
you can ask,
do you have any suggestions for

21
00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:20.174
how I can take on more responsibility or
expand my role?

22
00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:23.184
What goals or objectives should I
focus on in the upcoming months?

23
00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:27.428
This is just to see what
do they expect from you?

24
00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:31.805
What would exceeding
expectations look like for them?

25
00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.315
How do you gain visibility into my work?

26
00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:38.973
So this one's really, really important
because you want to know how your manager

27
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.147
is keeping track-of on you, right?

28
00:01:41.147 --> 00:01:45.127
Are they just using what you're
saying to validate your work?

29
00:01:45.127 --> 00:01:47.622
Are they hearing it from another engineer?

30
00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:51.568
Or is it through the review cycles?

31
00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:56.082
You wanna know so that you are making
sure that the correct feedback about what

32
00:01:56.082 --> 00:02:00.538
you're doing and its impacts is actually
being delivered to your manager.

33
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.714
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Asking for Help.

34
00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:11.180
So very common struggle for engineers
is how to ask questions and ask for

35
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.134
help without looking like you
don't know what you're doing.

36
00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:19.635
So this is a little bit of trying to
make sure we don't trigger our imposter

37
00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:20.371
syndrome.

38
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:26.791
So I have a few tips including,
Timeboxing.

39
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:32.899
So this just means you you go into
an agreement with your manager

40
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:38.325
about how long is it okay for
you to be stuck on a problem?

41
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:43.098
Maybe that's one hour, two hours,
three hours or something like that, and

42
00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:48.167
then after which your managers like I do
not want you to keep spinning by yourself,

43
00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.901
I give you permission to go and
ask for help.

44
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:55.219
I want you to figure this out
through help of someone else.

45
00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.321
So it's nice to have that in your mind so

46
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:03.779
you don't feel like there's this
other barrier to asking for help.

47
00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.321
When you go to this other engineer for

48
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.422
help, it's really important
to show your due diligence.

49
00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:15.169
So I'm assuming everybody has
actually tried different things, and

50
00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.646
you don't want to go to this engineer and
just say, I need help, and that's it.

51
00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:24.371
That kind of creates this narrative
like did you not do anything?

52
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.320
What did you do?

53
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.077
Right, so you wanna go to them and
say like hey, I tried this,

54
00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:30.608
which resulted to this.

55
00:03:30.608 --> 00:03:34.152
Here are the other things I tried,
and then this is what happened.

56
00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:37.026
Now this is my hypothesis.

57
00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:38.475
But I ran out of time.

58
00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:40.111
What do you think about that?

59
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:43.254
And now this becomes
a collaborative investigation

60
00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:47.906
with this other engineer where you guys
can figure out the problem together.

61
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.268
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: When you finally get
some sort of solution or the next step,

62
00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:59.900
I also find it really important
to clarify your assumptions.

63
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.021
I think a lot of engineers,
sometimes they made assumptions about what

64
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:10.925
was actually happening, and they actually
really didn't understand it at all.

65
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:14.274
And so by restating what you
think the problem was and

66
00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:17.854
what you're supposed to do
next to the other engineer,

67
00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:23.109
if you had made an incorrect assumption,
they can immediately figure that out and

68
00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:27.097
then tell you, and
then steer you back onto the right course.

69
00:04:27.097 --> 00:04:30.965
So, this is just important to make sure
you're not rabbit holing in the wrong

70
00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:31.629
direction.

71
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.950
And then lastly, just express gratitude,
thank this engineer.

72
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.997
Hopefully this is a new working
relationship that you're gonna always

73
00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:46.551
be building now, and so
just expressing things goes a long way.
