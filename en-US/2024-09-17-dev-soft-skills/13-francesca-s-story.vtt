1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.563
So my journey into tech,
I used to be an architect and

2
00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:07.209
then I was a software engineer.

3
00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.380
I work at Netflix now and
I do courses on the side.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.755
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: What got you
into tech from architecture?

5
00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:19.870
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes,
why did I leave architecture?

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.302
So, I didn't realize how
little money architects made.

7
00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:27.527
And so when I was trying to
live in LA on $33,000 a year,

8
00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.289
I was like,
this is very hard to live here.

9
00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.483
And so my husband, at the time,
was like, if you want money,

10
00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:40.667
software engineering is a great
opportunity for that, even if you hate it.

11
00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.707
You'll make a lot more than
what you're making now.

12
00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:47.566
And so I was like, well, let me try it.

13
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:53.387
And thankfully, I did because I always
thought that architecture was my passion.

14
00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:59.136
I realized I just liked architecture,
I actually have a passion for coding.

15
00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:04.012
It is so much more funner, yes.

16
00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:08.472
So for money initially, but
now it's passion, [LAUGH].

17
00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.419
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Can you tell
me more about that passion?

18
00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:14.266
What first made you realize
that you'd found it?

19
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:18.577
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So, I was learning
through FreeCodeCamp, where you start out

20
00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:24.364
with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, so a bunch of
the front end web stuff, design stuff.

21
00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:30.052
And that was the most fun thing, was that
as an architect, you can design something,

22
00:01:30.052 --> 00:01:35.273
five years later it'll be done and
you'll realize that that was a bad design.

23
00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:39.685
[LAUGH] But in software,
you build it and it's instantaneous.

24
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:45.064
You have such a quick feedback loop to,
one, improve your design and

25
00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:50.183
now with the ability to think of
anything I want and then build it.

26
00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:53.531
I was like, my god, so powerful.

27
00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:58.122
I can build anything I want and
that feeling is exactly why I like it,

28
00:01:58.122 --> 00:01:59.881
it's the freedom.

29
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:03.095
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 1: What was like
the moment when you realized, okay,

30
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:04.003
I can do this.

31
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.027
And how did that feel?

32
00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:09.099
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: The day I decided to
quit my job as an architect was when I was

33
00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.750
just like, I actually really,
really enjoy it.

34
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.687
And so
I didn't have any particular skills.

35
00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:17.606
But the fact that I just loved coding and

36
00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:21.498
did all my free code exercise
in all times of the day,

37
00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:27.534
I think that was enough an indicator to
me that I'm like, forget architecture.

38
00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:30.714
Software is where it's at now.

39
00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:34.686
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: How did you get
exposure into the tech community

40
00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:36.600
being self-taught?

41
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.627
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I
joined a lot of meetups and

42
00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:46.760
joined online communities like Chingu.

43
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.236
It's a free service that's somewhat
chaotic, but it [LAUGH] sorts

44
00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:59.677
students all over the world into groups
of four to build projects in eight weeks.

45
00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:02.558
And so, that was my community for
a long time.

46
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.556
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Can you
elaborate on what made it chaotic?

47
00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:08.860
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Because it's free,
a lot of people join, but

48
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.625
they don't get to the finish line.

49
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.908
And so you might be left with
the whole project to build an eight

50
00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:15.990
weeks by yourself.

51
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.114
[LAUGH] I found that happening a lot,
but it was still very valuable.

52
00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:27.075
You said you got into tech
through starting on FreeCodeCamp.

53
00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:32.574
&gt;&gt; Mark: What other resources or
things did you do to continue to learn?

54
00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:37.478
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes,
so I did FreeCodeCamp.

55
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:40.459
That's where I found in
the forums about Chingu.

56
00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.264
And I spent a few iterations
building voyages.

57
00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:48.505
That's what they're called in Chingu, to
the point where the admin team was like,

58
00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:50.619
you're around all the time.

59
00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:52.815
Maybe you wanna join the admin team.

60
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:56.469
And so that educational platform I was
talking about before, that's Chingu.

61
00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:02.905
And so I was brought on to build for
all of their students.

62
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:08.400
And so that nine month time frame, which
unfortunately had no users at the end,

63
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.433
but I learned a lot [LAUGH]
because these are real projects.

64
00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:18.451
They weren't tutorials, but
they were real things, it was very custom.

65
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:23.291
And so spending that nine months
building with the team helped

66
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:28.305
me gather tons of experience and
really hone my skills.

67
00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:33.730
Even though it was not great quality code,
it looked great and it worked.

68
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.835
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: How did you feel
when you were left holding the bag?

69
00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:42.838
So to speak,
when people would fall away and

70
00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:45.768
you are the one left
to finish the project.

71
00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:46.986
How did that make you feel?

72
00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:50.688
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So definitely
a little frustrated that I was just like,

73
00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:51.563
it's okay.

74
00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:54.511
This is important and
it's gonna look great on my portfolio, so

75
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:55.663
I'm gonna finish this.

76
00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:56.776
I'm gonna learn a lot.

77
00:04:58.236 --> 00:05:02.987
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Sure, and then when
you spent the nine months building that

78
00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:05.278
feature and nobody used it.

79
00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:07.027
How did you feel at that point?

80
00:05:07.027 --> 00:05:09.687
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Definitely
embarrassed, where I was like,

81
00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:11.230
I'm a goddamn designer.

82
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.170
I should have known this,
[LAUGH] how can I not have seen this?

83
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.543
And just so, it's like I learned a lesson.

84
00:05:20.543 --> 00:05:24.432
That was a very painful lesson that
I will always remember now, right?

85
00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:28.922
I'm like, yeah, forgot the users,
that's important.

86
00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:31.375
Go ahead.

87
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:37.332
&gt;&gt; Mark: How did you feel when you applied
for Netflix and eventually got the job?

88
00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:39.841
What was that process like?

89
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:41.667
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So
I didn't apply for the job,

90
00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.012
their recruiter actually found me.

91
00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:48.385
And I was very surprised because I
had heard that Netflix only hires

92
00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:50.816
extremely experienced engineers.

93
00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:56.032
And so, I wasn't expecting anything
because I was very early on in my career.

94
00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:58.993
And so they reached out for interviews.

95
00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:03.142
I was like, cool, probably not gonna get
it, just gonna try it anyways though and

96
00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:05.519
I'm sure I'll learn something.

97
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.904
And I just got through every
single interview thinking,

98
00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:12.196
probably not gonna get that.

99
00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.329
It's probably wasn't great.

100
00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.826
And then I just kept getting the next
interview I did that all the way up to

101
00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:19.465
the call with HR when they
actually gave me the offer.

102
00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:22.441
I was still like,
probably not gonna get it.

103
00:06:22.441 --> 00:06:27.917
And yeah, just shocked that, I was,
well, [LAUGH] I actually got the job.

104
00:06:27.917 --> 00:06:29.321
Just very surprising.

105
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:34.812
But I was like, wow, I'm really glad
that I constantly update my LinkedIn,

106
00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:37.594
cuz that's how they found me
[LAUGH] was through LinkedIn.

107
00:06:37.594 --> 00:06:43.198
Yes, I feel like there is, cuz I give
this introduction a lot for myself.

108
00:06:43.198 --> 00:06:46.957
I know the details I usually [LAUGH] tell,
but

109
00:06:46.957 --> 00:06:52.557
there's a huge chunk right there
in the middle about something.

110
00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:55.740
[LAUGH] That something is it's like,
go ahead.

111
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.240
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: Do you think
there is an advantage to you being

112
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.090
aloof during that process?

113
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.283
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Doing aloof, I think
it was more like it's not aloof, but

114
00:07:07.283 --> 00:07:09.862
just setting my expectations low.

115
00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.083
That's just how we were raised.

116
00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:15.104
We're like, try very hard, but
expect nothing, [LAUGH] just so

117
00:07:15.104 --> 00:07:18.682
that we don't feel the bitter
sense of disappointment.

118
00:07:18.682 --> 00:07:22.839
Yes, so there's, yep, go ahead, Mark.

119
00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:26.437
&gt;&gt; Mark: This one online said,
I find myself alone building projects.

120
00:07:26.437 --> 00:07:30.387
I don't mind it, but is there
a community where I should join and

121
00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:32.594
build projects collaboratively?

122
00:07:32.594 --> 00:07:36.954
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah, so Chingu
is one, again, remember, it is chaotic.

123
00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:41.964
[LAUGH] But, the other ones,
I think they're still around.

124
00:07:41.964 --> 00:07:46.534
It's been a few years, but there's this
organization called Code for America.

125
00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:50.317
They have numerous chapters
across the country, and so

126
00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:52.176
at least the way it is in LA.

127
00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:57.411
It's some sort of like regular
meetup where representatives from

128
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:03.437
the local government will come with
an actual real request for a project.

129
00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:08.184
And then these groups of engineers,
designers, and project managers will

130
00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:12.572
actually form together to solve
that problem with that stakeholder.

131
00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:18.194
And so, you're actually working in a real
team, you're working on a real project,

132
00:08:18.194 --> 00:08:22.495
and you are gaining tons of
experience this way as well.

133
00:08:22.495 --> 00:08:24.144
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: And
hopefully helping your [CROSSTALK]

134
00:08:24.144 --> 00:08:25.028
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: And you're helping,

135
00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:27.455
[LAUGH] yeah, you're helping society.

136
00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:30.762
So does anyone want to ask me about
how I got my [LAUGH] first job?

137
00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:32.335
What that was like?

138
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:33.907
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: How did you
get your [LAUGH] first job?

139
00:08:33.907 --> 00:08:34.975
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: [LAUGH] Yes.

140
00:08:34.975 --> 00:08:39.899
Yeah, so that's actually, like,
that's actually the bulk of what I

141
00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:43.224
remember in my career is because it was so
hard.

142
00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:47.597
[LAUGH] I spent a year and
nine months trying to get a job, and

143
00:08:47.597 --> 00:08:52.876
during that time period I was doing
everything that was recommended.

144
00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:56.022
I was working on my skills,
I built portfolios,

145
00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:59.874
I went to the hackathons,
I went to the networking events.

146
00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:05.501
I did my resume a bajillion times and
everyone I was speaking with was like,

147
00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:10.877
I'm not sure why you don't get any
calls back, because it seems fine.

148
00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:13.446
But I literally got nothing,

149
00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:18.674
not even a rejection email for
a year and nine months.

150
00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:23.637
And if you ask me how I felt about it,
[LAUGH] I've never

151
00:09:23.637 --> 00:09:28.286
been someone who was
depressed before in my life.

152
00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:34.187
But I think during that time period
was the closest I felt depressed and

153
00:09:34.187 --> 00:09:39.087
despair, because it's like
that feeling where you try so

154
00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:43.103
hard, but
you have no results from it, right?

155
00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:49.671
See, I tear up just a little bit thinking
about it because it was such a hard time.

156
00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:53.775
And so, yeah, and then just right
as I was about [LAUGH] to quit,

157
00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:56.033
I was just like, I'm a designer.

158
00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.277
Why am I trying to be [LAUGH] an engineer?

159
00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:04.447
That was when that first interview
request came in from 8 Flight.

160
00:10:04.447 --> 00:10:10.660
And so this is my takeaway for a lot
of engineers when they're starting off,

161
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.706
is that, how hard it took for
you to get your first job doesn't

162
00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:20.296
reflect the potential you
have as an engineer, right?

163
00:10:20.296 --> 00:10:24.064
Cuz it's very hard and
you just need that one opportunity.

164
00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:27.325
And sometimes it just takes time, right?

165
00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:31.604
And so, I think the goal, especially for
folks getting their first job,

166
00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:35.343
is trying to figure out how to
give yourself enough of that time.

167
00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:39.931
And maybe cushion your finances a little
bit so you can wait that amount of time

168
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.119
while you're still preparing for
the opportunity.

169
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:49.485
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: There's a bulk
of it right there, right [LAUGH]?

170
00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:50.894
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: I was waiting for
the word tough.

171
00:10:50.894 --> 00:10:57.008
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes, tough
[LAUGH] despair is how I felt, [LAUGH].

172
00:10:57.008 --> 00:10:58.150
Yes.

173
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.775
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 2: If I may ask,
what help you keep the confidence and

174
00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:06.378
the morale up during that time.

175
00:11:06.378 --> 00:11:07.127
And also,

176
00:11:07.127 --> 00:11:12.296
were you working on your skills at
the same time while looking [CROSSTALK].

177
00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:13.592
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah definitely,

178
00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:17.239
I was coding every day you
know with Chingu and stuff.

179
00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:22.034
Right as I got that job, that's when I
was like, goodbye, Chingu, thank you.

180
00:11:22.034 --> 00:11:26.459
But how to keep morale up.

181
00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:31.455
I think part of it that helped me from
getting too upset was because I had

182
00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:36.204
this project with Chingu where
there were other people,.

183
00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:41.275
I was really learning a lot and
I get felt like I was a part of a team.

184
00:11:41.275 --> 00:11:44.014
We were a team, and
we were building towards something.

185
00:11:44.014 --> 00:11:50.887
And so, having that to focus
on helped me not feel so bad.

186
00:11:50.887 --> 00:11:54.341
[LAUGH] Because I think when
you don't have that, and

187
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:59.379
you're just applying every day and
then getting that constant objection.

188
00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:03.224
You don't feel the little wins and
it's easy to get very,

189
00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:06.876
very depressed and
angry about your situation.

190
00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:12.806
So I think trying to find situations where
you can work in groups towards a common

191
00:12:12.806 --> 00:12:18.397
goal, and that's still benefiting
your skills, I think that will help.

192
00:12:18.397 --> 00:12:21.912
&gt;&gt; Mark: How difficult was your
first year as a software developer,

193
00:12:21.912 --> 00:12:24.752
once you started your first role?

194
00:12:24.752 --> 00:12:29.848
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Once I started my
role, so after the apprenticeship or?

195
00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:32.551
&gt;&gt; Mark: Your first year
as a software developer.

196
00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:35.094
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So
the first year as a professional,

197
00:12:35.094 --> 00:12:40.262
paid [LAUGH] software developer was at
8 Flight, where the first six months

198
00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:45.591
was actually an apprenticeship, and
so they paid us to learn actually.

199
00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:50.649
And I mean tons of imposter syndrome,
even now tons of imposter syndrome,

200
00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:55.549
I am constantly working with amazing
engineers, and I'm always like,

201
00:12:55.549 --> 00:12:57.821
I don't know if I should be here.

202
00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:03.273
I'm not sure if I'm as as good as
you guys, but yeah, just feeling,

203
00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:07.540
I'm like,
I can't lose this opportunity, [LAUGH].

204
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:13.005
I Just working really, really hard, and
it was actually like, I just worked so

205
00:13:13.005 --> 00:13:17.915
hard, and I didn't talk to anybody
as that actually was a mistake too.

206
00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:19.722
That I worked so hard always.

207
00:13:19.722 --> 00:13:24.317
I never had lunch with anyone,
even though everyone always invited me.

208
00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:28.773
Never did any of that and
just kept my head down.

209
00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.618
And I guess it was okay, but

210
00:13:30.618 --> 00:13:35.848
I think I could have done more if I had
actually just branched out a little bit.

211
00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:40.375
But yeah, the first year, learned a lot,
but also massive imposter syndrome,

212
00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:44.002
just afraid that I was gonna
get fired the entire time.

213
00:13:44.002 --> 00:13:46.351
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Do you feel heard and
understood?

214
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:46.972
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I do.

215
00:13:48.132 --> 00:13:55.162
Yeah, when people feel deeper emotions,
when they share it.

216
00:13:55.162 --> 00:13:56.752
I think you can't help but

217
00:13:56.752 --> 00:14:01.312
feel connections when people don't
reject you for that emotion, right?

218
00:14:01.312 --> 00:14:02.761
They're like, yeah, I relate.

219
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:06.082
And I'm like, yeah, same, right?

220
00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:09.680
Was it helpful to do aversion
with me before we go?

221
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.284
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, when your
eyes welled up a little bit, so did mine,

222
00:14:14.284 --> 00:14:16.912
so, cuz I relate to that emotion.

223
00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:19.377
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah, yes.

224
00:14:19.377 --> 00:14:24.304
And that's where connection is formed
is to feel that common experience with

225
00:14:24.304 --> 00:14:26.133
common feelings together.
