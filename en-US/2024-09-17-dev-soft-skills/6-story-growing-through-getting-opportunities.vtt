1
00:00:00.061 --> 00:00:01.937
Another story, right?

2
00:00:01.937 --> 00:00:04.985
The accumulation of opportunities
lead to massive growth.

3
00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:10.218
This is something that I
have experienced in my own.

4
00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:12.991
So, contrasting John's experience,

5
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.641
I found that trust-building
unlocked countless opportunities,

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.972
which led to what I perceive to
be massive career growth for me.

7
00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:24.724
So fresh out of my apprenticeship,

8
00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:28.866
I was assigned to a really
difficult client project.

9
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:33.262
This client was demanding,
the requirements were huge in scope,

10
00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.353
the deadlines were extremely tight and
it could not be moved.

11
00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:41.485
And my manager made it clear that she
didn't believe that I had the skills to be

12
00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:42.194
on the team.

13
00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:46.120
She actually singled me out and
had me tested, and

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.310
let me know she didn't really trust me.

15
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.862
So this could have easily
gone very badly for me, but

16
00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:58.052
instead of getting upset, I just focused
on delivering high quality work.

17
00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:00.618
And as recommended by my mentors,

18
00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:06.200
still try to build strong relationships
with my manager and my teammates.

19
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.277
And this approach transformed
this potentially tough engagement

20
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:14.582
into a success story, and
I eventually did earn my manager's trust.

21
00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:21.298
So one specific example stands out in
how I tried to build relationships.

22
00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:25.710
So I needed to work with another engineer,
let's call him Bob,

23
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.305
on something that was
totally blocking my project,

24
00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.657
I really needed his part because
my project could not proceed.

25
00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:36.760
But he was struggling
to get his part done.

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.519
Instead of getting frustrated and
angry that he wasn't doing the task,

27
00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:46.605
I had a conversation with Bob instead to
understand what was going on for him.

28
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:51.329
And he explained that he did understand
that this task was really important to me.

29
00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.846
He did want to help, but he just could not
help me in the timeframe I was looking for

30
00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:00.600
because he had a bunch of other
things that he had to do.

31
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.645
So hearing this, I spoke with his manager,
not to complain, but

32
00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:11.270
to see if there was any wiggle room
in my task being prioritized instead.

33
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.759
And that approach worked, my task got
prioritized, my project moved forward,

34
00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.467
and I maintained a great
relationship with Bob,

35
00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:22.310
which was important [LAUGH] cuz I
needed to continue working with him.

36
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.986
And this wasn't an isolated incident,

37
00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:28.683
I applied the same principle
in all of my interactions,

38
00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:33.890
essentially always looking for
win-win scenarios for everybody involved.

39
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.522
So even though, of course,
I did run into problems,

40
00:02:37.522 --> 00:02:42.531
I ran into blockers, the help I received
from these strong relationships

41
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:46.840
allowed me to consistently
deliver outstanding work on time.

42
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.930
All of which eventually
earned my manager's trust.

43
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.128
And this initial success was crucial for
my career,

44
00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:56.388
though I didn't know it at the time.

45
00:02:56.388 --> 00:03:00.402
By turning a difficult situation
into a positive outcome,

46
00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:05.391
I began to get assigned to more projects
when went back to my home company.

47
00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:08.888
And I maintained the same
approach on those projects,

48
00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:12.926
deliver excellent work while
fostering good relationships.

49
00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.737
That looks like, clear communication,

50
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:21.280
supporting teammates whenever I could,
looking for those win-win scenarios,

51
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.070
helping B me execute projects
successfully each time.

52
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.230
So each project became an opportunity for

53
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.935
growth of my technical skills and
larger responsibilities.

54
00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:38.461
And then successfully completing those
projects then strengthened my reputation,

55
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:41.770
leading to even more
opportunities coming my way.

56
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.177
And so this continuous cycle
of trust then opportunities

57
00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:50.398
allowed me to accumulate a huge
amount of new skills and

58
00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:53.812
experiences in a very
short amount of time.

59
00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:58.612
So when I hit that one year mark
at this company, I was like,

60
00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:01.694
I'm gonna go for a senior promotion.

61
00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:05.381
It's probably unlikely, because
I've only been here for a year, but

62
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.619
I'm just gonna try it.

63
00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:11.530
And to my surprise,
I had all of these colleagues,

64
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.025
ex-managers who eagerly supported and
vouched for me.

65
00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:21.963
And with their support and
the experiences that I had gathered to

66
00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:27.188
prove that I could perform at
the next level, I got that promotion.

67
00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:31.842
And the trusts and the relationships I
built continued to open doors for me.

68
00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:35.794
Opportunities kept coming and
I found myself on a fast track,

69
00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:39.214
continuously growing and
taking on new challenges.

70
00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:44.076
So ironically, while I didn't believe
in the importance of relationships,

71
00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:48.289
they turned out to be the very thing
that helped me grow the fastest.

72
00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.119
So this approach is something
that you can use too.

73
00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:58.121
But intentionally focusing on building
trust, you can rapidly grow your skills

74
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:04.137
to take advantage of those opportunities
and climb that career ladder quickly.

75
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:08.426
Trust me,
it really makes a big difference.

76
00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:09.959
That's the end of this story.

77
00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.566
How do you guys feel?

78
00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:15.657
Do you guys relate, agree, disagree?

79
00:05:15.657 --> 00:05:21.318
Yeah, I 100% agree,
I can't talk specifically about the tech

80
00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:26.996
industry roles, cuz I'm still looking for
my first opportunity.

81
00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:32.023
&gt;&gt; Female student 1: But in other work
environments, trust is just essential,

82
00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:35.943
with both teammates and managers, clients,

83
00:05:35.943 --> 00:05:41.183
if you're dealing with them as well,
it's very important.

84
00:05:41.183 --> 00:05:46.441
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes, I know it's
not something a lot of software engineers

85
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:52.131
are thinking about in what they
think makes a good career, yes.

86
00:05:52.131 --> 00:05:56.263
&gt;&gt; Male student 1: What qualities
do you look for in a manager and

87
00:05:56.263 --> 00:06:00.177
want to work for, every manager is toxic,

88
00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:04.227
how do you navigate
that type of situation?

89
00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:12.280
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: If a manager is
toxic, and what I describe as toxic is,

90
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.133
someone who's intentionally
pigeonholing you, as in,

91
00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:23.092
they're constantly only giving you
tasks that limit your abilities.

92
00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:27.397
I would actually try to
transfer to a different team.

93
00:06:27.397 --> 00:06:31.401
That's the type of manager who
already doesn't really like you,

94
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:34.487
and it's very hard to turn
around that narrative.

95
00:06:34.487 --> 00:06:38.000
And so, instead of trying to
stay there and making it work,

96
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.310
I would continue looking for
another place that helps you grow instead.

97
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.796
Now, if your manager is just someone
who isn't thinking about it,

98
00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:50.338
they're not intentionally
getting in your way, but

99
00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:53.978
they aren't actively
providing you opportunities.

100
00:06:53.978 --> 00:06:58.976
Definitely, the managing up scenario
applies, where you are now like, okay,

101
00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:01.549
hey, I talked to these other engineers,

102
00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:04.431
it looks like maybe they
need help over there.

103
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:08.786
I'd love to help take on some
of that responsibility, or

104
00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:14.433
you're actively asking managers as
well for more opportunities, yes.

105
00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:18.217
&gt;&gt; Male student 1: How did you know
you were ready for the next level?

106
00:07:18.217 --> 00:07:23.215
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Well, [LAUGH] when I
was working on these client engagements,

107
00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:27.840
I was working with a lot of
other engineers and managers.

108
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.955
And when I was having these
casual conversations with them,

109
00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:33.774
they would be like, wait,
you're not a senior?

110
00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:34.867
And I'm like, no, I'm not.

111
00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:38.326
And they're like, you perform at a senior,
[LAUGH] you should go for

112
00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:39.360
senior promotions.

113
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.810
And so I kept getting that feedback,
and that's when I was like,

114
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.206
I'm just gonna go for it.

115
00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:49.173
And then I also could tell from
working with the managers that I was

116
00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:50.536
doing very well.

117
00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:53.486
I was meeting their expectations and

118
00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:57.585
performing exactly where
they wanted me and more.

119
00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:59.030
And so I was, okay,

120
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.887
I think I am performing at the next level,
I'm going to just try it.

121
00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:09.602
Even if maybe I didn't have enough tenure,
years of experience.

122
00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:16.931
&gt;&gt; Male student 1: How do you build these
relationships earlier in your career?

123
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:22.681
For instance, if you're trying to
find your first opportunity or

124
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:26.231
even still in university,
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: How do you build

125
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:28.052
those relationships?

126
00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:32.026
So it's important to note that when
you're starting off, the types of

127
00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:37.009
relationships that will eventually lead to
opportunities, it's a long game, right?

128
00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:42.136
You won't see the immediate results,
so just keep that in mind, right?

129
00:08:42.136 --> 00:08:44.403
They may not immediately refer you.

130
00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:49.800
But what I like to do is that I take
whatever common context we have.

131
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.883
So for example, if it's another engineer
or another manager, I actually just go

132
00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:59.818
to them with questions or where I'm like,
I clearly have done a lot of the work,

133
00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:03.961
but I'm really asking for
their opinions on something specific.

134
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.773
I would really wanna
hear their thoughts and

135
00:09:06.773 --> 00:09:10.953
experiences on this project or
problems that we're facing, and

136
00:09:10.953 --> 00:09:15.442
then use that as the initial conversation
to get them talking with me.

137
00:09:15.442 --> 00:09:19.129
And then over time if I feel like
that was a really great relationship

138
00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:22.814
that he was starting to form,
I may be coming back and be like, hey,

139
00:09:22.814 --> 00:09:25.936
you told me about that,
let me give you an update on that.

140
00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:27.972
Now the problem is this,
what do you think?

141
00:09:27.972 --> 00:09:32.216
I'm gonna try this other thing, but
I'd love to hear your experience and

142
00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:33.452
your opinions on it.

143
00:09:33.452 --> 00:09:39.220
And so, slowly over time, you keep using
work as the initial set of conversations,

144
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.819
that by going into their experience,

145
00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:46.467
you're naturally going into a little
bit more of their life story.

146
00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:51.195
And you're eventually gonna see them
enough that you've built kind of a natural

147
00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:52.731
relationship with them.

148
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:56.133
So that's just one way
that I like to do it.

149
00:09:56.133 --> 00:10:00.668
&gt;&gt; Male student 1: Is it possible to
avoid problematic people in a more

150
00:10:00.668 --> 00:10:02.252
systematic way?

151
00:10:02.252 --> 00:10:06.572
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: What does
problematic people mean in this case?

152
00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:10.407
&gt;&gt; Male student 1: Or
just avoiding problems with people.

153
00:10:10.407 --> 00:10:14.997
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Avoiding
problems with people, [LAUGH] well,

154
00:10:14.997 --> 00:10:20.057
you can never control what
another person does, so

155
00:10:20.057 --> 00:10:25.014
I try my best to give them
the benefit of the doubt.

156
00:10:25.014 --> 00:10:29.646
So it's more about how I receive
their actions and their behaviors.

157
00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:34.033
So for example, I've worked with
engineers who are very, very cranky,

158
00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:37.710
[LAUGH] they're a little prickly,
but I think of it as, well,

159
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.786
they're not intentionally
trying to be this way.

160
00:10:40.786 --> 00:10:44.571
Maybe they're stressed or they're just
overwhelmed and they just don't have

161
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:47.857
enough time, and that's why they're
being a little short with me.

162
00:10:47.857 --> 00:10:52.107
I don't let that bother
how I respond with them.

163
00:10:52.107 --> 00:10:57.220
And I continue being kind and
trying to speak with

164
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.707
them kindly and
just not contribute to the problem,

165
00:11:02.707 --> 00:11:06.834
don't trigger the problem even more.

166
00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:11.744
So to reiterate, the story takeaways
of this first set of stories,

167
00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:17.518
you need opportunities to learn new
skills and take on more responsibilities,

168
00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:22.877
all of which becomes evidence of your
readiness to move to the next level.

169
00:11:22.877 --> 00:11:28.717
You will not be able to get promoted
without this type of evidence.

170
00:11:28.717 --> 00:11:33.325
And so, while some might think
opportunities come randomly, and they do,

171
00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:37.573
some of them do come randomly,
I've learned that they're often also

172
00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:40.390
cultivated through
the people you work with.

173
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.531
So by consistently delivering quality
work and being a great partner in

174
00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:49.224
these opportunities, you foster that
continuous cycle of success and growth,

175
00:11:49.224 --> 00:11:52.135
which leads to accelerated
career progression.

176
00:11:54.803 --> 00:11:58.845
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Okay, yes, yes.

177
00:11:58.845 --> 00:12:03.984
&gt;&gt; Male student 1: Do you have any
tips for acting professional and

178
00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:09.651
a team while you have a clash
with another teammate?

179
00:12:09.651 --> 00:12:12.160
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: How to act
professional [LAUGH] while you

180
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.295
have a clash with the teammates?

181
00:12:14.295 --> 00:12:18.455
Definitely, I think, just like friend
dynamics, you don't wanna drag your

182
00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:21.683
personal problems with someone
into a group dynamic [LAUGH].

183
00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:25.642
And so, if you're having conflict,
I think, and this is not

184
00:12:25.642 --> 00:12:30.534
something you can resolve through
conversations with that actual person.

185
00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:35.397
It may be time to bring it up
to your managers to help mediate

186
00:12:35.397 --> 00:12:39.685
what's going on,
because it should be resolved.

187
00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:44.154
So yeah, if you can't have the
conversation and resolve it together, it's

188
00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:48.709
time to step up, managers are there to
help mediate this type of issue as well.
