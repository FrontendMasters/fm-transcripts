00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.046
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Hello everyone?

2
00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:05.450
And welcome to today's workshop on
achieving success as a software developer.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.880
I'm Francesca Sadikin, and
I'm thrilled to have you all here.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.820
Just a bit about myself,
I'm a self-taught engineer and

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.900
I've had the incredible opportunity to
grow my career to the point where I'm now

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.330
a senior engineer at Netflix.

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.069
This course is the designed for anybody
interested in understanding what it takes

8
00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:27.545
to succeed in the software engineering
field beyond just technical skills.

9
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:31.012
Whether you're a budding developer or
a seasoned engineer,

10
00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.688
this workshop has something valuable for
you.

11
00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:39.242
Over the years, I've had the privilege of
working with some superstar engineers and

12
00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.309
I've learned a lot from their habits,
techniques, and mindsets.

13
00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.620
Today I'm excited to share
with you my observations and

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.439
tips that have not only
helped me in my journey,

15
00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:53.039
that can hopefully help you
excel in your own careers too.

16
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.819
So I'm gonna start with a quote that
has guided me throughout my career.

17
00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.244
Luck is when opportunity
meets preparation.

18
00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:03.564
So we're gonna break this
course down into two parts.

19
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.085
First, talking all about preparation,

20
00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:11.224
how we can equip ourselves to not just
meet expectations but to exceed them.

21
00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:14.029
This is going to be more
than just technical skills,

22
00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:17.408
which we will still cover, but
it's also about the mindset and

23
00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:20.371
soft skills that will set you up for
long term success.

24
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.437
Then we're gonna go into opportunities.

25
00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:27.794
We'll explore why opportunities are
critical for growth and how to create and

26
00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:30.907
seize opportunities that
can accelerate your career.

27
00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:38.495
So for a more specific agenda of what
we're doing, we are going to talk about

28
00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:44.117
ramping up and delivering value
quickly when you're at a new company.

29
00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:48.958
Working in legacy systems, so this is
going to be our Gilded Rose exercise

30
00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.862
which covers test driven development,
refactoring, and

31
00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.827
a little bit of the debugger.

32
00:01:55.917 --> 00:02:00.676
Then we're gonna go into handling
common project execution problems,

33
00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:06.138
getting promotion ready, and then we're
gonna switch over into opportunities,

34
00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:10.976
which ends with a building authentic
connections exercise where we learn

35
00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:13.259
a little bit of active listening.
