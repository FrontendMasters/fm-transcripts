00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.320
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Hopefully you
are all with me on why building

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.480
relationships of trust,
caring about people is important.

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.690
But you might wonder how
do you actually do that?

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.811
All right, how do I actually make
connections when maybe I'm not so

5
00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:17.960
great with people?

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.303
So as someone who has had
problems with socializing before.

7
00:00:25.303 --> 00:00:26.603
I do have some tips.

8
00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:31.478
So again,
first I've mentioned this before, but

9
00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:35.443
building relationships to increase
your opportunities is a long game.

10
00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:38.163
You're not going to see immediate results.

11
00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.611
But there are other significant
benefits to starting early and

12
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.703
fostering these connections often.

13
00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:50.893
Some of which is that things will go
wrong, there's gonna be a mistake that

14
00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:56.238
happens, or you're going to need help, and
all of that is just much easier to have

15
00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:02.105
a conversation about when you already have
a good relationship with the other person.

16
00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.665
And to be clear,
it's more like humanizing.

17
00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.408
People see you as a person,

18
00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:14.985
not just like a shadowless
entity that does work, right?

19
00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.375
The other big benefit,
sharing information.

20
00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:21.197
So through these conversations
that you're having,

21
00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:24.945
hopefully you're gaining a lot of
information about maybe the project,

22
00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:29.807
what's happening at your company, maybe
they heard about layoffs or restructuring.

23
00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:34.748
All of this is really good information
cuz it allows you to react faster if

24
00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.457
you knew about it before.

25
00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:43.685
And lastly, of course leveraging your
network to find future job opportunities.

26
00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:48.496
Maybe they won't give you a referral, but
if they can give you information about

27
00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:53.448
what it's like to work there or who's a
good contact, just any sort of information

28
00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:58.785
can really make the big difference to
whether you get that position or not.

29
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:03.508
And strong positive impressions like so
you've worked with someone you did great

30
00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:08.231
five years later you're like you pinged
them again they'll remember that you had

31
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:11.945
a good working relationship and
they'll continue to help you.

32
00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.336
How do you do this a bit more, right?

33
00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:21.496
I really recommend face-to-face time.

34
00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:25.436
Don't just slack them with text messages.

35
00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:28.533
Something about seeing people in person or

36
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:33.176
with faces actually helps
you humanize each other.

37
00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.676
Try to go for repeat interactions.

38
00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:39.963
So if you're on site, I recommend having
lunch with them every so often and

39
00:02:39.963 --> 00:02:42.971
then if your remote scheduling
one on one meetings.

40
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.729
Especially when you're
first getting started,

41
00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:50.454
schedule one on one meetings 30 minutes to
just introduce yourself to everybody and

42
00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:54.345
then meet them like every few months
afterwards, just a little call.

43
00:02:57.105 --> 00:03:00.701
It's really also important to
take a genuine interest in them.

44
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.154
If you don't have that genuine interest,
it's just gonna come across very strange,

45
00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:08.451
and you're not gonna have
the effect that you're looking for.

46
00:03:10.651 --> 00:03:12.061
I use active listening for these, and

47
00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:15.881
don't worry, if you don't know what active
listening is, we're about to cover it.

48
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.750
But some other sample questions that I
have is just try to go beyond the nitty

49
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.567
gritty work details, go work adjacent.

50
00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:27.232
So how they feel about what's
going on in their work or

51
00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:33.341
how they feel about the current company
update, layoffs, restructuring, whatever,

52
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:38.974
just work adjacent and try to get closer
to learning about them, their thoughts.

53
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.761
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Okay,
so I have another story.

54
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.667
This is the last story,
I promise, [LAUGH] so

55
00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:51.451
I mentioned that active listening
was one of my big tips.

56
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:56.646
You probably didn't know this about me,
and hopefully maybe you can't tell and

57
00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:58.171
how I'm talking right now.

58
00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:02.959
But I used to have really severe social
anxiety to the point where I thought I

59
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.434
was actually an introvert.

60
00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:09.484
This whole time, I actually was
a socially anxious extrovert.

61
00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:13.184
I do like people, I just didn't
know how to talk to them, right?

62
00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:17.400
But the one skill that actually
transformed my socializing skills is

63
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.643
active listening.

64
00:04:20.574 --> 00:04:24.825
So to give you an example of what it
was like before learning the skill,

65
00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:28.859
when I was trying to find my first job,
I was ready to try anything,

66
00:04:28.859 --> 00:04:33.854
including networking events, even though
I usually avoid them like the plague.

67
00:04:34.944 --> 00:04:37.394
Again, because I had no social skills.

68
00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:39.844
And these networking events
were exactly what I thought.

69
00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:42.563
They were horrible for me.

70
00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:46.358
I would start sweating through my
shirt just completely drenched,

71
00:04:46.358 --> 00:04:48.713
my face would turn very red.

72
00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:52.589
I would not know what to do, so
I would just stand awkwardly, around

73
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:56.873
the groups trying to like figure out how
to come in, and then when I came in,

74
00:04:56.873 --> 00:05:02.106
somehow ask my two questions, don't
know how to continue the conversation.

75
00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:06.486
And then I just had to,
very awkwardly back out of the group.

76
00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:11.348
And every event just left me so
frustrated, and embarrassed,

77
00:05:11.348 --> 00:05:14.396
and just emotionally drained.

78
00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:16.819
I just felt like I didn't
know how to socialize and

79
00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.196
wasn't sure if I was
actually Gonna get better.

80
00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:25.926
Fast forward a year, I was able to get a
job as a software engineering consultant.

81
00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:30.669
Now, if you don't know anything about
consulting beyond the technical tasks,

82
00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.482
you're also expected to create really
friendly relationships with everyone you

83
00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:36.193
work with.

84
00:05:36.193 --> 00:05:41.238
And as demonstrated in my previous
example, I didn't know how to do that.

85
00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:46.119
But the fear of getting fired finally
pushed me to actually focus on how to

86
00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.488
get social skills.

87
00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:54.164
So my sister, knowing me, suggested
a book called Never Split the Difference,

88
00:05:54.164 --> 00:05:58.626
which is about a hostage negotiator
who uses tactical empathy and

89
00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:03.349
active listening to create quick
connections with a hostage taker.

90
00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:09.119
I mean, I guess she was right and
she did know how much help I need,

91
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.849
because that book was amazing.

92
00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.011
To be honest,
I only read the first few chapters, but

93
00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:18.587
those first few chapters
are still taking me to today.

94
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:21.970
Like that's how mind blowing it was for
me.

95
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.084
I learned that connection with
other people does not depend on my

96
00:06:27.084 --> 00:06:32.927
ability to talk well or
ask a bunch of really clever questions.

97
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:36.471
Instead, I just had to focus
on truly listening and

98
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.603
ensuring that the other person
felt understood and heard.

99
00:06:42.643 --> 00:06:46.383
So I was like, all right,
sounds simple enough let me try it.

100
00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:52.283
At the time, I had this manager who
I had regular one on ones with.

101
00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:56.248
Now, these were supposed to be 30 minute
meetings, but he could barely get through

102
00:06:56.248 --> 00:07:00.120
five minutes with me, because we
always had nothing to talk about.

103
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.240
I had nothing to lose.

104
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.600
I was like, let's try it, right?

105
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.340
So the rules are simple.

106
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.940
I have to start with a genuine desire
to understand the other person, and

107
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.770
then I use some of these active listening
techniques I read about in the book.

108
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.899
So I asked my manager a carefully
chosen open ended question.

109
00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:23.389
And for the first time,
focused entirely on what he was saying.

110
00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:27.861
Instead of just accumulating
a bunch of questions in my head,

111
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:30.269
I listened to what he was saying.

112
00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:33.939
So if he said something like,
I don't know what that means.

113
00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:34.849
I actually don't know what that means.

114
00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:35.829
Let me ask him.

115
00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:37.379
Tell me more about that.

116
00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:39.239
Or if something was interesting,

117
00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:42.455
I was like, can you explain
a little bit more about that?

118
00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:44.395
I'd love to hear more, right?

119
00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:50.024
And what was once a really painful five
minute meeting turned into several one and

120
00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:52.935
a half hour conversations.

121
00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:56.420
He actually told me that he
doesn't usually share so much, and

122
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.835
really enjoyed our conversation.

123
00:07:58.835 --> 00:08:01.437
He was actually forming
a connection with me.

124
00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:06.562
And that was amazing because that was the
first time I was actually able to do that

125
00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:07.517
with someone.

126
00:08:07.517 --> 00:08:09.977
And I think I was like.

127
00:08:09.977 --> 00:08:14.407
I finally figured out how to socialize and
create authentic connections.

128
00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:18.537
So this realization was mind blowing.

129
00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:21.823
It's so simple yet
no one really teaches you this, and

130
00:08:21.823 --> 00:08:26.037
I applied this with everybody I met,
which quickly grew my careers and

131
00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:30.692
in my personal life, I was able to deepen
the friendships that I already had.

132
00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:37.132
So, this skill is my superpower,
and I want to share it with you.

133
00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:39.217
It's difficult to teach
in a one hour setting.

134
00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:44.257
But I want us to practice the first few
steps and just to get familiar with it.

135
00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:48.038
Remember that the first goal must
be to understand the other person,

136
00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:50.787
a genuine desire to
understand the other person.

137
00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:56.006
Active listening is a technique to
help you understand someone and

138
00:08:56.006 --> 00:08:57.897
help them feel heard.

139
00:08:57.897 --> 00:09:01.266
Without that genuine desire,
people will always know and

140
00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:04.024
it's just gonna come
across as manipulative.

141
00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:07.929
So we're gonna go over our
connection principles and

142
00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:09.684
what active listening actually is.

143
00:09:09.684 --> 00:09:13.534
And then we're gonna put it all together
in our active listening exercise.
