00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:03.978
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Let's move into
our Authentic Connection Exercise.

2
00:00:03.978 --> 00:00:09.594
The goal is to use active listening and
these other quick connection

3
00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:14.729
principles to extract each
other's full journey into tech.

4
00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.505
Ideally, by the end of it,

5
00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:20.772
we start to feel a sense of authentic
connection with each other.

6
00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:23.508
That's how we know that we did this right.

7
00:00:23.508 --> 00:00:28.430
[LAUGH] So there are two roles here.

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.857
There is going to be a story share,
so this is one person.

9
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:36.346
They're going to start the exercise
by giving a 10 to 15 second short

10
00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:38.637
summary of their journey into tech.

11
00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:42.670
Then they'll only be answering
the questions that are being asked.

12
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.125
So if someone ask a yes and no question,
they will answer yes and no.

13
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.657
Now the rest of us,
as many as those who wants to volunteer,

14
00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:55.934
are going to be questioners.

15
00:00:55.934 --> 00:01:00.170
Our goal is to extract the what, why, and

16
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.876
most importantly,
the feelings about their journey.

17
00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:12.938
And so all of these techniques are used
to help understand their experience and

18
00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:18.191
then make sure that they felt
that they were heard, okay?

19
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:22.353
Just a small conduct rule,
when we go into feelings and

20
00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:25.248
we going into our journeys into tech,

21
00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:30.586
sometimes it's a little delicate,
and so we want to ask for consent or

22
00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:36.578
give them a way out before touching upon
really deeply personal life details.

23
00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:40.199
There should be no pressure
to share something that for

24
00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.332
folks are uncomfortable with.

25
00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:46.841
Okay, so with that,
we can actually start this exercise.

26
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:50.084
Who wants to be the story sharer first?

27
00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:53.635
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: I was in real estate,
I did a bunch of remodels.

28
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:59.219
I heard about a boot camp to get into
tech, and I took that opportunity

29
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.593
to learn how to build something new
using tech, and that's where I'm at now.

30
00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:08.219
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So
the rest of us are questioners, and

31
00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:13.321
I'll also be jumping in, but I'm gonna
give the floor to you guys first.

32
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.890
Some questions here.

33
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.233
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 2: Was it just interest, or

34
00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:22.488
was there something motivating
you to getting to tech?

35
00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:29.390
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: There was both.

36
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.723
There was an interest in the sense
that I really enjoy remodeling and

37
00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.724
working with just creating things.

38
00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:43.725
And I was really very
focused in real estate.

39
00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:49.035
And I saw an opportunity to
continue that without excessively

40
00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:53.944
putting wear on my body through
building with software.

41
00:02:53.944 --> 00:03:01.266
Combine that with seeing how
slow the ship of Real estate is,

42
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:06.147
I saw there were a lot of opportunities in

43
00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:10.742
tech to build tools for clients and for

44
00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:15.783
people within the real estate industry.

45
00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:17.912
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 2: How did that make you feel?

46
00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:20.946
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: Excited and overwhelmed.

47
00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:24.933
And then really getting into it,
once I dove into

48
00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:30.737
tech,
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: How

49
00:03:30.737 --> 00:03:36.533
much harder it is to actually do that,
[LAUGH] then just think about it.

50
00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.709
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Are there
other folks who have questions?

51
00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.403
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: How did you balance
those two feelings of being really excited

52
00:03:43.403 --> 00:03:46.026
and overwhelmed at the same time.

53
00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:51.833
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: I think time
really balanced them for me.

54
00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:52.698
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Mm-hm.

55
00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:56.233
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: Especially once
you start building things.

56
00:03:56.233 --> 00:04:00.920
And I really enjoy networking.

57
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.510
So speaking with others
who have attempted to

58
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.098
build products similar
to what I had in mind,

59
00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:14.568
and also enterprise
level products that and

60
00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:18.693
companies who are already profitable.

61
00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:23.679
It's not that my excitement died,

62
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:27.002
it became realistic and

63
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:32.320
I thought of it in more realistic terms

64
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.818
instead of just like a grandiose idea.

65
00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:38.789
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Any other questions?

66
00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:46.093
There's like two things there that
someone could further dig into.

67
00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:50.537
Well, I noticed and the thing that you
said previously you said it's actually

68
00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.907
a little harder than you were expecting.

69
00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:57.752
And then also like you just mentioned
just now about something being

70
00:04:57.752 --> 00:05:01.324
more realistic for
it's like grandiose ideals.

71
00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:04.082
What's that mean?

72
00:05:04.082 --> 00:05:08.289
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: I know we're getting
a little bit away from where I'm at in my

73
00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.665
tech journey now, but this is more
like product development conversation.

74
00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:24.227
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: Having an idea,
you can only self-fund for

75
00:05:24.227 --> 00:05:28.187
so long and there's only so

76
00:05:28.187 --> 00:05:34.398
much time in the day to accomplish things.

77
00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:39.028
And paralleling my intro into

78
00:05:39.028 --> 00:05:43.473
getting into tech was also,

79
00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:48.472
seeing how to build a product and

80
00:05:48.472 --> 00:05:55.339
the nuances in that
planning of doing that.

81
00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:00.092
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So is that your goal
is to, still somehow build this tool that

82
00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:05.121
you have in your head, but
still also try to find, like a job, or

83
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:10.825
you're like, no, I'm focusing on I
want this, this idea that I have.

84
00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:14.125
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: No I've
backed away from the idea,

85
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:19.405
I had started building something,
and then my awareness

86
00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:24.575
of large language models came
out around the same time,

87
00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:29.966
and like switch cases for
like things that I was building.

88
00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:35.401
The product that I was building,
got turned on its head when

89
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:40.851
I was exposed to the possibilities
with machine learning.

90
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.888
And it kind of became irrelevant.

91
00:06:43.888 --> 00:06:48.382
And so I was like,
I would need to start over to keep

92
00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:51.707
up with what is currently possible.

93
00:06:51.707 --> 00:06:56.209
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So I'm just gonna
pause a little bit and just like,

94
00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.712
I'm not sure if I fully
extracted everything, but

95
00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:06.488
did it feel like we kind of heard you and
understood your journey?

96
00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:08.498
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: Yeah, I think so it felt.

97
00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:09.651
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: A little bit.
&gt;&gt; Tech-guy 1: Yeah.

98
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:15.591
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Okay, so
we're gonna just change roles again.
