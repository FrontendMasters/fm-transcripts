00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.484
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So
in our last story,

2
00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:05.824
we explored how building relationships of
trust with the people we work with can

3
00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:09.890
open up more opportunities and
accelerate career growth.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.055
But I found that trust isn't just key to
creating opportunities, it's also super

5
00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:20.019
important for executing effectively
once those opportunities come your way.

6
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.218
Okay, I've learned that the same soft
skills, empathy, active listening and

7
00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:29.728
genuine care for others not only
help build these relationships, but

8
00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.489
also makes you more effective engineers.

9
00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.169
So I'm gonna share how I learned this in
two different experiences in my career.

10
00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.606
So, this mental trap that
I show you on the slide,

11
00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:47.184
good solutions speak for themselves.

12
00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:51.804
I feel like this is a very common
mental trap that engineers fall into

13
00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:56.589
essentially getting so caught up in
the technical aspects of a project

14
00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.278
that we lose sight of its real purpose.

15
00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:04.078
And this trap can happen In both personal
and corporate projects where even

16
00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:08.890
with significant time like resources
like many, many, many engineers.

17
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.556
And tons of money invested the final
product may end up unused because it

18
00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.583
doesn't solve the actual problem.

19
00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:21.644
The reason is it's a shallow
understanding of what users truly need.

20
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.754
So I learned this lesson
the hard way early in my career.

21
00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:31.448
I was part of a project where our team was
tasked with building a series of tools for

22
00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:34.154
admins to manage their
educational program.

23
00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:40.658
In particular, one of the tools I was most
excited about would solve how admins,

24
00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:45.373
for spending hours manually sorting
students into groups using Excel.

25
00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:49.192
And I designed this really cool
[LAUGH] solution that even now I still

26
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.623
think is so cool.

27
00:01:50.623 --> 00:01:55.237
It looks exactly like this,
it's a drag and drop system, and

28
00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:57.473
I implemented it perfectly.

29
00:01:57.473 --> 00:02:02.535
It looked perfect but
When I launched this tool,

30
00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.764
I realized a huge mistake for context.

31
00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:08.444
I have a background in design.

32
00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:13.412
I've spent many years thinking about
users, but in all of my excitement

33
00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:18.382
in building this tool, I completely
overlooked the basics of involving

34
00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:23.443
the actual users, the admins And
the students while I was building this.

35
00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:28.533
So we made assumptions based
on what we thought was needed.

36
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.374
We just heard you need a portal and
a dashboard and

37
00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:33.713
a tool to help you sort it right?

38
00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:34.803
Cool, we'll build that.

39
00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:37.563
That's literally the type of
conversation [LAUGH] we had.

40
00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:40.814
We did not check back in, and as a result.

41
00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:45.522
When it was time to launch,
our results reflected our approach,

42
00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:48.954
which is no one used it,
the only users were us.

43
00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:53.712
And this project, which was meant
to serve admins and students,

44
00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:57.854
failed essentially because we didn't
bother to actually understand them.

45
00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:01.901
This experience was
a really painful lesson,

46
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:07.217
because we spent nine months building
all of this with nothing to show for it.

47
00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:10.349
So it showed me that building technically

48
00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.841
excellent solutions is
only half the battle.

49
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:18.307
Really, the most important part is
actually understanding who you're

50
00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:20.513
building for and what do they need.

51
00:03:20.513 --> 00:03:22.549
This is where so many engineers go wrong,

52
00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.691
pushing out technically impressive work
that doesn't solve anyone's problems.

53
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.961
I'll pause here, what do you guys think?

54
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:34.691
Do you relate to it?

55
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.611
Agree, disagree?

56
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:38.731
Lot of head nods.

57
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:39.731
Lot of head nods.

58
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.975
We've all made this mistake.

59
00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:46.445
And sadly we still continue to make it
in corporate settings too, [LAUGH].

60
00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:49.555
&gt;&gt; Participant: So did you come up
with a solution that users did use?

61
00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:53.136
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: No,
my time was done there.

62
00:03:53.136 --> 00:03:57.805
[LAUGH] Was there another question?

63
00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:58.695
Go ahead.

64
00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:03.868
&gt;&gt; Participant 2: As a consultant,
I find that holds true for oftentimes

65
00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:10.729
people looking to create an initial
idea like you have a start up idea.

66
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:11.439
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes.

67
00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.749
&gt;&gt; Participant 2: And
they they wanna build it.

68
00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.387
And a part of me wants to just
take the money and build it,

69
00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:27.183
and then another part,
which is the authentic version of me.

70
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:32.408
During that first meeting,
I always have to bring up these

71
00:04:32.408 --> 00:04:38.073
questions to see whether it's
test users or user base in mind.

72
00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:43.134
And how these individuals
who they're building it for,

73
00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:49.467
they've talked to them to see if this
is actually a viable thing or not.

74
00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:52.576
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I think
the authentic version of yourself would

75
00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:57.757
actually make you an even better
consultant if you went that way, right?

76
00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:00.527
But it does require a lot
of the persuasion skills.

77
00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:03.407
Is of like first listening
to their concerns and

78
00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:07.727
then being able to persuasively like
lead them in a different direction

79
00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:11.757
that actually still solves what
they're looking for, right?

80
00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:16.398
But yeah, I like kinda what
you're saying is that sometimes I

81
00:05:16.398 --> 00:05:21.028
think engineers think
they just are the coders.

82
00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:22.527
But if we just code,

83
00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:27.568
we're then letting ourselves just
be code monkeys, [LAUGH] right?

84
00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:32.212
So to really be a great partner,
I think, with product owners and

85
00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:36.278
design, that is part of their
role to be researching it.

86
00:05:36.278 --> 00:05:42.759
But I think we have a part in showing up
as our technical experience in our roles,

87
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.198
and just be, are you sure that's
how you want to accomplish that.

88
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:53.055
Or you can be an equal voice
to give your opinions, to see,

89
00:05:53.055 --> 00:05:57.241
is this really the direction
that we want to go to?

90
00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:02.535
Because, I think, because we have
the technical experience and

91
00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:07.454
we have to translate their
requests into implementations.

92
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:11.712
They're also lacking experience in
knowing what's actually reasonable and

93
00:06:11.712 --> 00:06:12.814
what's possible.

94
00:06:12.814 --> 00:06:15.594
And maybe there was
a different way to achieve it.

95
00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:20.549
And so these are great opinions that we
can offer to them as different solutions.

96
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.577
&gt;&gt; Participant 3: And sometimes,
especially with startups,

97
00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:30.920
even if your gut or
intuition is saying it's not gonna work,

98
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.680
maybe an iteration of that
idea will actually work.

99
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.531
So sometimes it's your
responsibility to say, well,

100
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:39.860
I'm gonna do the best I can with this.

101
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.319
Put it out there and who knows?

102
00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.549
Maybe they know something about
the customer or the audience that I don't.

103
00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:50.389
And suddenly that feature
is actually used a ton.

104
00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.879
So in a way,
you have to kind of balance both sides.

105
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.933
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: It's the agile way
where, right, we just try to push out

106
00:06:57.933 --> 00:07:01.526
the minimum amount first,
the one with the least amount of effort.

107
00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:05.696
Put it in front of real users and see
what they actually say and then iterate,

108
00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.251
which I actually talk
about in the next story.
