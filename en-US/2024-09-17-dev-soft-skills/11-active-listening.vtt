00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.306
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So we just covered
the story of how I learned active

2
00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:04.178
listening.

3
00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:08.793
Just a few takeaways here from this story,
as a reminder,

4
00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:13.797
creating connections with others
is not just for extroverts.

5
00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:20.726
Even those with social anxiety can develop
this skill, and it is that, it is a skill.

6
00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:25.077
You gotta remember to
start with genuine intent,

7
00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:28.815
an intent to understand the other person.

8
00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.847
Authenticity is crucial for
building trust.

9
00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:37.486
And active listening is just
a skill to help you foster this

10
00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:42.799
connection by making the other
person feel heard and understood.

11
00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.873
So let me actually cover a little bit
more in detail what is active listening.

12
00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:54.135
I actually really like this description
by Harvard Business Review,

13
00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:56.193
so I'm gonna read it loud.

14
00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:59.647
What exactly is a active listening?

15
00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:04.309
You might think you are a good listener
because you put away distractions,

16
00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.528
stay quiet, and then nod your head
when someone's talking to you.

17
00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:12.716
You might even repeat back your
conversation partner's main points to

18
00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:15.798
demonstrate that you've heard and
absorbed them.

19
00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:18.508
These are all smart things to do, but

20
00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:23.591
they can still leave the speaker
feeling unheard or even dismissed.

21
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:28.256
So active listening is when you not
only hear what someone is saying but

22
00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:31.275
also attune to their thoughts and
feelings.

23
00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:35.091
It turns a conversation into an active,

24
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.030
noncompetitive two-way interaction.

25
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.948
Robin Abrahams and Boris Groysberg
from Harvard Business School describes

26
00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:46.801
active listening as having three aspects.

27
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:52.003
Cognitive, so mentally we are paying
attention to all of the information,

28
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.802
what someone is explicitly and
implicitly saying, comprehending,

29
00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:59.994
just trying to build
that picture in our head.

30
00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:06.191
Emotionally, we're trying to stay calm and
compassionate during the conversation.

31
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:10.940
Filtering out emotions such as annoyance,
boredom, judgment,

32
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.447
about what they're saying,
you wanna filter all of that out.

33
00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:19.099
Behavioral, so in your body and
your facial expressions,

34
00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.736
you're going to be conveying interest and
comprehension, verbally and non-verbally.

35
00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:29.223
So body cues, and then also through
our words we're saying, yes,

36
00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:32.227
we want to hear more,
we want to understand.

37
00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:36.338
Some other little tips that I have,
again, important,

38
00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:39.945
make the other person feel heard and
understood.

39
00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.804
That is the entire point
of using active listening.

40
00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:48.748
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: People will not
share anything if they don't feel like

41
00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:55.417
they can trust you or if there is not
a safe place for them to share, right?

42
00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:59.810
And so to do that,
we have to make sure that we are, again,

43
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.858
filtering out our inner feelings
of judgment, shame, or blame.

44
00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:11.296
People can sense it immediately, and
they're gonna clam up immediately.

45
00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:14.479
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I've also
noticed that a lot of conversations

46
00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.141
kind of bucket into three categories,
what, why, and emotions.

47
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:24.588
So when we're talking about conversations
that try to create a connection,

48
00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:27.204
what in this diagram is like the air?

49
00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:32.378
There's nothing of substance there,
we want to move away from those

50
00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:37.921
types of questions quickly and
move into why, which is a little bit more.

51
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:41.265
And then the big bulk
of it is the emotions.

52
00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:48.798
This is where connection is formed, when
we actually start to share how we feel.

53
00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:54.089
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So two active
listening tactics out of many that I'm

54
00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.803
gonna share with you is mirroring and
labeling emotions.

55
00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:01.882
So remember, again,
active listening is a way for

56
00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:06.250
you to demonstrate your desire to
hear the other person's experience,

57
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.339
creating space for
the other person to share more.

58
00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:17.102
So mirroring achieves that by giving them
a verbal cue that we'd love to hear more.

59
00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:22.643
So for example, I said, I'm worried about
my presentation for the board meeting.

60
00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:26.641
And my friend could say, what about
the presentation is worrying you?

61
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:31.283
So that is actually a clue for me,
it's like, she wants to hear more,

62
00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:33.001
let me share more, right?

63
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.698
Labeling emotions, so
like my previous diagram, we want to

64
00:04:36.698 --> 00:04:41.412
get to the emotions as quickly as
possible cuz that's the interesting part.

65
00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:45.281
And one of the easiest ways to do
that is by labeling the emotions

66
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.960
of the other person, one,

67
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.351
to see if you did actually understand
what it is that they're feeling.

68
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:57.304
And two, it prompts them to continue
sharing more, if they feel comfortable.

69
00:04:57.304 --> 00:05:03.210
So for example, they just wouldn't listen,
even though brought it up so many times.

70
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.932
And I could say,
did that feel really frustrating?

71
00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:10.322
My friend can say, exactly,
it was frustrating because blah, right?

72
00:05:10.322 --> 00:05:13.936
You can see that these types of
questions is a way to prompt for more.
