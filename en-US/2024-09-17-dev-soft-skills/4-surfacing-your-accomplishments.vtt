00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.061
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Preparing for
Promotions.

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:09.882
So here's another prompt,
is it enough to just work hard and

3
00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:17.520
deliver good quality code if you
want to climb up the career ladder?

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.375
No, yes [LAUGH] okay.

5
00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.656
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [INAUDIBLE] to notice.

6
00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.418
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Exactly, exactly.

7
00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:27.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Advocate for yourself.

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.243
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Advocate for
yourself, exactly.

9
00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:34.752
So it's interesting cuz some people really
know that you have to have to advocate for

10
00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:35.536
yourself.

11
00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:41.816
And others maybe culturally we just think
we don't need to talk about it too much,

12
00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:47.291
and I definitely grew up in a culture
like that, but you guys are right.

13
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:52.357
Look at it this way, your managers and
leadership are busy, right?

14
00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:57.170
They actually appreciate
any visibility you give

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.728
them into your work and its impacts.

16
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:06.091
You maybe think, all right, my manager
needs to hear about my accomplishments,

17
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.667
but shouldn't that come from others?

18
00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:13.253
While it's wonderful that
peers acknowledge your work,

19
00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:18.317
relying solely on them is very risky,
because people are busy.

20
00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:21.512
And if you're not advocating for yourself,

21
00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:27.145
your contributions might go unnoticed,
and silence can easily be mistaken for

22
00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:31.110
inactivity, which is not
a narrative you wanna build.

23
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.935
At the end of the day promotions,
despite all of these processes and

24
00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:38.896
paperwork you probably have to fill out,

25
00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:44.921
it is still a subjective decision made by
people and that decision depends on trust.

26
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:48.620
Can they trust you to take
on more responsibility?

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.889
If they're unaware of your impact and
achievements,

28
00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:59.775
they cannot confidently entrust you with
more challenges and more responsibilities.

29
00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:04.549
So remember, owning your narrative
is not about self-promotion,

30
00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.004
it's not arrogance,
it's about creating clarity and trust.

31
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:14.694
Your work has value, and it's important
that those in leadership understand and

32
00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:17.097
appreciate your contributions.

33
00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:20.853
So how do you actually do that?

34
00:02:20.853 --> 00:02:23.748
What I like to do is create a brag doc.

35
00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:28.404
So this is a personal document
that you are hosting somewhere

36
00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:32.065
where you start accumulating
all of your work.

37
00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:37.801
And most importantly if you
have metrics of some kind to

38
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:43.794
show the impact of that work,
that would be even better.

39
00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:48.152
I like to use
the situation-behavior-impact format to

40
00:02:48.152 --> 00:02:53.054
essentially outline what happened,
what my actions were, and

41
00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:55.612
then the results of that action.

42
00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:56.526
Bonus point,

43
00:02:56.526 --> 00:03:01.493
this is probably the format you need
to talk about in behavioral interviews.

44
00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:05.610
It's probably what you paste into
the promotion dockets as well, and

45
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.261
you probably can use a shortened
version of it in your resume.

46
00:03:09.261 --> 00:03:15.091
So think of it as like writing it
once use it in four different places,

47
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.421
create regular communication loops.

48
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:24.443
So, just like we talked about before with
the feedback loops that you want to get,

49
00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:30.309
you also wanna be sharing all of the
successes that you've been doing, right?

50
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:35.385
If you receive positive feedback
from anyone you're working with,

51
00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:38.720
ask them to put it in writing,
send it to you.

52
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.023
Take a screenshot,
put it in your brag doc, and

53
00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:42.702
then send it over to your manager.

54
00:03:42.702 --> 00:03:48.454
You wanna be continuously sending that
kind of information back to your manager.

55
00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:51.130
And lastly, understand the promotion and

56
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.856
rewards process before you
actually want that promotion.

57
00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:58.579
So maybe a year, a year and
a half beforehand.

58
00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.446
You wanna start having conversations with
your manager and be like I'm trying to go

59
00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:07.564
for that, where do you think I am
compared to what I'm supposed to be.

60
00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:12.019
And so now you have that time frame to
continuously focus on those things and

61
00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.282
checking with your manager
whether you're on track.

62
00:04:15.282 --> 00:04:19.263
So that when it's time for promotions
you're not gonna be as surprised about

63
00:04:19.263 --> 00:04:21.172
whether you're gonna get it or not.

64
00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:27.961
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So
despite all of the pros of surfacing your

65
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:33.173
accomplishments, people still
have hesitations, right?

66
00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.843
And so hesitations,
it still feels really arrogant.

67
00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.937
Or this work was really done as a team,

68
00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:45.761
I'm not really sure how to extract my
own impact when we did it as a team.

69
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.733
Or I'm not really sure this is
actually an accomplishment at all.

70
00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:54.893
And I'm not sure if anyone's actually
doing this because usually it's

71
00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:59.809
done behind closed doors,
I swear to you, everybody is doing this.

72
00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:05.360
So, to learn a little bit more about
overcoming some of these hesitations,

73
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.279
I recommend these two books,
if you wanna go into it.

74
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.288
How women rise is specific for women,

75
00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:18.227
the cultural norms that we were raised
with, and what we need to overcome.

76
00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:21.242
They're different from what
men traditionally experience.

77
00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:26.313
So if you're a guy, I recommend what
got you here won't get you there.

78
00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:34.867
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So we're coming
up on our preparation takeaways,

79
00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:40.394
where we're wrapping up
the preparation section.

80
00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:45.394
So some things to keep in mind, right?

81
00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:49.944
To deliver work efficiently and
understand the code base,

82
00:05:49.944 --> 00:05:53.675
I really recommend,
again, that shadowing and

83
00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:59.230
pair programming experience to just
help you deliver that much faster.

84
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.204
Remember that quality code is actually
about making code maintainable and

85
00:06:05.204 --> 00:06:06.539
easy to change.

86
00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.957
Use tests to understand systems and
help yourself work safely and

87
00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:16.911
embrace test driven development, even if
your company doesn't really care about it.

88
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:22.641
I actually think it's really useful for
you individually as a software engineer.

89
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.493
It's important to have
a clear debugging process and

90
00:06:26.493 --> 00:06:30.098
then to help you execute
tasks more effectively.

91
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:34.806
Think about gathering more information,
improving your estimation skills,

92
00:06:34.806 --> 00:06:37.694
and changing the way you
start working on tasks.

93
00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.552
And make sure to overcommunicate.

94
00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:45.730
And lastly,
be proactive in asking for help and

95
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.901
continue to surface your achievements
to help you continue growing.
