00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; Participant: How do you manage early
days in office as software developer?

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.990
I mean, what priority?

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.761
What things should you prioritize more,

4
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:15.328
connection to other people or
focus on the job description at first?

5
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.641
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Especially
when you start a new job.

6
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:27.522
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So I think it's
important to split, it almost 50, 50,

7
00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:28.249
in that.

8
00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.360
So it depends on how this
company is actually structured,

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.277
and whether you're expected
to be on site all the time.

10
00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:42.285
Of course, if you can ramp quickly,
in your work.

11
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:46.015
That would be great, but
if you can combine it together right?

12
00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:49.537
Because a lot of that ramp up
activities can actually be best,

13
00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:53.945
faster learned by connecting with another
engineer and having them actually

14
00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:58.947
go through it together with you and
they're pointing out the quick spots too.

15
00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:02.099
And that actually becomes your first
connection with somebody which

16
00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:03.811
you can build on top of.

17
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.438
I also find that these on-site events,

18
00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:10.101
especially if they don't
happen that often.

19
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:13.822
So I'm assuming if it doesn't
happen that often, prioritizing,

20
00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:18.277
creating a little bit of a connection with
your teammates is going to be helpful.

21
00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:22.447
So that when you become remote,
you guys already know each other and

22
00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:26.758
you guys can,
it's just smoother when you work together.

23
00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:30.367
But if you are constantly on site,
then I think,

24
00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:35.078
it's fine to not front load all
of the connection building.

25
00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:39.501
Just make sure to schedule time to
actually still do that to at least have

26
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:40.542
met everybody.

27
00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.692
&gt;&gt; Participant: An anecdotal
from my personal career.

28
00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:49.406
Early in my career,
I was at an office that had a lot of roles

29
00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:54.042
that I didn't necessarily
know what they even did.

30
00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:55.563
And so I was like, hey,

31
00:01:55.563 --> 00:02:00.072
can I have coffee with you or take you
to lunch and just talk about your.

32
00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:03.611
Job and how you kinda got there and
whatever and

33
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:09.420
people were surprisingly really open
to that and granted I was in my 20s and

34
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.619
just kinda eyes wide open
just looking to meet people.

35
00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:18.636
And so that was they were really
amicable to it but I realized that doing

36
00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:23.737
that 34 40 times, I gotta know a lot
of people in the company and then

37
00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:29.541
eventually all the best projects and stuff
just kept getting thrown on my plate.

38
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:33.486
And I got raises really, really quickly.

39
00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:37.424
And I was really young
leading big projects.

40
00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:41.487
And I have to say that
that's direct one to one,

41
00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:45.347
because everybody knew who I was, whereas,

42
00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:51.153
the other people just only writing code,
it was a huge difference.

43
00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:52.756
And that kind of connection?

44
00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.534
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes, exactly,
if you think about it right,

45
00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:59.934
like if you're giving opportunities,
you prefer, it's not great.

46
00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:02.346
But of course,
you prefer to give it to someone you know,

47
00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:04.525
like someone you're like
I talked to that person.

48
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:07.206
I know what he's like, and
they got the skills to do it.

49
00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.620
Here you go, right?

50
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.974
Yes.

51
00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:13.561
&gt;&gt; Participant 2: I would add
to not only is this good for

52
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:18.072
building a relationship with
your manager and your coworkers,

53
00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:22.435
but also your potential manager And
potential co-workers.

54
00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:27.850
I found that asking questions like
you used in your example during

55
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.265
a behavioral interview has really
helped me make a connection and

56
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:36.920
hit it off with
an engineering manager and.

57
00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.680
&gt;&gt; Participant 2: If you start making
that connection a lot of times,

58
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.460
they're willing to go over the allotted
time in the interview, and

59
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.137
then that feels really good.

60
00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:49.764
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Participant 2: Especially if you know

61
00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:53.010
you go over time and
don't even notice it maybe.

62
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.445
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes, yeah.

63
00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:56.269
&gt;&gt; Participant 2: So
it can be helpful in that context, too.

64
00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.942
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: And
I've definitely, I'm pretty sure,

65
00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:03.397
that them being able to feel like they
had a good conversation with you,

66
00:04:03.397 --> 00:04:06.899
it does impact what they write
about you in the reviews.

67
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:12.846
Yeah, cuz interviews are also very
subjective, there are a lot of processes,

68
00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:18.793
but it's still based off of how another
engineer feels when they work with you,

69
00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:21.494
and what they think of your skills.

70
00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:22.423
Yes.

71
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:24.702
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Go ahead.

72
00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:28.249
&gt;&gt; Participant: How do you get
the most out of your one-to-ones?

73
00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.521
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: How do I
get the most of the one ones?

74
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.951
I think it depends on what the goal
is of the one ones, if it's-

75
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:36.478
&gt;&gt; Participant: With your manager,

76
00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:37.098
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I see.

77
00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:39.945
&gt;&gt; Participant: Keeping trackin for
instance,

78
00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:40.535
or-
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So

79
00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:46.424
if it's a regular one-on-one that I always
have, for example, with my manager.

80
00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:51.376
I could be better at this as well for
myself, but I try to ask,

81
00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:54.886
first of all, am I meeting expectations?

82
00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:58.169
[LAUGH] Am I doing okay based
off what you're looking at?

83
00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.385
And then trying to see, it's different
because my manager is always asking

84
00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:10.907
me what opportunities I'm seeing that I
think that should be improved as well.

85
00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:14.512
And so it's kind of more a two-way
conversation where he's also asking for

86
00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:16.258
my opinions on things.

87
00:05:16.258 --> 00:05:20.145
So it's a little different but
just also just asking,

88
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:23.022
how you can ask, how can I help you?

89
00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:26.673
Manager, I'm doing my task, but
I have a little bit more for your time.

90
00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:30.957
Is there something that you want me to
focus on that would actually be able to

91
00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:32.318
help you more, right?

92
00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:37.021
Those types of conversations, just kinda
getting a sense of what what they're doing

93
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:39.251
and what they would like more help with.

94
00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:45.217
&gt;&gt; Participant: There's somebody
who had a question around they're

95
00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:50.542
making a career change and
if you're almost kind of ashamed

96
00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:55.138
in sharing things on LinkedIn or
on it's just not.

97
00:05:55.138 --> 00:06:00.777
That they've already built is
kind of in a different field,

98
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:05.766
and so they're trying to,
break into this new area.

99
00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:12.256
And every time they share about it,
it feels bad, I guess.

100
00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:15.086
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah,
that's really difficult.

101
00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:20.602
I wonder if there's anything that you've
experienced in previous field that

102
00:06:20.602 --> 00:06:27.176
would actually help you as an engineer,
and to highlight those abilities, right?

103
00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:30.271
Maybe it's like I've worked with
like numerous other people and

104
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:32.746
always been able to gain
alignment with them.

105
00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:35.541
That's a useful skill as an engineer,
right?

106
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.372
It doesn't have to be
your technical abilities.

107
00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:41.099
&gt;&gt; Participant 3: In this case,
it was a different technical field.

108
00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.599
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: A different
technical field, yeah.

109
00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.587
Yeah, I think trying to find those
common things that would be good in

110
00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:50.828
a software engineering role.

111
00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:53.826
And then just stress that,
don't feel shame.

112
00:06:53.826 --> 00:06:57.609
Cuz I feel people can always tell that
you're feeling shameful about it and

113
00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:58.759
they're like, why?

114
00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:04.235
[LAUGH] be proud of it and
find that thing that actually makes

115
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:10.180
you coz every experience you
learn something important in it.

116
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.676
Take that learning
whether it was a good or

117
00:07:11.676 --> 00:07:13.354
bad thing you've learned
something from it.

118
00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:16.064
Express that in the interviews.

119
00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:20.167
&gt;&gt; Participant: Is it
interesting question.

120
00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:28.255
How would you say the ratio of focusing on
coding skills versus relationship skills,

121
00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:35.721
what kind of balance would you put to
those kind of separate skill tracks?

122
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.107
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So
[LAUGH] I kind of,

123
00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:41.723
think of them like the technical
skill has to be there.

124
00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:45.813
It is the foundation on which
you apply this other stuff.

125
00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:50.451
But without the technical skills, you will
not be able to match you won't be able to

126
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:53.803
take advantage of
the opportunities you're given.

127
00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:55.893
You're not gonna be able
to succeed at them.

128
00:07:55.893 --> 00:08:01.041
So definitely focusing on your technical
foundations and making sure you're

129
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:05.966
really good there while at the same time,
in your little bits of downtime.

130
00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:09.552
While you're still ramping
up as a software engineer,

131
00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:13.148
going to still maintain
those relationships, right?

132
00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:17.889
It's not, I don't find it particularly
time consuming, because you just gonna

133
00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:22.163
split it up to like, I'll do one 30
minute meeting every week, right?

134
00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:27.026
Just one, and then over time,
you're gonna meet quite a lot of people.

135
00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:34.746
&gt;&gt; Participant: Yeah, I personally think
about it almost like a multiplier effect.

136
00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:38.539
It's if you're an incredible engineer,
and you just get better and better and

137
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.734
better at engineering.

138
00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:44.825
That's awesome, but then every
bit of social skills [LAUGH] and

139
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:47.724
relationship building, and trust building.

140
00:08:47.724 --> 00:08:51.933
And these kinds of communication skills,
every little bit that you layer on top of

141
00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.440
that is a multiplier
affect your entire career.

142
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.502
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Participant: So it's yeah,

143
00:08:56.502 --> 00:09:01.696
the foundation is just
being Amazing coder, but.

144
00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:02.272
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes.

145
00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:05.623
&gt;&gt; Participant: As you get better at
these other skills, suddenly boom.

146
00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:10.989
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: So definitely, so-
&gt;&gt; Participant: Opportunities in your lap.

147
00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:12.300
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: I
think in the beginning,

148
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.304
just especially if you're really,
really new focus on the technical skills.

149
00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:20.816
But just save a little bit of time to
start practicing talking with people and

150
00:09:20.816 --> 00:09:22.977
building that connection.

151
00:09:22.977 --> 00:09:27.207
And moving forward,
when you are working with people,

152
00:09:27.207 --> 00:09:32.807
those are actually all opportunities for
you to show up well, right?

153
00:09:32.807 --> 00:09:38.144
When you start working, already be
a great working partner by making sure

154
00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:44.319
you're not coming across in a way that's
very judgy, or making others unsafe.

155
00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:48.829
Those are how you can show
up every day in your work.

156
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:51.837
Even if you may not be amazing
at talking with others yet,

157
00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:55.296
there are little things in how you
come across that you can do now.

158
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:10.059
&gt;&gt; Participant 3: How can
you ask questions without

159
00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:14.549
making the other person feel

160
00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:20.358
they're being inquiring too much.

161
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:24.131
How can you ask open upend
questions that will lead to,

162
00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:27.502
that conversation and
relationship building?

163
00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:31.607
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah, definitely,
there's a thing about consent, right?

164
00:10:31.607 --> 00:10:34.277
If it definitely seems a little touchy,

165
00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:38.291
you can ask questions in a way
that gives them an out, right?

166
00:10:38.291 --> 00:10:43.950
You're like that sounds really difficult.

167
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.246
And then if they want to talk about it,
right?

168
00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:49.937
It's a very gentle nudge, I'd love to hear
about it if you wanted to talk about it.

169
00:10:49.937 --> 00:10:51.888
But if they don't, you just let them go.

170
00:10:51.888 --> 00:10:55.456
Don't keep trying to trail down into that.

171
00:10:55.456 --> 00:11:01.498
And other things is just if you look
at their body language and their face,

172
00:11:01.498 --> 00:11:06.476
usually people are not very
careful in how they come across.

173
00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:11.746
And so you can kind of tell you start to
pick up, they don't wanna talk about that.

174
00:11:11.746 --> 00:11:13.332
It's uncomfortable, right?

175
00:11:13.332 --> 00:11:17.386
Or they'll even just change the subject
for you and you just follow them?

176
00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:21.140
You don't wanna force anyone, but
I think always asking, in a way,

177
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.206
in a question, just like,
do you want to talk about it?

178
00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:29.346
I think it's a good way to give
them the option to do it or not.

179
00:11:29.346 --> 00:11:32.146
&gt;&gt; Participant: What's your
advice if you have someone on

180
00:11:32.146 --> 00:11:34.474
your team you genuinely dislike?

181
00:11:34.474 --> 00:11:38.704
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Well, if you're
not gonna leave on to another team,

182
00:11:38.704 --> 00:11:43.969
you're gonna have to just figure
out how to work with this person.

183
00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:46.271
You could go very toxic with this, right?

184
00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:49.530
If they're actually genuinely very,
very hard to work with,

185
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.132
then you do the corporate way.

186
00:11:51.132 --> 00:11:56.669
Which is, you start gathering evidence of
how their actions are making it hard for

187
00:11:56.669 --> 00:12:01.653
everybody to deliver, and
then you bring it up to the manager.

188
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.565
That's the very toxic,

189
00:12:03.565 --> 00:12:09.893
formal way of work trying to resolve
something when it's a really bad case.

190
00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:14.343
But if it's just a mild case,
I think you could try and give feedback.

191
00:12:14.343 --> 00:12:16.057
But if they don't take it well.

192
00:12:16.057 --> 00:12:19.716
Because maybe it is you not
giving the feedback well,

193
00:12:19.716 --> 00:12:23.787
or they didn't receive it,
talking to your manager.

194
00:12:23.787 --> 00:12:24.647
That doesn't work.

195
00:12:26.017 --> 00:12:30.216
I guess your options are either to stay on
the team and accept it, or leave the team.

196
00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:30.769
&gt;&gt; Participant 4: Right,

197
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:34.727
I work with someone that I think
was very difficult before.

198
00:12:34.727 --> 00:12:37.721
So, we're on same project.

199
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:43.011
And I discovered he wasn't on chat team,
so I chatted him and

200
00:12:43.011 --> 00:12:49.361
told him, you are not online,
something you're not showing visible.

201
00:12:50.631 --> 00:12:54.001
And his response was,
why are you trailing me?

202
00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:55.274
Are you my supervisor?

203
00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.055
Something like, I want to report him.

204
00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:01.065
So I said, no you got this wrong.

205
00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:04.775
I'm just trying to see if you have
a problem with your connection or

206
00:13:04.775 --> 00:13:08.432
we are on the same team or if I have
any issue I can always fall back.

207
00:13:10.095 --> 00:13:12.645
&gt;&gt; Participant 4: So
that was a soft tool one.

208
00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:17.550
Another thing, time, you often thinks
I'm I was trying to probably offend him.

209
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.510
He's only offensive anyway.

210
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.660
So there was a time he came
in to me without telling me.

211
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.800
He just called me on Teams and
said, I shouldn't have done this.

212
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.693
I should have told you earlier before.

213
00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:32.090
I said, no, you are my priority.

214
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.900
We are on the same team.

215
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.365
And I was always responding to his
own harsh way with ease and calm.

216
00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:43.352
And eventually we became best of friends.

217
00:13:43.352 --> 00:13:44.681
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: That's good.

218
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:48.515
&gt;&gt; Participant 5: So
I think anybody you can handle people.

219
00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:51.836
Eventually, I knew he was going through
because he had to tell me that he was

220
00:13:51.836 --> 00:13:54.120
going through some problems,
and he apologized.

221
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.621
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah.

222
00:13:54.621 --> 00:13:55.591
&gt;&gt; Participant 5: I've been at being very.

223
00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:57.435
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Participant 5: Awkward to you, I'm so

224
00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:57.984
sorry.

225
00:13:57.984 --> 00:14:02.461
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Your story is very
similar to another story I've heard where,

226
00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:04.075
and that is the thing.

227
00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:09.903
It's sometimes when people are coming
across very aggressive or prickly, maybe

228
00:14:09.903 --> 00:14:15.658
they're actually going through something
difficult in their personal lives.

229
00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:17.305
And it's coming out that way.

230
00:14:17.305 --> 00:14:21.793
And so if we don't engage in it,
and we're actually that's okay,

231
00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:25.791
give them benefit of the doubt and
still being calm.

232
00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:30.962
And if you somehow have a face to
face conversation, to talk it out,

233
00:14:30.962 --> 00:14:35.569
without judging them, or
shaming or blaming them.

234
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:40.163
Sometimes, they'll actually just say, I'm
sorry, I'm actually having a really bad

235
00:14:40.163 --> 00:14:44.109
time right now and
I'm coming across on you, I know that.

236
00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:46.202
And I'll try to be better, right?

237
00:14:46.202 --> 00:14:50.241
Give them a chance to
actually apologize maybe,

238
00:14:50.241 --> 00:14:54.892
as long as you don't keep
being aggressive with them.

239
00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:58.227
They may actually apologize for you.

240
00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:02.613
&gt;&gt; Participant: Yeah, and in my own
experience in this one is just find

241
00:15:02.613 --> 00:15:08.367
the thing that you both know, or
you know that you both want and try to.

242
00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:11.244
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Get
the alignment incentives aligned.

243
00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:15.086
&gt;&gt; Participant: Yes, center your thinking
and also the conversation around.

244
00:15:15.086 --> 00:15:17.726
Hey, we're both trying to do this right?

245
00:15:17.726 --> 00:15:21.175
And then they're, yeah, okay?

246
00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:23.269
What's your ideas here?

247
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:27.096
And I feel that breaks things open,
so many times,

248
00:15:27.096 --> 00:15:31.991
because it's just this is something
we obviously both want, and

249
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:35.466
just starting off with
that in a positive way.

250
00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:41.903
I feel almost every single conflict
that I've had with people working,

251
00:15:41.903 --> 00:15:45.714
that's just broken through the the trap.

252
00:15:45.714 --> 00:15:49.656
The doors, trap doors or whatever,
cuz you're getting it off what I think or

253
00:15:49.656 --> 00:15:52.326
what I feel or what they think and
what they feel, and

254
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.234
you're putting it on
something that you both want.

255
00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:58.023
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yeah, that's
actually, that's really good advice, and

256
00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:01.315
it's also, I think, very similar
to finding that win win situation.

257
00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:05.937
So when you talk to this person,
if you can figure out what incentives

258
00:16:05.937 --> 00:16:09.935
are driving them,
you can see if you can find an alignment.

259
00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:13.155
So that even if you disagree, you said,

260
00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:17.907
we can find a common path to
continue moving forward still.

261
00:16:17.907 --> 00:16:20.604
&gt;&gt; Participant: And then the part is,
if you still can't through,

262
00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:24.075
it's somebody has to make
the decision whether it's a manager.

263
00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:26.707
&gt;&gt; Francesca Sadikin: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Participant: There's two viable things,

264
00:16:26.707 --> 00:16:29.864
can we just pick one and
both get behind it.
