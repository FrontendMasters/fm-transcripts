00:00:00.174 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now,
our next exercise, let's jump ahead.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.431
So we'll say npm start exercise babel 1.

3
00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:17.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And now, we should see
our tests failing, snapshot is failing.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.708
Now, things look slightly different.

5
00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:24.344
So we have three console logs.

6
00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.716
One of them's in the root at the very
bottom, that one wasn't changed.

7
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:32.160
But the other two that are inside
of functions did change.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.732
So now, we want to also include
the name of the function here.

9
00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
I think that you can get that.

10
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.010
Wait, if we just look here.

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.500
Here we are at our MemberExpression,
our CallExpression.

12
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.240
This is what we're visiting.

13
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.522
If we look at the parent and do a
findParent to find a function declaration,

14
00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:07.426
then we can find the function
declaration that this thing belongs in.

15
00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:12.466
And get the name from that
function declaration.

16
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:17.131
Yeah, it's pretty much, if you
remember from my little demo before,

17
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.503
where we were looking for
the program, I said path.findParent.

18
00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:23.804
And then t.isProgram.

19
00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:26.878
You'll be doing something very
similar to that, just not program,

20
00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.630
cuz you're not looking for a program.

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.970
Okay, and then based off of
the function declaration, if it exists,

22
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.800
then you'll add a little prefix.
