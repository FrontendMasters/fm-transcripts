00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.420
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: We're gonna round
npm start exercise ES Lint two.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.074
So now you should have that
looks like function in here,

3
00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:12.218
and your plugin should look similar
to what we just solved for.

4
00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:19.305
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And
then your test should be failing.

5
00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.704
So if we run npm start
to start up our test

6
00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:27.804
again,
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Your

7
00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:32.632
test should fail because,
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Your

8
00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:38.579
console.1 up here in the valid is
specifying some options saying

9
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.580
that one is okay, but
we're saying there's an error.

10
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.340
So this is where you need to learn about
the schema property in our configuration

11
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.230
and I'll just show you that here.

12
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.300
Schema is pretty much all you do.

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.390
Provide an array and

14
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.300
what you need to do is provide
an object in that schema.

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.330
So this is JSON schema,
I'll show you the docs to go look that up.

16
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.366
But you need to fill this in with a JSON

17
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:20.403
schema object with a property that is

18
00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:25.767
called allowedMethods, that accepts

19
00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:32.606
any of the console log
methods as an array, okay?

20
00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:36.600
Cool, so the docs for this,
I'll paste this in the chat.

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.040
Lives in options schemas and
there's a link to JSON schema.

22
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560
If you're not familiar with JSON schema,
don't worry.

23
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.340
I wasn't either when I made this exercise
and it's fairly straightforward.

24
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.780
I'll just give you a little pro tip

25
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.180
that there's these examples
in JSON schema's website.

26
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.600
And let's see,
the simple example is pretty useful.

27
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.000
You can look at some of these examples to
see what your schema should look like.

28
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.490
After you've defined your schema,

29
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.840
then you can start accepting
the options that have been provided.

30
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.020
And you get those from the context.

31
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.609
So it would be context.options, and

32
00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:32.220
that'll be an array of
the options that you're passed.

33
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.520
So I'll leave this up so
everybody can see this.

34
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.690
Here I'll even paste a link to
this example right here, so

35
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.350
you can look at that.
