00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.371
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
you're gonna do the second exercise,

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:05.855
npm start exercise babble 2.

3
00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:14.441
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And we added another
thing to the mix and that is this multiply

4
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:20.680
function but it's a narrow function,
not a function declaration.

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.000
And so we need to be able to
get the name of that thing.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.941
And actually just to save on time and

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.440
we'll just do both of this together
cuz it all is kinda related.

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.980
Let's go ahead and
skip ahead to step three.

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.518
And this is the last step for
our babble plugin and

10
00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:43.619
all this does is it adds
another function expression.

11
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.550
And so yeah,
just update your babble plugin so

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.740
it can handle both of those cases.

13
00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.812
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Shoot, no rats,
no doing that gives you the solution,

14
00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:59.610
I hadn't thought about that, rats.

15
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.180
Okay forget it.

16
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.255
Go back to,
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Go back to 2.

17
00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:07.812
We'll just do one at a time.

18
00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.879
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: But if you want to
you can add that to your test and

19
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.810
do that if you finish early.
