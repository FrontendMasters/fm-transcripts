00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.720
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah,
my name's Kent C Dodds.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.488
This is a bunch of links and
information about me.

3
00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:06.600
I work for PayPal.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.250
I live in Utah.

5
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.980
I have a family.

6
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.250
We're expecting another baby in September.

7
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
So one wife, four kids coming up.

8
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.510
So that'll be fun.

9
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.450
And yeah, if you want to see what
all these things are all about,

10
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.750
I have my link to my slides right here,
which if somebody could put that in

11
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.360
the chat that be pretty awesome,
kcd.im/asts-workshop-slides.

12
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.090
Let's set up some expectations here so
we're all on the same page.

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.238
We are not gonna be doing
air squats the whole time.

14
00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:42.991
We are gonna be talking
about abstract syntax trees,

15
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:49.326
gonna give an introduction to what
that even is and why you should care,

16
00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:55.788
and give some practical examples of
traversing and manipulating ASTs.

17
00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.270
It's gonna be super cool.

18
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.611
I'm not going to give you a super deep
dive into all the tools and ASTs.

19
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:11.782
We will go pretty deep, and the exercises
are part of what makes you learn ASTs.

20
00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:14.795
There's no shortcut to
getting experience with ASTs,

21
00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:16.790
you just have to work with them a lot.

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.890
And we'll be doing that
a lot during this workshop.

23
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.680
We're also not gonna actual publish
a plugin package for ESLint or Babel.

24
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.590
There are great docs for
how to do that, and

25
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.620
so I'll leave you to look at the docs for
that.

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.000
Most of what we'll be doing is
working with the AST specifically.

27
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.609
Okay, so the setup.

28
00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.463
The reason that I have everybody setup
before the workshop is to make sure that

29
00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:47.958
there aren't any problems.

30
00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.390
And there was a problem
somebody found this morning.

31
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.140
Thank you so much to that person.

32
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.380
Actually gonna give that
individual a shout out.

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.510
This guy, thank you.

34
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.410
He found a serious bug for
Windows users in particular.

35
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.760
So yeah, regardless of your platform, I'd
like it if you could run this setup again.

36
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.643
I would recommend just blow
away your directory or

37
00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:16.530
go rename your directory and
start from scratch.

38
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.340
And I'll leave this here for just a sec,
or actually I'll just go the chat and

39
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.150
paste this in.

40
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.120
Cool, yeah, so you can have
that running in the background.

41
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.518
Change YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM
to your email.

42
00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:38.898
And yeah, so just a couple of logistics.

43
00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:44.760
Mark talked about it mostly, but
just to make sure I cover everything.

44
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.637
The way that we're gonna do things is for
every exercise,

45
00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:55.760
well actually I'll cover this later,
let's just get into things and

46
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.380
then I'll talk about how we're gonna be
doing the exercises and stuff in a sec.
