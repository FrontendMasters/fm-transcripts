00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
this next one is quite a bit bigger.

2
00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:08.143
Let's go ahead and
run the exercise script.

3
00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:14.065
So we'll run,
it's number two is our exercise,

4
00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:17.312
so exercises.esn.two.

5
00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.593
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That wasn't
the one we just were on?

6
00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:20.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Maybe it was.

7
00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:21.780
Yes, so it was, you're right.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.386
How did?
Wait a second.

9
00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:30.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You're right,
that was the one we were just on.

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.391
Three,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Sorry.

11
00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:38.009
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let me copy
that one over to the chat.

12
00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:44.219
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, so
now your code should look like mine.

13
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:50.596
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And we have a new case here.

14
00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:56.035
So somebody, some person,
decided that it would be a good idea to

15
00:00:56.035 --> 00:01:01.620
reassign console to CSL, I don't know,
and then start calling stuff on that.

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.406
Maybe they didn't like that our es lint
rule was yelling at them or something.

17
00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:09.583
So this is where things really
start to get edge casey.

18
00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:12.649
And you can think of some
really edge case things,

19
00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.110
like what if they assign this to x?

20
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.320
And then, wait, we're gonna bind,
or take the log and

21
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.520
bind it to CSL or console or
something like that, now we're calling x.

22
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.500
So there's a point where you just say,
okay, I'm not gonna cover that edge case,

23
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.195
because anybody writing code like that
doesn't deserve to have my plugin.

24
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:36.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But there are like, if it

25
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.490
really is important to you, the cool thing
is that you can do it, it's possible.

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.120
You can handle these edge cases.

27
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.840
And this is one that we definitely can,
and the workshop does.
