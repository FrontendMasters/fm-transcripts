00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.700
Okay, exercise time.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.630
So you just learned a bunch
of different directives.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.070
What you're gonna make is
this little calculator.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.020
All it's gonna do is it's
going to add numbers together.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.870
Then we're going to have
a little select drop down.

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.924
And as soon as you click something for
the select drop down,

7
00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:25.401
you're going to conditionally
render something onto the page.

8
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:30.620
So this will not be rendered onto
the page until you've selected something.

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.730
I've given you a code pen
to fork to begin with.

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.150
If we look at this pen,
you have a span for

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.110
all of these and you can change
the tags to whatever you need to.

12
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.850
And we have this just
hard coded onto the page,

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.130
but it will eventually
will need something else.

14
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.755
And I've even started you off with an app
with the kind of basic things that

15
00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.633
you'll need to get started.
