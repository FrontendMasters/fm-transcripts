00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:04.169
The last thing that we're gonna cover
in this animation section is a Nuxt

2
00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:05.180
page transition.

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.680
I mentioned Nuxt offers us like
all of these really amazing things

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.860
right out of the box.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.300
One of them is just assumes that you might
wanna transition component for a page so

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.410
you're immediately able
to make transitions.

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.745
So for review, we have these enter and

8
00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.450
leave states,
it's always gonna use page hooks.

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.490
So it's basically assuming that
transition component is called page.

10
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.939
And so you can say, page-enter-active,
page-leave-active page-enter-from and

11
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.600
to, and you can state these
things in any CSS file.

12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.150
So we can create animation for our pages.

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.920
And then we can have pages slide across.

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.630
Don't make pages slide all the way across.

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.230
It's a goofy animation but it's for
the purposes of demonstration.

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.090
But you don't have to
do anything in order to

17
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.148
have those hooks, they already have
the hooks available to you in that

18
00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:09.050
page-enter-active and
page-leave-active, which is so nice.

19
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.020
That's really, really cool.

20
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.980
You can also make page
specific animations as well.

21
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.260
So let's say you want all pages
to animate a certain way,

22
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.160
but there's one page you want
to animate a different way.

23
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.210
You can say transition fadeOpacity.

24
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
And then declare that either in assets or

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.690
in a scoped style within
that same page template.

26
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.230
And then we can do this and
then if we click on the Contact page,

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.890
you can see that that one
fades instead of goes across.

28
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.850
So we can do different ones for that.

29
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.298
We also have page specific JavaScript
hooks, which is really awesome.

30
00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:53.520
So it to remember there's like before
enter, enter leave all of these things.

31
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.300
And this is how we typically declare it.

32
00:01:56.342 --> 00:02:03.820
In Nuxt.Js for that page, what we
would say is transition in an object.

33
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.710
And we could state things, we have
transition modes even, we could say,

34
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.040
wait for this one page to move out,
and then let the other page move in.

35
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.490
That's typically really hard to do,
because routing usually doesn't wait for

36
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.230
one state or another.

37
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.800
So in this case,
we have CSS false mode out in.

38
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.359
And then you can work with things the way
that you would have worked with them when

39
00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.193
you were working with JavaScript
took in a transition component.

40
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:36.014
So I can do all sorts of
kind of fancy GSAP things,

41
00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:38.636
do not ever do this [LAUGH] series.

42
00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:42.600
So you could do really goofy things.

43
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.990
But you could also do things that
are really more seamless and nice.

44
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.250
So, what about that single element
that I flipped upside down?

45
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.615
You can still plug in to
that page specific hook and

46
00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:58.985
access different properties if you want.

47
00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:04.325
You don't have to pass in, you pass in
the EL, you could pass in a selector.

48
00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:08.015
You could pass in a ref,
which accesses the DOM nodes or

49
00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.845
you could add it to a lifecycle hook.

50
00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:14.690
So the sky is endless,
open, can of worms is open,

51
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.020
something to that effect,
you have a lot available to you.

52
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.009
Now if I was gonna plan, something that
would be coordinated in a really slick

53
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.311
way across all of these
different Nuxt positions,

54
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:32.557
remember the things that stay constant,
can live in layouts/default.view.

55
00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:37.240
So I have that Nuxt component but remember
I added that navigation component.

56
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.990
So I was able to add a navigation,
above that next component.

57
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.930
It's stayed stable on all the pages.

58
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.230
So let's get fancier.

59
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.100
What we could do is we could be alerted to
when something's changing in that header,

60
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.980
that navigation is the same for
our application.

61
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.520
It's not being reloaded or re rendered.

62
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:07.840
So I could transition pieces of that
application in next as I change each page.

63
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.373
So I have this demo app,
you can go check out all of the code here.

64
00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:16.405
And there's the live version here
if you want to check it out.

65
00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:21.870
So this whole header is one
unit that uses the same piece.

66
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.912
I'm just plugging in slightly
different pieces as I transition.

67
00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:32.790
So, if I go to this page, she changes
position and we move components around.

68
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.880
And we can move from page
to page because remember,

69
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.830
transitions just take one state and
go to the other state.

70
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.680
It doesn't matter what order they are in.

71
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.460
So I can create these kind of
native like page transitions.

72
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.810
And it can even be dynamic.

73
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.566
So, I switched to this woman instead and
now it goes to this woman and

74
00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:57.830
I can change the state of the application
and make native like animations.
