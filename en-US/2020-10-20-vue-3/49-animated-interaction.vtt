00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.310
Let's connect things to
interaction really quick.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.010
So we have this little Wally, he has his
cockroach friend, and he looks around.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.030
So we're going to go over to our little,
you controlled Wally.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.490
I'll move this over and
I'll say So he's like,

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.270
looking around and bopping around, and
he's gonna try to reach out to him.

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.080
And then every time I pass this point,
he's gonna say wow.

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.990
And basically the way that this
is done is well first of all,

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.240
if I stopped moving the cockroach around,
you might notice that he does this little

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.450
and then he blinks a little bit and
he does some other things.

10
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.610
That's because living, breathing things,
move and blink, even when they're

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.520
sitting still, they don't ever just sit
completely still even little robots.

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.150
So, I have a repeated timeline
that does that on a loop.

13
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.825
And I call that on the mounted hook.

14
00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:04.930
So as soon as this component is mounted,

15
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.880
I set a timeline to do all
sorts of like movie little

16
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.700
Bobby things in this Yo Yo True in
G SAP will allow me to repeat things.

17
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.370
You can also see that when I pass
a certain point his head turns around.

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.530
This is done by setting

19
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.830
I have I'm capturing mouse move
coordinates like I did before earlier.

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.650
And once it gets to a certain
point in the screen,

21
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.160
what I'm doing is transform
translating his eyes.

22
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.930
So I'm binding a style that transforms
his eyes this way instead of this way.

23
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.700
So that's that's bound here.

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.030
And the last piece of this is that we're
scrubbing his arms across the page.

25
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.860
And what I did was I made
a timeline of him going like this.

26
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.940
And as I mentioned before, with green
sock, you can create a timeline.

27
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.870
And then you can actually access that
timeline and access the progress.

28
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.200
So I'm mapping that progress
to the coordinates.

29
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.550
So if you look at methods,
we've got the arms timeline.

30
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.840
So that's that whole timeline
where I'm moving the arms.

31
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.470
And then in coordinates
I'm passing in the E and

32
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.580
here we have this startArms,
which was that, that animation timeline.

33
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.620
And I'm saying, pause it, but
allow me to scrub it across the screen.

34
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.720
So you can make all sorts of cool
interaction between view and

35
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.946
green sock this way.

36
00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:45.570
So @mousemove="coordinates", and we're
flipping that head by binding the class.

37
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.050
So we've got this flip is false, and
then we're binding it to the false.

38
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.900
And then we've got this
getBoundingClientRect for the Walle.

39
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.180
I'm detecting when we're
crossing that BoundingClientRect.

40
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.950
Then I'm plotting
the progress of the arms.

41
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.630
And again, in the mounted hook,
as soon as that component is mounted,

42
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.320
I have these repeated things that
are fired over and over again.

43
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.690
I made this big, crazy site that's
like one it's a giant view x or

44
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.970
as a giant view view animation
that's like one big SVG.

45
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.320
And it uses scroll trigger, and

46
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.920
G SAP to coordinate all of
these different animations.

47
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.350
And you can also turn the animations
off using a view x store and

48
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.000
it will turn all the animations
off in case of motion sensitivity.

49
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.540
If you're interested learning
about how that was done.

50
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.260
I wrote a making of post and
also, it's all open source.

51
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.580
So you can check out the little GitHub

52
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.390
icon there if you want to learn how to how
to coordinate scroll with you as well.
