00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:03.920
Okay, let do another use case I
am showing you a lot of use cases

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.740
with methods because methods are something
that we are gonna use all the time.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.850
It is just one of the most important
tools in your tool basket toolbox.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.730
Yes, that's right toolbox.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.790
So we're gonna go over a few
different examples of that.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.360
So, I've got a bunch of data
that is actually from a real

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.950
Netflix API hard coded here, but

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.640
this is actually real data that you can
get when you're working with Netflix API.

9
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.160
So, if I say,
lowest rating to highest rated,

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.205
you can see all of that data filter and
change.

11
00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:42.327
And I don't really know why black mirror
is so low like I really love that show.

12
00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:45.207
And Grey's Anatomy is
really high I have no idea

13
00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.710
why people like the things that they do.

14
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.940
So, okay,
if we're looking through lowest rated and

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.560
highest rated and we're going to make
that work, how would we make that work?

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.850
We have at click sort lowest,
and at click sort highest.

17
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.850
As you might imagine, those are two
methods that we are going to create.

18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.710
Then we've also got this table.

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.131
We've got a table that is outputting,
some head pieces, and

20
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:15.050
we're looping through to
create all of the rows here.

21
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.030
And something to mention
because we did item in items.

22
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.160
I kind of touched on this earlier, you
might think that you need to put something

23
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.670
with an S and then just the thing
in order to like plurals of s and

24
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.660
then the thing like item in items.

25
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.670
But English doesn't really work
that consistently like if you have

26
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.150
occupy there's no like singular,
I think it's like octopus and occupy.

27
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.640
So, it doesn't really
quite work like that.

28
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.950
So this can actually be
whatever you want it to be.

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.300
It does not have to be
the singular version of this.

30
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.767
You can name it whatever you want to.

31
00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:53.013
And that's really helpful when we start to
get into computed properties because you

32
00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.830
might notice that you'll start to change.

33
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.130
This value as we work with computed, and

34
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.880
it's all of the rest of this stays stable,
right?

35
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.820
Like I can easily switch that out and

36
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.750
everything inside of it doesn't
need to be changed as well.

37
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.000
But we'll get into that a little bit more
when we talk about computed properties.

38
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.170
Now when we look at the app.

39
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.660
We've got columns which are title and
rating.

40
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.290
We know from before with the model that I
could have used like a different type of

41
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.690
index for that and pass in the v4 and
grab the key and things like that.

42
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.250
But, instead of doing
that I named it title and

43
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.980
rating just in case I wanna
change the name of that later.

44
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.210
So it's a little bit more flexible to if I

45
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.950
don't want it to be exactly
bound to this title and rating.

46
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.220
That's just a choice.

47
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.140
You can do it either way.

48
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.819
I just wanted to show you that you don't
necessarily have to do it that way.

49
00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.571
And if we look at our methods, we've
got this sort lowest it's this .ratings

50
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:55.539
info .sort and then we're using sort
to kind of look and compare and

51
00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:00.440
say, okay, is it higher or
is it lower and output that to the page.

52
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.720
So here we'll go back
to the code pen here.

53
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.910
Just so you can see it all in one place.

54
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.500
In our app,
we have all of this ratings information.

55
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.340
We've got our 2 columns of title and
rating.

56
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.160
And then we've got our
methods sort lowest and

57
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.595
sort highest in just kind of a one liner.

58
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:28.070
I wanna mention too, because the this
dot binding is really important.

59
00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:34.905
We wanna establish a relationship
with these properties in this.

60
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:37.165
We can't use an arrow function here,

61
00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:41.215
on the method because that
would not create that binding.

62
00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:46.335
We can use an arrow function once we're
inside of that method, but it would

63
00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:52.288
lose the this dot binding if we started to
use an arrow function at this top level.

64
00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:56.600
So we're gonna say sort lowest
this dot ratings info and

65
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.070
then we're sorting based on
the rating based on .rating here and

66
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.281
then if we look over here we sort
titles by sort, lowest, sort highest.

67
00:04:10.281 --> 00:04:13.091
We loop through key and columns, entry and

68
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.222
ratings info and
then that outputs to the page.
