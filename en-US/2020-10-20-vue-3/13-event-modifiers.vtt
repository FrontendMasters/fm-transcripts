00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.787
We have modifiers in, our @ or v-on, so

2
00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:09.976
we have @mousemove.stop is
comparable to e.stopPropagation.

3
00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:13.496
If you've been coding for a while,
you're probably very used to writing

4
00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:17.496
stopPropagation over and over again, it's
really nice to have a modifier for it.

5
00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.994
@mousemove.prevent is like
e.preventDefault, the same thing.

6
00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:27.422
@submit.prevent is really helpful, because
you probably use it a lot in forms,

7
00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:31.857
it will no longer reload the page
on submission, so I use this a lot.

8
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:37.883
@click.once is not to be confused
with the v-once that we just saw.

9
00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:42.755
@click.once means the click event will
only be triggered once, it doesn't mean

10
00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:47.625
it's only rendered once to the page, so
anytime you want something to be clicked,

11
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:51.799
and then you don't want them to be able
to keep on clicking or they can but

12
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.355
it just doesn't keep submitting,
then the click.once is really helpful.

13
00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:00.719
@click.native is so that you can
listen to native events in the DOM.

14
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.501
So like I mentioned before,
abstractions are really wonderful, but

15
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.358
if you can't dive beneath them,
then you get into trouble sometimes.

16
00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:12.892
What's really nice about view, is that it
lets you dive beneath the abstraction if

17
00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:15.740
you need to, so
rather than using the virtual DOM and

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.242
DOM diffing, @click.native allows you
to have access to those native events.

19
00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:23.556
You can also use keycodes as a view three,

20
00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:27.354
you can no longer use numbers for
the key codes.

21
00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:30.255
We used to be able to use numbers for
the keycodes, and

22
00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:33.556
the reason why we're changing
that is the HTML spec change.

23
00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:37.338
The HTML spec is deprecating the use
of numbered keycodes, and so

24
00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:42.015
we're moving just along with that HTML
spec and we're using two names instead,

25
00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:45.480
and if you need more information,
I've linked it up here.
