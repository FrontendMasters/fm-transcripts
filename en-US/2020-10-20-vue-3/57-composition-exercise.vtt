00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:05.140
Okay, exercise time, refactor this
example to the composition API.

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.572
You remember this comment form, this one
is the simple one that's just an array.

3
00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:16.940
So I say I like tacos and
you can look at it here.

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.581
So here's how it was done before.

5
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:22.104
We had that new comments,
the comments array,

6
00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:27.830
we were adding a comment that pushes and
turns this into an empty string.

7
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.324
I also put this little watch
in here because I want

8
00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:34.594
you to practice using a watch
in the composition API.

9
00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:35.954
You can use watch or

10
00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:40.794
watch effect for this,
either one is okay for this exercise.
