00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.110
So exercise time,

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.380
we are going to take this CodePen
with these individual comments.

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.360
Remember, I like tacos, and we had this
Mr. Magoo guy show up with a new tacos.

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.170
Right now all of the logic that we
have is in our top most app component.

5
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.720
We have the comments,
we have the new comment,

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.250
we've got the methods that
we're adding a comment.

7
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.370
What I want you to do is to
create an application with and

8
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.880
make these components and
put that logic into the store instead.

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.222
So the component will have a little bit
of state of its own, but really what it's

10
00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:52.431
doing is letting view x store all of that
data and also update all of that data.
