00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
Modifiers I mentioned before that Vue
gives us some things that make it really

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.580
easy because it's like, hey, you probably
need to do this over and over again.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.980
Don't worry, I've got your back.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.802
So these modifiers are really helpful.

5
00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:17.160
The v-model.trim will strip any leading or
trailing whitespace from the bound string.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.612
The v-model.number changes strings to
number inputs JavaScript is a fun beast,

7
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.820
in a way [LAUGH] it
loves to coerce things.

8
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.720
So in this case, we can absolutely make
sure that our numbers are numbers and

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.736
not strings when we start to handle them.

10
00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:38.075
V-model.lazy won't populate
the content automatically,

11
00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:40.805
it will wait to bind
until an event happens.

12
00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:44.735
So it listens to change events,
instead of input.

13
00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:48.675
And I use the v-model.lazy
a lot to aid in performance.

14
00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:54.492
So in this demo itself,
I actually am using the v-model.lazy.

15
00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:58.380
I am lazy because I'm not
actually doing anything with this

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.510
input until I click Write Me, right?

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.730
I don't need to keep track
of every single update.

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.590
I just need it once I'm done.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.960
So that's a good use case for
the v-model.lazy.

20
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.170
It's also really good for form
validations, like let's say you're going

21
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.950
to do some validations and you don't
want it error as the person's typing,

22
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.190
you want it to evaluate once they're done.

23
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.353
That's a really good use case for
v-model.lazy as well.
