1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.880
V-If and V-Show.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.860
This is a conditional that
will display information

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.830
depending on meeting a requirement.

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.240
This can be anything, buttons forms,
divs components, you name it.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.910
So it's really flexible.

6
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.240
So if I right What is your
favorite kind of taco and

7
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.910
I say all puster you can see how
that button shows up as I'm typing.

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.560
If I get rid of it, then it goes away.

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.700
And what we have here Is if we
are gonna Beit Babel JavaScript tab.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.480
You can see tacos is an empty string here.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.300
So if it is an empty string,

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.530
it will say okay we do not have
anything evaluates to false.

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.300
So if we say V- If tacos it
is not then it will go away.

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.140
And then if I start typing, it shows up so
that can be used for a lot of things.

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.790
If I go into here, let's go look at what
we see in the DOM here for a second.

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.900
So if we actually go into
the elements in the DOM,

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.275
what you'll see is that text area, and
then you'll see this commented out V-If.

18
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.910
And as I start to type, you will
see that buttons start to show up.

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.430
So basically it's mounting
that button into the DOM and

20
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.180
removing it as necessary as it
evaluates to true or false.

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.100
Now if I change this V-If to V-Show

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.100
what it will do instead and I'll save
it here and I'll open this up again.

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.470
If I go into my evaluated code here,

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.200
I have the button, but
now it's style display none.

25
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.960
And the reason why we offer both of those
is if you have something that you know is

26
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.630
gonna be toggled back and forth and shown
back and forth a lot, then using V-Show

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.080
is really helpful because mounting a whole
component into the DOM can be expensive.

28
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.630
So what we're doing instead is we're just
showing and hiding and showing and hiding.

29
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
If on the other hand, you have a lot of
information, let's say you have a big

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.540
component or something, and you don't want
it to just be in the DOM chilling and

31
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.000
display none because that's
a lot to then it makes.

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.290
It makes a lot of sense
to use V-If instead.

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.625
V-If and V-Else should, anytime you have
an if you need an else statement, right,

34
00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:24.270
so we have V-If, V-Else and V-else-if,
just like conditionals in JavaScript.

35
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.100
So this is pretty straightforward.

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.030
You can conditionally render one thing or
another.

37
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360
There's also the else V as I mentioned.

38
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.830
They must be siblings.

39
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.780
So you can't have a V-if and

40
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.910
then a V-else nested somewhere else they
must be next to each other siblings.

41
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.620
So that view knows, okay, those are the
two things that you're referring to.

42
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.600
So if we have something
like do you like tacos?

43
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.030
Yes is a thumbs up?

44
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.540
No is you're a monster
because that's reasonable.

45
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.286
Then you can look over here
we say v if tacos = yes,

46
00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:03.231
note the string I'm passing
in here as well, right?

47
00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:05.130
V else-if = no.

48
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.750
So I'm able to set a conditional of
either that's yes or no in this state.

49
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.930
And you might notice this
is one of those view pens.

50
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.490
So if I open it up, you can see
the templates and all of these inputs.

51
00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:22.564
And the V-If tacos is yes,
the V-else-if tacos is no and

52
00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:26.789
the tacos again is an empty string,
tacos are empty strings today.
