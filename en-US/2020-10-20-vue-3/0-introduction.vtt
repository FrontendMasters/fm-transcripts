00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.010
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.020
I'm Sara Drasner.

3
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.160
I'm really excited to be here
today in part because I just love

4
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.640
giving workshops for Frontend masters but

5
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.440
also because I'm a huge fan of
Frontend Masters as a student.

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.220
This is just one of my favorite
platforms for learning.

7
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.368
So today we're gonna talk about Vue.js.

8
00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:17.588
As I mentioned before,
my name is Sarah Drasner.

9
00:00:17.588 --> 00:00:22.170
This is me as a child picking my nose and
also my relationship with authority.

10
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.800
If you need to get in touch with me,
that is my handle on Twitter, @sarah_edo.

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.020
So if you need to ask me questions or

12
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.200
anything like that,
that's where you can find me.

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.240
I am VP of developer
experience at Netlify.

14
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.985
And I'm also on the Vue core team.

15
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:40.955
Right now I'm really focused on Docs work
which is really exciting because we have

16
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:43.995
this major release for
Vue 3 that just came out.

17
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:45.465
So I got to work on that.

18
00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.725
And you might notice that
a couple of examples here and

19
00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:49.345
there are similar to the Docs.

20
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:54.315
That's because I wrote them, so
you'll see a lot of different examples and

21
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:55.735
some from that area.

22
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.960
So why are we talking about Vue today?

23
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.140
Why should we spend
a whole day covering Vue?

24
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.680
Well, there are a couple
of different reasons.

25
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.790
One is it's really amazing framework that
a lot of people like around the world.

26
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.700
You might notice that it's the second most
starred GitHub repository in the world

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.280
after Free Code Camp.

28
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.560
Does this matter?

29
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.990
No, that doesn't matter at all.

30
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.460
GitHub stars are not a reflection
of how good something is.

31
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.855
But it doesn't not matter in the sense
that it does show that people really like

32
00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:29.490
Vue, people really like working
with Vue all over the world.

33
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.238
So why do I like Vue?

34
00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:34.833
I really like it because it's declarative
if you're familiar with imperative and

35
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.078
declarative programming.

36
00:01:36.078 --> 00:01:37.511
Vue is really declarative.

37
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:41.514
In other words, things are not
written like steps in a recipe.

38
00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:45.450
In imperative programming,
we're saying do this, do this, do this.

39
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.940
With declarative programming,
we're really setting a few things and

40
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.520
letting the computer do the hard work.

41
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.040
And you'll see that as soon as
we start to dive in to the API.

42
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.080
It's really legible.

43
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.081
There's a legibility of distinction
between methods, computed, and watchers.

44
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:01.316
I used to be a consultant and

45
00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:04.870
I'd have to dive into different code
bases that were unfamiliar to me.

46
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.170
And because I knew exactly how those
pieces of the API were working and

47
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.210
the legibility of that distinction,
I could jump right in and

48
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.620
I could get started and
that was really helpful.

49
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.720
Because of this, it's really easy to
maintain, and I love that as a maintainer.

50
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.720
Even if I'm jumping into an old
project of my own, it's really helpful

51
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.715
to be able to get a lay of the land
really, really quickly and get started.

52
00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:30.260
Vue kind of has a reputation for
being simple and easy to learn.

53
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.750
And I think that that's a really,

54
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.530
really amazing thing that you'll see
today as we start to work with it.

55
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.758
It's really powerful.

56
00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:41.591
And you might think, well it's simple
though, how can it also be powerful?

57
00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:45.482
But I think what you'll see is that
the surface layer is very simple,

58
00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:48.630
but it also dives underneath
those obstructions.

59
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.576
So you have something very
simple on the surface, but

60
00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:55.448
you can also get beneath the obstructions
in case they get in your way.

61
00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:57.433
It's a collection of the best of the best.

62
00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.447
When Evan You was first working with Vue,
he looked over the whole framework

63
00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.600
landscape and he said, okay, well,
I really like this piece from Knockout.

64
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.190
I really like this piece from Angular.

65
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.750
I really liked this piece from React.

66
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.690
So you might notice if you come
from other frameworks, like, hey,

67
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.100
this looks a little familiar.

68
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.550
It's because it really is borrowed from
all of these different frameworks.

69
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.630
And it is a collection of
this best of the best.

70
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.570
Now, what you might assume when you
look at something that takes from so

71
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.580
many other places, and even invents
its own, that it might feel jumbled.

72
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.850
But what I really
appreciated about it is that

73
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.370
even though it's gathering
the best of the best,

74
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.320
it still manages to feel really
elegant when you're working with it.

75
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.000
It gives me what I want when I need it,
and then it gets out of my way.

76
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.130
There's a UX premise,
that's Don't Make Me Think.

77
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.110
And Kathy Sierra who's a UX expert says,

78
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.260
don't make me think
about the wrong things.

79
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.630
And I think that that's
how I feel when I use Vue.

80
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.900
I'm able to build super fast because it
gives me all of the things that I need.

81
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.160
And then all of the things that are kind
of repetitive tasks that I find myself

82
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160
doing over and

83
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.030
over again, it gives me really simple
API's to just do those things quickly.

84
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.039
So I really love it.

85
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.728
It's a way to be really productive because
of all of those things because it's easy

86
00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.531
to maintain, because it's powerful.

87
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.920
And goodness gracious, it's freaking fun.

88
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.020
I love working with Vue and I'm gonna
have such a fun time teaching you today.

89
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.790
I hope you're gonna have
a great time learning.

90
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.800
I put this little GIF in there,
that's a little yak shaving.

91
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.200
If you're not familiar with the term,
yak shaving is when you do a bunch of

92
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.770
other things because you have to
get something done in programming.

93
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.160
I like Vue because it
keeps me from yak shaving.

94
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.290
It says, hey, a lot of developers
are probably gonna take an input and

95
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.800
they're gonna trim out whitespace.

96
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.310
So I'll just give you
a modifier called dot trim.

97
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.210
So you don't have to keep doing
that over and over again.

98
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.270
Or maybe you're gonna loop through
a lot of arrays in your life.

99
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.450
Maybe we'll just give you
a simple way of doing that.

100
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.950
So that's really helpful as a developer.

101
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.720
I'm showing you this iPhone and
that's not because we're gonna

102
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.520
talk about mobile even though everything
that we're showing you is responsive,

103
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.380
works on mobile, and things like that.

104
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.220
It's more because it's a metaphor.

105
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.691
When I'm using the iPhone,

106
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:13.506
I feel like I'm working with a really
sophisticated piece of machinery.

107
00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:20.014
I know that some of the smartest engineers
in the world work on the iPhone.

108
00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:22.145
But yet when I use it,
I don't feel talked down to,

109
00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:24.040
I feel like everything's at my fingertips.

110
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.240
I feel like I can access
everything really, really easily.

111
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.570
And I think that is a metaphor for
how I feel when I'm using Vue.

112
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.550
I feel like I have something
really powerful in my hands, but

113
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.660
it never feels like I'm fighting with it.

114
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.021
It always feels like everything
is right at my fingertips.

115
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:44.905
So let's do a quick comparison of other
frameworks just on a technical level of

116
00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:48.832
what some of the similarities and
some of the differences are.

117
00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:51.665
It offers a virtual DOM,
same with Angular, same with React,

118
00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:53.543
same with a lot of JavaScript framework.

119
00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:58.046
And we're actually gonna talk a little bit
about what the virtual DOM is today, so

120
00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:00.017
you get to know what that premises.

121
00:06:00.017 --> 00:06:03.400
It offers reactive component
that offer the view layer only.

122
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.360
So this is both similar and
different from both React and Angular.

123
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.360
React, despite the name is not reactive,
although you can make it reactive but

124
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.390
the use of libraries, but
it is the view layer only,

125
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.260
whereas Angular is reactive,
but it's an MVC.

126
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.290
It offers model, view, and controllers.

127
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.470
So that's a slight difference and
similarity to both of those frameworks.

128
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.982
As props and a centralized state
management store similar to React,

129
00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:32.738
as we get to the last section today,
we're gonna start using Vuex.

130
00:06:32.738 --> 00:06:36.012
We're also gonna talk about the
composition API which is a new feature in

131
00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:41.040
Vue 3, which can be used as a centralized
state management store as well.

132
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.690
It offers conditional rendering and
services similar to Angular.

133
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.131
If you come from an Angular background,
you might look at the directives and

134
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:51.543
say, I know about these.

135
00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:54.838
It's inspired by Polymer for
simplicity and performance.

136
00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:58.494
Vue offers similar development
style with HTML styles and

137
00:06:58.494 --> 00:07:01.100
JavaScript composed in tandem.

138
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.770
Vue offers the thing called
single file components,

139
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.980
which have HTML script and
styles all in one component.

140
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.970
And I'm gonna show you a few different
ways to make Vue components today.

141
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.890
And that's typically how Vue
developers are working with Vue, and

142
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.795
you'll see that when we move into Vue CLI.

143
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.270
Scoped styles in single file components

144
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.720
are available to you just by writing
an attribute that says scoped.

145
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.990
And it's similar to some types of CSS and
js-like CSS modules in React.

146
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.300
So what this course is, let's just get
the lay of the land really quickly.

147
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.700
This is an introduction.

148
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.080
It assumes no prior knowledge,
even of frameworks.

149
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.882
You can come really, really fresh and
everything is starting really at the base.

150
00:07:46.882 --> 00:07:50.510
We're gonna go slowly through every
single piece to try to give you

151
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.330
a good lay of the land of all
of what Vue has to offer.

152
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.640
It's all this stuff to get you going.

153
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.180
Because it's an eight hour course and
there's a lot to cover.

154
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.250
I'm gonna cover the things that
I think are most valuable to you

155
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.740
to start to build applications so
that by the end of the day,

156
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.195
you can feel comfortable
starting to build things.

157
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:09.650
It has a lot of exercises
to help you learn.

158
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.530
You'll notice in this course, I have all
of these distinct modules and sections and

159
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.340
I show you a bunch of different ways
of working with the same concept.

160
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.100
That's because I don't want you
to learn just one way of working

161
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.400
because that just kind
of gives you one path.

162
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.600
So I might show you an example of list
rendering one way and then another way and

163
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.280
then another way so

164
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.640
that you can kind of get to see it
in a bunch of different contexts.

165
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.710
It's also so that if later on,
you wanna go back to the course and

166
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.250
you say hey, I forgot what computed was,
you can go right to the computed

167
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.450
section fork a CodePen,
play with it and get going again.

168
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.279
So this course does not do
a full application live coding,

169
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.260
we're covering basic premises and
a couple of more advanced features.

170
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.120
So we'll make sure that you have all of
the things that you need to get going.

171
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.397
And then we're also gonna cover
things like the composition API,

172
00:09:02.397 --> 00:09:04.634
which is an additive
more advanced feature.

173
00:09:04.634 --> 00:09:08.392
We're gonna talk about different ways to
work with Vuex and so on and so forth.

174
00:09:08.392 --> 00:09:12.682
And anything that's out of the scope of
the course, I'll try to give you more

175
00:09:12.682 --> 00:09:16.850
resources so that you can dive off into
learning a little bit more about it.

176
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.310
What we won't cover.

177
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.080
We're not gonna cover ES6/ECMAScript 2015,
however you wanna call it, and above, but

178
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.360
we'll use it.

179
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.770
This course is assumptive that you
have modern JavaScript knowledge and

180
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.560
there's lots of other courses like
Will Sentence's courses that kinda go over

181
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.318
those premises if you need a refresher.

182
00:09:34.318 --> 00:09:39.156
We're not gonna go into minor details so
that we can cover more ground and

183
00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:42.582
give you the full lay of
the land in the eight hours.

184
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.140
And we won't cover edge cases for
that same reason.

185
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.150
We're gonna dive right into
the things that get you going.

186
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.350
But there's another course in one day,
again, where we will build some of those

187
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.410
things and we'll kind of dive into
some of the idiosyncrasies of things.

188
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.560
Before we start, the repo lives at
github sdras intro-to-vue, here it is.

189
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.610
So in here, all of the things
that I used while I'm working,

190
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.070
I'm gonna work in VS Code
a little bit today.

191
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.660
All of the things that I
use to work in VS Code,

192
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.620
all the things that I work in Chrome Dev
tools and extensions are linked up here.

193
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.040
And here are all of the slides,
all the slides have embedded CodePen demo.

194
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.930
So if you need to get back
to them right away, you can.

195
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.540
The password for all of the slide
decks is Vue with exclamation points.

196
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.461
So you can click right to there and
get going.
