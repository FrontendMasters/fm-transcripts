00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:04.114
One thing that I wanna make mention
we're talking about Vue 3 today.

2
00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:10.754
And Vue 3 is not so different from Vue 2,
in that the surface API is the same.

3
00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:15.559
In this next section, we're gonna be
talking about what the reactivity system

4
00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.864
is and that is all different in Vue 3.

5
00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:22.403
But the surface API is the same, but
there are a few minor differences.

6
00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:24.728
One is that we deprecated filters.

7
00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:27.946
Another one is a lot of people are
probably here because they want to learn

8
00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.478
the composition API,
which is an additive new feature,

9
00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.874
that's an advanced feature
that we'll talk about.

10
00:00:32.874 --> 00:00:37.863
But in case you're coming from Vue 2,
I'll discuss filters really quickly.

11
00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:40.796
Filters were dropped between Vue 2 and
Vue 3,

12
00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:44.328
because you can do everything
with a computed property.

13
00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:47.037
And I'll show you what I mean by this.

14
00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:51.940
In Vue 2, if we wanted to show a tip or
something that's slightly

15
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.148
different from the original value,
I would use a pipe.

16
00:00:56.148 --> 00:01:00.724
And I would say filters and
I would parse in the value and

17
00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:05.513
then I would return
[value* .2].toFixed(2).

18
00:01:05.513 --> 00:01:09.901
Which would yield this Tip Calculator
that has the total and

19
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.773
it's 20%, and
then it shows what that value is.

20
00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:18.550
So this is Vue 2, that's why this syntax
looks a little bit different too that we

21
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.018
changed the kind of Vue instance as well.

22
00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.989
The mounting.

23
00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:31.874
And here you see this customer total,
I'll open it up And the pipe.

24
00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:33.827
And that's how we would use filters.

25
00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.231
But you might understand that we can
actually do the same thing with computer

26
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:37.879
properties.

27
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:41.843
And the reason why it's important to
deprecate features like this that you can

28
00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:45.400
actually do the same thing in,
is we wanted to make Vue 3 super small.

29
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.394
Vue 3 is really, really tiny comparatively
and it offers really great performance.

30
00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:55.644
And part of the reason is that we're
making sure that surface area of the API

31
00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:56.392
is slender.

32
00:01:56.392 --> 00:02:02.127
So if we wanted to do a similar thing,
I could say, data customer total one,

33
00:02:02.127 --> 00:02:06.715
tip20, return customertotal*
2}.toFixed(2).

34
00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:09.281
And I could return that as
a computed property, right?

35
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:11.417
So I could offer the same thing.

36
00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:14.140
Now, you might notice one
small difference here,

37
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.811
which is that I wasn't
able to parse a parameter.

38
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:21.591
And I'm not able to do that and compute
it, it's tied now to customer1total.

39
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.380
But you can do that with methods, and

40
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.555
we're gonna go over that when I do
the building web apps with Vue,

41
00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:29.470
we're gonna create some with
methods instead of filters.

42
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.813
So you'll be able to see
those more in action.

43
00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:35.737
But you can use computer properties or
methods for

44
00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:39.480
the same functionality,
so that was dropped.

45
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.805
Some other examples that you might
use computer properties for,

46
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:44.266
are adding currency signs.

47
00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:49.402
If you have to say 1st, 2nd,
3rd place, something like that,

48
00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:54.173
to that effect, if you're adding
in a two you probably always

49
00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:58.617
want to prepend it with and,
[LAUGH] and so on and so forth.

50
00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:01.095
Those kind of simple explanations.

51
00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:05.520
For more complex ones, you can filter
large amounts of data that we just showed,

52
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.269
or you can create dazzling
data visualizations.

53
00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.361
Let's say you have a map
of the United States and

54
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:14.768
you wanna show only some
units based on a condition.

55
00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:18.858
That's a really good example
of using computer properties.
