1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:07.605
Okay, so let's start with this app.vue and
we'll go back to our backpack shop.

2
00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:12.415
This app.vue this vue.create app that
we've been working with this whole time,

3
00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:13.863
is very similar to that.

4
00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:16.940
So I'm gonna grab the data
from inside here.

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.943
So we're gonna add that data,

6
00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:24.734
I'm actually gonna remove the component of
HelloWorld because we're not gonna use it.

7
00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:30.062
And I'm gonna remove it here.

8
00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:33.440
And actually,
I'm gonna remove the vue logo as well.

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.280
So we've just got div id app,
I'm gonna remove this style here.

10
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.980
And you can see it's given
us SCSS because we asked for

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.520
that when we were working
with the CLI as well.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.589
And I'm gonna go grab
the styles from here.

13
00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:02.840
Then we'll go back and
we're gonna put them here.

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.330
There's a thing that I didn't mention
which is the vue style guide.

15
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.050
If you go into the docs, there is a style
guide that makes some recommendations for

16
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.310
how to work with vue apps.

17
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.340
And inside that style guide,

18
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.070
you'll see that what we suggest is either
putting global styles in a main dot CSS

19
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.730
file, or an app, or
the top level app component.

20
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.080
Anything below that, any component
below that should have scoped on it,

21
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.420
which means that it's
scoping to just that area.

22
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.290
So I'm gonna save that.

23
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.450
The other thing that we had was a font,
so I'm gonna go in grab this

24
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.870
font from this area,
we'll go back to VS code,

25
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.180
we go into the index.html, and
I add the link to the font here.

26
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.620
Cool, then we go back again and I'm
gonna go into my HTML and I'm gonna take

27
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.930
all of the HTML that was in that first top
level, and I'm gonna put it into my app.

28
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.689
So I go back into my app, div id app.

29
00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:13.610
There we go.

30
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.552
Now, right now I'm not even gonna look,

31
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.242
cuz I know what's happening is it's
erroring because am adding an app child.

32
00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:21.390
And that app child doesn't exist yet.

33
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.590
So let's make that app child component.

34
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.010
So I'm gonna make a new component,
and I'm gonna save it and

35
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.650
it's gonna say AppChild.vue,
I'm gonna save it in components.

36
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.230
And here I'm gonna type vbase, this is
my snippet to output some boilerplate.

37
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.350
So I have a lot of different snippets that
allow you to work really, really quickly.

38
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.860
This will allow me to output all of
the things that are necessary for

39
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.680
me to set up a single
file component with ease.

40
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.890
So now go back to this here, we're gonna
go grab everything inside the child.

41
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.370
We don't need to state that there's
a relationship with the child anymore,

42
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.580
because we know that we're in there.

43
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.504
So I'm able to put this in.

44
00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:12.704
So we save that.

45
00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:18.223
And then once again, we go back and
we gonna get the state of this component.

46
00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:25.598
So we don't need the template,
because that's already associated, and

47
00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:26.650
we go back here.

48
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.780
And inside export defaults,
we put the props and we put the data.

49
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.390
Now if I wanted to import that component
again, I'm gonna use my snippet.

50
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.010
So I'll say vImport-export, and

51
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.070
what it will give me is some
boilerplate to add that in.

52
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.730
So I'll say AppChild is what I named it,
and I can't have to export default.

53
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.410
So I want to do that, so
that I can have access to it.

54
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.700
And okay, we coded for
a long time without looking at anything.

55
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.120
So we should probably look at it now and
see if we have any errors.

56
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.080
So we'll go over here, and here we are,
we see our full setup from the code pen.

57
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.120
So what's different?

58
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.850
What do we do that's different
that's in this kind of application.

59
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.830
We have all of our app child's style.

60
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.890
So if I wanted to know something
about this child component,

61
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.170
I would go to this file and
I see all the information here.

62
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.010
Every piece of this is optional.

63
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.700
So if I have no information here,
I could totally remove that.

64
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.190
And it's very clear what this component
is in does, it's right there.

65
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.910
If I look at this app, now I know
that I'm importing this app child.

66
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.147
Here this is here's the template,

67
00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:49.086
here is the data in the manifest and
here is my SAS.

68
00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:54.761
[LAUGH] So what I'm gonna do from here,
is I'm gonna go back to my terminal.

69
00:04:57.351 --> 00:04:58.843
And did I save it?

70
00:04:58.843 --> 00:05:01.165
I think I saved it, cool, cool.

71
00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:04.380
And try to save you, saved, okay.

72
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.030
Now I'm gonna go back to my terminal.

73
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.110
And I'm gonna use a thing
that's called hub.

74
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.230
Hub is a command line tool for
making GitHub repos.

75
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.700
So I can say, hub create,
I'm gonna pass in -p,

76
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.170
which allows me to make private repo and
I could name it something but

77
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.120
I wanted to just use
the name of the directory.

78
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.144
So I'll say hub create -p and
this will run.

79
00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:37.362
And so now I say git add -A,
git commit -m,

80
00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:42.845
and then we'll say initial commit

81
00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:49.380
Git push -u origin master.

82
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.580
So we're pushing that up.

83
00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.610
And then if I go to the setup, I should
see everything deployed right over here.

84
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.168
So now I have it all set up on GitHub.

85
00:06:05.168 --> 00:06:07.977
Now, the next thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go to netlify, and

86
00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:08.960
I'm gonna deploy it.

87
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.473
So I log in.

88
00:06:15.192 --> 00:06:16.682
It's saying new site from git, GitHub.

89
00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:20.567
Then I authorize GitHub.

90
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.284
I say setup1.

91
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.794
Click on this.

92
00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:39.842
We're gonna branch to deploy as master,
our build command is gonna be,

93
00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:44.086
if you are confused on how to find
where the build commands are,

94
00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:48.830
you can go to the readme and the readme
tells you exactly what you need.

95
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.620
So you can copy and
paste this right in here.

96
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.690
Yarn run build, we'll go back.

97
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.613
Builds command and in the publish
directory is gonna be dist deploy site.

98
00:07:01.613 --> 00:07:09.160
So you can see it's starting to get
this site deploy and process and stuff.

99
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.200
While that's happening, you can see that
I set that -p and that is private now.

100
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.000
And so what we're doing is we're
gonna deploy the entire site

101
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.590
that we just created so that we're taking
it all the way from this CodePen example,

102
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.570
all the way to a deployed site.

103
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.620
And in the repo,
if you want to see this, its setup1.
