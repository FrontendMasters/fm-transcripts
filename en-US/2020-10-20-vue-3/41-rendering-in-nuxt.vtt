00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.517
So here's an example of
bringing in a style sheet.

2
00:00:03.517 --> 00:00:06.237
We are gonna load that into the meta,
which is the head.

3
00:00:06.237 --> 00:00:08.900
And if we wanted to bring in global CSS,

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.988
I mentioned that array inside the next
config we'd say assets normalize,

5
00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:18.370
assets main.js, may not CSS,
I typically put them in assets.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.613
We're gonna move over to rendering and
explaining what rendering is in Nuxt.

7
00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:29.829
So, I mentioned that everything
is server side rendering and

8
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.326
you might have heard of
the term hydration before.

9
00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:37.211
And we're gonna go over
what hydration is so

10
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:42.155
that you can understand what
that is in terms of of Nuxt.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.003
It can speed up performance to
initially serve raw HTML and CSS.

12
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:56.042
We can do this by server side rendering
an app and delivering it statically,.

13
00:00:56.042 --> 00:01:00.922
After it's been served vue needs to
take over the elements that are dynamic.

14
00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:02.371
This is called hydration.

15
00:01:05.172 --> 00:01:10.042
Since the market has been rendered,
we don't throw that away and recreate it.

16
00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:15.352
Instead, we want to hydrate the DOM and
make just the pieces that are interactive.

17
00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:20.243
So here the button can now respond to
changes and we can now add to the cart.

18
00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:26.112
So hydration, lets us deliver fast and
secure sites and still have a reactive UI.

19
00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:30.784
So that's one thing that Nuxt
does under the hood to let

20
00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:33.636
us work with things really fast.

21
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:36.732
So let's get a little bit fancier.

22
00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:42.070
I mentioned that we could create an entire
store and in fact, I made an entire store.

23
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.532
And this is all done with Nuxt.

24
00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:46.557
I'm not gonna go through every
single piece of this, but

25
00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:50.844
this is a resource that's available to you
if you'd like to see how a store in Nuxt

26
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.763
would be created and
how we might make dynamic routes.

27
00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:58.836
All of these items are coming in
from a piece of a big manifest and

28
00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:04.214
we're creating every single item
dynamically with Nuxt as well.

29
00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:10.011
And also this cart once we start
putting things inside of the cart and

30
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:14.804
adding things and picking a size and
adding to the cart.

31
00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:15.817
You can actually,

32
00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:19.622
it's actually wired up with surveilance
functions that go to stripe.

33
00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:24.113
So you can see how you would use an
application like this that was built with

34
00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:26.286
Nuxt in the ways that you just saw and

35
00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:30.940
also how we would work with that with
stripe to actually make transactions.
