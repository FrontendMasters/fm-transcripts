00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.820
Before, you saw this before,
when we did item and

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.480
items, it loops through a set of values.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.010
So you saw that in the first example,
but we can also do a static number.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.850
So we don't even need anything in our app,
right?

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.260
Here we're just saying create app and
grab that piece of, you know?

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.150
Grab the div id app and you know?

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.220
Establish a relationship with it in view,
and

8
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.700
I'm saying li v4 num in 5 and
I'm adding a key of num.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.880
This key we didn't talk about before.

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.320
This is v bind key.

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.450
So what keys do and
if you come from react,

12
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.330
you're probably familiar with
a concept that's very similar.

13
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.970
What keys allow us to do is it allows
view to efficiently track VDOM changes.

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.120
It can say like, okay, in the virtual DOM,
we have this information.

15
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.070
And in this other piece,
we have this information.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.009
Are there any differences
between these lists?

17
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.240
So it makes more efficient
DOM diffing inside of v4.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.470
So key needs to be unique.

19
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.760
It's what view uses to track VDOM changes.

20
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.220
So we have li v4 and this says num,
it could be anything,

21
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.170
you could name and you don't have to
name it num or number or anything.

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.570
But whatever this is,

23
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.240
I'm saying okay dynamically use
this to track which one it is.

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.220
And in this case it would be one and
then two and then three and

25
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.730
then four, and then five.

26
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.770
So we're able to kind of
piece together for the DOM.

27
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.130
Okay, keep track of these
as separate pieces.

28
00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:40.027
I'll show you another example of this
with all of the things that we can output

29
00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:40.560
in v4.

30
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.068
So far, we've just looked at v4 and
then showing an array but

31
00:01:44.068 --> 00:01:48.399
what if I have an object and what if I
want to show a bunch of different things?

32
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.234
We're typically showing
the values of things.

33
00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:52.842
So let me move over to this.

34
00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:55.470
Actually, let's open this in code pen so
you can see it a little bit better.

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.640
So far, we've only outputted the value and
that's the default, but

36
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.480
you can also pass in the key and
the index.

37
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.758
So you have access to all of
those things inside of a v4.

38
00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:13.195
You don't need to name them value,
key and index, but

39
00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:18.410
they will be in that order, value, key and
index, as you put them on the page.

40
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.134
And here for the key I used value.

41
00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:26.539
So that's what I know is gonna be unique
about this is going to be that value so

42
00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:31.280
I have here my jokes, what did one
baby prototype say to the other?

43
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.470
The answer is I'll race you to class.

44
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.350
Okay, that's okay the responses
have grown as it needs to be.

45
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.440
So what we have is an index right here and

46
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.960
we've got our key and
then we've got our value.

47
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.548
So you have access to all of those
every single time you do a v4,

48
00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:53.677
especially when you're
doing working with objects.
