00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.864
We've hit an exercise, excellent.

2
00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:06.100
All right,
we covered a lot of material here.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.443
What I'm gonna give you is
this hard-coded destination.

4
00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:15.858
We say Your Upcoming Destinations and

5
00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:19.936
we've got basically the HTML
the way that we want it formatted.

6
00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:26.589
And then in the data here,
we have a bunch of locations,

7
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:32.830
this array with a bunch of name, image,
descriptions, and things like that.

8
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.000
What I want you to do is create a
component that displays things like this,

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.800
and pass this location data in instead.

10
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.067
So right now it's formatted in a way that,
if you set it up right,

11
00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:53.946
you could create a component of this and
pass that data in and

12
00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:58.392
it will output and it will look like
this and kind of be set up for you.

13
00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:02.740
But I also want you, at one point or
another, to use a slot.

14
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.980
Just find a place to use a slot.

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.480
Try first to just make
them into components.

16
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.454
So if you get through the exercise and you
just make them into components, good job.

17
00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:13.808
But if you get through
the components part,

18
00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:17.952
then try to make something a slot that
you're passing in as content instead.

19
00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:22.107
So you're gonna make it
look like this at the end.
