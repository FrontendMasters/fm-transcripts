00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.410
Props.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.660
It's kind of like how
you're used to using them.

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.940
They are reactive and
now they're passed into setup.

4
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.970
So, if we're working with props
we could declare it the same way

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.830
we could either do it in an array,
in a string in array.

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.360
Or we could say type number required true,
give it a default, things like that.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.240
And then in that initial setup,
we would pass in props.

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.870
And that's how we would work with it.

9
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.740
And so from here,
what we would say is props dot count.

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.540
So in order to access
that piece we could say,

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.220
props count, so
we're declaring the props here.

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.218
We pass it into setup, and
then we say props dot count.

13
00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:50.417
Context, it's passed as
the second argument in setup,

14
00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.410
so it's always gonna be props and
then context.

15
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.350
And context is like the dollar sign
that you are used to seeing before.

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.620
So you could say context dot omit and
the event, so

17
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.030
remember when we use dollar sign omit,
this is how you would use context.

18
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.330
So things like omit attrs,
things like that would be passed in here.

19
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.610
Or you could destructure it and
instead of passing in context,

20
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.490
you could pass an emit in an object,
and then just say emit event name.

21
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.960
Instead of saying context dot
emit we would just say emit.
