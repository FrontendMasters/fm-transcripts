00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.240
I have a kind of silly example
that I'll show you really quickly.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.000
That's a little weather
notifier that will end on.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.230
So if I have this like little weather
notifier I can make a drizzle apocalypse.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.200
And then I say, okay, thank you.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.550
And then I can make a weather
notification, what a windy day,

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.280
okay, thanks.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.520
And then I say here comes the sun.

8
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.155
[NOISE] And then I can make a tornado.

9
00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:37.599
[NOISE] Okay, thanks.

10
00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:41.550
And then actually if I press it again it
loops right back around to the first one.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.690
We can use vuex and CodePen if we like or
just with a script tag.

12
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.120
We don't have to use it
in an application and

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.500
I'm gonna show you just a little bit of
this and not go into too many details.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.400
Okay, so what we have inside this
pen is a store with the state.

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.360
And what we have is the show
weather which is false.

16
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.650
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna
toggle it when we want to see the weather.

17
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.810
We're also gonna say that the template,
we're gonna number some templates, and

18
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.160
we're gonna use that component is and
we're gonna say template is zero.

19
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.750
And we're gonna say,
if toggling the state,

20
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.480
as, we have this mutation where we have
a toggle, where we toggle that state.show

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.960
whether, we also update the template
by saying, keep advancing

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.230
until you get to the fourth one and
then go back to the first one using a mod.

23
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.378
And while you're doing that,
please toggle as well, cool.

24
00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:43.410
Like I mentioned before we have that
app that's a whole ecommerce site, and

25
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.290
that has a vuex store in it, where we're
doing all sorts of this kind of logic.

26
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.910
And if you wanted to see a kind of
a bigger example, you could go in here and

27
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.860
see how we have these mutations,
how we're committing an action if

28
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.380
we're actually reaching out to a function,
a serverless function as well.

29
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.760
So if you wanted to see an example
that uses a vuex store and

30
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.920
kind of doles out information
to multiple components.

31
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.790
Congratulations, you learned so
much today.

32
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.970
We went through [LAUGH] directives,
we went through methods computed watchers.

33
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.372
We talked about animation,
we talked about the composition API,

34
00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:24.780
w e talked about creating
our own custom directives.

35
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.270
We did so many things, we built apps with
ViewCLI and next we learned about ViewX.

36
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.980
You should be really proud of
yourself if you got to this point

37
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.790
because we covered so much ground and

38
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.700
it was really truly an honor to be here
because I love talking about view and

39
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.150
I love being here on front end masters,
I think it's an amazing platform.

40
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.110
If you need further resources,
the vue docs are a great resource.

41
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.500
We try to cover everything and

42
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.240
kind of human readable english
like we're talking to you.

43
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.920
We have the vue repo, if you want to kind
of go through the code we did a lot in

44
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.920
that reactivity section where
we talked about the code base,

45
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.330
maybe you want to check it out.

46
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.870
There's the nuxt docs, the vuex docs.

47
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.230
There's this really cool GitHub
repo called awesome view

48
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.080
that has a collection of men,
just so many resources,

49
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.756
if you wanted to dive in and
find a million resources for learning vue,

50
00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:24.290
or cookbook entries and things like that,
that's available to you there.

51
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.440
There's also a vue newsletter.

52
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.641
And what's unique about the vue newsletter
is Damian who writes the vue newsletter is

53
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.040
on the vue core team.

54
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.060
So really these updates that
are put into the vuew newsletter

55
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.560
are really important updates.

56
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.370
They're the things that we all agree on
are like the things that we need to be

57
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.720
talking about the most.

58
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.380
So if you wanted to keep
up to date with vue and

59
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.800
no more, this is a great way of doing
that, you can subscribe to that.

60
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.607
Thank you so much for being here today.
