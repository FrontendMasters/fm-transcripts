00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, we have our exercise.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.350
We had our little form here.

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.500
We have our blog posts.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.730
So what we wanted to do was create
a form with @submit.prevent

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.630
instead of putting them on the button,
so we have the button type as submit.

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.230
We have this form,
we have some v models, have new title,

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.158
new author, new label, and
then we had add a new label here.

8
00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:31.870
And instead of, we had it hard coded
before all of these different labels,

9
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.100
it's totally okay if
you left it like that.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.600
But what I did instead was I moved this
over into categories in here, so that I

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.150
could go option v4 category in categories,
in case more categories showed up.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.400
In case I have, you know, it kind of
allows it to be a little bit more

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.880
flexible, but if you left it totally good.

14
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.730
So we have this selected.

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.437
We also have all of these posts in here.

16
00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:03.510
We have newTitle, newAuthor and newLabel.

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.792
As I'm typing here, and I say like,

18
00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:13.309
tacos and sdrizzle, like I did before.

19
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:16.869
And then adding a label,
that's not science,

20
00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.600
we add a new blog post that
gets appended to the end.

21
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.160
And then we also, so here's
the methods for adding a post right.

22
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.999
We have the form that's
submitting this add post.

23
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.520
For added posts,
we have this .newAuthor, this .newLabel.

24
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.390
If you did destructuring here,
that's awesome.

25
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.710
I'm staying away from that a little
bit just to keep things clear for

26
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.120
people who are at different levels.

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.000
So we've got our author,
we're gonna push it on to the added post.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.600
And we're gonna clear out newTitle,
newAuthor, newLabel.

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.070
We are also gonna do filteredByLabel.

30
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.710
And this filteredByLabel is very,

31
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.690
very similar to that last Netflix
rating table that we saw before.

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.890
We're gonna make sure that we
aren't case sensitive here so

33
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.110
we're doing a little regex check.

34
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.350
And then we're gonna filter,
and see if they matched, and

35
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.000
that's what we're gonna show.

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.660
But we also have to take
this computed property and

37
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.140
we need to use it to loop through in here.

38
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.987
So instead of looping through posts,

39
00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:31.326
we are looping through filteredByLabel.

40
00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:36.213
And again here maybe you can see that
magic of I didn't have to change

41
00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:37.450
post in posts.

42
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.320
I didn't have to change the post part.

43
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.870
I can just simply replace
the filteredByLabel from

44
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.270
the computer property.

45
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.590
And now it's filtering all of those.

46
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.680
So you're able to push
that on to that array.

47
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.820
And then you're able to
also filter the label.

48
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.240
Also, I wanted to show you this
example that I made a few years back.

49
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.540
I used to work for Azure and

50
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.680
there were a bunch of people speaking
at different events that year.

51
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.104
So I made it so
that you could filter by name.

52
00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:08.110
And then you could say Abel,
who's awesome.

53
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.060
You should definitely follow him
on Twitter and Burke and things.

54
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.084
But you can see how fast that big table
of info, this is actually a pretty large

55
00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:22.207
table and it's filtering so quickly
because we're using that same concept.

56
00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:27.850
And this is all open source if
you want to check out the for it.
