00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.310
Exercise time.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.410
All right,
we have a bunch of blog posts here.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.598
This is what you're going to be making.

4
00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:10.630
It's a form and
it's gonna be Tacos: A History.

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.640
And the author name is gonna be my name,
which is S-Drizzle, and

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.610
we have a different label for different
things that you might wanna show,

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.010
so you're adding things with that.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.810
And then you're able to filter all
of these based on their label.

9
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.570
So in this case, we said, we added
Tacos History, you can see that label of

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.680
history, and we're able to filter
down to just the histories.

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.320
So I'm gonna start you
off with this code pen.

12
00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.650
And here we've got blog posts,
we've got add a new post.

13
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.370
So we've got v model and a placeholder and

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.810
that required and
then we've got add a new label.

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.370
And we have science, math, poetry,
history and add a new blog post.

16
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.520
Here we've got this selected
as an empty string.

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.890
We haven't, hooked that up yet.

18
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.947
Look, you don't have to think
of all the posts by yourself.

19
00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:12.090
[LAUGH] I made an array of dummy posts for
you.

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510
We've got new title,
new author, new label.

21
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.100
So here we've got this.

22
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.770
We've got the button that submits and
then we've got the selected values.

23
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.358
And then we have the post and
post, post.title, and

24
00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:31.809
it's outputting all of these labels and
authors.
