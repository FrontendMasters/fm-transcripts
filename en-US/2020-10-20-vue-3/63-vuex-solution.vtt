00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.809
In the repo, we have commenting-solution.

2
00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:07.884
For extra credit, you can add uuid and
create a new ID for

3
00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:10.420
each comment and use it as the key.

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.290
So if you got through that exercise and
you want a new challenge,

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.371
you can add uuid.

6
00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:21.702
So if we go back into this repo and
we look at the commenting-solution,

7
00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:26.039
I'm actually going to open
this up in my VS Code.

8
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.960
And then we'll say,

9
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.300
I'll put it in code.

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.428
So if we open this up,
what we have in our div id app is

11
00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:52.133
the image that's hardcoded of
the woman in her profile and

12
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:56.182
Julianne Delfina,
it's lovely after it rains.

13
00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:59.818
And we also have a component
called individual-comment,

14
00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:03.026
where we're looping through and
adding comments.

15
00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:08.375
But let's look at our store,
so inside store,

16
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:14.415
we have index.js,
we saw the importing piece here.

17
00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:18.996
We're gonna move the comments
array into the state.

18
00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:23.880
So now the state owns comments, but
you'll notice, I didn't add the comment

19
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.802
string that was also a part of
that because I'm just using it for

20
00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:31.285
that component, and
I'll show you what I mean by that.

21
00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:36.177
I also have this mutation where
I have a new comment object, and

22
00:01:36.177 --> 00:01:40.793
where I add the comment,
I've passed in this comment, and

23
00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:47.648
I'm going to state.comments.push this new
comment object that I've just created.

24
00:01:47.648 --> 00:01:50.612
So if we go back over to the app,

25
00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:55.864
here is where I'm gonna hold
this new comment string.

26
00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:59.807
And the reason why I'm going to hold
the new comment string here is, really,

27
00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:03.037
all I'm doing with it,
it's a placeholder for information.

28
00:02:03.037 --> 00:02:08.160
I'm really accessing it from that v-model,
and once I have it and

29
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.836
once I press Enter, that's when
I'm going to do this.store.commit,

30
00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:18.795
and send whatever is in
this.newComment to the store, right?

31
00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:22.728
I'm not actually doing anything that
the store needs to know about with this

32
00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:23.560
string.

33
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.750
I'm just using it to store data for a
second, and then I'm getting rid of it, so

34
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960
I wanna keep that in this component.

35
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.650
What I'm moving into the store
are the comments array and

36
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.760
the ability to add new comments.

37
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.210
So I said this.store.commit ("addComment",
this.newComment), so

38
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.030
that's whatever this will be.

39
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.857
And then we also have,
in our computed properties, our comments,

40
00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:52.710
we could've also said map state and then
added it in that way, either one is fine.

41
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.927
Since it's only one property,
it's totally fine to just return it.

42
00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:01.531
So we have this.store.state.comment,
and the individual comment hasn't

43
00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:06.690
really changed because that was kind of
a presentational component to begin with.

44
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.510
It was really just taking some props and
showing some information.

45
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.610
So this one doesn't have
anything to do with the store,

46
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.010
and it doesn't really have
that much logic in it either.

47
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.920
It's just showing you that
bit of the LI as well.
