00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.431
Exercise time, your favorite time.

2
00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:08.078
So, in this and there's a couple different
ways that you can build this, but

3
00:00:08.078 --> 00:00:11.312
I want you to pay attention
to the set timeout in here.

4
00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:14.670
So if we say, where is my taco?

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.340
Then you have a button that
says Click me to order a taco.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.330
Click that button and it changes that,
to a taco with an exclamation point.

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.250
And then we had a set
quickly set timeout for

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.790
a second your order was submitted and
then it went away.

9
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.480
Now, what I want to make sure that you do,

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.150
during this exercise is
use a watcher somewhere.

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.740
So use a watcher at some point
to change one of the values.

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.970
So you can also use a method for
other things.

13
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.140
You can also use a conditional or whatever
you want, but use a watcher somewhere.

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.020
If we look at the code pen
we have button at click,

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.620
get taco click me to order a taco and
the h2 is where is my taco.

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.210
We have our order status
right now is no or

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.370
as an empty string and
the order submitted is no.

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.580
And I gave you the method of get taco but
I didn't put anything inside of it.

19
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.040
So you have to figure out what
you're gonna put inside of there.
