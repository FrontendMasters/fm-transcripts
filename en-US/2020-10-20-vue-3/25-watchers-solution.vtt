00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.820
Alright, let's go over the solution if
we just review what we had at first for

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.520
a moment, you had at click,
and then a get taco,

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.340
which was an empty method right here.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.550
And the where is my taco that's hard
coded with order status as a string and

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.450
order submitted as no and
you had to use a washer.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.466
So if we go to the solution.

7
00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:32.390
So here we have click me to
order a taco with get taco.

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.990
In the get taco method,
we're going to go to this order status.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.660
And instead of it being an empty string,
we're gonna start with where is my taco?

10
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.180
And we're gonna put that instead in here.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.270
So instead of hard coding,
where is my taco and

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.740
swapping things out in
a go find that kind of way

13
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.885
we're gonna make a kind of dynamic
relationship between order status.

14
00:00:55.885 --> 00:01:01.410
Order status starts off with where is
my taco and then when you click that,

15
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.680
this order status updates to
the taco with exclamation point.

16
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.070
There are a number of ways
that you could have done this.

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.800
This is one way that I'm doing it in
order to kind of hook into a watcher.

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.050
So, for the watcher what I have,

19
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.890
Is this order status so
I'm gonna watch order status change.

20
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.610
As soon as it goes from
where is my taco to the taco

21
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.828
I'm watching order status and
the new value and old value.

22
00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:36.810
And I'm gonna say this
order submitted which is no

23
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.420
turns into your order was submitted.

24
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.310
And then I have a set timeout that
turns this .order submitted back

25
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.018
into null after 1000 seconds or
1000 milliseconds which is a second.

26
00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:53.988
So, there's a lot of different ways
that you could have done this but

27
00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:58.318
this is definitely one way was to
watch that order status change and

28
00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.408
then do something else
based on that change.
