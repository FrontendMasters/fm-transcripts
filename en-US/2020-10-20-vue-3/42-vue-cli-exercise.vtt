00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:04.743
All right, exercise time,
we are gonna take the component solution,

2
00:00:04.743 --> 00:00:06.965
or you can grab this pen, [LAUGH], and

3
00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:10.504
we're gonna set it up with
Vue CLI in a real build process.

4
00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:15.747
And you're going to take this existing
app, and we are going to refactor it.

5
00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:20.110
So you're gonna take the component and
that regular app part,

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.662
and you're going to go through it and

7
00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:27.288
make sure that you have all of
the setup that you would with Vue CLI.
