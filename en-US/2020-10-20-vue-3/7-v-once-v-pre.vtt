00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.080
v-once and v-pre, I mentioned
before that I have my favorites.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.000
These are my less than favorites.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.635
I mean, they're okay but
they're just not quite as useful.

4
00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.668
v-once will not update once it's
been rendered to the page and

5
00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:16.300
v-pre will print out the inner text
exactly how it is, including code.

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.550
And I will show you an example so
that you can see that with some clarity.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.897
So if I say what,
is my favorite kind of taco, and

8
00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:29.230
I say I like Al Pastor tacos,
I'm gonna say, I like Carne Asada tacos.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.830
You can see that that first v-once,

10
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.522
which has the mustache templates,
didn't change, right?

11
00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:40.250
It outputted to the page what
I had initially, which was

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.740
I like Al Pastor tacos, but as soon as
I updated it, it didn't change at all.

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.658
So that's useful sometimes, sometimes.

14
00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:52.738
I also show you v-pre next to pre because
I think it's important to know that

15
00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:54.653
there's this distinction there,

16
00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:58.770
sometimes people get caught up in like,
I thought it was gonna do this.

17
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.236
The pre tag is just a basic HTML pre tag
that's outputting kind of pretty printed

18
00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:09.225
code to the page, whereas the v-pre
isn't doing quite the same thing.

19
00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:12.746
The v-pre is taking
whatever I have in here and

20
00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:16.820
it's not evaluating anything
the typical view way.

21
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.070
So rather than evaluating those mustache
templates to tacos, like we did above,

22
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.900
it's just going to show you that moustache
template is just gonna show you a string.

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.710
And the reason why we have something
like this is it's really useful for

24
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.840
documentation.

25
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.900
So if you're working on a doc site and
you need to show people, no, literally,

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.130
this is exactly what this is,
this is a really good way of doing that.

27
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.670
And beneath, I'm using this opportunity in

28
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.440
showing you pre to show you
a cute little debugger thing.

29
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.860
This dollar sign,

30
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.265
when we use it in view, often is
referring to the view instance itself.

31
00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:56.748
It's a special thing the view is giving
us to dive into some of the internals.

32
00:01:56.748 --> 00:02:02.810
And here what we're saying is dollar sign
data, which is a relationship with this.

33
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.701
So it will print whatever I
have in data to this page.

34
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:14.170
It will say hi, and
it will literally say hi beneath.

35
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.370
Now, you know that we have those view dev
tools that we've been working with, but

36
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.980
there might be some instances
where you don't wanna go back and

37
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.200
forth to a dev tool, or you just
wanna see something really quickly.

38
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.541
Or you're trying to get
a response from a server and

39
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:27.880
you just wanna check
something really fast.

40
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.175
This is really useful for that.
