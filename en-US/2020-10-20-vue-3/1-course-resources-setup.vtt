WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.390
We also are using the Vue devtools 3
beta at the time of recording of this.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.920
We just came out with view three.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.660
So there's Vue devtools,
which is the kind of standard devtools.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.450
And this is the beta version
that we're working on currently.

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.780
So I'm gonna be using these today.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.620
But it's missing a couple of features,

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.960
you might notice that when I move over
to next, this won't work anymore.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.360
And when we're working with knucks, this
would actually be the better version, but

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.590
we're going to really
be working with this.

10
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.120
In the future, this will be the only
version of vue devtools that you'll need.

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.331
Also when I'm working with VS code,
I'm going to be using Vetur,

12
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:45.140
Vetur allows us to use single
file components in VS code and

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.440
get syntax highlighting and error handling
and all the things that you're used to.

14
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.870
I also created Vue VS code snippets.

15
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.300
And those are really handy for

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.020
drumming up boilerplate and
things really quickly as you're working.

17
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.530
We're also gonna work
with CodePen a bit today.

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.940
So I wanted to give you a couple
of little starters just so

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.400
that you know your way around
CodePen if you're not familiar, so

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.560
you can either click Pen to create
a new pen, or you can click View Pen.

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.540
So I'll show you
the differences between these.

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.060
If I clicked on Pen I can change
the view to make these go the HTML,

23
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.080
CSS and JavaScript go to
the top instead of the side.

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160
I have an HTML, CSS and JavaScript panel.

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
If I click this here, you can see that
you can add whatever you need here so

26
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.370
you could save Vue.

27
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.550
This will go to the two version of Vue and

28
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.920
all the pens have the view next version of
Vue so you can just fork one of those pen

29
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.330
I'm also using bait babble babble one
of those two as a as a preprocessor.

30
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.010
I'm using some pre processors and

31
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.740
CSS I like to use SCSS normalise
autoprefixer, but that's up to you.

32
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.920
You can use whatever you like.

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.900
In terms of the HTML tag,
you can use pre processors.

34
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.940
I'm also gonna add for
Fonts into the head right here.

35
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.620
So that's how we work with that.

36
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.430
As we're working with exercises today,
if you see an exercise and

37
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.130
I say like work with this exercise and

38
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.370
fork this pen, what you're going to
need to do is save it to an account.

39
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.120
So I suggest that you make a free account
with code pen so that you can save

40
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.280
it because if you refresh the page and
you don't then your work will be lost.

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.410
You also notice that I use this
extension called code open.

42
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.910
So if I save this as private, and

43
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.010
then I hit code open,
what it does is it opens a debug window.

44
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.890
This debug window will allow me to
see my pen without any iframes.

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.620
These are all built with IFrames.

46
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.820
So I can actually traverse
this quite easily and

47
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.190
see all of my elements on the page and
things like that way.

48
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.240
If I went back to CodePen,
and I click the drop down and

49
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.440
I click Vue, you can see that I'm
actually getting a single file template.

50
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.910
And this is what a single
file template looks like.

51
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.360
I have a template area
where I put my HTML,

52
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.370
I have my script area
where we put my script.

53
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.600
And I have my style area
where I put my style.

54
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.040
So there are a couple pens that
we'll be using today that have this.

55
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.685
It's a newer feature of CodePen.
