00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.957
V-BIND or colon I know I said
I love V model the most, but

2
00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:06.300
I also love V-BIND the most.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.130
I like both of them.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.492
Okay, so, V-BIND or this colon that's a
shortcut, we have a couple of shortcuts in

5
00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:16.510
Vue because there are some directives
you'll use again and again and again.

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.632
And it's a little bit more legible to just
use the colon instead of writing V-BIND,

7
00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:22.000
V-BIND, V-BIND.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.560
So it's one of the most useful directives.

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.100
That's part of the reason
why it has a shortcut.

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.450
We can use it for so many things.

11
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.817
We can use it for class and
style bindings, dynamic props, etc.

12
00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:35.170
So I'll show you some examples.

13
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.660
So, here instead of the button
not being on the page,

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.300
what we have is this V-BIND
of a state of a class.

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.800
So we're basically saying, if talk and
then we have a ternary operator.

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.660
If tacos is true,
add an active class otherwise don't.

17
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.510
So I can say like our past or here and

18
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.560
what you can see is that we
now have that class appended.

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.175
So if we looking inside here
we see this button .active.

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.260
What we have is tacos as an empty string.

21
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.300
And we said, okay, add the active class or
active class in this case was active and

22
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.620
that's how it knows to kind of toggle
back and forth between those classes.

23
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.650
Here's an example that's like,

24
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.810
this is a very common use case
making weird Tron things.

25
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.170
No, I'm just kidding.

26
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.130
So this is a style binding that
we're changing perspective origin

27
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.415
based on your mouse movements.

28
00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:39.460
So, if I move my mouse around,
I have this event at mouse move and

29
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.610
I'm able to bind x&amp;y coordinates.

30
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.990
To this style, and
that's how I'm doing this.

31
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.220
That's all that it takes to make
something move around in space,

32
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.340
which is really cool.

33
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.480
So that's that V-BIND style right here.
