00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:05.450
v-html, scrape for strings that have
HTML elements that need to be rendered.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.408
This is really cool.

3
00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:09.090
So let's say, from a server,

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.115
somebody gives you this string and
it has a link in it and

5
00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.455
of course, it's gonna be a really
amazing taco recipe that I really like.

6
00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:20.125
So if you wanna make really good,
all pasta or

7
00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:23.675
tacos, I suggest this one
that's neither here nor there.

8
00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.900
But, [LAUGH] if you look at this string
you don't wanna evaluate this string when

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.690
you put it to the page,
which is what it would typically do.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.770
What you wanna do is you want to use
v-html instead of the mustache templates,

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.780
and then it will treat
that HTML like HTML.

12
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.510
It will see that link and
create a link out of the link.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.070
Cool.

14
00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:52.224
There is a warning that I will warn
you with, do not accept user input and

15
00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:56.307
then put it to the page with v-html
because that could be a cross

16
00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.550
site scripting attack vector.

17
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.270
So if you look at this goofy example and
you want it to go to this Alpa store

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.090
tacos thing, and it says I have to
install all your tacos, that sucks,

19
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.320
I don't want them to be stolen.

20
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.770
So this is really not
a good way of doing things.

21
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.853
If you know that you you don't
know exactly what you're getting,

22
00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:23.674
I would not suggest using v-html to
access that and print it out to the page.

23
00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:27.760
v-text is similar to
using mustache templates.

24
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.800
This is also one that is not
as useful as other things.

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.870
But it's basically the same
as the mustache template.

26
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.223
So if I say, I like carne asada,
I know there are other tacos but

27
00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:44.979
I'm just sticking to those
two those are my favorites.

28
00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.736
[LAUGH] So we've got these
moustache templates here, and

29
00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.760
then we've got the v-text,
they do the same thing.

30
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.430
The reason why we have both is sometimes
you only have access to changing

31
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.670
an attribute or something and

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.230
you don't or you're not able to
insert something inside of a tag.

33
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.530
So just in case you run into that
occurrence, then you can use that.

34
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.890
If you want to dynamically
update things though,

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.930
it's recommended to use
mustache templates.

36
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.400
They're evaluated a little faster.

37
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.630
I made a little table just in case you
wanted to look at all of them really

38
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.010
quickly and you didn't wanna go through
back through all of the course.

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.300
So I have some of these purposes and
examples that you can refer to.
