00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.162
Let's check out our solution.

2
00:00:01.162 --> 00:00:05.919
Okay, so we took that components
exercise from CodePen,

3
00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.400
and we're putting it into
a brand new Vue CLI app.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.192
So, what differences would we make,
what would we change here?

5
00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:16.759
So the first thing that we're gonna
do is we're gonna make sure that

6
00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.587
that data goes into the App.vue.

7
00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:22.582
So we've got Moscow, Paris, Rome, Paris.

8
00:00:22.582 --> 00:00:27.238
And we have all of that location
data stored in this array in

9
00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:31.170
the data at the topmost level,
at the App.vue.

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.703
Then what we're going to do
is we're gonna go through and

11
00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:38.102
we're gonna say
v-for="location in location".

12
00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.614
So we're gonna loop through
that location data.

13
00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:44.173
And we're gonna pass in that AppPlace.

14
00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:50.010
Now, previously, when we were working in
CodePen, we had that script x template.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.318
And when you were working with it,

16
00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:57.743
it was hard to tell which template was
referring to which piece of the component.

17
00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:00.707
But here, you can see that in the App.vue,

18
00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:05.452
we have all of the template associated
with the data that it provides.

19
00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:07.990
And then we're bringing in a component.

20
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.184
So we have import AppPlace,
@/components/AppPlace.vue, and

21
00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:14.072
components: { AppPlace }.

22
00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:16.940
So, we're making sure that we're
bringing in that component.

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.583
Then we have this component
with location is location,

24
00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:23.223
so that we're passing that in as a prop.

25
00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:24.951
We also have a slot here.

26
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:28.350
That's like location is name, in that h2.

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.833
If we go over to AppPlace,
we have a component of its own.

28
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:38.865
And don't worry about it if you didn't
do this, but extra credit if you figured

29
00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:43.990
out to do this, that place is something
that's very special to this component.

30
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.412
So if you brought over this class places
styles as well to the laying CSS scope.

31
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.868
So, if we scoped that places styles,
that makes a lot of sense,

32
00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.081
because we're not using it in
App.vue in that component.

33
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:04.803
We're using it in the AppPlace, so we put
all of the associative styles in here.

34
00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:07.683
We're bringing in the props of location,
just like we did in the pen.

35
00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:12.670
And then we have the image,
the slot and the location.

36
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.992
So we now have the App.vue that has
kind of the main brains, right?

37
00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.982
It's got the locations,
and then it gives it out.

38
00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:24.855
And we have multiple components for
that AppPlace.
