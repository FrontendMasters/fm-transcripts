00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:07.680
If we look back at our first challenge,
what we had was this hard coded area.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.590
And what we needed to do was create
a component and try to put a slot in.

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.500
So here's the solution.

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.811
And just like some other ones,
there are multiple solutions,

5
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:20.382
cuz you could have put
slots in multiple places.

6
00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:25.233
So what we did here was we created
a script type="text/x-template"

7
00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.432
with id of place.

8
00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.038
And we've got an image
source that's passed in.

9
00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:33.661
location.img and
location.description are passed in.

10
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.570
We have all of our locations here.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.822
We have our app.component("place".

12
00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:42.585
I'm showing the simple
way of writing props.

13
00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:45.690
Extra props to you, get it, props?

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.614
Extra props to you if you
actually did the type.validation,

15
00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:53.323
and required true, and
defaults, and things like that.

16
00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:57.209
Defaults are really nice because if
somebody doesn't provide information for

17
00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:01.103
you, it's not like the component fails or
looks funny or something like that.

18
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:05.153
So here we passed in a slot.

19
00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:08.522
And so
what I did was I created this location,

20
00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:13.055
and I'm passing its locations,
locations and locations.

21
00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:18.351
[LAUGH] location bound to location,
you can name props the same thing.

22
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:23.460
And then inside of here,
I said location.name in the slot.

23
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.080
So that behaves the same way as
a prop would of in this case.

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.590
I'm just doing this to show
how slots could work as well.
