00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.780
V-ON or the at symbol.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.580
So V-ON is another one of those
modifiers that's super, super useful.

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.980
So we're going to use an at sign,
because it's a shortcut.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.510
It's something that we can get going with,

5
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.770
and it's a little bit more legible
than writing V-ON, V-ON, V-ON.

6
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.950
So it's extremely useful.

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.020
It's for binding to events like click and
mouse enter.

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.296
You're able to pass in a parameter for
the events like e,

9
00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:27.924
you don't have to pass it in to
the initial way that you call it.

10
00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:29.605
And I'll explain this in a minute,

11
00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:33.040
you can just pass it into the method
if you're using it that way.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.780
We can also use ternary directly.

13
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.880
And at first,
we're going to just use ternary directly,

14
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.690
because I'm going to just show you all
the directives first, but don't worry.

15
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.350
In the next section, I'll show you how to
wire those up to methods so that you can

16
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.370
write actual functions that are called
once you do something with a click event.

17
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.590
So let's say we have this backpack.

18
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.880
And in this backpack, we wanna
increase the quantity of the backpack.

19
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.026
But we don't want them to be able
to order negative backpacks, right?

20
00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:04.780
[LAUGH] There's no such
thing as negative backpacks,

21
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.848
maybe then we'd owe them
the customer money I'm not sure.

22
00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:11.961
So if we wanted to do this super
quickly inside of a click event,

23
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:16.930
we could say, at click, and then we say
if the counter is greater than zero,

24
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.460
then we make the counter less.

25
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.300
Otherwise, just state zero.

26
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.450
And here we're increasing the counter.

27
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.860
So if it's just a small
bit of ternary logic or

28
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.440
a small bit of other kind of logic,
it's totally fine to execute here.

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.480
Anything more robust than this, you're
not gonna write a full function in here.

30
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.180
You're gonna move into our view instance.

31
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.960
So here we have the counter.

32
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.910
And you can see those click events file.

33
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.200
You can do multiple bindings,
I sometimes make games in view.

34
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.350
And this is really handy for making
games in view or something of that sort.

35
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.603
So like let's say I wanna bind
both to a click event and

36
00:01:57.603 --> 00:02:00.361
also to something with
a key at the same time.

37
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.713
Because let's say they're
using their keyboard or

38
00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:04.540
they're also using their mouse.

39
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.376
I could say V-ON or at, and
then we can say mouse down, do this,

40
00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:10.911
mouse up, do that.
