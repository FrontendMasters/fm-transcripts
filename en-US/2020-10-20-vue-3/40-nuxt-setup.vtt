WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
So in order to create a new project, we'll
say yarn create next-app my-project and

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.128
I also linked up the guides for
the installation.

3
00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:11.930
We're not gonna go through everything for
time purposes, but

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.180
I will walk you through the setup of
what the next project looks like.

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.360
So if we replace what their
boilerplate of index.vue is,

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.218
and just say here's a template with,

7
00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:30.300
a next-link to for
a different page to the product page.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.910
So replace index.vue, so we've got
index.vue, and then a product.vue.

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.183
All of a sudden we have this,

10
00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:42.729
we have an application that has two pages,
product and index.

11
00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.429
And I'll show you this
when we go back into,

12
00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.239
let me go clear this out,
we'll go back to the terminal.

13
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.156
I'm gonna go up a level,

14
00:00:55.156 --> 00:01:00.762
cd intro-to-view, cd setup2.

15
00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.820
And then if we look at a kind of Nuxt-ish
setup of the last pen that we did, so

16
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.128
we had that pen and
we had that application, but

17
00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:05.299
we didn't build out many pieces of this.

18
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.139
And I mentioned routing

19
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:14.979
about as something that

20
00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.820
Nuxt does really well.

21
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.353
When we're working with Vue router or
when we're working with Vue CLI,

22
00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:29.587
as I mentioned, you add in Vue router
as a library in dependency, and

23
00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:31.487
then you declare every route.

24
00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:34.730
And then in Nuxt,
you don't have to do that.

25
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.549
So I'm gonna show this with a menu bar.

26
00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.807
And I'm gonna show a couple of other
things that is really cool and

27
00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:40.790
unique to Nuxt.

28
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.050
So right now,
I'm in this kind of local hosts 3,000.

29
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.650
If I go to the cart page,
you can see that,

30
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.070
it's actually going to a route named cart,
and

31
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.310
then I can go back into the homepage,
and then we have this component here.

32
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.080
Now if you go to Nuxt, and

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.180
we look at what that looks like, based
off of the same thing that we just did,

34
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.660
we have an index.vue page that
was like our app.vue, right?

35
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.300
We've got our index.vue,
it's kind of holding that

36
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.220
first bit here with the unit and
the row, and

37
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.430
we've got this component that we're
bringing in from a components directory.

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.210
So this is very much the same,
you don't have to get used to

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900
a whole new way of working
because you're working with Nuxt,

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.910
you have components in
your component directory.

41
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.690
So we have a component here but

42
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.398
the difference is, I also have a pages
directory where I have .vuecomponents.

43
00:02:35.398 --> 00:02:40.467
But these .vuecomponents will
automatically turn into pages of my app,

44
00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.029
which is really nice.

45
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.970
So that cart.vue that we just saw has
this template with like your cart,

46
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.680
thank you for shopping with us and
all of this, which is really nice.

47
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.700
In assets,
we put things like global style sheet.

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.670
So we could add a global style sheet and

49
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.711
what we would do is we'd go into
this thing called Nuxt config.js,

50
00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:09.280
our Nuxt config file is like the brains
of the application in a sense.

51
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.680
It will tell all of the things
that we needed to do, right?

52
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.205
I mentioned that we have different
rendering modes, whether or

53
00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:22.310
not we wanna target static
meaning like jam stack builds or

54
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.778
if we wanna do more like server
side rendered or if we want SPAs.

55
00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:29.306
And they do a really good job
of kind of commenting and

56
00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:31.550
giving you more information here.

57
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.090
And you notice in Vue CLI where
we had in the public folder,

58
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.360
in index.html file where we're
adding fonts and things.

59
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.830
This is where we're adding
fonts inside of our Nuxt

60
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.440
config because it's server side rendered.

61
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.570
So all of these pages
are dynamically going to be created.

62
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.480
And so here we've got our links and
our head tag and

63
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.800
our meta tags, but they're expressed
in this kind of JSON format instead.

64
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.230
If we wanted a global CSS,
we could make like main.css here and

65
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.900
then I would plop it into
this array in the CSS here.

66
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.390
I could add plugins, so if I wanted to
use external libraries that I might

67
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.710
bring in globally for the entire app,
I can do so in plugins.

68
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.250
And there's all of these other
options that are available to us.

69
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.550
So we have static files like
a favicon would go in here,

70
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.750
any static images that you
need go in the static folder,

71
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.870
and you can actually access them as though
they're at the base of the directory.

72
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.450
We have a store,
which is a place to put our Vuex file,

73
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.580
we'll get to Vuex later today.

74
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.811
You don't have to install Vuex,

75
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.700
Nuxt will automatically look for
a file in the store directory and

76
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.810
say, you've got Vuex, I will make
sure that Vuex is wired up for you.

77
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.180
So it does some of this sniffing to make
sure that it wires things up like routing,

78
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.870
like it wires up your store and
that's quite nice.

79
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.960
But I think that one of the nicest
capabilities is that ability to make

80
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.190
dynamic pages and have all of these
pages render directly for you.

81
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.450
So one more thing is this layouts
directory, this is super cool.

82
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.000
So for every single page that we create,
it's going to

83
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.620
route through a default.vue and it's gonna
route through this component called Nuxt.

84
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.610
Now, if I wanted something to persist on
every single page of my entire build,

85
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.320
I could bring in my navigation and
say app menu.

86
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.880
And bring it in from my
components directory.

87
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.420
And now it will be on every single page,
it will persist on every single page.

88
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.770
So that means that you don't have to keep
declaring in your pages, go get the nav,

89
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.790
go get the footer, or anything that's kind
of the same among all of these things.

90
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:58.640
So if we go back here, now, this is
actually persisting between those pages.

91
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.950
So I didn't have to put it
back on every single page.

92
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.390
If I wanted to make a footer,
I could do that as well.

93
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.660
I can make more layouts as well as
long as it has that next route.

94
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.840
I could go into a page in say,
in the data I could say

95
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.780
layout, in an object, I didn't spell
that right, you should spell it right.

96
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.470
And then we could say
which layout we wanted.

97
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.069
So if I wanted a different layout for
my blog say, I wanted to make sure that I

98
00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.646
always have the sidebar component and
I always have this,

99
00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:35.615
you can declare that in layouts and have
a bunch of different types of blog pages.

100
00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:38.827
But they're all kind of a little
bit similar because they have

101
00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:43.027
the same structure or they have the same
aside sidebar or something like that, so

102
00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:45.520
that's quite interesting and
really unique.
