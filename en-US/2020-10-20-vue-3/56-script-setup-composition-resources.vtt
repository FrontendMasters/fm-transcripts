00:00:00.174 --> 00:00:03.328
There's a little bit of sugar
that we just introduced,

2
00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:05.240
Evan just announced this [LAUGH].

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.390
So, previously, we were saying, export
default and then we're saying script.

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.000
Now you can say script, and we were
putting a setup function inside of it.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.440
Now you are able to say, script set up, so

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.990
you can do it either way, you can say
script and then a set up function.

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.208
And that's where you have all of your refs
and things, or you can say script set up.

8
00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.487
So this is what that would look like,

9
00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:33.839
instead of putting it inside a setup
function, you say script setup.

10
00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.905
Then you have this const state
equals reactive, count to zero,

11
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.133
onMounted state.count, and
you're returning the state here.

12
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:48.059
Further resources, we just did all sorts
of stuff to document the composition

13
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.279
API in the vue 3 docs, there's the link
to that composition API documentation.

14
00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:58.483
There was also previously,
a whole another microsite about

15
00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:02.368
the composition API where
we were documenting things.

16
00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:06.315
This has slightly more information,
I'm eventually gonna merge this into here.

17
00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:09.709
But I'm showing both links, for
now you might come along in the future and

18
00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.260
there's just one link here,
it's because all of that got merged.

19
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.180
There's also this really
cool site called Vueuse,

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.528
and this is really interesting,
I'll show it really quickly.

21
00:01:21.528 --> 00:01:26.569
So, it's tree shakable, and
you can use all of these

22
00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.957
different kind of composition API
functions, use local storage,

23
00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:38.240
use session storage,
use device motion, use device.

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.460
So this is both good for, if you wanna
use them in your project as it is,

25
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.160
or if you just wanna learn how to
work with the composition API.

26
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.431
And you wanna dive into the code here,
and see how they set everything up.

27
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:55.800
So this is a really good resource for
both just grabbing it and using it, or

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.360
actually learning more.
