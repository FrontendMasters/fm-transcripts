00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:02.830
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And
log in, it's pretty similar.

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.568
So I will also use my
teacher rights to copy and

3
00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:12.500
paste and then work around it.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.082
You also have it in the Freadme
in case you want to use it.

5
00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.753
And then I need to change,
well, I don't have a name.

6
00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:24.069
I don't have a confirmation here,
so it's log in.

7
00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.752
Email, login, password, and
then only maybe two validations for

8
00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:30.238
email and password.

9
00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.319
I don't have confirmation.

10
00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:36.804
And then I will go to API,
dot login, no name, email and

11
00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.772
password and kind of the same thing.

12
00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:42.975
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Right?

13
00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:46.432
So if I try to log in,
then I type an email, a password,

14
00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:49.834
I try to log in, I click there,
and nothing happens.

15
00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.595
So we actually need to debug this.

16
00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:57.075
If we go to the HTML, we can see that on
submit, we are calling app dot login.

17
00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.188
So the next step is to
look into the app Js file.

18
00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:05.084
And the app js has a login property,
so it should execute this.

19
00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:09.968
But if you scroll down a little bit,
we actually are keeping two logins.

20
00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:14.224
And the problem with JSON is that the
second one is replacing the first one, so

21
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.401
nothing is happening because of that.

22
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:19.873
So be careful, and
we need to remove that one.

23
00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:22.750
Instead of having two log ins.

24
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.570
So now I, if I save.

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.846
Refresh.

26
00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:29.350
And try again.

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.353
Any password I log in.

28
00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:33.584
And now [SOUND],
something weird has happened.

29
00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:37.399
But it's trying to, first,
it's trying to save me the password, okay?

30
00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.349
And then say, enter a password
where at least seven characters.

31
00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:42.607
And then it moves somewhere else.

32
00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:44.516
So what happened here?

33
00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:47.681
Something weird happened, okay?

34
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:50.879
The thing is that if we follow the errors.

35
00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:54.433
Actually, we are showing
an error at some point.

36
00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:57.251
And I'm not sure if you
remember that show, an error.

37
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.822
If we go to show an error.

38
00:01:58.822 --> 00:02:03.438
The sketch actually in this same file,
it has a second argument go to home.

39
00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:04.862
That is true by default.

40
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:08.569
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Maybe
we can say false by default.

41
00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.387
So if you wanna go to
the home explicitly say so,

42
00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:18.031
because it was showing me the error and
then it was getting out, okay?

43
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.490
So it was kind of weird.

44
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.931
So one more time.

45
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:28.287
Now, let's type at least seven characters,
login and authentication fail.

46
00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:31.393
So this is the server, okay?

47
00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:34.177
It's still going to the home, so

48
00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:38.160
let me see if I save this
go to Home equals false.

49
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.124
So it shouldn't go to Refresh.

50
00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:47.527
Sorry, wrong password.

51
00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:50.237
Authentication fail is
not going to the home.

52
00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:52.432
So it's working now, okay?

53
00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:53.464
So it's not working.

54
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:58.077
Now, if I have a short password, log in.

55
00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:01.032
It's not short enough like this.

56
00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:01.697
There we are.

57
00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:05.060
Now I'm getting a client
inside of our message.

58
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.493
This is our JavaScript validation, okay?

59
00:03:08.493 --> 00:03:12.124
If I have a wrong email, so the email
does not exist in the server, but

60
00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:13.768
the password is the right one.

61
00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:15.832
I'm still getting authentication failed.

62
00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:18.893
We can make a better error message, okay?

63
00:03:18.893 --> 00:03:24.482
And if I do the right one, so
the right email and the right password.

64
00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:26.102
I'm actually in.

65
00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:30.042
And by the way,
my password manager say you should change

66
00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:34.491
your password because 123457,
is easy to guess, okay?

67
00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:35.825
It's okay, I know.

68
00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:36.761
I know.

69
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.437
And by the way it's trying
to save the password.

70
00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:46.886
The password manager, and
also it went to forward slash account.

71
00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:49.302
That was what I expected, okay?

72
00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:55.315
It's still not working because I didn't
create that page, but at least that works.

73
00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:58.697
Let's try registration to
check that everything works.

74
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:03.401
So I will create a new test
account with a new email.

75
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.533
It's a new at test of Dev and
the password.

76
00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:11.335
Well, let's try first, like a small
password, something like that.

77
00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:15.469
So you can see they have two
error messages at the same time,

78
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.530
which is okay,
because I was collecting error messages.

79
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.855
Like if I have a very short name,
I'm collecting error messages, okay?

80
00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:29.282
Which works, my validation.

81
00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:32.309
So let's say new test account.

82
00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:33.733
That password don't match.

83
00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:35.037
We have already checked that.

84
00:04:35.037 --> 00:04:37.628
And the other password
is really complicated.

85
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:39.183
It's adminadmin, okay?

86
00:04:39.183 --> 00:04:41.133
This is really complicated.

87
00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:44.526
And if I register,
it seems like it worked,

88
00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:48.945
because it went to account
that it should say something.

89
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.855
And if I go to my database and refresh.

90
00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:54.835
Now, I have two users.

91
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:58.168
So my flow is working, okay?

92
00:04:58.168 --> 00:04:59.770
Magic has happened.
