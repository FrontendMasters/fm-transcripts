WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.263 --> 00:00:05.535
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So the final step
will be to actually create the routes.

2
00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:08.883
So, the path for example,

3
00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:13.401
I think it was account/favorites.

4
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:20.580
The component is FavoritesPage, and
do we need logged in through here,

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.710
yes, cuz we need the user to be logged in.

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.398
Remember we have done
that with the router, so

7
00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:33.990
now we have a system where if a route
needs logging, it will just work.

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.309
And something similar for the watch list.

9
00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.610
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay,
so now if I refresh,

10
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.726
I should be able to get into favorites and
watch list.

11
00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:54.094
If I refresh, and you can see right now,
it's saying there are no movies.

12
00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:59.077
So I'm not getting a page error or
not found, it seems to be the page, but

13
00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:04.798
there are no movies because, we know that
when we are going through that, if you see

14
00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:10.410
the network favorites is trying to bring
the favorites, that right now is null.

15
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.273
And watchlist is also getting, well
actually it's getting favorites watchlist.

16
00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:18.942
So we have a bug,
that's because I copy and paste it.

17
00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:24.830
So I think that on watch list page,
I also need to change the endpoint.

18
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.224
Does that make sense?

19
00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:32.087
So now this one will actually get from
watchlist that is a different collection.

20
00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:36.749
So if I go to watchlist,
now we can see it's using that endpoint.

21
00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.212
But of course,
right now my database is null, so

22
00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:45.038
we don't have any collection, so
we need to add to the collection.

23
00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:50.853
That's the last step before seeing this,
if everything works.

24
00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:55.016
Adding to the collections right now,
we will make just the basic part, and

25
00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:58.206
you will have some homework
to do the more advanced part.

26
00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:00.459
That is, for example,
having a way to remove a collection.

27
00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.291
Right now, when we add a favorite,
it will be there forever, okay?

28
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.865
But the other part is pretty simple,

29
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:11.370
it's just adding the remove
service as well.

30
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.035
So to answer the collection,
we need to actually create a new

31
00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:20.161
service that will be called
from where when you're.

32
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:25.736
When you are watching my movie, when
you are seeing the details of a movie,

33
00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:28.318
we have these two buttons, okay?

34
00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:29.959
So these two buttons,
let's try to analyze where they are.

35
00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.098
So if I go to my index html,
I and look for

36
00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:39.502
those buttons,
those buttons will be available.

37
00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:45.498
In template movie details,
so they are here, okay?

38
00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.607
And we have the button Add to Favorites,

39
00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:51.027
Add to watch list that they don't
have any click handler, okay?

40
00:02:51.027 --> 00:02:55.109
So I need to bind an event
handler to those, and

41
00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.298
there are two ways to do that,
I can do it from here, from HTML, okay.

42
00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:06.147
As we did with other buttons, but we may
have a problem if we do that in this way,

43
00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:09.244
I'm not sure if you realize
what's the problem.

44
00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:12.635
I mean, I can say add and
add to favorites, or

45
00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:17.110
however you wanna call this,
or maybe save to collection.

46
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.046
So we use the same function for both.

47
00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:22.846
The problem is that to
save to a collection,

48
00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:24.976
I should pass the ID of the movie.

49
00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:31.284
And I'm writing a template right now,
where should I get the ID of the movie?

50
00:03:31.284 --> 00:03:32.131
Does that make sense?

51
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:32.773
Yeah.

52
00:03:32.773 --> 00:03:36.541
So if I here need to pass an argument,
let's say I wanna pass,

53
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:40.029
this is gonna be a favorite,
so that's the collection.

54
00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:45.618
But then I need the ID, of the current
movie, or the movie that I'm rendering.

55
00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:49.831
But where should I get the ID from?

56
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.431
So, there are two ways
to solve the problem,

57
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.578
I think we will solve the problem
in the cleaner way, or

58
00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:59.496
I think it's a cleaner way, but
lemme show you the dirty way first.

59
00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:04.784
The dirty way will let you do
something like this, what if we,

60
00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:09.258
when you're using the DOM,
you can, for example,

61
00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:14.973
talk to your parents,
the parent is actually the parent element.

62
00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:16.870
So if I'm in a button,
the parent will be a section.

63
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.151
So maybe later, through JavaScript,
you can check the ID here, so

64
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:25.504
then you can get the ID with something
like this, I'm not saying this

65
00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:30.489
code will work as it is, but to give you
the idea, it's a little dirty, okay.

66
00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:35.433
It works, but it will solve the problem
because later from Javascript,

67
00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:40.229
you will inject that ID as a custom
property, and then we work, okay.

68
00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.737
But I think in this case,
it's gonna be better to just create

69
00:04:45.737 --> 00:04:51.367
the event listeners,
when we are creating the details page.

70
00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:56.667
Remember that here we
are creating the cast,

71
00:04:56.667 --> 00:05:00.299
we are doing all this binding.

72
00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:05.324
Well, here we can add we can say, you know
what I will go and grab from here we have

73
00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:10.818
two buttons, maybe if you want, we can add
ID, so it's better to find those buttons.

74
00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:14.149
So maybe that's okay,
like button favorites.

75
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:18.181
I can use the DOM also to just
find the first button, and

76
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:20.995
the second button, but maybe later.

77
00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:24.277
A designer thinks that, well,
we should reorder the buttons and

78
00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:25.899
then then everything blows up.

79
00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:31.409
So that's why it's better to just do this.

80
00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.303
So then I can try and get, well, now it's
an ID, so I can use get element by ID.

81
00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.599
Gavi, remember?

82
00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.647
Now you have get movie by ID,

83
00:05:41.647 --> 00:05:47.364
which instead of get element
by Id as possibilities.

84
00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:52.868
So get element by Id will then now I have

85
00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:58.716
the button for favorites, so I can add,

86
00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:04.221
an event listener for tick like this.

87
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.317
And something similar for watch list.

88
00:06:06.317 --> 00:06:09.991
And here I can go and
what, I wanna call you up,

89
00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:14.623
and I wanna save this to a collection,
and where is the id?

90
00:06:14.623 --> 00:06:18.603
Well, I actually have the movie here.

91
00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:21.577
So I will just say this movie id, and

92
00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:26.051
this is gonna be favorite,
that's the collection.

93
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:32.766
And for watchlist, remember this is the
render method of our work component that

94
00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:38.114
is gonna be executed every time
we are rendering a page details.

95
00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:43.702
So, when we are doing that,
we are also binding

96
00:06:43.702 --> 00:06:48.749
the action listeners for our two buttons.

97
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:49.885
Okay, this makes sense?

98
00:06:49.885 --> 00:06:54.669
So I don't have yet the code,
so it's not gonna work,

99
00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.559
but if I open the console and
try to click these buttons,

100
00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:04.884
it's not working, so
let's try to debug what's going on.

101
00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:08.081
So actually, if you look at the html, so

102
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:13.457
there are some hashes here that
shouldn't be there, this is html.

103
00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:16.041
So it's just the id, just that.

104
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:21.899
But we didn't get any errors, so
anyway, we should, the thing is,

105
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:27.757
what happened is when you do get
element by id, and returns nothing.

106
00:07:27.757 --> 00:07:28.833
It's undefined, so
it should give us an error anyway.

107
00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:35.001
Remember, you can always try
this from the console as well.

108
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.728
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: When
you are doing the console,

109
00:07:43.728 --> 00:07:48.462
remember that these you are not in a web
component, so this is not gonna work, so

110
00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:51.731
you need to check and
try with document, for example.

111
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:53.048
And now you see that
we do have the button.

112
00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:57.523
So that means that now when you
click here, something will happen,

113
00:07:57.523 --> 00:08:01.145
the problem is that,
we don't have yet the function.

114
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:08.512
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, so
we need save to up, save to collection.

115
00:08:08.512 --> 00:08:14.704
So, save to collection,
we just need to call our method.

116
00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:19.526
So that's the last,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Part that

117
00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:24.068
we will have, so
we will go to public app.js.

118
00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:28.841
And the last service that we
will have here somewhere,

119
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:33.731
for example after the logout
is the save to collection.

120
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:34.408
We already have one.

121
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.427
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: On h5 this
is our save to collection, and

122
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:48.255
now let's analyze what
it's trying to achieve.

123
00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:56.445
So save to collection first is
verifying if you are logged in or not.

124
00:08:56.445 --> 00:08:57.284
Why is that?

125
00:08:57.284 --> 00:09:02.237
Because of course, you can click in
a button and you are not logged in.

126
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:03.213
Does it make sense?

127
00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:06.941
And we don't wanna save anything,
because the user is not logged in.

128
00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:10.259
So what we are doing here, if it's false,

129
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.682
we are sending the user
to the account page.

130
00:09:13.682 --> 00:09:20.516
But the account page needs login, so it we
will be redirected to the login screen.

131
00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:25.292
So this is a quick way to say, okay,
is this, you need to go and log in.

132
00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:26.252
Okay?

133
00:09:26.252 --> 00:09:27.955
Because if not, it's not gonna work.

134
00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:32.644
If you are logged in,
I will try to save this to a collection.

135
00:09:32.644 --> 00:09:36.634
And if it's a favorite of a watch list,
I will then,

136
00:09:36.634 --> 00:09:40.920
after clicking there,
I will send the user to that url.

137
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.460
And that will give me
directly the list of current

138
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.676
favorites I should see the one
that I have just created.

139
00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:52.596
Okay, does it make sense?

140
00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:56.668
Something important here is that I should
use constants to avoid these issues, but

141
00:09:56.668 --> 00:09:58.954
I'm using singular favorite and
watch list.

142
00:09:58.954 --> 00:10:04.003
So we need to be very careful
when we are calling this,

143
00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:07.932
in this case from our movie details page,

144
00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:12.105
that we are using
the same collection type.

145
00:10:12.105 --> 00:10:16.263
Because the constant is different,
and then it's not gonna work.

146
00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:21.004
Now that we are ready to try this,
let's first fill some gaps that we have.

147
00:10:21.004 --> 00:10:25.408
Let's say for example, in our html,

148
00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:30.094
we are actually binding these buttons.

149
00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:34.482
So something that we can do always, and
maybe it's a good idea, mostly when you

150
00:10:34.482 --> 00:10:38.761
are doing web components, if those web
components are not using shadow DOM.

151
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:43.560
Remember Shadow DOM will let us make
like a small little Dom, just for

152
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.027
the web component, and
we are not doing that in this project, so

153
00:10:48.027 --> 00:10:50.037
we are not using Shadow DOM.

154
00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:55.570
Is that maybe we can be more specific
when we are doing even if it's an id,

155
00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:01.405
okay, for example, we could say that,
we want the button inside actions.

156
00:11:01.405 --> 00:11:06.528
So instead of using a by id,
let's use query selector.

157
00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:10.003
And because it's squared selector, I need
a css selector, so I need to add id.

158
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:14.841
And then you can say, you know what
it's not any button, even if it's an id,

159
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.796
and it shouldn't be duplicated,
you don't know, it may be.

160
00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:24.482
The browser will never enforce that,
so I can say this inside action.

161
00:11:24.482 --> 00:11:28.417
Okay, so I'm saying this button
inside actions, that's one thing.

162
00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:33.717
Then we have a gap in the API,
because we have already added

163
00:11:33.717 --> 00:11:39.898
the authorization token, but
we are not saving to the collection.

164
00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:42.452
So we are getting favorites and
worksheets, but

165
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:46.763
saved to collection is empty, so we need
to fill that gap, so save to collection.

166
00:11:46.763 --> 00:11:50.903
Remember, receives a movie id,
and a collection and

167
00:11:50.903 --> 00:11:53.391
need to send that to the server.

168
00:11:53.391 --> 00:11:57.095
We are not going to use fetch for
that, because we are sending data.

169
00:11:57.095 --> 00:12:00.922
I remember when we are sending,
we have another function that is send.

170
00:12:00.922 --> 00:12:06.169
So we are going to return wherever
it's coming from API.send,

171
00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:11.330
and the service name is account
forward/save to collection.

172
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.560
Okay, this should match
exactly what you have,

173
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.185
in your main.go in this case,
save to collection.

174
00:12:22.185 --> 00:12:24.176
Okay, so it's matching that.

175
00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.216
And then we need to pass the data.

176
00:12:26.216 --> 00:12:29.660
And for the data,
we're going to pass an object,

177
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.190
that will contain the movie id and
the collection.

178
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.646
Remember here I'm using the JSON
shortcut available in JavaScript,

179
00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:44.198
so this is like saying movie id is
movie id, collection is collection.

180
00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:48.075
Okay, so you'll need to do that,

181
00:12:48.075 --> 00:12:51.964
we just pasising the option like.

182
00:12:51.964 --> 00:12:54.680
And we also need to check that,

183
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.277
were in this case our
collection the abstract page,

184
00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:04.724
is actually creating new
instances of movie item component.

185
00:13:04.724 --> 00:13:09.723
A movie agent component is
currently not imported,

186
00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:14.835
so we need to use contrast space and
add that import and

187
00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:19.834
remember, our friend VS
code is not adding in.js so

188
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:23.256
I need to go and add the.js, okay?

189
00:13:23.256 --> 00:13:26.160
At least to see if everything works.

190
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.426
So let's say now, I will refresh,
I will get into a mad max and

191
00:13:31.426 --> 00:13:36.003
I will see what happens if I
click on Add to Favorites.

192
00:13:36.003 --> 00:13:40.925
I click there and boom,
I'm in the favorite section and

193
00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:45.126
I'm seeing Mad Max already
there in the table.

194
00:13:45.126 --> 00:13:49.046
If I'm going to watch list,
I still there are no movies.

195
00:13:49.046 --> 00:13:51.616
Remember, you see that
little animation for

196
00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:55.750
a while that is loading that's
the loading animation that we have done.

197
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.525
So if I go to other movie,
no Jurassic World,

198
00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:01.747
I add it to my watch list
It's there in my watch list.

199
00:14:01.747 --> 00:14:03.706
So I can go now to favorites.

200
00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:08.907
I see Mad Max, I can go to watchlist,
I see Jurassic World,

201
00:14:08.907 --> 00:14:12.859
and of course,
I should be able to log out, so

202
00:14:12.859 --> 00:14:18.594
now if I go to favorites,
it sends me to log in, I cannot see them.

203
00:14:18.594 --> 00:14:21.763
And if I log in, test@test.dev,

204
00:14:21.763 --> 00:14:27.372
I should be able now to to see
again my favorites and my watches.

205
00:14:27.372 --> 00:14:31.882
And of course,
I can add more okay to both favorites.

206
00:14:31.882 --> 00:14:34.703
Okay, and watch this if you want
the same movie can be in two

207
00:14:34.703 --> 00:14:36.729
different collections at the same time.

208
00:14:36.729 --> 00:14:39.945
Okay, that's make sense?

209
00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:42.199
So as I mentioned, yeah,
there are more things you can add.

210
00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:46.448
You can add, for example Here, like it can
be like an X button, that you can delete

211
00:14:46.448 --> 00:14:49.787
it from there, or you can ask
the user you sure you wanna delete.

212
00:14:49.787 --> 00:14:54.496
So there are still more actions that
you can add to this project, but

213
00:14:54.496 --> 00:14:57.149
now we have the full project working.

214
00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:00.702
So we have a home page,
that is rendering top movies and

215
00:15:00.702 --> 00:15:06.359
also random movies every time I refresh,
I'm getting new suggestion to watch today.

216
00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:09.729
I can get to the details of a movie,
in this case,

217
00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:13.194
I have the Youtube trailer and
some information.

218
00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:18.744
Well, in this case, it seems like
this one has no enough information,

219
00:15:18.744 --> 00:15:25.418
this movie compared with other movies, it
has no cast, that's part of the dataset.

220
00:15:25.418 --> 00:15:28.851
The one that I picked has no cast,
so here we can see Michael Keaton.

221
00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:34.477
I can add these movies to favorites or
to a watch list.

222
00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:36.344
I can see my account, I can log out,

223
00:15:36.344 --> 00:15:40.031
I can also search movies remember
that we can search movies from here.

224
00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:43.707
So if you wanna search Harry or
Harry Potter,

225
00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:46.626
I can see all the movies with Harry.

226
00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:52.005
I can reorder this, by score,
by release date, okay, by name.

227
00:15:52.005 --> 00:15:54.693
And I can filter by genre, so

228
00:15:54.693 --> 00:16:00.193
I can see only comedies with
Harry work somewhere, okay?

229
00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:06.924
So we have a fully working, full stack
project, that we did mostly from scratch.

230
00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:11.107
Yeah, there were some
pieces that we pasted,

231
00:16:11.107 --> 00:16:15.199
just to avoid spending
too much time coding.

232
00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:22.697
But from the database creation, importing
the data to the front end, to the login,

233
00:16:22.697 --> 00:16:27.986
the JWT token authentication,
we have the full app ready.
