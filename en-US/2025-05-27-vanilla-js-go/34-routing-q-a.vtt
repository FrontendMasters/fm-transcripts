WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.394
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why would you not use
the constructor of the web component

2
00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:10.236
to pass in the ID versus
creating this additional?

3
00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:15.333
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So, I mean,
we can, what you're talking about is

4
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:20.561
that we should first get the params and
then do this.

5
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.849
No, actually, this again, no, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.091
And here pass params, right?

7
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:32.574
Yep, if you like that, it's fine.

8
00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.404
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You were
suggesting as a data attribute.

9
00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.507
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Also it
can be a data attribute, yeah.

10
00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:43.525
So instead of this, you can use datalist.

11
00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:47.297
And you can say, urlParans.

12
00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:52.190
By the way, when you use this, urlParams,

13
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.360
becomes data-url-params automatically.

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.470
It converts camel case into Kevav case,
that's the one with the hyphen.

15
00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:06.032
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So in this case,
yeah, you pick the solution you want.

16
00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.695
Actually, it's not gonna
be a big difference.

17
00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.130
Okay?
So you can pass as an argument in

18
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.287
the constructor, but that means that you
will need to create the constructor that

19
00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:14.131
sometimes you don't do
that in web component.

20
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:18.351
But, yeah, if you need the data,
you will be forced to do that.

21
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:19.374
In this case, yeah.

22
00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:23.819
I created just a normal argument,
okay, but it's up to you.

23
00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.356
It's just the same.

24
00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:30.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What happens if you have
more than one route that has the projects.

25
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.281
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Well, as many
router systems the order is important,

26
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:39.201
so the first one that
is actually matching.

27
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.247
Okay, actually, I didn't do this.

28
00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:45.645
You do a break, which means that
the first one that matches you go outside

29
00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:48.255
of the floor, so
it will use the first one.

30
00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:54.648
The first route that you find that matches
the current URL will be the chosen one.

31
00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:55.635
Is that what you ask?

32
00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:59.953
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I guess, if you have, for
instance, right now you have movie/id.

33
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.705
Now what if it's account/id?

34
00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.637
How can you tell the router,
which route to take?

35
00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:09.105
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Well,
actually, you will change this.

36
00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:13.893
So account,
it will be another one with this.

37
00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:15.302
That what you're saying?

38
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.187
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right,
something like that, account ID.

39
00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:19.198
Then how does it to know where to go?

40
00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:23.531
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Here,
because you will change this account page.

41
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.935
So that component is the one that
the router will use based on

42
00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:28.102
the current route.

43
00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:32.637
So it will send the parameter
to account page.

44
00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:33.544
Does it make sense?

45
00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:38.241
So we are creating a router
that then you can use

46
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:43.068
later to add more routes
in different formats.

47
00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:46.552
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But it's all based on
the current path that you're on.

48
00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:51.143
So if I go from my
AccountPage to movie page,

49
00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:57.238
it's gonna use a router based
on the path that I'm going?

50
00:02:57.238 --> 00:02:59.290
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I'm
not sure I'm following you.

51
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.710
So the router is reading the URL, okay?

52
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.158
So when the URL changes,
the router sees the URL.

53
00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:07.715
It doesn't matter where you are.

54
00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:10.547
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's reading the new URL and

55
00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:12.859
said, we need to go there,
and it goes there.

56
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.074
So there is no relationship between
the previous page and the next page.

57
00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:19.933
Does it make sense?

58
00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.519
Sure?

59
00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.426
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, no, so it's all
based on where you're at, basically, and

60
00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:25.348
where you want to go.

61
00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:27.098
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Where
you wanna go, not where you are.

62
00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:28.244
It doesn't matter where you are.

63
00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:29.249
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Got it.

64
00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.878
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: For this router,
at least, it doesn't matter where you are.

65
00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:36.837
The only thing that matters is
where you want to go, okay?

66
00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:41.443
And you express where you want
to go by changing the route.

67
00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:44.825
And you can change the route,
you can call the route.

68
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:48.364
Let me remove this,
because it will give me an exception.

69
00:03:48.364 --> 00:03:52.665
Just calling Router.go with the location.

70
00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:59.367
Or maybe by changing the URL, we will
see that, how we should do that, okay?

71
00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:05.009
If I don't have any value,
I think that my router is ready.

72
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.476
Again, it's a little complex,
not too much.

73
00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:10.934
I just explained how that works.

74
00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:14.116
It's just programming,
nothing really complicated,

75
00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:18.633
just when you understand how that works,
okay, it's actually pretty simple.

76
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.634
You have any question on that?

77
00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:24.172
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Should the break be
inside of the if statement, or?

78
00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:26.764
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah,
you're right, thank you.

79
00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:33.011
So I do have about because if not,
it will on the first regular expression,

80
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:37.487
even if it's not matching,
it will just stop there.

81
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.976
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I think you
removed params from before.

82
00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:47.096
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Maybe,
yeah, you're right, yeah.

83
00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:52.966
So in this case,
we were taking the params for

84
00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:56.059
match.slice (1).

85
00:04:59.018 --> 00:05:00.344
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Now
we will see if it's working.

86
00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:06.281
But anyway, before seeing if we have any
any bug to solve, how to use the router.

87
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:10.084
Because right now it's in the module and
it's just a constant,

88
00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:12.491
I may wanna export maybe that constant.

89
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:16.916
But anyway,
how to use it from anywhere in my app?

90
00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.918
Well, we can expose it in app.js.

91
00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:26.302
Up here,
remember we do have a global window.app.

92
00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:29.306
By the way, going back to the window idea,
here is just window.app.

93
00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:33.015
Instead of saying window.app, I can
just say let app and it's just the same.

94
00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:34.445
It will be window app anyway.

95
00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:38.485
So let app because the global variable or
window app is just the same.

96
00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:43.399
So from here, I can just add

97
00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:47.470
the router like this.

98
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.695
This is a JSON shortcut.

99
00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:53.046
So this is like router router.

100
00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:58.239
But instead of saying router router, now
you can just say router and it just works.

101
00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:02.263
So that means that now, just for now,
to see if this is working or not,

102
00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:04.599
probably we have an error or something.

103
00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:11.065
I can say app.Router.go, and
I can try to go somewhere else,

104
00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:14.730
to someplace and see what happens.

105
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.842
We have an error saying cannot read
properties of undefined reading go.

106
00:06:18.842 --> 00:06:24.062
Okay, so, but I think the problem is
that then, I'm not sure if I refresh.

107
00:06:24.062 --> 00:06:25.523
Check that.

108
00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:29.803
Well, yeah, I didn't refresh,
and we have another issue.

109
00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:31.135
Quickly, what's going on?

110
00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:32.848
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

111
00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:35.629
I don't have the.js.

112
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:36.538
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Js.

113
00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:43.000
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's
an import here, missing the.js.

114
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.227
That's pretty common when you're doing
Manila Javascript and using VS Code.

115
00:06:46.227 --> 00:06:49.665
There is a property that you can change.

116
00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:52.750
I don't remember exactly which properties,
but

117
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.169
it's where you can say that you
always want to add the Javascript.js.
