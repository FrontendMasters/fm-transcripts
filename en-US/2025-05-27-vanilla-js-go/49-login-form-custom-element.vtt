WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.537
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So the
registration form is already on the screen

2
00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:04.839
and ready to use.

3
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.049
So let's create also the login one,
so we have both, and

4
00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.131
then we connect the client to the server,
that's the last part to make that work.

5
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:20.846
So going back to HTML, icon, again,
don't do this at home, but yeah,

6
00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:27.150
I'm the teacher, so I have the rights to
do that, I will copy and paste, okay?

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.711
From the template to register and

8
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:35.297
I will create the other template login and
make some changes from there.

9
00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:39.314
So we have this is the login form,

10
00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:43.618
when we log in we won't have a name,

11
00:00:43.618 --> 00:00:48.645
we won't have two passwords, only one.

12
00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:50.636
The button should say Login,

13
00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:54.944
and then the link if you don't
have an account register, okay?

14
00:00:54.944 --> 00:01:00.159
So we send the user back
to the registration.

15
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.126
And also change the IDs, so
it's not register email,

16
00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:08.190
let's call it login email,
or authentication email.

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.494
The same here, the same here, and also
we call app login and not app register.

18
00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:19.206
That's just the template,
remember, that's HTML and

19
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm sure that you're thinking like
early someone asked about this,

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.564
but everything is in the HTML.

21
00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.571
Maybe we can separate HTML in
separate files, we can do that.

22
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:37.192
And then to do that on the web component,
you just need to fetch the HTML for

23
00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:40.921
the template instead of
getting it from the DOM.

24
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:44.112
So I think that so
far we are good, I mean,

25
00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:47.954
in terms of the size of
the HTML is not really huge.

26
00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.286
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The auto complete
attribute needs to be-

27
00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:51.314
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's correct,

28
00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:55.806
yeah, we have to change the auto complete
attribute, which one, specifically,

29
00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:56.652
the password.

30
00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:59.660
In fact, sometimes I'm not
sure if you have seen this,

31
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.647
we need to use now current password.

32
00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:06.493
You go to your website and
then the password manager is suggesting to

33
00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:10.669
you a new password on the login screen,
and you say, why?

34
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.894
No, this is a login screen, well, that's
because the developer didn't change that,

35
00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:18.136
you probably copy and pasted, okay?

36
00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:22.408
So anyway,
now I need also the component and

37
00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.768
also add the component to a route.

38
00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:31.911
So I will, let's copy and paste the
registry page and create the login page.

39
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:39.175
And now I'm going to change login
page here, also here at the bottom.

40
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:43.960
And then it's the template login
the one that I'm going to read, and

41
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.766
I'm going to define this as login page,

42
00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:50.746
in case we wanna use the login
form somewhere in the HTML.

43
00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:56.246
Here is the part where you can
load it from an external HTML,

44
00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:59.546
so you just do something like this,

45
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:04.720
you fetch this from template
forward large login HTML.

46
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.758
And when you have it, you'll wait for
it because it's a fetch and

47
00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:13.178
you get it as text, not as JSON, and
then you inject it somehow, okay?

48
00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:15.348
That's how that works.

49
00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:20.161
Okay, so
now [COUGH] I need also the route for

50
00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:24.439
this, so I'm going to add one more for

51
00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.183
the path, account, login, and

52
00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:33.696
the component that I wanna
render is login page.

53
00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:38.819
So, now if I click in Log in,
I'm getting the login page,

54
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.538
so I can go from register to login,
and it just works.
