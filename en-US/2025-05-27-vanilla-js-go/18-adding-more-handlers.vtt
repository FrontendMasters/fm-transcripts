1
00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:06.834
We have already added all
the functions to our data repository.

2
00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.459
We just need to finish
the handlers because the handler,

3
00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.946
remember the handler is
the one that speaks HGTP only.

4
00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:19.888
It's only has get the movies and
get random movies, so we need the rest.

5
00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:24.759
Stop the services as well get movie by ID,
all the genre.

6
00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.351
So in this case,
we can go to the readme and

7
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.568
just we have here the final
movies handler.go.

8
00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:37.121
So I can copy and paste, or
I can just take the new ones.

9
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:41.823
Something that I have here is that if I

10
00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:46.072
copy everything like from here,

11
00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:52.458
I have better error management so
on, like this.

12
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.849
Also, I have a new movie handler that's,

13
00:00:55.849 --> 00:01:00.380
remember the in case you want it,
let's take it as well.

14
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.180
Code that will take
the storage,bbb great one.

15
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.246
I don't need to copy the imports,
typically VS code will actually

16
00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:18.137
update that for you, and
probably I have to update some things.

17
00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:20.844
So this is the handlers.

18
00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:26.380
Yes, I'm going to paste this here and
now it's DME error,

19
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.163
because this code was
expecting lowercase s and L.

20
00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:36.517
Okay, remember that I use because I was
showing you different ways to do that.

21
00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:41.507
We can go back to lowercase or
update every reference.

22
00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:45.874
Remember, if you do this
now they are private.

23
00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:49.113
So from the outside,
main is giving me an error now.

24
00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:53.318
So now main is in red, so
main is actually giving me an error.

25
00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:54.157
Why?

26
00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:58.539
Because now when we were trying to
initialize the storage, now it's private.

27
00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.397
So there is no way to do this.

28
00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:03.194
So now instead of creating
the instance like this,

29
00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:07.041
if you want to follow this pattern,
if not, you can keep it like this.

30
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:12.585
We can now call new movie handler,
and new movie handler will receive

31
00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:18.139
the both options, the log instance and
the movie repo as arguments.

32
00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.890
It's just the same, okay,
in this case, going through a factory.

33
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.091
Three, does it make sense?

34
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:28.703
So now that we do have the handlers,
we have the handler for

35
00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:30.973
GetGenres, for GetMovie.

36
00:02:30.973 --> 00:02:33.984
We have SearchMovies.

37
00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:39.703
In this case, you can see this is
receiving arguments through the get,

38
00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:41.338
so through the URL.

39
00:02:41.338 --> 00:02:44.972
So it's getting the query,
the order, the genre,

40
00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:48.285
and it's passing that
to the data repository.

41
00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.764
Remember handlers speaks HTTP.

42
00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:53.734
So that's why it's speaking URL.

43
00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:59.127
Speaking JSON is reading
information from the request.

44
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.488
Sending information back to the writer to.

45
00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:05.167
Response writer, and on the other side

46
00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:10.194
the repository is actually
speaking models and SQL.

47
00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:16.857
That's kind of the idea and after we have
the handles, we need to register the URLs.

48
00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:22.938
So that's actually the last step for
our server as aat least for the data part,

49
00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:29.037
because we still have the account type,
the login authentication for later.

50
00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:31.920
But for the movies part,

51
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.273
now we need to add
the the rest of the function,

52
00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:41.542
so handle func, so we will have API.

53
00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:47.352
Movies search, remember,
keep the trailing slash or

54
00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:51.280
not up to you, but stay consistent.

55
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.866
Movie handler, and
we will try to here call search movies,

56
00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:03.806
then we have one One that
takes one particular movie.

57
00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:05.281
So handle funk.

58
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:09.140
Look at this, I will just say movies/.

59
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.010
I will explain what
that is in a minute and

60
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.467
this is get movie, one movie,
and then handle funk.

61
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:27.479
Genre movie handler get genres.

62
00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.979
So what's the idea with this?

63
00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.819
Because it says movies.

64
00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.156
The idea is that this one
is going to be API movies.

65
00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:41.729
And the idea of the movie,
like for example, 140.

66
00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.241
I don't need, just say anything
special here, in this case,

67
00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:52.864
this handler will take everything,
starting with API movies.

68
00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:57.839
What about search random on top,
because they were defined before,

69
00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.546
they will handle the HTTP
request before this one.

70
00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:04.577
So that means the order is important.

71
00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:09.231
If I do this, top random and
search will never work.

72
00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:12.518
You understand why?

73
00:05:12.518 --> 00:05:15.155
The order is important.

74
00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:20.925
I want to pass the body,
right in JSON, You want to pass what?

75
00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:26.073
Sorry, The body, like JSON body.

76
00:05:26.073 --> 00:05:32.080
So instead of receiving, we will do
that for authentication and login.

77
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.735
We will pass data over the body in JSON.

78
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:35.594
So we will do that.

79
00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:41.723
But the answer is that the quick answer is
that it's not going to change this part.

80
00:05:41.723 --> 00:05:43.565
It's going to change the handler.

81
00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:48.204
So inside the handler,
you will use their request to

82
00:05:48.204 --> 00:05:52.855
read the body that is coming
from the client, okay?

83
00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:59.031
So you change actually the handler,
not actually how you register the handler.

84
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:04.567
There is no way to create a handle
that is doing Different there

85
00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:11.395
is a way to register to the HTTP system
a handler, but only if there is a body.

86
00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:12.851
You cannot do that.

87
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:17.103
In that case, you just create a handler,
and inside, you check if you do

88
00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:21.110
have the body or not, and based on that,
you call other functions.

89
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.626
So that means that now, if we try this.

90
00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:28.315
We have the top movies, random movies.

91
00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:33.539
We can request one movie, for example,

92
00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:40.309
this one, 542, and
it's giving me that movie.

93
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:45.176
And also,
we can request things like genres.

94
00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:50.177
Genres will give us the array, okay?

95
00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:50.705
And search.

96
00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:55.741
Search is more complicated because
there are more things here,

97
00:06:55.741 --> 00:07:00.601
but we can try to search and
search by, for example, Mad Max.

98
00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:04.719
Now it's giving me only
Mad Max Max Movies,

99
00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:10.186
mailbox four, URL Max Mark
beyond thunder dome and so on.

100
00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:13.170
And the original one, okay?

101
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.300
Does it make sense?
So we have the API up and running,

102
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.817
API that is currently
connected to our SQL database.

103
00:07:20.817 --> 00:07:24.646
This is just stage stage one for
our backend.

104
00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:26.043
The data is there.

105
00:07:26.043 --> 00:07:27.442
We can consume the data.

106
00:07:27.442 --> 00:07:31.571
The next stage will be authentication,
but that's for later.

107
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:34.096
But before doing that,
I wanna go to the client so

108
00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:35.955
we can actually see this in action.

109
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.637
Because right now everything is so

110
00:07:37.637 --> 00:07:40.306
abstract, it's time to see
something on the screen.
