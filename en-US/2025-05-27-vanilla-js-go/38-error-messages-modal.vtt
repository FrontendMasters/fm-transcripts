00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:04.740
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We still want more
thing to solve, and that is what happens

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.809
if I'm using a wrong ID movie,
an ID that doesn't exist, okay?

3
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.021
I'm seeing this which is not really good,
and

4
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:19.431
probably I'm having a console
error at some point, okay?

5
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.124
It Go to read the properties
of that movie.

6
00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:28.627
So to solve the problem, we need a way to
show a nice error message to the user.

7
00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:33.892
So to do that, in case you
are following along with the material,

8
00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.306
we are an e5 error messages.

9
00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:41.791
So we need to go to index HTML
actually somewhere here, for example,

10
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.615
after the main, we are going to
create a dialogue element and

11
00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:49.753
call it other model, other dialogue.

12
00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:54.647
I'm not sure if you have
ever used dialogue before.

13
00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:58.546
So this is not a web component
that has no dash, no hyphen, so

14
00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.228
it's actually from the browser, okay?

15
00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:06.771
And inside here, for example,
I will just say error and a message,

16
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:12.231
like there was an error,
something loading the page, like that.

17
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:17.205
And a button, let's say I'm
sure if I will use a class and

18
00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:22.402
on click, we need to do something,
we are now okay, okay?

19
00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:25.951
And okay, that's the HTML,
we can add more things later.

20
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:30.380
But now we need a way to use it,
because if I save this and refresh.

21
00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:37.542
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That dialogue
is not really appear in anywhere, okay?

22
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.297
Not even if I go to the homepage,
it's not there, even if it's in the HTML,

23
00:01:41.297 --> 00:01:42.840
exactly the template, okay?

24
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.650
It's waiting for you to use it later but
it's not rendering it in the DOM.

25
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.194
We're actually in the layout,
the visual layout is in the DOM, but

26
00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:53.958
not in the visual layout.

27
00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:58.798
So that's why we knew,
for example, in Node.js,

28
00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:05.508
we can have a method that we can call
from anywhere, it can be Show Error,

29
00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:10.583
that it may receive a message and
do something with it.

30
00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:13.706
Also, if we don't receive a message,

31
00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:19.016
we can set the default message
like there was an error, whatever.

32
00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:23.597
Also, we can add a second argument,
go to home, for

33
00:02:23.597 --> 00:02:28.180
example, if we found an error
that we can't solve,

34
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.786
we can send the user to the home,
because we want to.

35
00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.254
And what to do with this?

36
00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:38.715
Well, I'm going to get the element by ID
or query selector, it's just the same.

37
00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:42.136
So I will take that alert model,

38
00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:47.342
that's the idea I use,
I will say, show model.

39
00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:52.067
So and because I have a message,

40
00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:58.192
I will take query selector from that alert

41
00:02:58.192 --> 00:03:03.445
model add the paragraph inside it.

42
00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:09.146
So remember that in the HTML we
have a paragraph inside this one,

43
00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:13.697
so I'm going to change
the text of that paragraph.

44
00:03:13.697 --> 00:03:19.230
So I will just say text
content equals to the message

45
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.997
that we receive here as an argument, okay?

46
00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:25.142
Makes sense?

47
00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:28.601
And then if you wanna go to home,

48
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:34.634
we know how to go to home,
up router, go forward slash.

49
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:38.751
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay?

50
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:43.359
And we have Show Error,
we should have a hide or

51
00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.502
a close, that will just close the model.

52
00:03:47.502 --> 00:03:53.013
So instead of show Model,
we also have a closeModel,

53
00:03:53.013 --> 00:03:56.693
that we can call from the OK button.

54
00:03:58.945 --> 00:03:59.988
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay?

55
00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:03.320
This is a browser API as well.

56
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.642
So you can see no libraries,
no dependencies,

57
00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:14.540
so now I can go to my index, HTML, and

58
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.718
I can fill this with app,
close error, okay?

59
00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:23.739
Pretty simple, it's not really a big deal.

60
00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:29.899
So that means that now if we
are going to movie details page,

61
00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:35.583
we are trying to get a movie and
we have an error, okay?

62
00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:41.203
So if the movie does not exist or if we
have an error, here we have an alert.

63
00:04:41.203 --> 00:04:44.274
Actually, we're not Seen that error,
we should see why.

64
00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:48.005
But actually here we can try
to show the error message, and

65
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:51.601
also we can see the error
message because it's global.

66
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:55.781
We can actually see it from the console,
so app, and

67
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:02.157
we can remember app has the router,
I need to refresh app, okay, there we are.

68
00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:07.528
App dot and
you can see that we have now, loops,

69
00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:11.973
right there, Show Error as an option.

70
00:05:11.973 --> 00:05:18.100
So app Show Error with no arguments,
looks like this.

71
00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:24.429
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, nice,
this one is not working, it's not closing,

72
00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:25.547
so we'll see why.

73
00:05:25.547 --> 00:05:30.713
We have a bug there, when I'm trying to
close, close model is not a function,

74
00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:35.510
okay, we'll see why, because it's close,
not close model, my bad.

75
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.374
So App.js is just close.

76
00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:45.383
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Like that, okay?

77
00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:50.167
Let's try again, so if I force an error,

78
00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:54.953
I see that nice message
I could change also

79
00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:59.903
the message, blah, blah, blah, okay?

80
00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:03.639
So it actually works, so
now anywhere in my app,

81
00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.843
when I wanna show an error message,
I have that model.

82
00:06:07.843 --> 00:06:12.374
Of course, you can create different
models with different colors, with CSS,

83
00:06:12.374 --> 00:06:17.054
showing you different stuff, there is no
need to install a library or something.

84
00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:22.110
And everything is model, which means if
you try to click something like here,

85
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.103
it's not clickable, so it's not working,
it's actually a model window.

86
00:06:27.103 --> 00:06:30.307
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are you defining
the model window somewhere explicitly?

87
00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.348
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: No,
this is part of the browser, so

88
00:06:32.348 --> 00:06:35.419
it's part of the HTML spec,
the model and HTML spec.

89
00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.728
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because, yeah,
you had a close model method,

90
00:06:38.728 --> 00:06:41.257
I think you were calling-
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: This one,

91
00:06:41.257 --> 00:06:42.181
you say, or?

92
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:44.709
No, I had a close model,
but it was my bad,

93
00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:47.978
actually, it's called close,
not close model.

94
00:06:47.978 --> 00:06:50.113
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then you have show model, okay, yeah,

95
00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:51.514
does that then turn in that?

96
00:06:51.514 --> 00:06:54.406
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Exactly,
that's, that's, that's,

97
00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:58.997
the trick is to get the element from
the DOM and then call show model.

98
00:06:58.997 --> 00:07:03.962
And that show model is actually part
of the API from the browser that will

99
00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:07.783
pop up the model, and
then the design is actually CSS.

100
00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:11.472
So if you go to style CSS and
you search for alert.

101
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.283
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: For
model, here you have the CSS to

102
00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:22.221
make the background color
like this with a border.

103
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:27.644
And you can set the backdrop It is
a pseudo element, it's double column.

104
00:07:27.644 --> 00:07:33.168
That's a pseudo element where I'm sending

105
00:07:33.168 --> 00:07:40.792
the blur effect that you see
there over the backdrop, okay?

106
00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:41.500
That's all.

107
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.803
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
does escape work too to close the model?

108
00:07:43.803 --> 00:07:46.181
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Nope, so
let's see, so the question is,

109
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:48.703
if I use my keyboard and
press escape, okay?

110
00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:50.897
Well, first I need to focus there.

111
00:07:50.897 --> 00:07:52.551
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But we could.

112
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:56.353
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Again, if I have
the focus on there and not on the console,

113
00:07:56.353 --> 00:07:58.536
if I press escape, it goes back.

114
00:07:58.536 --> 00:08:02.689
Yeah, by default, models,
to be honest that depends on the browser,

115
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:07.074
but I think that most of browser at this
point they are using the escape key.

116
00:08:07.074 --> 00:08:11.360
And if not, you can read the key
key press and do it yourself.

117
00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.269
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, cool?

118
00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:17.584
Any other question?

119
00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.422
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The styling,
the blur and all of that,

120
00:08:19.422 --> 00:08:20.996
that comes from the CSS, right?

121
00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:23.787
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's CSS,
that's pure CSS.

122
00:08:23.787 --> 00:08:28.438
So actually it's a filter,
you can see it here, backdrop filter or

123
00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:31.303
you can play with this and
do it less more.

124
00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:35.094
You can play with those
bio change the background,

125
00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:38.986
make it more red forever,
and see how it looks like.

126
00:08:40.078 --> 00:08:42.883
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
the greater the value,

127
00:08:42.883 --> 00:08:48.631
the greater the lure effect
that you will see, okay?

128
00:08:48.631 --> 00:08:53.729
So you can play with that until
you're happy with the results,

129
00:08:53.729 --> 00:08:57.973
that's just two lines of CSS,
that's all, okay?

130
00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:00.655
When a framework, yeah,
you have style dependency,

131
00:09:00.655 --> 00:09:04.098
that dependency has the dependency
on other trade dependencies, and

132
00:09:04.098 --> 00:09:07.095
then fame machines that now you ship and
blah, blah, blah.

133
00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:10.576
Well, you can make it, yeah,
if you want to customize it a lot,

134
00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:13.365
you will need a lot of CSS,
but yeah, you can do it.
