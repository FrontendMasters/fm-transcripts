WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:05.016
Now every time we are changing URLs,
we know it's working,

2
00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:08.072
but the change happens immediately.

3
00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:15.219
And maybe we can do a nice transition,
a nice animation between pages.

4
00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.440
And initially you are thinking,
this is probably too complicated.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.349
I know we need to get
into CSS animations or

6
00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.821
no fade in with a set timeout and
well, actually no today,

7
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:35.318
there are a better way to do that is
known as the view transitions API.

8
00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:40.520
It's actually pretty simple, at least for
the basic usage, so let's try to use it.

9
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.194
I will go to my router, so
I will do a change in the router, okay.

10
00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:49.944
So in the router, when we are here,

11
00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:56.321
defining the page element,
I'm going to do something new.

12
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.302
I'm talking about here, okay.

13
00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:06.278
So these two lines are actually
inserting the new page, okay, in the UI.

14
00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:08.118
So those two lines are doing that.

15
00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:12.133
So I'm going to do this,

16
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:19.606
I'm gonna save the old page,
so the old page.

17
00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:25.525
Page is query selector, Main,

18
00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:31.518
first element child, Because remember,

19
00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:36.655
the main has an element inside
that's the current page.

20
00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:43.446
If I do have an old page, why is the
possibility of not having an outpatient?

21
00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:50.362
Because when you load the page, there is
nothing in the main, okay, so it's empty.

22
00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:55.530
So if I do have one,
I'm going to talk to that old page, and

23
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.348
I'm going to set a CSS style that
is called view transition name.

24
00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:06.701
I'm going to set any name for
example, old, okay,

25
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:13.647
and for the new one, I will say style,
view transition name, new.

26
00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:17.493
Then we have the old,
we have the new, okay.

27
00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:19.813
So how does this work?

28
00:02:19.813 --> 00:02:27.132
So to make the change, we need to make
the change in one particular function.

29
00:02:27.132 --> 00:02:34.720
So we need to call one function that is,
document, start, view, transition, okay.

30
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.536
And then I need to pass an argument,

31
00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:46.452
a function one, and
I should put this code inside.

32
00:02:46.452 --> 00:02:51.793
Okay, I'm going to refactor this
a couple of times, so this goes here.

33
00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:56.205
So this is what's going on,
when we call a start view transition

34
00:02:56.205 --> 00:03:01.288
the browser is kind of taking a screenshot
of the current user interface.

35
00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:05.305
Then you make a change and
with that change,

36
00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:11.612
it's also taking a screenshot and
it's animating the transition.

37
00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:14.549
Something like that,
okay, does it make sense?

38
00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.605
I'm not done yet, but if I'm trying this,
refreshing I go to movies.

39
00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:25.912
I'm not sure if you see there
is a slight difference mostly,

40
00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:27.696
when you are doing this.

41
00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:32.639
Can you see there is a fade now,
and it's subtle,

42
00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.702
but you could see some small
changes in the mostly,

43
00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:41.019
if it's already loaded, okay.

44
00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.944
You can see that here
there is an animation.

45
00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:49.889
And of course you can, using CSS,
you can customize that.

46
00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.598
Even you can make things going out and
the other one going in so

47
00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:57.038
you can make a slight transition and
many other things.

48
00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:59.745
To finish this code,
we may have a problem,

49
00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:03.929
is that build transitions might
not be available on every browser.

50
00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:07.835
They are in Safari, they are in chrome,
the latest versions.

51
00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:10.160
They are on the latest
of versions of Firefox.

52
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.437
But there still, if we go to, can I use,

53
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.126
There are still a couple of browsers
where, it's still not there.

54
00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:24.628
So we are at 84 I mean, it's good, but

55
00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:29.572
the problem is that if the browser
is not supporting build

56
00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:34.321
transitions, it will never
execute these two lines.

57
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:40.425
So we should check if we have.

58
00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:45.179
So if we don't have document start
view transition, so if it exists or

59
00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:49.451
if it doesn't exist,
it doesn't matter, we do something and

60
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:51.559
if not, we do something else.

61
00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.611
So in this case, we do a transition, and

62
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:59.793
in this case, we don't do a transition.

63
00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:04.681
So actually what I'm going to do is
these two lines will actually go to

64
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:07.055
a local function, update page.

65
00:05:09.238 --> 00:05:12.648
I'm going to call,
if there is no transition,

66
00:05:12.648 --> 00:05:15.393
I will call update page immediately.

67
00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:19.635
And if we do have transitions inside,
start the transition.

68
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.774
Okay, does it make sense?

69
00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:33.438
And that's how you can quickly create
a transition between two pages.

70
00:05:33.438 --> 00:05:34.790
So where does that come from?

71
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.082
That's looks like that's using CSS, but
it's that's, it's in the browser API.

72
00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:44.297
It's a browser API that belongs,
it's a CSS spec page transition, but

73
00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:48.184
it also involves a JavaScript API,
so it's both it's come from.

74
00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:55.387
It's not a library, it's a browser spec,
so here, can I use?

75
00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:58.145
You can go here and
you can see the spec, okay.

76
00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:02.835
But have a link on the spec,
but not on this one.

77
00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:05.400
And here you can see that
five four has some issues.

78
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.275
You need to enable the flag, but

79
00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:10.959
I mean, it's still good enough
to use it if it's available and

80
00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:15.776
if it's not available, there are still
a lot of users that will not execute that.

81
00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.614
So that's why we need a fallback, okay.

82
00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:24.044
And will create animated transitions
between different DOM states.

83
00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:28.206
Everything you change there, and
you can make it even more complicated.

84
00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:31.967
And also, we have now a cross document
view transition where you can do

85
00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.602
a transition between two
different page loads.

86
00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:38.677
So server side, render page loads, okay.

87
00:06:38.677 --> 00:06:42.207
So this one is for single page
applications, and this one is for

88
00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:43.681
multipage application.

89
00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:48.104
And I'm assuming you can make a different
transition if you wanted to do

90
00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:50.401
something unique you could do that.

91
00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:55.736
Yeah, I mean, if you look for
the view transitions API,

92
00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:58.637
there is a web dot dev article.

93
00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:04.502
With some examples of what you can do,
things like that, that's pretty cool.

94
00:07:04.502 --> 00:07:07.372
In that case,
you need to define some properties, like,

95
00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:11.415
I wanna animate that particular image, and
I want that particular image to become

96
00:07:11.415 --> 00:07:14.659
that other image, and
then you will make the transition for you.

97
00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.962
So there are lots of things that you can
do, okay, here I have more examples.

98
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.750
And for
you don't need JavaScript for that.

99
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.916
You just need to find some
properties in CSS, okay, and voila.

100
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:34.517
This is for several documents,
so it's doing that animation,

101
00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:38.677
even loading different
HTMLs from the server.

102
00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:47.260
So it's this is bringing kind of
native app transitions for web apps.
