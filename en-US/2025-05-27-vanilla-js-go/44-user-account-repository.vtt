00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.929
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Something
similar happened with authenticator,

2
00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:04.384
it's kind of the logging.

3
00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:09.043
Okay, with first check if you
are passing me an email and password,

4
00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:11.841
then I'm trying to find users by email.

5
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:19.052
Be very careful here to use SQL
variables or arguments, not concatenate.

6
00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:22.362
And well, if there are no rows,
so over that select,

7
00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:24.655
it means the user has not been found.

8
00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:29.695
So authentication, validation,
there is a problem,

9
00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:34.320
and then that means the user
does not exist, okay?

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.655
That means the user does not
exist with that email, and

11
00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.641
then we check the password,
so the user exists.

12
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.404
Now let's see if the password
is the same one.

13
00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:48.341
So we hash the password again and
we compare that with the password

14
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:52.398
that we have stored in the database,
the hashed one.

15
00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:53.533
Does it make sense?

16
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:58.615
And just in case we are updating last
login, so we registering the database for

17
00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:02.700
login purposes the last login for
that user, and that's all.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.515
That's login,
something that typically arrives here,

19
00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:11.937
and it's a good idea,
is don't create two errors for

20
00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:16.173
user doesn't exist and
password doesn't match.

21
00:01:16.173 --> 00:01:21.106
It doesn't matter which one is the thing,
it's just credentials are wrong.

22
00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:26.425
This is for privacy reasons.

23
00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:29.537
That's why, when you you go to a website,
it's pretty common, and

24
00:01:29.537 --> 00:01:32.505
you say, I had an account,
I don't remember the password.

25
00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:36.116
So you go, I forgot my password,
it's asking for your email.

26
00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:39.343
You type your email and it says,
if you have an account,

27
00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:41.343
we have already sent you an email.

28
00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:45.788
And you don't know, why don't you tell
me if you send me the email or not?

29
00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:50.948
Because they don't wanna expose
their database to the public.

30
00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:54.196
Because if not,
you can try different email addresses and

31
00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.122
see if they have an account or not.

32
00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:57.308
Does that make sense?

33
00:01:57.308 --> 00:02:01.576
So that's why, in this case,
if the email is not in the database,

34
00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:06.552
you are not going to say your email is
wrong or you don't have an account here.

35
00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:08.402
You're just saying your
credentials are wrong.

36
00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:10.936
It can be the password,
it can be the email, I don't know.

37
00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:13.664
The combination doesn't
work together here.

38
00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:15.812
Does it make sense?

39
00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:20.756
Then GetAccountDetails will
just get an account by email

40
00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:25.086
to actually bring the fabrics and
the watch list.

41
00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:30.214
So it's making a select of
movies with a join on this

42
00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:35.958
intermediate thing, and
it's looking for watch list.

43
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:41.474
So it's just a query on the database
getting a, in this case,

44
00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:48.596
the movies that are powered from that user
or are in the watch list for that user.

45
00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:50.285
Okay?

46
00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:51.493
Does that make sense?

47
00:02:51.493 --> 00:02:54.643
And it's just setting the watch list for
that user.

48
00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:56.060
Nothing really important.

49
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.645
And well, SaveCollection is to
actually save one movie as actually,

50
00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:02.596
we can go save to collection.

51
00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:05.878
Maybe that's better,
say movie to collection.

52
00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:11.809
It will save a movie into watch list or
into favorites.

53
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:17.930
It's just actually verifying first, well,
it's, I have the email, we'll see why.

54
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.261
We get the ID of that user, and then we
check if we already have that movie there.

55
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:27.775
Because maybe the user is
adding a watch list or

56
00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:32.093
a movie that is already in watch list, so
I don't want to add the movie twice, so

57
00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:34.757
I'm checking if that
relation already exists.

58
00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:38.220
You can see I'm using variables for
everything.

59
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.123
So then passing all the values from here,
if exists,

60
00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm actually not retaining an error.

61
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.181
I'm actually saying true.

62
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.519
I mean it works, yeah, it's there.

63
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.161
I wanna mark a favorite, yeah, it's there.

64
00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:53.694
So yes.

65
00:03:53.694 --> 00:03:59.190
And if it's not there, I will insert
this into this table and that's all.

66
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.756
And that's our repository.

67
00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:06.405
Okay, it's a long code, and
it's not complicated, but it takes time.

68
00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:08.861
Okay, it's always the same actually,
pretty similar.

69
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.024
You have any question,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a security

70
00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:17.291
recommendation that it's better to
return messages like username and

71
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.935
password combination is invalid.

72
00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:22.707
Rather than saying user
not found just from.

73
00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:23.628
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, exactly.

74
00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:28.305
That's what I was saying, that credentials
are wrong, it means something's wrong.

75
00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:31.916
To be honest, there are still workarounds,

76
00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:36.002
because I got trying to
register a new account, and

77
00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:40.102
if I already have an account,
you will recheck me.

78
00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:44.495
So, through registration,
I can also kind of check in that.

79
00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:48.388
And also with passkeys,
that's a new standard,

80
00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:52.847
with passkeys, also we have
a way to log in just by email.

81
00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:56.213
And also there are some workarounds.

82
00:04:56.213 --> 00:05:01.266
I mean, if you're a bad actor and
you want to get that information,

83
00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.899
you wanna see if a friend
of yours has an account,

84
00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.883
I mean, you wanna see if your
partner has a Tinder account, okay?

85
00:05:09.883 --> 00:05:13.795
Let's be direct here,
that's one possibility.

86
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:18.057
How do you know if your
partner has a Tinder account?

87
00:05:18.057 --> 00:05:19.545
Or I mean, if she or

88
00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:25.417
he has still has a Tinder account because
maybe you met him or her on Tinder.

89
00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:30.401
Well, that's why, for privacy reasons,
we are trying to hide that,

90
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:34.970
that it's not easy for someone that
has no credentials to get into

91
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.482
a system to know if an email address
has an account or not, okay?

92
00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:44.384
It's not, I mean,
there is no way to be 100% safe on that.

93
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:49.022
We always work around, so
most of the time, we also, I mean,

94
00:05:49.022 --> 00:05:55.480
on really large projects, you are checking
how many login attempts they are trying.

95
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.755
After three or four emails you are trying
you're blocked, things like that,

96
00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:02.888
because you're saying you're
doing something wrong.

97
00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:07.544
Who is trying different
emails in five minutes?

98
00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:12.143
You are trying to get more information
that you want, and of course,

99
00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:16.684
that has a lot of code behind testing
that you need to do a lot of work.
