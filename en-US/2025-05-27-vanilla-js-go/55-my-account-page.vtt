WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.512
So now, after log in or registration,

2
00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:07.171
we know that the user is going to
an account section that doesn't exist.

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.682
So let's do that account section.

4
00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:12.882
So we will create, of course,
we know how to do that, a component.

5
00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.893
So this is actually
pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:17.963
For example,
I can just copy the registration part.

7
00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:25.008
I will create the account page I copy
this because, yes, a basic template.

8
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.912
So let's create a template for
the account and

9
00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:35.215
we will do we will call this the account
page,and this is the account page,

10
00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:39.733
okay, so then we need
the template where in the HTML.

11
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.679
So we go to the HTML and
we create another template.

12
00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.463
This is going to be pretty simple.

13
00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:49.467
We can say that we have
a section ID account, and so

14
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:55.541
far, we're going to just add
an HQ saying you are logged in,

15
00:00:55.541 --> 00:01:00.692
okay, just to confirm
frames the user is logging.

16
00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:05.553
And some actions that are only
available for logged in users or

17
00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:07.431
authenticated users.

18
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:12.371
So we can do that with some buttons,
such as log out, because if we can log in,

19
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.204
we should be able to log out.

20
00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:21.681
And also we will have a link to your
favorites and also to your watch list.

21
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.117
We also have links somewhere.

22
00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.802
And then when we click here,
well, we have an app.login,

23
00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:32.379
we may have an app.logout,
we can see that.

24
00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:36.431
We need to copy that, and
we need to create that and

25
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.718
then here, we can just go to the router.

26
00:01:39.718 --> 00:01:44.815
And say,
I want to go to Account favorites.

27
00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:51.948
I think that was the URL we were
working or we will do after this.

28
00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:58.504
So and
the watch list like this app lookout.

29
00:01:58.504 --> 00:01:59.821
Let think about that for a second.

30
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:05.321
App login was actually making all
the stuff, okay, go into the server.

31
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:06.661
What about logout?

32
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:15.219
From a client's perspective logout is
when you check-out your hotel, okay?

33
00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.691
So you take this and you return it or
you throw throw it away,

34
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:24.205
I need to remember to pick it up later.

35
00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:28.425
So logout will be just
to talk to our store and

36
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:33.572
just say, You know what,
I don't have JWT anymore.

37
00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:39.406
That will also delete that one from
local storage if my proxy works.

38
00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:46.319
So from now on, I throw my credentials so
I don't have them.

39
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.091
So, I'm logged out, okay?

40
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:54.776
And after that, maybe I want to
say something like, you know what?

41
00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:59.118
I want to go maybe to home or
to thanks or whatever.

42
00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:02.877
I need to send the user somewhere else.

43
00:03:02.877 --> 00:03:08.376
Okay, finally,
I need to create the route for

44
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:14.582
this account, so
path:/account/, just that,

45
00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:19.813
and the component will be the AccountPage.

46
00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:25.717
If everything works now,
I should be able to refresh here.

47
00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:32.994
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: First,
if I go to Account, it's not working.

48
00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:34.505
See why.

49
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:39.899
If I open the console,
it's saying that it can read the content,

50
00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.853
so it's probably the template ID.

51
00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:48.271
I have a problem with my template ID,
so account page is trying

52
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:53.806
to read template account, and
in my HTML, I didn't add an ID.

53
00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:54.782
That's why.

54
00:03:54.782 --> 00:04:00.734
So Id template account, okay, cool.

55
00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:02.303
Let's go back here, refresh.

56
00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:07.172
And it says you are logged in akay,
if I click Log Out, it goes to the home.

57
00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:12.179
And also, I have no unmatched jwts,
so I don't have the credentials.

58
00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:16.552
So if I log in again, for now,
I need to do it manually for

59
00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:19.170
some reason, we will get there.

60
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.014
So if I log in again,
okay, you are logged in.

61
00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:26.912
If I log out, I'm logged out.

62
00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:30.698
The problem is that if
I'm going to my account,

63
00:04:30.698 --> 00:04:36.390
it says that I'm logged in, but
that's not true because I logged out.

64
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.007
Why is that?

65
00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:40.175
Because my router just goes there.

66
00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:47.874
If I say so, okay, so we need to add
another validation rules in my router, and

67
00:04:47.874 --> 00:04:54.193
that's saying that maybe some
pages will need being logged in.
