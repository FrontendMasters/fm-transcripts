WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.572
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Well,
we are getting into the next section,

2
00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:04.206
that is gonna be the search.

3
00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:08.921
So if I do something here,
if I search for movies, okay?

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.751
I wanna search for Superman,
and I want this to go to movies

5
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:18.887
forward/superman, or
actually we can make a query, okay?

6
00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.972
In this case,
they're going to switch ideas.

7
00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:27.120
So instead of using the URL
forward slash movies,

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.342
forward slash superman, I'm going to
send an argument like this, okay,

9
00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:39.696
what is known as a query string or
a search, okay, which is better for this.

10
00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:43.582
Also I can add later more arguments there.

11
00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:47.719
So to do that,
well first we need the route, okay,

12
00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.143
I think we do have that route.

13
00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:52.120
Is this one movies?

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.643
And we have a movie page.

15
00:00:55.643 --> 00:01:00.698
Right now if I'm trying to do this first,
it's important to decide if we want or not

16
00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:05.923
the last forward slash, because not gonna
be the same with or without forward slash.

17
00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:12.322
Okay, so now is without forward slash and
see nothing, not patient phone.

18
00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:16.638
That's because my web component is empty,
okay?

19
00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:21.839
Also, I should come back to this input

20
00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:26.565
form and try to see how that works.

21
00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.221
Let's go and see that.

22
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:33.314
So if I go to the HTML,
I have here a form with a search,

23
00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:36.608
and form is calling app.search.

24
00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:40.130
So let's go to app and search.

25
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.099
Now it's preventDefault getting the value,
and it has a TODO.

26
00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.971
Now it's time to fill that TODO or
to replace it, and

27
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.353
we will just talk to the router.

28
00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:55.155
So app.router.go, and

29
00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:59.310
we will go to movies?q = q.

30
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.445
Why q?

31
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:05.282
As I mentioned before,
it's like a standard practice for

32
00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:10.216
the query to have that q value,
but if you want to use query or

33
00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:13.099
search or keywords, it's fine.

34
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.517
So that means now that if
I'm typing something here,

35
00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:22.433
Batman and pressing enter,
you can see in the URL it works.

36
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.543
So then now we know it's working.

37
00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:28.715
Anything we are searching
here is changing the URL, and

38
00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:34.774
now the next step is to actually render
something on this particular component.

39
00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:39.394
So we need the template, and
then we need to fill the JavaScript for

40
00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:40.806
the web component.

41
00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:42.440
So let's start with a template.

42
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.520
So we are now,
if you are following through the RHYTHMI,

43
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.741
we are on F1, so
we already passed all the routing stuff.

44
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.300
Here we have the template,
I will just copy and

45
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.511
paste it just HTML and
maybe the part that is maybe new.

46
00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:07.052
We can spend some time, but it's just
an HTML, nothing really so important.

47
00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:08.940
So we have a section for templates.

48
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.879
Template home, template movie details.

49
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.601
By the way, in these movie details,
I have a style open here.

50
00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:18.376
I'm not using it, so just nothing happens.

51
00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:23.598
But I will just add this template
then after the last template.

52
00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:27.823
So in this case,
it's pretty much similar to other HTML.

53
00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:32.208
The only new part that we
have is that we have selects.

54
00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:39.532
So this will be for filtering and also to
change the order of the search results.

55
00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:45.117
Okay, so we have some selects the one
with genre is empty because we

56
00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:52.097
need to actually fit it by JavaScript, and
the other one is already pre populated,

57
00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:56.808
so it's a static list of
possible options for sorting.

58
00:03:56.808 --> 00:04:02.600
And also for the movies result we have
the animated loading, remember that one?

59
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.556
So we can see if that works,
just by trying to show us it.

60
00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:17.374
So after we have that, the next step is
to go on work with movie page JavaScript.

61
00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:21.667
This is the one that is rendering movie.

62
00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:26.991
Actually, we should probably
rename it to movies,

63
00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:30.141
maybe that's better, yeah?

64
00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:34.473
Because we have a collection of movie
result, maybe it's better name,

65
00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:35.263
that movie.

66
00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:38.084
So if I change it from here,

67
00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:43.132
I should also update my routes,
so movies page.

68
00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:46.438
And also I should update the import.

69
00:04:46.438 --> 00:04:50.092
So now I should remove this one, so

70
00:04:50.092 --> 00:04:55.636
everything is now there with
the right name I think,

71
00:04:55.636 --> 00:05:01.695
so if I refresh,
can I refresh without going to the home?

72
00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:05.838
Yeah, because we have already
solved the problem from the server.

73
00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.963
So is it still working.

74
00:05:07.963 --> 00:05:09.991
So, now I need to do something here.

75
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:14.133
So we need to get the template,
so we know the deal.

76
00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:22.684
So let's also do the copy part
here because we have already done.

77
00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:28.244
At least the first part, we have
already done something very similar,

78
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.848
so it's probably faster for us.

79
00:05:30.848 --> 00:05:36.159
We just take this, the movie space, and

80
00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:42.889
we copy that and
then we will finish the part later.

81
00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.266
So now I need to go to movies page
that is still called Movie Page here.

82
00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:50.480
So let me rename the file as well.

83
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.204
There we are.

84
00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:53.405
Now I paste it.

85
00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:56.310
So let's analyze the code, okay.

86
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.134
So first, the new part is that now
we will work with the URL bar.

87
00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:09.733
We will read from the URL bar arguments,
for example, q.

88
00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:14.996
Here we're going to show
not just the query,

89
00:06:14.996 --> 00:06:18.330
but also a possible filter.

90
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.142
So then we can actually filter by genre.

91
00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:26.312
So we can have genre, and
also we can define the order, and

92
00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:31.422
maybe later, maybe for homework,
you can then make different pages,

93
00:06:31.422 --> 00:06:34.334
so you can add fagination to the system.

94
00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:41.284
So then you can add a lot of arguments
in this search query string, okay.

95
00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:42.825
So we need to read that, and

96
00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:47.589
to read that that string is available in
window location search or location search,

97
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.498
you can add window or not here,
it's the same, that's the string.

98
00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:55.502
But now we need to parse the strings
to extract each argument,

99
00:06:55.502 --> 00:07:00.129
and we do that with URL search params,
that's actually a browser API.

100
00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.125
So that will give you all the params.

101
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:09.353
And then we can get here, for
example, the order, the genre,

102
00:07:09.353 --> 00:07:13.793
and also the query, okay,
that actually the query is

103
00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:18.740
receiving by by here,
that is actually being sent by here.

104
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.670
So in this case, we are reading the
template, we are cloning that template.

105
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.574
We are injecting the template.

106
00:07:23.574 --> 00:07:26.976
We know how to do that, and
then we are getting the query.

107
00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:33.402
If we do have a query, we're actually
setting the query movies like that,

108
00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:37.387
movies as a title, and
then we are rendering.

109
00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:40.924
If there is no query,
I'm just showing an error.

110
00:07:43.194 --> 00:07:44.703
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Why
is there no query?

111
00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:49.378
Well, maybe q is empty, like this, so

112
00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:52.512
I won't make any search.

113
00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:53.829
Okay, so I will show an error.

114
00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:58.865
That's kind of idea, and
render is just my method is calling

115
00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:03.309
the API that we already have
server side that is making

116
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:08.347
the queries with AI like it's
looping through the movies and

117
00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:12.139
it's injecting new movie item components.

118
00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:14.050
Nothing really fancy.

119
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.775
And if there are no movies so
movies length equals to zero.

120
00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:22.729
It's just saying there are no movies
with your search, that's not an error.

121
00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:28.043
I mean, you are searching for
a movie that doesn't exist.

122
00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:29.011
Okay, make sense?

123
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:31.446
Nothing completely complicated.

124
00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:37.391
So now, if I then search for
Superman movies, nothing happens,

125
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:41.619
because it seems like we
have a bug somewhere.

126
00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:46.636
So it says that Movies Page
is not exported.

127
00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:53.743
So let's see, when I rename things,
I might be doing some weird stuff.

128
00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:57.321
No, maybe I need to refresh, okay, no.

129
00:08:57.321 --> 00:09:03.859
Okay, MoviesPage doesn't provide
an export name, movies page.

130
00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.294
But actually, we do have it, right.

131
00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:10.702
Movies page, movies page.

132
00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:13.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The default export.

133
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.330
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, maybe
because what's the difference when you

134
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:25.328
have default you don't need then to use
calibrates when you are importing it.

135
00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:28.551
Okay, so that's the difference, and

136
00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:33.344
in the routes, route say,
yes, we had those calibrate.

137
00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:37.630
So if I leave the default,
then I need to remove this.

138
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:42.715
So both will work, okay, but
just to stay consistent with the others.

139
00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:46.660
This has got to do with
Ecmascript modules.

140
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.210
So refreshing, there we are.

141
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:55.159
We are back searching for Superman and
we see this, which is something, okay?

142
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.449
It's not yet the list, but

143
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:59.886
we actually see the animation that
actually looks pretty good, right?

144
00:10:01.704 --> 00:10:06.150
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's
the animation that we have created before.

145
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.344
We have this filter by genre and now sort
by popularity and we can change this.

146
00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:11.748
That's the idea it's not working yet.

147
00:10:11.748 --> 00:10:13.324
We need to finish that part.

148
00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:17.356
And also we should see
why it's not loading.

149
00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:20.180
So here it says API is not defined.

150
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.000
So that happens when you copy and paste.

151
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.543
So movie space has a call to API,

152
00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:31.422
but it has no import for it.

153
00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:37.478
So control space enter will
add the import without js.

154
00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:44.070
Okay, and I think checking if there is
any other import that I need quickly.

155
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.042
I don't think so.

156
00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:48.792
So if I refresh now,
it says search, I have search,

157
00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:51.596
search movies for some reason.

158
00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.646
Yeah, here.

159
00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:58.039
That's wrong, it's only one search.

160
00:10:58.039 --> 00:11:01.550
It says there are no movies with your
search which, these we are okay,

161
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.692
there should be some.

162
00:11:02.692 --> 00:11:05.721
So now how to debug this?

163
00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:10.016
First, I may look into the network tab and

164
00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:15.293
maybe I wanna look at fetchXHR and
if you look here,

165
00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:19.119
I'm seeing something weird there.

166
00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:22.118
It's searching with
the function to a string.

167
00:11:22.118 --> 00:11:27.530
So something is wrong somewhere
when I'm doing the API part, okay.

168
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.728
So I'm sending to search movies,
queue, order, and genre.

169
00:11:32.728 --> 00:11:37.488
And here I'm sending arguments, okay.

170
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.863
So it seems like the problem is here.

171
00:11:39.863 --> 00:11:40.894
Can you spot the problem?

172
00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:44.706
We have a bug that is coming from
a few hours ago, many hours ago.

173
00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:45.764
Problem is here.

174
00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:49.838
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Choosetring
is a function.

175
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.684
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
that's a bug that we have,

176
00:11:54.684 --> 00:11:58.400
this is the first time that we
are actually calling that function.

177
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.590
So choose string is a function.

178
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.080
So if you are passing
the function as an argument,

179
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.528
it's trying to pass
the function to the server.

180
00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:06.488
So it doesn't make any sense.

181
00:12:06.488 --> 00:12:11.646
So we need to call this by the way,
this code is taking this and

182
00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:14.898
converting this into a query string.

183
00:12:14.898 --> 00:12:18.540
Okay, so let's try again.

184
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.091
Refresh, I can see that now to a server,

185
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:26.282
it's sending the right query, q=superman.

186
00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:28.964
And if I look here,

187
00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:34.162
I'm still not seeing movies because

188
00:12:34.162 --> 00:12:40.544
searchtemComponent is not defined, okay?

189
00:12:40.544 --> 00:12:44.866
Movies page, it's here.

190
00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:46.867
Why is that like this?

191
00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:49.869
I don't know, but in this case,

192
00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:54.381
we are going to create
a new movie item component.

193
00:12:54.381 --> 00:13:01.029
I'm not sure when that changed, but that's
our component, is movie item component.

194
00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:04.209
Okay, so refresh.

195
00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:09.182
Well now, movie item component is
another one that I need to import.

196
00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:13.171
Maybe you're thinking, well, but
we have already imported that one.

197
00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:16.743
So it should be already defined, okay?

198
00:13:16.743 --> 00:13:17.734
Does that make sense?

199
00:13:17.734 --> 00:13:19.949
So why is it already imported?

200
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:24.580
Because if you go to the homepage,
remember,

201
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.392
we are talking about that component.

202
00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:30.351
So the component was already loaded.

203
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:34.846
But then when I'm going to search,
the component is not there,

204
00:13:34.846 --> 00:13:40.351
it's complaining that it's not there,
but you're loading the component.
