00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.585
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, so
I have the same issue, I think,

2
00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:06.681
with all my pages.

3
00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:11.458
So all my pages in routes
are missing the.js that

4
00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:15.893
was because I didn't add
it on the first one.

5
00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:19.305
So then you need to go add all of them.

6
00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:25.257
Okay, so now we are back and
I can try to go to someplace and

7
00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:29.845
see now if I doing something someplace,
and

8
00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:35.797
the first thing you see is
that it's going to someplace.

9
00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:41.501
So something is there, okay?

10
00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:46.841
We are still missing some parts,
so actually what happened?

11
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:52.828
Actually, it went in here, and
actually, page limit was null.

12
00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:56.449
It should try to go
through all the routers.

13
00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.154
And actually, I guess page
limit should be null, I guess.

14
00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:05.029
Yeah, I'm missing one part.

15
00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:08.902
Yeah, I'm missing one part actually
because I wasn't watching.

16
00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.818
What's the problem that I have right now?

17
00:01:10.818 --> 00:01:14.976
I'm only injecting the current page or

18
00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:19.013
the page element, if I do have a page.

19
00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:24.463
If it's 404, I'm sending the page element,

20
00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:29.798
but actually I should also
add that into the DOM.

21
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.261
Does it make sense?

22
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.805
So if I don't have a page,
I will create one.

23
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.369
I need to check that one anyway.

24
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.530
So I will append the page element
even into 404 because I have just

25
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.972
created a page element for
that particular situation.

26
00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:51.395
So now, first, if I refresh I have
a problem, that 404 is from the server.

27
00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.064
Okay, be careful with that.

28
00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:58.046
So I need to go to the route and
then try to execute

29
00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:02.913
this again and
now I'm seeing Page not found.

30
00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:10.384
Okay, so now from the router,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Also,

31
00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:14.063
I'm getting an error there,
but I can go to some place.

32
00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:16.330
I can go to the route.

33
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.633
If I go to the route,
it's actually working.

34
00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.987
Can you see that?

35
00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:26.388
So if I'm going to the route,
it's actually working.

36
00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:31.557
What if I go to one particular movie,
will it work?

37
00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:33.894
I don't know.

38
00:02:33.894 --> 00:02:39.142
Well, it worked and I use the same id but

39
00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:42.331
what if I change the id?

40
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.200
It's always Men in Black 3, why is that?

41
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.138
Do you remember why?

42
00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:57.880
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Our
MovieDetailsPage has that 14 hard coded,

43
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.119
where should I get the id from?

44
00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.701
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Params.

45
00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:07.554
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Params,
that's the property that I injected.

46
00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:11.872
So I should have a params and
it's an array,

47
00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:16.087
actually, so it should get it from there.

48
00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:20.662
Let's see if that works,
so I need to refresh.

49
00:03:20.662 --> 00:03:25.411
On the home, this is going to
be a problem that we will solve.

50
00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:32.032
So I'm in the home and now, if I'm
going to movie 24 it's Jurassic World.

51
00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:37.605
Let's put this to the side like that.

52
00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:43.010
So if I'm going to 240, it's an address.

53
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.828
These errors are coming from YouTube.

54
00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:50.578
Base.js is the YouTube embed,
so forget about them.

55
00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:56.391
And if I'm going to the home,
it's going to the home.

56
00:03:56.391 --> 00:04:02.386
And if I'm going to any other
place is giving a Page not found.

57
00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:08.369
So we are closer than before.

58
00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:13.785
And by the way,
what happens if I use the back button?

59
00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:20.022
So if I go back from Page not found,
okay, it goes back to the home.

60
00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:20.803
Let's go back here.

61
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:24.682
It's changing the URL, but
it's not updating the UI, why?

62
00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:27.479
I'm missing just one one piece.

63
00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.439
That piece is that my router has an init

64
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.099
function that no one is executing.

65
00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.719
So I need to execute this init, where?

66
00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.522
For example, when the page loads,
that's a good place, DomContentLoaded.

67
00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:50.862
So I can just say app.Router.init,
so we initialize this.

68
00:04:50.862 --> 00:04:56.101
And also I don't need to inject
the homepage or the movie details anymore.

69
00:04:56.101 --> 00:05:00.535
The router will do that,
the router will check

70
00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:05.321
the current URL and
will render the initial page.

71
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:08.195
Okay, does it make sense?

72
00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:14.419
So now, if I'm going to the home again,
refresh, I'm seeing the home page.

73
00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.280
So that works,
if I'm going to 404, it works.

74
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.834
If I'm going to one particular movie,
it also works.

75
00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:27.273
And now if I go back,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's working.

76
00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:34.683
So it's going through the URLs and
updating the UI.

77
00:05:34.683 --> 00:05:40.566
So that's voila, we have a router
that is accepting different

78
00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:45.904
routes dynamically,
that's the clients are routing.

79
00:05:45.904 --> 00:05:50.384
Not really complicated,
just sending data, receiving data.

80
00:05:50.384 --> 00:05:53.149
There is one more thing to solve, links,

81
00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:58.140
because right now I want to click here and
I want to go, okay to the details.

82
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.554
That's not working right now, we can solve
it, and also links here at the top, okay?

83
00:06:03.554 --> 00:06:06.898
Even if we don't have all the options yet,
I want to click Movies and

84
00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:08.788
I want to go to the home, for example.

85
00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:12.316
Right now it's working, but
what's happening is that, I mean,

86
00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:15.218
if you look at what happened in here,
it's flashing.

87
00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:18.081
That means that it's refreshing the page.

88
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.494
So right now, these links
are refreshing the page, okay, why?

89
00:06:21.494 --> 00:06:26.516
Well, if you look at our index html,

90
00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:29.440
they are just links.

91
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.647
So they're just refreshing the page.

92
00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:36.278
But something that I can do and
that's a missing step,

93
00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:41.524
mostly if you are pasting
the router from the documentation.

94
00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:46.654
In the router I need,
I also have other part that

95
00:06:46.654 --> 00:06:51.542
will enhance current
links in the document.

96
00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:56.941
So this is the deal,
I'm going to get from the document.

97
00:06:56.941 --> 00:07:01.556
Let's use querySelectorAll,
I will take all

98
00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:06.643
the links with a.navlink class,
all of them, and

99
00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:12.578
for each of those links,
I'm going to execute something.

100
00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:17.225
I'm going to add a.EventListener for
the click event, so when you click on

101
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:22.205
those links, I want to do something
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: First,

102
00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:25.532
I want to preventDefault.

103
00:07:25.532 --> 00:07:28.774
So if I do that,
I'm going through all the links,

104
00:07:28.774 --> 00:07:31.335
at least all the links with that class.

105
00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:34.989
In case I have other links that
are going to external sources, and

106
00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:36.590
I'm preventing defaults.

107
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.628
So which means, if I click here,
nothing happens.

108
00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:45.259
So now it's not refreshing
the page because I'm preventing

109
00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.358
the default action for
links that is going to the URL.

110
00:07:49.358 --> 00:07:53.872
Because I'm preventing it,
I'm going to replace that with

111
00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:58.129
getting the href of the current
link with getAttribute.

112
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:04.943
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: By the way, there
are two ways to get the href, a.href,

113
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:09.689
a is actually the current link
that I'm looping and get article.

114
00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.416
Does anyone know the difference?

115
00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:16.495
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If it doesn't exist, it
doesn't return anything, or becomes nil.

116
00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:20.618
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: In this case, both
will give me the same value get attribute

117
00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:24.417
is actually getting the attribute
that is in the HTML.

118
00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:29.081
And this one will get the current
value in JavaScript, and you say, but

119
00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:30.577
isn't just the same?

120
00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:36.610
Well, in JavaScript, you may change
the property and not change the HTML.

121
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.468
So at this point this is kind of
the initial attribute in case someone

122
00:08:40.468 --> 00:08:42.508
is changing that with JavaScript.

123
00:08:42.508 --> 00:08:44.595
So this is the property
with society previews.

124
00:08:44.595 --> 00:08:49.417
It's something that you wanna
get deeper when you embody

125
00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:54.450
that JavaScript and
when I have the href, I wanna go there.

126
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.344
And we have a router for that, right?

127
00:08:56.344 --> 00:08:57.351
Actually, we are the router.

128
00:08:57.351 --> 00:09:01.098
So we are going to go to that link.

129
00:09:01.098 --> 00:09:04.551
So I'm replacing those links and
saying, hey, browser,

130
00:09:04.551 --> 00:09:06.426
I will take care of those links.

131
00:09:06.426 --> 00:09:08.857
Don't go, I will do that.

132
00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:13.658
So that means that now, for example,

133
00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:18.617
for now go into a movie and I click here.

134
00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:22.003
It goes to the home without
refreshing the page.

135
00:09:22.003 --> 00:09:23.164
So it enhances this.

136
00:09:23.164 --> 00:09:28.180
If I'm going to Favorites, it's Page
not found because I don't have it yet.

137
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.805
The same on Watchlist and My Account.

138
00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:34.877
So these links are actually working now,
okay?

139
00:09:34.877 --> 00:09:37.018
The only one that is not
working is clicking here, but

140
00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:39.073
that's something that I
need to change manually.

141
00:09:39.073 --> 00:09:41.979
It's not really a big deal.

142
00:09:41.979 --> 00:09:47.874
Do you remember where this HTML
is actually currently located?

143
00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:49.844
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's a movie item element.

144
00:09:49.844 --> 00:09:53.601
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's
a movie item element that is

145
00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:57.631
actually this part, is this link.

146
00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:00.731
So in this case,
there are many ways to solve the problem.

147
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:06.490
I can use onclick or href, it's up to you.

148
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.612
So if I use onclick, I can say here, for

149
00:10:09.612 --> 00:10:13.698
example, that they wanna
go to app.Router.go.

150
00:10:13.698 --> 00:10:18.049
And I wanna go to one
url that I can set here.

151
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:22.712
Let's say url, like that.

152
00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:27.588
So I can create the url variable, and

153
00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:31.834
I wanna go to "/movies/" and

154
00:10:31.834 --> 00:10:35.623
the id, this.movie.id.

155
00:10:35.623 --> 00:10:38.348
The id of the current movie, okay?

156
00:10:38.348 --> 00:10:40.934
I think it's okay, I guess.

157
00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:45.904
So let's see, I'm going to Guardians
of the Galaxy and nothing happens.

158
00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:51.313
So something is wrong, and
by the way, what's happening?

159
00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:55.763
It seems like there is an error in
JavaScript that probably is gonna be

160
00:10:55.763 --> 00:10:57.613
difficult to see, I guess.

161
00:10:57.613 --> 00:10:59.916
Let's see, if I go to Console.

162
00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:04.553
If I click here, it's actually,
it's actually going to the home, so

163
00:11:04.553 --> 00:11:06.886
I think that the router is working.

164
00:11:06.886 --> 00:11:11.339
So this code is working and the url,

165
00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:16.839
let's see, we can actually inspect this.

166
00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:21.411
And we can actually see,
no, it's still the old one.

167
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:23.871
So let me refresh.

168
00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.532
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Now,
I'm seeing the right one.

169
00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:33.388
So it's up router.go and
be careful with quotes.

170
00:11:33.388 --> 00:11:39.262
So I'm using double quotes on the outside
and single quotes on the inside.

171
00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:44.397
Okay, you have to deal with this every
time you are mixing JavaScript and HTML.

172
00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:48.600
So, if I now go there actually working.

173
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.997
Yeah, I didn't refresh,
I think that was a problem.

174
00:11:50.997 --> 00:11:56.203
So I can go to the home and I can click
on any movie and just go in there.

175
00:11:59.338 --> 00:12:01.553
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
it's working, right?

176
00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:04.429
I can go to a home and get here and

177
00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:10.419
if I'm going to a page that is not ready,
I'm getting a 404.

178
00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:12.817
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I can see
why frameworks exist.

179
00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:15.739
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah,
I mean, writing it from scratch.

180
00:12:15.739 --> 00:12:17.009
It takes some time.

181
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:21.163
The good part is that when you have it,
you already have a micro library for

182
00:12:21.163 --> 00:12:21.769
a router.

183
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:23.562
So now you can use that router.

184
00:12:23.562 --> 00:12:25.523
There are more things you can improve and

185
00:12:25.523 --> 00:12:28.126
you can use that router on
every new Vanilla project.

186
00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:31.429
And that's your micro library
specifically for routing.

187
00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:33.908
And by the way,
when you're doing Vanilla JavaScript,

188
00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:35.464
it's okay to use micro libraries.

189
00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:38.628
So libraries are specifically for
one particular purpose,

190
00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:41.053
because you don't wanna
reinvent the wheel.

191
00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:47.973
And it's fine, it's perfectly fine to use
that particular, it's helping your issue.

192
00:12:47.973 --> 00:12:50.225
You try to find one that is small,

193
00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:55.463
that it's not forcing you to use any
specific pattern in the rest of your app.

194
00:12:55.463 --> 00:12:59.611
Set for that, and stuff works,
and that's all, okay?

195
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:05.266
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Very rewarding feeling
diving into the basics like this.

196
00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:08.917
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Cool, yeah,
actually a lot of people at the beginning,

197
00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:13.404
when they started learning things
like that, you say, come on,

198
00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:14.942
I don't wanna do this.

199
00:13:14.942 --> 00:13:18.954
I mean, it's better to use React or
start this with Angular.

200
00:13:18.954 --> 00:13:24.664
And I could argue also that probably the
first 20% of the time at the beginning,

201
00:13:24.664 --> 00:13:27.253
you feel like I don't wanna do that.

202
00:13:27.253 --> 00:13:31.345
But at some point,
I think that you get that feeling that,

203
00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:35.301
now I understand, okay,
what's going on with something?

204
00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:39.615
Now you decide next time if you want
to use a library for that or not.

205
00:13:39.615 --> 00:13:44.835
If you feel, yeah, a library will be good
enough or maybe this is good enough.

206
00:13:44.835 --> 00:13:47.658
It's just another tool for
your toolbox, okay?

207
00:13:47.658 --> 00:13:53.079
And then on every case, if you don't
know the tool, you will never use it.

208
00:13:53.079 --> 00:13:56.096
It's kind of a kind of a monster, okay?

209
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:57.638
That you don't know what that is.

210
00:13:57.638 --> 00:14:01.081
And I know that a lot of new
generations of web developers,

211
00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.903
they think that this is
what we're doing here.

212
00:14:03.903 --> 00:14:05.845
Sounds like assembler, okay?

213
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.646
Writing, talking to the DOM.

214
00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:12.244
I think that sounds like something really,
really low level.

215
00:14:12.244 --> 00:14:16.171
I mean, it's a lower level library but

216
00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:19.982
it's not really so low level, okay?

217
00:14:19.982 --> 00:14:26.450
One more rewarding thing
is that when we click here,

218
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.860
okay, it works but maybe we can make

219
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.862
a transition between the pages, okay?

220
00:14:35.862 --> 00:14:38.636
And it sounds scary, okay?

221
00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:41.506
I need to fade in, how do you do that?
