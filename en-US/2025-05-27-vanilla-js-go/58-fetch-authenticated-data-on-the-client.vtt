WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.677
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Now
we have the server.

2
00:00:02.677 --> 00:00:05.289
The next step is to go to the client.

3
00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:11.477
So in this case, we, for example,
remember our client in public services.

4
00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:15.581
We do have an api.js with
all our endpoints, so

5
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:20.825
we actually need to fill the new
endpoints that we have here.

6
00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.734
But then we need to think about this.

7
00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.016
What are the data here?

8
00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.238
We need to now add the new services.

9
00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:33.984
Okay, so let's say after login,
we have actually three services.

10
00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:40.349
getFavorites, that will be async.

11
00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:42.715
We have getWatchlist.

12
00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:48.594
Actually, watchlist is one word,
so I shouldn't capitalize the L.

13
00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:51.504
async, something like that.

14
00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:55.544
And we have saveToCollection,
or addToCollection,

15
00:00:55.544 --> 00:01:00.194
however you wanna call this,
that will receive a movie ID, and

16
00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:04.962
also in which collection we should
be saving that movie, okay?

17
00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:06.185
Something like that.

18
00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:09.045
So in this case, well,
we need, for example,

19
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:13.193
getFavorites should do something
simple like try to return, well,

20
00:01:13.193 --> 00:01:16.709
let's remove the try,
just to understand why we need it.

21
00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:23.291
I will return await of API.fetch.

22
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.944
This is account/favorites.

23
00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:28.718
So something similar to
what we have done before.

24
00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:29.848
Does it make sense?

25
00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:34.198
So let's start with favorites and
watchlist.

26
00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:38.357
So if I wanna try this
without finishing the UI yet,

27
00:01:38.357 --> 00:01:41.568
I'm going to expose the API to the app.

28
00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.572
Remember, we do have the app.

29
00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:45.521
The app is exposing the router and
the store.

30
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:49.347
Let's expose, just for
debugging purposes, the API, okay?

31
00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:53.802
So that means that now I can go
to the browser, refresh, and

32
00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:56.845
try to access the API through app.api.

33
00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:03.708
So if I try to get favorites,
okay, it's 401 (Unauthorized).

34
00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:07.459
So our server is returning 401.

35
00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.199
And you say, no, but I'm logged in.

36
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:15.293
If we go to Application, okay, well,
maybe we are not logged in, so let's try.

37
00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:17.724
If I go to my account,
it seems like we are not logged in.

38
00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:20.749
Okay, let's try again.

39
00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.837
We have test.dev, and our very secure
password that we said before that,

40
00:02:25.837 --> 00:02:30.136
of course, here is complaining
that it's not really secure.

41
00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:32.374
Okay, that's Chrome saying,
hey, be careful.

42
00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:34.063
That's a password manager, okay?

43
00:02:34.063 --> 00:02:40.125
So now I do have a JWT, so
if I'm seeing here, it's there.

44
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.697
So that's the JWT.

45
00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:44.577
Okay, it's available
there in local storage.

46
00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:49.609
So also, we can check that in our store,

47
00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.165
we do have the token, okay?

48
00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:55.518
So it's there, we are logged in.

49
00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:59.982
The thing is that if we
try again from here to

50
00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:04.829
getFavorites, we are still getting 401.

51
00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.622
Does anyone know why?

52
00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:09.216
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're
not passing the token?

53
00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:10.426
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I'm
not passing the token.

54
00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:12.344
The token is not like cookie,

55
00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:16.268
so it's not gonna pass to
the server automatically, okay?

56
00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:18.467
A cookie goes automatically.

57
00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:21.681
So when you're working with sessions,
a cookie works automatically, but

58
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:22.341
not the token.

59
00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:24.715
This is our custom implementation.

60
00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:29.772
So that means that we need to make
a little change to our API service,

61
00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:33.080
that we have two versions, fetch and send.

62
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.494
Remember, one is just requesting data and
the other one is also sending data.

63
00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:42.830
We could merge both in
just one if we want to.

64
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.125
So here, we should add a new header.

65
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:52.245
So we need to pass manually this,
the token.

66
00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:56.329
And the standard way to do that,
of course, you may change that,

67
00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.060
is to pass authorization,
that's the name of the header.

68
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.285
And JWT goes there with a prefix,
something like this,

69
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:10.395
Bearer, and then the token, okay?

70
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:16.340
So we can, well,
I need a coma here because it's JSON,

71
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.387
and then we can use template string and

72
00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:24.705
get from app.store.jwt, the token.

73
00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:28.929
The problem is that, yeah,
it will add it, but maybe it's not there.

74
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:31.547
Maybe it's null or undefined.

75
00:04:31.547 --> 00:04:37.031
So we may wanna check if it's there or
not first.

76
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:41.624
So if we do have one, we pass that.

77
00:04:41.624 --> 00:04:43.161
And if not, we can say null.

78
00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:47.548
If we say null, the header will be
ignored, so it will remove the header.

79
00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:51.659
And something similar we can add to fetch.

80
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.895
The problem is that fetch
right now has no headers.

81
00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:58.380
So when we are fetching,
we are not passing headers.

82
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.152
So after the URL, I need to add
a second argument that will be

83
00:05:03.152 --> 00:05:08.688
an object where we can set the header,
similar to what we did before,

84
00:05:08.688 --> 00:05:12.325
and then we need at least this header,
okay?

85
00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:14.587
So we have added the, yeah.

86
00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:17.449
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sorry,
I think JWT is misspelled on 55

87
00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:17.976
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Maybe.

88
00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:20.277
Yeah, you're right, thank you.

89
00:05:20.277 --> 00:05:24.193
Again, it's autocomplete for some reason.

90
00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:26.836
There we are, thank you.

91
00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:31.673
So now we are passing, if the token
is there, we're passing the token.

92
00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:34.930
Actually, we're passing the token
to every request, which is okay.

93
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.015
I mean, if it's there, let's pass it.

94
00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:39.186
The server will decide
what to do with that.

95
00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:42.250
Because maybe you can say, well,
but maybe, to get the movies,

96
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.952
we don't need the authorization,
so we don't send it.

97
00:05:44.952 --> 00:05:48.090
But, but, but, but,
maybe you wanna do something with that.

98
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.316
For example, when you get the movies from
the server, if the user is logged in,

99
00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:57.306
you change what you are returning,
such as your watchlist.

100
00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:00.797
I mean, when you go to Netflix,
Netflix.com, the homepage, but

101
00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:02.216
before it has some movies.

102
00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:03.657
But if you're logged in,

103
00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:07.072
you will see also the movies that
you added to your watchlist.

104
00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:12.059
So maybe it's the same API endpoint,
but you will get different responses,

105
00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.604
basically, if you have a token or not.

106
00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:16.068
Does it make sense?

107
00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:21.156
So that means that now we can try this
again, and if I try to get favorites,

108
00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:24.537
now I'm not getting a 401, it's a promise.

109
00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:28.483
So because it's a promise, I can wait for
it and I will receive the answer.

110
00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:30.352
Now, in this case, it's null.

111
00:06:30.352 --> 00:06:35.019
Okay, we'll see if it's what I'm
expecting or not, but at least it's null.

112
00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.263
I'm not getting any error.

113
00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:39.235
If I'm going to Network and

114
00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:43.790
try this again,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We should see here

115
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.892
the call, and
we are getting null from the server, okay?

116
00:06:47.892 --> 00:06:51.725
We will see if that's what we want, but

117
00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:56.488
at least it passes the first
step that is actually

118
00:06:56.488 --> 00:07:01.732
receiving the email through
the middleware, okay?

119
00:07:01.732 --> 00:07:02.276
Does it make sense?

120
00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:03.692
We are not getting 401.

121
00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:10.715
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, so the next
step, and then we see if we have a bug or

122
00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:15.669
not, if everything is connected, is to
actually connect this to the UI, okay?

123
00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:21.404
So we have the Favorites and
the Watchlist sections or

124
00:07:21.404 --> 00:07:25.361
pages that we need to actually fill.

125
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.732
So we know how to do that.

126
00:07:26.732 --> 00:07:29.608
Though, it's actually at this point,
pretty simple.

127
00:07:29.608 --> 00:07:34.081
The only thing that we need to do
remember is to register the routes,

128
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:37.380
create the web component,
create the template.

129
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.670
So everything we've done so
far a couple of times.

130
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.983
In this case, we can use a template for

131
00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:49.814
both collections.

132
00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:53.895
We don't need one for
Favorites and the other one for

133
00:07:53.895 --> 00:07:57.809
Watchlist because they are just the same,
okay?

134
00:07:57.809 --> 00:07:59.773
Just collections, at least.

135
00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:04.945
So we can go here and
create a new template.

136
00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:07.126
It's gonna be our last template.

137
00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:11.257
It's a template-collection, like that.

138
00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:16.559
The template-collection,
I think that for now, will have a UL for

139
00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:22.332
movies, and maybe a title that we can
add later, or something like that.

140
00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:26.893
So we can start with a UL, with an ID,

141
00:08:26.893 --> 00:08:30.731
so we can later grab this by ID.

142
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:35.393
So let's say this is a list of movies.

143
00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:39.576
Okay, we can add a title there,
so we can fill that title later.

144
00:08:39.576 --> 00:08:40.663
Actually, pretty simple.

145
00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:44.558
When you look at that, you may say,
well, maybe we don't need a template.

146
00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:50.105
We can just write this from the web
component, from JavaScript, okay?

147
00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:51.415
Which is okay.

148
00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:54.179
But maybe in the future,
if you wanna change that,

149
00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.053
it's easier if it's in the HTML.

150
00:08:56.053 --> 00:09:00.286
So then we are going to create
the web components, and in this case,

151
00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:01.710
I'm going to use OOP.

152
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.440
So instead of creating the full
code in both classes that they're

153
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.264
gonna be the same, I'm going to
create the base Collection page.

154
00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:13.565
And then we will have Favorites page and

155
00:09:13.565 --> 00:09:16.918
Watchlist page extending
from Collection page, okay?

156
00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:18.208
Does it make sense?

157
00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:19.850
That's kind of the idea.

158
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.941
So I'm going to create
first the three files,

159
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:27.944
CollectionPage.js, and

160
00:09:27.944 --> 00:09:33.826
then FavoritesPage.js,
and WatchlistPage.js.

161
00:09:33.826 --> 00:09:35.378
Okay, the three.

162
00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:38.106
Now, we have already done
this a couple of times.

163
00:09:38.106 --> 00:09:42.784
So if you want, we can just take the from,

164
00:09:42.784 --> 00:09:46.546
in this case, I think it's H4.

165
00:09:46.546 --> 00:09:49.139
Over here,
we have a template with more details.

166
00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:53.994
If you wanna get the same template
that we have here, it's okay,

167
00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.948
you can take it from here.

168
00:09:55.948 --> 00:09:58.421
I'm talking about the template collection.

169
00:09:58.421 --> 00:10:03.593
But the other one will work anyway for
what we are going to create.

170
00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:08.037
And then we need,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: This is

171
00:10:08.037 --> 00:10:10.727
the Collection page.

172
00:10:10.727 --> 00:10:14.007
And the other components are simpler,
okay?

173
00:10:14.007 --> 00:10:17.360
And we can write it manually
to understand what's going on.

174
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.757
So this is the Collection page.

175
00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:22.988
Probably, I will need an import
some points, we'll see.

176
00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:24.626
So the Collection page looks like this.

177
00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:27.416
Extending HTML elements, so
it's actually a web component.

178
00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:33.932
But I'm not defining the web component,
because it's gonna be a base class, okay?

179
00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:36.035
That will have an endpoint.

180
00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:37.128
What's the endpoint?

181
00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:40.849
The API function that we will call,
and a title, and

182
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:44.839
we are receiving that through
the constructor, okay?

183
00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:46.499
So we control the collection, we pass.

184
00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:48.857
This is favorites and
this is your endpoint.

185
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:52.228
And then this is looping
through the movies and

186
00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:55.522
actually rendering movie item components.

187
00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:57.455
Okay, this is pretty simple.

188
00:10:57.455 --> 00:11:00.836
And on connectedCallback is
just cloning the template.

189
00:11:00.836 --> 00:11:03.070
We have already done
this a couple of times.

190
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.676
So Favorites, for example,

191
00:11:06.676 --> 00:11:12.303
is gonna be an export class,
FavoritesPage,

192
00:11:12.303 --> 00:11:19.677
extending from not HTML element,
but our CollectionPage.

193
00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:25.108
And the constructor of this
one is gonna call super,

194
00:11:25.108 --> 00:11:29.682
passing the endpoint and the title, okay?

195
00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:30.760
Does it make sense?

196
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.656
So for example,
it's gonna be API.getFavorites,

197
00:11:35.656 --> 00:11:38.062
API needs to be imported.

198
00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:40.658
Be very careful with both imports,

199
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:45.077
not sure if you realize at this
point what's going on there.

200
00:11:45.077 --> 00:11:49.955
So this is Favorite Movies,
I need to add .js.

201
00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:57.928
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And I'm going
to define this, customElements.define,

202
00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:02.000
and this is gonna be favorite-page.

203
00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:11.087
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And
something very similar on watchlist,

204
00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:17.379
just changing the endpoint,
the name of the class,

205
00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:22.537
Movies in Watchlist, watchlist-page.

206
00:12:22.537 --> 00:12:24.199
I think I'm done with that.

207
00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:25.357
Okay, does it make sense?

208
00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:31.242
So remember, when you're using web
components, you can use OOP, and

209
00:12:31.242 --> 00:12:37.044
create your structure of components
that you just inherit behavior.

210
00:12:37.044 --> 00:12:43.784
And you then enhance that
behavior with subclasses.
