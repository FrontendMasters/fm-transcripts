WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.024
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So pretty quickly,
I'm going to create a web component for

2
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:11.325
that one, so
let's create the registration page or

3
00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:16.158
register page,
whatever you wanna call that.

4
00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:19.096
That we know the deal, okay?

5
00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:23.318
So it's export class, register page,

6
00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:28.285
extend from HTMLElement,
and then we define,

7
00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:34.118
go to customElements,
define page, you can say,

8
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:39.355
it's a lot of work,
we need to do that every time.

9
00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:44.605
Remember, you can create your micro
library, and then you can have in one

10
00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:50.209
sentence, a way to create a web component
that will kind of write this for you.

11
00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:53.943
So it's possible to do that pretty easily,
okay?

12
00:00:53.943 --> 00:00:57.733
And you create your own mini library,

13
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:02.596
and it's fine, and
on the connectedCallback.

14
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.542
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We need to always
do the same, I'm talking about this.

15
00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:20.186
So I will just copy and paste, this
copy and paste is the one that you say,

16
00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:25.724
come on, it's template register,
and we are appending that.

17
00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:29.058
And actually, to see it in action,
I need one more step,

18
00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:31.007
does anyone remember which one?

19
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.344
Which step am I missing?

20
00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:37.269
So I wanna go to account register,
and I wanna see that form.

21
00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:38.406
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Render?

22
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:39.138
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Render, no,

23
00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:43.413
render is something that you can call if
you want, I don't think we need that here.

24
00:01:43.413 --> 00:01:47.251
Render also is not mandatory, it's just
a method, actually, why isn't it working?

25
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:51.408
So if I do this, I'm not seeing anything.

26
00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:52.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have
to put it in our routes?

27
00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:57.745
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, we need to
have the route, because it's not there,

28
00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:01.289
the router is looking at the URL, it says,

29
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.024
I don't have any, target for
this, so we need to add it.

30
00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:09.972
So path/account/register, and

31
00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:16.153
component will be,
now that we have the RegisterPage,

32
00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:21.165
let's check it has the .js, which is okay.

33
00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:25.143
So, now if I refresh, I'm still getting,

34
00:02:25.143 --> 00:02:29.883
there we are, okay,
the name looks weird, right?

35
00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:35.078
So let me see why something
is wrong with the name,

36
00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:41.015
maybe, let's see,
input ID maybe because of the type,

37
00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:45.362
maybe let's have an explicit text type.

38
00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:49.822
Yep, you say, why do I need to set
explicitly, because by default it's text?

39
00:02:49.822 --> 00:02:56.013
Because of the CSS, so, this CSS is
probably applying to input type text,

40
00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:59.769
input type password, and input type email.

41
00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.901
So if you don't have the text,
it's not going to apply the CSS.

42
00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:05.978
But of course, you can change the CSS.

43
00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:10.332
And now I have, like,
a pretty nice form, okay?

44
00:03:10.332 --> 00:03:14.261
So as I was mentioning before,
if you click over the Email world,

45
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.905
if you click there,
it gets focused there as well, okay, so

46
00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:20.350
that's because we have the label four.

47
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you have
an closed tag for the login link?

48
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.746
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Maybe,, everything
is possible, let's see, yeah, it's closing

49
00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:36.900
the P, and by the way, I haven't had close
talk, but seems to be working anyway.

50
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.942
I mean, I can go to Login,
and it works, and

51
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:45.637
I have not seen any glitch from that and
close tag, why is that, does anyone know?

52
00:03:45.637 --> 00:03:50.705
I'm gonna solve it anyway, because you
want to sleep tonight, if I'm not doing

53
00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:56.082
that, but I know, but well, actually, the
browser is always trying to do its best.

54
00:03:56.082 --> 00:04:01.626
In this case, when you close the
paragraph, it says, but we want a link,

55
00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:07.261
but anyway, okay, so let's close the link,
so it will close the link for you.

56
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:11.790
And this is interesting when
you do [INAUDIBLE] Javascript.

57
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.578
I don't have it closed in my HTML, but

58
00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:20.157
if I look at the DOM representation of
that, so if I look talking about here,

59
00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:24.534
I'm not sure, I have used this,
it's a pretty nice tool.

60
00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:28.300
You click there, and
then you go and click here, and

61
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.066
it goes directly there,
actually it's closed, so

62
00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:37.134
that's when you see that the browser
is closing the tag for me, okay.

63
00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:41.481
The thing is that if you don't do that,
sometimes it's not closing when or

64
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:45.138
where you were actually expected,
so not in every situation,

65
00:04:45.138 --> 00:04:47.218
everything will look really nice.

66
00:04:47.218 --> 00:04:51.471
So that's why you need to close it,
which is fine, so

67
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:54.694
thank you to whoever alerted me to that.

68
00:04:54.694 --> 00:05:01.046
But keep in mind, the web is typically
always working on the best effort, so

69
00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:06.324
it will try to do it anyway,
let's render this however we can.

70
00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:08.645
Okay, let's dance, anyway.

71
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:14.003
Okay, so we have the form,
now the next step is to do something

72
00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:19.278
when you click there and
just call the app and then the login.
