WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.633
So for logging and for registration and
logging, we are done on the back end.

2
00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:11.070
We still have more things to
do when we are talking about

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.485
seeing private data, okay?

4
00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:17.584
So now we need to go back to the client.

5
00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.890
So let's start with the HTML.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.489
So what's idea?

7
00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.365
The idea is that I will have two new URLs.

8
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:31.032
Account register and
account authentication or login.

9
00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:35.197
Right now they don't exist in the router,
so

10
00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:40.246
that's why the router says patient,
phone, right?

11
00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:43.845
And by the way this is
working client side.

12
00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:48.741
Because actually if I try forward
slash login, I'm getting 404 from

13
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:53.734
the server on forward slash login but
not on forward slash account login.

14
00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.872
I'm not getting a 404 from the server.

15
00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.323
I'm getting a 404 from the client.

16
00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:01.517
The trick happens in main.go.

17
00:01:01.517 --> 00:01:08.286
When we were doing this client routes
handler, we added an account prefix.

18
00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:13.767
So everything is starting with account
is sending that back to the client,

19
00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:16.032
so to the router in the client.

20
00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:19.136
Forward slash logging is not there, so

21
00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:23.470
it's handled by the server saying,
hey, no 404.

22
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.417
Now we need to go to the HTML
index.html in the public.

23
00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:31.055
Let me close all the go
folders that we won't use for

24
00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:33.430
a while and public index.html.

25
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.687
We'll create more templates, okay?

26
00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:40.233
I will do one and
the other one will be pretty similar.

27
00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.144
So probably I will copy and paste it,
and then make some changes.

28
00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:47.586
You have then ng3 in case you
want to copy and paste, but

29
00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:52.285
I want to explain something while I'm
writing it, so I will do it manually.

30
00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:53.897
So I have a template.

31
00:01:53.897 --> 00:01:56.554
Let's call this template register first.

32
00:01:59.342 --> 00:02:04.730
Like that, and I will have Actually,
let's say section.

33
00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:09.070
Like that.

34
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.037
A section, inside a section,
I will have a title, register,

35
00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:16.581
a new account, and then a form.

36
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:21.566
And on submit, I will call app.register.

37
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:24.466
So we will need to add later
that register function, and

38
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.700
then we'll pass the event as an argument.

39
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.993
Does anyone know why we doing the event?

40
00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:31.195
Prevent submit.

41
00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:35.730
For prevent default, that is,
prevent submission of this form.

42
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.648
Because, if not, it will submit this
not by our app, but by the browser.

43
00:02:41.648 --> 00:02:47.560
And then we have a pair,
a lot of pair of label input.

44
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.399
So the label is for the text.

45
00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:56.268
It's very important for
accessibility to add always a label.

46
00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:57.895
So for example,
let's start with the input.

47
00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:03.841
We have the ID whether, for example,
register name, that's the ID.

48
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.701
Type text is by default,
so I don't need to add it.

49
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.047
We can add a place holder if you want,
if not you don't need that.

50
00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:14.667
We can say if it's required or
not for some client side validation.

51
00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:18.729
And submitter is important,
mostly in registration forms and

52
00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.495
login forms, is the auto complete thing.

53
00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:26.182
This is useful for oral competition,
of course, but also for password managers.

54
00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:32.288
When you go to a website and that the
password manager, that it can be iCloud or

55
00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:36.880
the Google password manager, is suggesting
you to type a password for you or

56
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.474
to save your credentials in your password
manager is because the website has

57
00:03:41.474 --> 00:03:43.802
set the right order complete values.

58
00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:46.278
So in this case, we do have a name.

59
00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:48.400
Be careful CC name is not the right one.

60
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.692
This is credit card name.

61
00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:53.012
KCC is credit card, so that's not the one.

62
00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:54.921
So we just need to use name.

63
00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:57.368
Also we have nickname, given name.

64
00:03:57.368 --> 00:03:59.426
I think name will work here.

65
00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:03.209
And label here, I will just say name.

66
00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.984
And it's important to define their for.

67
00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:08.121
I'll say, this is the label for
"register-name".

68
00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:10.632
Does any one know why the for
is important?

69
00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:18.231
Well, it's important to specify
this label is for that input.

70
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:19.631
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's for accessibilities.

71
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.301
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: For
accessibility and also for usability.

72
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:27.537
So that means, for example, when you have
a screen reader and you click or you tap

73
00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:33.255
with your finger over the input, it will
explain, that's the input for the name.

74
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:36.218
So it's looking for the associated label.

75
00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:41.184
And also, if you click on Name
with your mouth, your pointer,

76
00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:46.258
your touch with your finger,
it will focus on the input, okay?

77
00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:50.125
So they act together as a group.

78
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:53.593
So we have a name,
we have another pair for email.

79
00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.090
Or let me copy this one.

80
00:04:56.773 --> 00:05:01.353
So email for the label and
also auto complete is

81
00:05:01.353 --> 00:05:06.180
gonna be email, and
also type is gonna be email.

82
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.237
This is important for mobile devices,
mostly also for validation,

83
00:05:11.237 --> 00:05:16.294
but for mobile devices because it
will activate the email keyboard,

84
00:05:16.294 --> 00:05:20.411
that has the add symbol and
the close to the user, okay?

85
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:25.862
So that's something to have name,
email, and then it's a password.

86
00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:30.153
Actually, we need two passwords, right?

87
00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:31.560
We need a password.

88
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.522
And password confirmation.

89
00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:40.334
And auto complete is gonna be new
password or current password?

90
00:05:43.012 --> 00:05:44.616
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: New?
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: New.

91
00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:46.778
What's the difference?

92
00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:51.156
This is for the password manager
to know that when you click there,

93
00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:53.668
it should suggest you a new password.

94
00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:57.761
So on the type is password.

95
00:05:57.761 --> 00:06:03.187
This is for a mask when you type
with asterisk or with circles.

96
00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:07.059
And then we need
the password confirmation.

97
00:06:10.584 --> 00:06:12.131
Repeat your password.

98
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.326
Like that.

99
00:06:16.757 --> 00:06:20.077
Password confirmation.

100
00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:23.630
It has no auto complete, so we don't
need that, but we need type password.

101
00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:26.191
Like that.

102
00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:28.760
And then finally, we will add a button.

103
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.675
Oops, that says, register.

104
00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:39.431
Do I need to do something
with click of the button?

105
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.791
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No,
because you're gonna do it from the form.

106
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:43.428
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I'm
doing it from the form.

107
00:06:43.428 --> 00:06:47.611
And the advantage of that is that
it will work with buttons and

108
00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:49.340
also with the keyboard.

109
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.732
So if you press the Enter key,

110
00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:56.631
it will also trigger on submit
both keyboard and the button.

111
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:58.887
So I don't need to do anything special.

112
00:06:58.887 --> 00:07:03.492
Maybe I will add a paragraph saying
that if you already have an account.

113
00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:06.098
Actually, yeah,
if you already have an account.

114
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:15.183
PLease, log in.

115
00:07:15.183 --> 00:07:23.503
And log in will have a link
going to account log in.

116
00:07:30.254 --> 00:07:30.891
Okay?

117
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:38.133
Will it work without or should I do
JavaScript, router, app, router.go?

118
00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:39.679
Actually both will work.

119
00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:43.277
It's probably gonna be
better to use the other one.

120
00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:46.424
Because this one will
actually reload the page.

121
00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.076
It will work, okay?

122
00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:55.232
Because we have this idea of catching
everything on the server, okay?

123
00:07:55.232 --> 00:07:57.821
But we can improve that later.
