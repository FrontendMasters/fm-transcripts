1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.625
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: But we need to
separate between the idea of loading

2
00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:09.164
the component and executing the component
than importing that in a module.

3
00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:15.541
This module, if it's going to use it,
it needs to import it anyway.

4
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.889
So one thing is for HTML to execute
the custom components defined.

5
00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:23.506
Another thing is for JavaScript,

6
00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:28.661
a module should always import
elements from other modules, okay?

7
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.288
Make sense?

8
00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:34.716
And finally, we can see Superman movies or

9
00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:39.761
Back to the Future movies,
and it works, okay?

10
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:42.949
And if I click on these ones should work,
oops,

11
00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.678
seems like you have a bug there, right?

12
00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:52.483
So for some reason, no, maybe I click
twice because it's in the history.

13
00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:53.991
Can you see that?

14
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:58.893
We have a bug somewhere, we need to
find that bug that when we click in one

15
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:04.231
element, it goes to the home for
some reason, but then it's in the history.

16
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:09.742
So I can go back and
then there it seems like I do have a go

17
00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:15.757
to home that is there somehow
that we need to solve, okay.

18
00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:17.811
Is it happening also in the home page?

19
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.995
Yes.

20
00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.555
So the problem seems
to be directly in our-

21
00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:23.714
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The catch all.

22
00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:26.668
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Movie
item component, right?

23
00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:31.590
The catch all is on the server, so we
are actually not touching the server, so

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.795
it shouldn't be something on the server,
okay?

25
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:41.049
So because here we are not touching
the server, so we are just client-side.

26
00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.013
So the problem should be
around movie item, so

27
00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:49.958
we are going to a URL on clicking, and

28
00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:56.597
maybe the problem is this one,
I'm not preventing default.

29
00:01:56.597 --> 00:02:00.717
We can do that first,
maybe that's the issue,

30
00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:06.283
because this is going to the home
page event, preventDefault.

31
00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:07.201
Does it make sense?

32
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:12.752
It's a link with an href, so
if I don't preventDefault, the browser

33
00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:18.695
is also changing the URL, and it's going
to the home because it has no URL.

34
00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:20.609
But also my code is changing the URL.

35
00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:26.412
So we are both calling router, I think
that's the issue, cross your fingers.

36
00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:33.325
So we go here, click, no,
let's refresh again just in case, yeah.

37
00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:39.883
And if I search, back to the future,
go in here, it's working now.

38
00:02:39.883 --> 00:02:42.053
Okay, did you all get the problem?

39
00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:46.972
When you have links or forms,
you have to preventDefault.

40
00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:50.896
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there some kind
of listener that exists for

41
00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:53.795
injecting in our HTML like that?

42
00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:59.157
Because when we load the page,
we go through each href and disable them.

43
00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:04.018
It seems like you could probably make
a listener or something here too.

44
00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:07.753
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Something that we
can do is that, so we have that maybe,

45
00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.660
if I understand correctly,

46
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.357
maybe we can add the same nav link
that we have for the homepage, okay?

47
00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:19.038
And then we can, I mean, as an idea,

48
00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:23.872
you can go to the Router and remember we

49
00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:28.869
have that enhancing experience here.

50
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.956
So maybe we can call that also
when we are going to a new page.

51
00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:37.099
So after injecting the page,
we go through the links and

52
00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.844
do something, that's one option.

53
00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:44.560
Another option that's probably gonna
be better is that you can have

54
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.141
observers of the DOM.

55
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:50.542
So every time there is a change
in some parts of the DOM,

56
00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:53.519
you can go again and run this, okay?

57
00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.953
That's another option.

58
00:03:54.953 --> 00:03:59.456
And let's say the final option is
to you can even do something like,

59
00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:04.275
I'm not sure if it's initially a good
idea, but just to tell you that you

60
00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:09.184
can do that, you can take the document and
addEventListener(click).

61
00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:15.412
And you say, well, but if I do this,
it's the click of the whole page, yes.

62
00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:17.587
But I'm not sure if you know,
there are two things.

63
00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:21.391
We have target, two elements,
and current target.

64
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:25.118
Does anyone know the difference
between target and current target?

65
00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:32.751
Nope, let's do a console.log of both,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And

66
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:33.982
see what happens.

67
00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:40.116
So anywhere,
now if I click anywhere on the page,

68
00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:44.212
I should see that, or maybe not.

69
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:48.251
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: This
error is from YouTube,

70
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.725
I'm still getting the error from YouTube.

71
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:57.355
There, I'm seeing the document, sorry,
I'm clicking on Back to the Future,

72
00:04:57.355 --> 00:05:02.049
and I'm seeing first h2,
second the document, okay?

73
00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:07.607
So target is the actual
element you are clicking on.

74
00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:13.314
Even if you are listening for the whole
page and current target is the whole page.

75
00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:17.548
So meaning that on target,
you can actually check,

76
00:05:17.548 --> 00:05:22.371
for example, which kind of element it is,
if it's a link.

77
00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:27.080
So then, if it's a link,
you can preventDefault for all the links.

78
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.555
I'm not sure you want to do that, okay?

79
00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:33.507
But I'm just saying that you can use
the DOM with this and listen for

80
00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:37.150
events in the whole document or
just in the part.

81
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.281
So it can be just the main and
everything is in there.

82
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:47.744
When you click there, then you can
check here who is the actual target.

83
00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:51.472
And if the one that you are looking for,
do something with it.

84
00:05:51.472 --> 00:05:55.981
This gets more complicated,
you have something known as bubbling,

85
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:58.792
I'm not getting into those details here.

86
00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:04.184
Also you can stop propagation, so
another listener can stop propagation,

87
00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:08.070
so then you won't get executed
at the document level.

88
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.529
It depends if in which phase you are,
so it gets more complicated.

89
00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.469
So, but
if you wanna get there you can make a lot

90
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.554
of dance tricks,
just by using the DOM, okay?

91
00:06:21.554 --> 00:06:23.568
Does that make sense?

92
00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:26.283
So, do you have any
questions on the search?

93
00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:34.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In the, I think it was a
movie item you had the onClick attribute.

94
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.968
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Movie item?

95
00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:36.744
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, that.

96
00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:37.257
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah.

97
00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:42.576
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's just implicitly
it has access to the event object?

98
00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:47.169
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, exactly when
you have any on something event on HTML,

99
00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.763
you always have an argument known
as event with that name that

100
00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:56.019
is available in that particular
context of execution.

101
00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:00.447
It's called event, but
if you're passing that to a function,

102
00:07:00.447 --> 00:07:05.285
you need to pass, I mean,
if you have here app.process or whatever,

103
00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:08.407
you typically pass
the event as an argument.

104
00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:12.723
So then that function will
execute preventDefault.

105
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:17.874
But because here I'm not using an external
function, I'm just writing a script there,

106
00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:22.282
I can use semicolon, separate sentences
and execute both at the same time.

107
00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:25.530
And there is an implicit
argument known as the event.

108
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.209
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
you can assume that it's just a-

109
00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.899
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, it's

110
00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:28.720
always there.

111
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.696
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, but in that line,

112
00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:32.404
that's essentially a function
that's just always gonna execute.

113
00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:35.358
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's an object
more than a function, but yeah,

114
00:07:35.358 --> 00:07:39.754
event is an object that is always
available inside an event of type on when

115
00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:41.139
you say on something.

116
00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.436
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay,
could you pass in a function to onClick?

117
00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:47.552
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah,
I think I'm doing that at some point,

118
00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:49.035
maybe on the search.

119
00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:52.901
So if you go index.html and

120
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:58.471
the search the homepage, no, here.

121
00:07:58.471 --> 00:07:59.036
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sure, yeah.

122
00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:01.034
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And
passing the event argument.

123
00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:05.369
So I was in this case stopping the default

124
00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:10.098
action prevented default from inside app.

125
00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:13.391
So here on app search I'm
receiving the event and

126
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:15.892
calling preventDefault from here.
