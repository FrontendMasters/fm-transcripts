WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.064
So now we have on the Frontend,
we have the API service ready.

2
00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:11.974
But if you look here,
the API connects to web components.

3
00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:16.295
So to actually see something on
the screen, we can do it directly.

4
00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:20.805
But the idea is that I want to create for
the main,

5
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:27.850
remember the main is empty right now,
this is where we are going to put this.

6
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.820
I want you to create something like this.

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.734
I wanna create a web component that can
be something like a homepage, okay?

8
00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.626
Of course, if I run this,
nothing happens, okay?

9
00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:41.513
If I refresh, nothing happens.

10
00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:45.409
what is the browser doing
with that component?

11
00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.522
If I look here in the main it's
actually there, but it doesn't know

12
00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:56.529
what to do with that well, but we can
create a custom element, a web component,

13
00:00:56.529 --> 00:01:03.106
that can actually render something under
that name, under that HTML element, okay?

14
00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:04.700
And that's a web component.

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.261
So if you wanna get deeper
into web components,

16
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:15.405
you can see the course
of Frontend Masters,

17
00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:18.056
vanilla JavaScript.

18
00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:23.029
You might not need that framework, but
just a few really quick definitions,

19
00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:28.157
a web component is a modular, reusable
building block for web development that

20
00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:33.077
encapsulates a set of related
functionality and user interface elements.

21
00:01:33.077 --> 00:01:39.843
In short words, your own custom HTML
element that you can reuse, okay?

22
00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:44.255
And you can encapsulate under one
HTML element that you create,

23
00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:46.306
such as our homepage, okay?

24
00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:50.200
Actually, the Web Components
spec is not really a spec.

25
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.818
So this is that's wrong.

26
00:01:51.818 --> 00:01:56.238
It's not really a spec, it's not an API,
it's a design pattern, and it's currently

27
00:01:56.238 --> 00:02:00.200
compatible with every browser, so
we don't have any compatibility issues.

28
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.053
It's actually a set of a standard.

29
00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:03.859
So it's more a design pattern.

30
00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.128
We use custom elements.

31
00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:11.645
We use HTML templates and
Shadow DOM if we want that's optional,

32
00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:15.673
and also Shadow DOM has
a declarative version.

33
00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:21.455
Roughly Custom Elements lets us
register into the browser my new tag.

34
00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:28.253
Template, HTML template is a way,
instead of writing HTML from JavaScript,

35
00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:34.330
it's a way that we have to write
the HTML for that component in the DOM,

36
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.656
and Shadow DOM will create
an encapsulated DOM for

37
00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:43.296
that component that is useful for
CSS, for example.

38
00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:47.278
So then each component,
we have its own CSS, and

39
00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:50.884
that CSS won't affect the outside, okay?

40
00:02:50.884 --> 00:02:52.995
By default, it affects the outside, okay?

41
00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:57.715
So that's idea, and it's similar to
the idea of components on most of

42
00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:04.043
the libraries out there, React, Angular,
everyone has the idea of a component.

43
00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:06.668
So it's kind of the same thing, but

44
00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:12.104
with vanilla JavaScript with no libraries,
with no frameworks, okay?

45
00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:15.579
And we have freedom of choice on
how to define them and use them.

46
00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.267
And we will use, during this course,
many ways to use web components.

47
00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:25.459
So let's create our first web component.

48
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.756
We can create first the template,
or first the JavaScript.

49
00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:32.400
It's just the same, what's the template?

50
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.492
Well, the template, it's actually
something that we can put here somewhere

51
00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:44.970
in the HTML template, and it's actually
the template HTML element, we set an ID.

52
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.365
You will see why we need an ID.

53
00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:49.703
We can call this template home, for

54
00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:54.500
example, and
then write the HTML for this, okay?

55
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.328
So our our HTML for the homepage,
we have two sections.

56
00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:06.310
The sections will be,
we have vertical scroll and I have CSS for

57
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.926
that class for
making a vertical scroll of movies, okay?

58
00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:15.246
And this is gonna be the top 10,
actually top 20,

59
00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:19.471
because we have 20 as our constant,
not top 10.

60
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.240
We can't say top 10 and
then change that doesn't matter.

61
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.201
If we have an issue such
as this Week's Top Movies,

62
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:35.579
that's a title and a list, okay?

63
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:41.138
And something similar, we will have for

64
00:04:41.138 --> 00:04:46.857
the random movie so
we can say the title for

65
00:04:46.857 --> 00:04:53.083
this can be something to watch today,
okay?

66
00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:56.656
So if I say this,
here comes the important part,

67
00:04:56.656 --> 00:05:01.287
the template HTML element will
not be rendered by the browser.

68
00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:05.806
It will be parsed by the browser but
not rendered.

69
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:12.514
We need to use JavaScript to bring that
template and use it in our web component.

70
00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:17.044
Because by default, I mean,
if I refresh, I'm not seeing that.

71
00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:20.535
I mean, the template is there, but
by default it's not being rendered,

72
00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:21.279
it's hidden.

73
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.745
I mean, it's a template, so
it's not being used to rendering.

74
00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:31.004
At least, it should render the HU,
the title I'm not seeing that.
