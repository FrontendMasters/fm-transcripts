WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.366
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And now we
will work with the public folder, so

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.162
with the HTML.

3
00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:07.813
So our index HTML has that hello from Go,
that doesn't make any sense.

4
00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:12.637
So, the first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm going to delete that, and

5
00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.975
I'm going to replace the HTML.

6
00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:19.700
So you have an HTML to copy and paste if
you want, but I wanna do this manually,

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.455
at least for the first minutes, so
we understand how we are building the app.

8
00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.533
How easy is actually?

9
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.520
Think about building an app
with Vanilla JavaScript.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.132
So first, let's set the title for this,
so this is the name of the project is

11
00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:39.259
ReadingIt, so we can start reading movies,
something like that.

12
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.575
We're have a style.CSS
that we can point to.

13
00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:45.657
So after this, we have a CSS.

14
00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:48.069
So we have to link the HTML to a CSS.

15
00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:53.090
So I'm going to say link rel "stylesheet".

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.648
The CSS is already ready,

17
00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:03.960
href "styles.css".

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.479
Okay, we also have a web manifest file.

19
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.426
Does anyone know what that is?

20
00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:10.744
A web manifest file.

21
00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:16.337
We can actually look at it but
you know what that is?

22
00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:19.369
It's a web standard file, so it's not Go.

23
00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.557
It's not something for any library
framework, it's actually a standard.

24
00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:29.432
It's called the web app manifest,
defines metadata for your website,

25
00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:34.547
and most of the time it's being used for
progressive web apps.

26
00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:36.783
But it's not just for
progressive web apps.

27
00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:41.384
Actually, every browser is reading that
file to get more metadata about your

28
00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:44.164
website, for example, what's your color?

29
00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:45.574
What's your icon?

30
00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:50.460
So in case, someone is adding
your app to the home screen or

31
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.068
adding your website as an app.

32
00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:58.383
So for example, Safari on a Mac.

33
00:01:58.383 --> 00:01:59.769
Let me show you Safari on the Mac.

34
00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:04.440
When you go to a website like 8080,

35
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.130
you can go to File, Add to Doc.

36
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.093
So when you go and
Add to Doc, you can see it's

37
00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:17.934
taking this and
you can Add this to your doc.

38
00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:23.735
But for that, you need to connect
your HTML with that file,

39
00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:27.112
and you do that with another link.

40
00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:31.628
It's link rel "manifest".

41
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:38.362
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
now there is a connection,

42
00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:42.019
a link between the HTML document and
that manifest file.

43
00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:48.935
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Again,
if I reload my page,

44
00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:52.532
first, I'm not sure if you realize
that there is something new now.

45
00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:57.130
There is a color in the toolbar, so

46
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.626
this color, that color.

47
00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:04.935
That color is coming from the manifest,
it's a theme color.

48
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:11.969
In fact, let me change that with green or
can be any color, okay?

49
00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.585
Let's try with green.

50
00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:17.606
If I refresh, now Safari is green.

51
00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:22.961
So you can see that the HTML,
the browser is using this

52
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:28.087
external document to
enhance the user interface.

53
00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:34.500
And also if you add this to the doc,
it's gonna use now the icon and

54
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.579
also a name that I can set
separated from my HTML title, okay?

55
00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.569
So that's the idea of the manifest, okay?

56
00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.042
So we have connector.CSS and
also the manifest.

57
00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:50.225
That part is done, you wanna save it?

58
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.694
Yes, because I don't
want to keep that green.

59
00:03:52.694 --> 00:03:55.496
That was not actually their idea.

60
00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:57.263
And also, maybe, we wanna set,

61
00:03:57.263 --> 00:04:00.435
just because something that we
need to do on every project.

62
00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:05.901
So now, if we see local host,
we can close this now,

63
00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:10.872
8080, we see nothing, which is okay, but

64
00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:16.363
we have this very old icon
there that we don't want.

65
00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:19.048
So something that the next step for
every project.

66
00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:24.635
If you also link,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: The shortcut icon.

67
00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:29.147
There are many ways to define this,
one is through icon or

68
00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:31.688
shortcut icon is another link.

69
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:39.070
So on the href,
we have an icon inside images, icon.pn.

70
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.444
So "images/ icon.png" will make the trick.

71
00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:50.891
So if I refresh now,
make sure if you realize

72
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:56.350
that we have a nice icon
there as a favcicon.

73
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.019
Baby steps that we're doing
in our user interface, so

74
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:02.423
now let's start working on the UI.

75
00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:06.933
I know that at this point your thinking,
writing the HTML manually,

76
00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:08.699
it's gonna be a lot of work.

77
00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.727
Well, you see,
it's not gonna be a lot of work.

78
00:05:11.727 --> 00:05:18.452
If we keep the HTML semantic and simple to
understand, it's not gonna be a big deal.

79
00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:22.502
So the body will have a header.

80
00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:27.669
And remember, in this case,
we are trying to design something

81
00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.320
that we have already seen,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Here.

82
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.413
We are trying to design that website.

83
00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:39.579
So actually,
what we will have is the header.

84
00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:44.932
This is the header, everything
we have here, that's the header.

85
00:05:44.932 --> 00:05:46.971
The header will we have a logo.

86
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:52.850
It will have a navigation bar or
a navigation section and a search input.

87
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.912
And then we will have the section for

88
00:05:54.912 --> 00:05:59.809
the main content that will depend on the
section that we're currently navigating.

89
00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.211
Okay, does it make sense?

90
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.958
Cool, so that means that's the header.

91
00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:11.817
The header will have
the title that is gonna

92
00:06:11.817 --> 00:06:18.004
be an image pointing to images/logo.png,

93
00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:25.024
I really have the size that I want,
they have 35.

94
00:06:25.024 --> 00:06:28.203
Remember every image should
have an alternative text.

95
00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:32.334
In this case, it's the logo read in it.

96
00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:34.049
We close the h1.

97
00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:38.754
Inside the header,
we will also have a nav.

98
00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:42.961
This is pure symantic html, navis for

99
00:06:42.961 --> 00:06:50.326
the navigation section of your app and
we will have a list of links.

100
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.820
A UL an unorder list with links.

101
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.694
Pointing for example to the homepage,

102
00:06:59.694 --> 00:07:02.548
we call it movies.

103
00:07:02.548 --> 00:07:08.517
For now, we'll say Movies,
we'll say Favorites,

104
00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:13.430
then we'll go to Watchlist and My Account.

105
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.384
Need to solve these issues
they have here like that.

106
00:07:18.384 --> 00:07:19.968
And then the URLs,

107
00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:25.924
we can change this later because
they're not gonna work at this point.

108
00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:29.078
I mean, the target of those links.

109
00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:35.866
Watchlist, maybe something like this,
account.

110
00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:37.811
Okay, like that.

111
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:42.983
And after the nav,
I'm also going to have div with a form,

112
00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:47.524
and the form will have
an input type="search",

113
00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:53.883
I'm not sure if you know that we do
have an input type search for search.

114
00:07:53.883 --> 00:07:55.277
So don't use text.

115
00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:59.773
Use search that has more semantic and
even more attributes for

116
00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:01.512
when you have a search.

117
00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:05.476
And the placeholder for
it will be search movies.

118
00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:09.637
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And
that's actually our header.

119
00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:14.929
Then we have the main content
that we will leave it empty for

120
00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:22.171
now, and then a fooder with some basic
metadata such as copyright or whatever.

121
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:27.939
ReelingIt FrontendMasters.com.

122
00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:31.216
Something like that will
work as an initial HTML.

123
00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:35.033
So if you look at it,
it even fits in one screen.

124
00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:37.749
So it's not really so complicated.

125
00:08:37.749 --> 00:08:41.651
And we can actually
understand What's going on.

126
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:46.332
Okay, I will enhance this
with some properties.

127
00:08:46.332 --> 00:08:50.415
For example, for
these four links, I will say,

128
00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:53.912
I will add a class, I will classify them.

129
00:08:53.912 --> 00:08:59.195
And for that, I'm not sure if you know how
to use a multi cursor without or option.

130
00:08:59.195 --> 00:09:04.631
So I can just say, for all of them,
I'm going to define a class.

131
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:07.887
I will call the class nav link.

132
00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:11.003
So it's not just any link, nav links,

133
00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:15.733
it's just a classification
that I'm creating right now.

134
00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:20.728
And for the form, I will say that when you
submit this, I will talk to an app that

135
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:25.450
we don't know what that app is,
actually it's undefined at this point.

136
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:31.002
We're going to create the global
app object later, and so

137
00:09:31.002 --> 00:09:37.365
we can call search, and
we're going to pass the event of the form.

138
00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:42.941
Again, you have also the HTML,
in case you wanna have copy and

139
00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:46.705
paste or follow along in the readme HTML.

140
00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:53.492
So if I save this and reload,
now I'm seeing something.

141
00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:57.026
Okay, yeah,
of course the CSS is already there.

142
00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:59.986
But anyway, it's just CSS, okay?

143
00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:03.663
But just with a very plain semantic HTML,

144
00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:08.402
you can just use CSS without
adding dips everywhere.

145
00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:11.778
Okay, it's just a very basic CSS.

146
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.594
Of course, you can read the CSS,
it's not really a big deal.

147
00:10:14.594 --> 00:10:16.936
For example,
let's take this part, the nav.

148
00:10:16.936 --> 00:10:19.520
So let's go to CSS and
understand how that works.

149
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.299
So when we go to the style css and
we search here,

150
00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:27.376
we have a header with some info,
and there is a nav.

151
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:31.286
So the nav URL, it says, display flex.

152
00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:38.007
So that's how they are organized,
one besides the other.

153
00:10:38.007 --> 00:10:45.076
Then there is a gap of 1.5 rem,
that's the gap we have here, okay?

154
00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:48.403
Then inside every nav we have a link.

155
00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:50.421
The link is using a color.

156
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:53.923
By the way,
do you all know what these bars are from?

157
00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:56.210
Or what do they mean?

158
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.140
I mean, you can guess for
the keyword bar, but it's a variable.

159
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.979
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A variable, too.

160
00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:02.512
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And it's a color.

161
00:11:02.512 --> 00:11:06.105
So at the top, I have a list of colors.

162
00:11:06.105 --> 00:11:10.374
So my color palette is actually
defined as CSS variables.

163
00:11:10.374 --> 00:11:16.839
So then we can use these variables
without copy and pasting the color.

164
00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:18.721
So it's actually pretty cool.

165
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:23.183
So we have variables now in CSS and
on hover, if I'm changing, for

166
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.690
example, the highlight color,
so when you hover,

167
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.649
you see that other color and you can
get the pretty easily with something.

168
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:38.014
Now, of course, if I click there,

00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:38.906
