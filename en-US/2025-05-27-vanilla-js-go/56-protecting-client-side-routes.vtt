00:00:00.798 --> 00:00:04.385
So to solve the problem,
we need to think about this.

2
00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:09.462
Let's talk about from a route point
of view, maybe I wanna add something

3
00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:14.578
like this,
Like a flag in some routes saying hey,

4
00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:19.874
for that route, you need to be logged in,
you need to be authenticated.

5
00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:21.418
Does it make sense?

6
00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:25.563
So and then how to deal with this?

7
00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:27.744
It's not really complicated,

8
00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:31.468
from the router we are not we
need to change our router.

9
00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:36.633
In our router, remember the Go part was
the one that is, was making the magic,

10
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:40.561
at some point, it recognized
that there is a page element.

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.053
Okay, to we need to go to a page element,
so

12
00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:49.293
at some point you will find that
we do have a page element, okay?

13
00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:55.004
So if we do have a page element, we
actually need to check before going there.

14
00:00:55.004 --> 00:01:02.311
So before saying that you wanna go we need
to check if we have access to it, okay.

15
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:05.951
So what does that mean?

16
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:10.830
So for example, where do we
know that we have a page to go,

17
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.506
or we have, we have already find the page.

18
00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:20.802
For example, after these four, after
this we know if we have a page, okay?

19
00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:25.676
So we know if page element exists, so

20
00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:31.022
if exist is we have a page from browsers,

21
00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:36.055
but now we need to verify check first is

22
00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:41.589
if it has the property logged in, right.

23
00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:46.574
And if it's true, it needs a property and

24
00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:51.987
needs to be true, and
also, if it's the user

25
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:56.841
is the current logged in state is false.

26
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:00.655
So if those conditions are true,

27
00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:06.377
it means the route needs
an authenticated user and

28
00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:10.069
the user is not authenticated.

29
00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.909
Does it make sense?

30
00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.527
So if that's the case,
I'm not going to that page.

31
00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:20.668
What do I need to do?

32
00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:24.237
I need to go to the library page and

33
00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:28.835
just return, just get out of here, okay.

34
00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:32.246
Again, this part of the condition is
asking for the current logging status.

35
00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:36.400
This is false, so
it means you're not logged in and

36
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.112
it means that the current route that
we have chat found needs to log in.

37
00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:46.216
The problem is that this is page element,
and

38
00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:51.076
actually we have the logged
in property in the route,

39
00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:57.462
not in the page element, okay, so
in R, so there is a situation here.

40
00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:02.850
I'm not sure if you
understand what's going on,

41
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.405
but the R is the route, so
the route is actually this object.

42
00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:16.721
Login is a property of the route,
not of the component, okay, makes sense?

43
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.863
So the problem is that the route,

44
00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:24.915
the router here is if we
are looping through routes and

45
00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:28.746
then we are storing only the component.

46
00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:33.614
So we can do a dirty trick,
really dirty trick,

47
00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:36.536
saying that, for example,

48
00:03:36.536 --> 00:03:42.034
the R component dot logged
in is equals to R logged in.

49
00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:46.994
This is a very dirty C the trick,
to be honest,

50
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:52.094
and if not,
it's as simple as creating a flag.

51
00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:56.075
Let needs login equals to false, and

52
00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:00.571
then we just say needs
login is equals to if

53
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:05.451
the current route has
a logged in property and

54
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:09.056
that logged in property is true.

55
00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:13.420
Well I'm not just saying
logged in because if it's

56
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.089
undefined it will say undefined and
I prefer boolean so

57
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.854
I'm saying if it's equals, equals true.

58
00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:25.107
So it must be true if not,
it's gonna be false, so

59
00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:30.232
then I don't need this page element login,
I can just say if it's need login.

60
00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:36.008
I think that's probably easier to
understand, so if I need login and

61
00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:40.602
the user is not logged in,
let's go to the login page.

62
00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:44.518
You're not going to see the account page,
okay, makes sense.?

63
00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:48.766
So now let's try this, first.,

64
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:54.334
if I refresh, I'm still seeing my account,

65
00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:59.168
so let's see why is this happening, so

66
00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:05.028
if I am asking,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: App.store.login

67
00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:10.099
is giving me true,
which is not true, actually, right?

68
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.430
Because if I log out, okay,
now it's giving me false,

69
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.888
so now it's working, so
it was a still in memory I think.

70
00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:24.776
So if I go to my account,
I'm still seeing that, okay?

71
00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:30.502
But logged in is false, so
let's debug this to see what's going on,

72
00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:35.655
first, let's look at application,
I'm setting the null.

73
00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:42.059
We should check just in case what happens
in our store when we are checking here.

74
00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:47.329
This is not null, so it should tell me,
okay, false, which is okay now,

75
00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:52.951
so it's okay, it's giving me false,
okay, so it's false, always false.

76
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:58.658
So it's okay, we are not logged in,
but we shouldn't be seeing this,

77
00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:02.096
so for that, let's go back to the router.

78
00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:09.105
So we need to debug this,
this is the route we can do this

79
00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.144
Actually, yeah,
I know why we have it back.

80
00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:24.589
Because actually we need to do this
only if it matches the string,

81
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:29.627
or actually before the break,
because it's not so

82
00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:37.970
gonna work, because I was actually taking
the logged in property of the last route.

83
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:42.285
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That
does it make sense?

84
00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:48.205
So if it's the selector route,
I need to check that,

85
00:06:48.205 --> 00:06:53.874
in fact,
we can actually even add a debugger here.

86
00:06:53.874 --> 00:07:00.752
So if I refresh now, it's stopping there,
needs login is true, okay?

87
00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:05.794
So it recognize that you get
into the account because

88
00:07:05.794 --> 00:07:10.499
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to get the account.

89
00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:15.841
So let's add some watches here so
we know already that

90
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:20.947
needs login,
it's true now let's add App Store,

91
00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:26.424
logged in as another watch,
and it's giving me true.

92
00:07:26.424 --> 00:07:32.043
So we have a problem here,
why it's giving me true,

93
00:07:32.043 --> 00:07:36.661
if technically I shouldn't be logged in.

94
00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:40.921
So when I'm loading the page, for
some reason it's giving me true, so

95
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:42.770
we have problem there, okay.

96
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.294
Does it make sense?

97
00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:49.393
So that's why, if I continue
executing this, at some point,

98
00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:54.989
it showed me the page, because it
thinks that I'm logged in, okay.

99
00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:56.710
Does it make sense?

100
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.870
So App Store logged in
gives me true initially,

101
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.140
now it's, but
you can see it's giving me true.

102
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.266
So if you look at the store,
it should give me false,

103
00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:13.644
because actually JWT is null, and

104
00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:18.317
if you look at that null,
it's a little weird.

105
00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:22.894
Can you can you spot
something on that null?

106
00:08:22.894 --> 00:08:25.037
&gt;&gt; Student 1: It's a string and not null.

107
00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:28.589
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's
a string half quote, why is that?

108
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:31.125
Does anyone know?

109
00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:32.448
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Came from local storage?

110
00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:33.086
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Sorry, what?

111
00:08:33.086 --> 00:08:34.645
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Came from local storage.

112
00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:38.719
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It came from
local storage, that's correct, so

113
00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:43.674
when we were here reading the item,
we We're storing null.

114
00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:49.066
So that was a problem,
we should check what's going on.

115
00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:52.957
When we are saving,
actually the problem is here,

116
00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:57.853
we are setting the I bin, so
we should check if the value is null.

117
00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:04.636
I don't need to set null because it's
saving the null value as a string.

118
00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:05.780
Does it make sense?

119
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.580
So do I have a way to remove this?

120
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.127
Have remove item, so
we remove the JWT instead of saving

121
00:09:15.127 --> 00:09:20.331
the null because local
storage works with strings.

122
00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:25.301
So now to run this again,
one good way to do that is to go

123
00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:29.952
to application, storage,
and clear site data.

124
00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:33.488
So let's start from scratch, okay?

125
00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:39.624
So if I start from scratch, now,
logged in is false, needs login is true.

126
00:09:39.624 --> 00:09:46.111
So if I continue this,
I need to remove my debuggers,

127
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:50.156
it's going to the login screen.

128
00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:55.020
So let's remove the debuggers that we
have in the router, have one here.

129
00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:01.096
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Think it's
the only one, so let's do that again.

130
00:10:01.096 --> 00:10:06.072
If I go to the Home,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So

131
00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:10.351
if I go to the Home, it works, I can
get into the details, which it works,

132
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:14.580
if I go to My Account, it's not going
to account, it's going to log in.

133
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.215
If I log in
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It goes

134
00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:25.477
to My Account, now, let's do the process
again, I'm going to the home, it works.

135
00:10:25.477 --> 00:10:29.902
I'm getting here, I'm going to my account,
and now I'm logged in,

136
00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:33.588
so it's not sending me to the login form,
it's working.

137
00:10:33.588 --> 00:10:37.661
If I log out, and
now I try to go to My Account,

138
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:43.146
it's sending me to the login screen,
so now it's working.

139
00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:49.756
So now we can create as many pages as
we want and mark them as needs login.

140
00:10:49.756 --> 00:10:54.252
For example, favorites and
watch list will have that.

141
00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.820
That's the next and
final step for our project.
