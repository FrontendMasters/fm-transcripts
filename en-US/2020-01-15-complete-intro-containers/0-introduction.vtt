1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.071
Containers are really exciting to me.

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:06.278
I started working for Azure, the cloud
provider, and so as part of that job,

3
00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:09.030
I work a lot on the day-to-day
with containers.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.170
And so for my job, I had to really dive
in and figure out how containers work,

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.490
how to best serve developers and
engineers using containers.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.920
And so I wanted to share some
of that knowledge with you all.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.967
So let's go ahead and dive in.

8
00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.060
I'm gonna click on the Introduction.

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.400
So just another kind
of housekeeping thing,

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.610
you'll see it here it says,
Welcome-Introduction.

11
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.530
You can see here that it corresponds
to the Welcome section and

12
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.760
the introduction part, cool.

13
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.090
So my course objective at this end of
this is to kinda demystify containers for

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.750
you and make you feel like
they're more accessible.

15
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.232
So that was part of my
problem with containers,

16
00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:49.724
I felt like they were
an infrastructure thing.

17
00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:54.055
I'm a front end engineer or let's just go
with JavaScript engineer these days, and

18
00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:57.532
so I felt containers were something for
the office people and not for

19
00:00:57.532 --> 00:00:58.520
the engineer.

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.620
And so I just kind of never
approached it cuz I had that kind of

21
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.510
conception in my mind.

22
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.362
And so my course objective in this is
to kind of breakdown that barrier for

23
00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.354
all of you so that containers are
accessible to anyone that's doing any sort

24
00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:09.263
of engineering work.

25
00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:13.715
And I think that can be useful to everyone
from the deepest part of operations all

26
00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:15.450
the way to designers, right?

27
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.339
I think that the containers can be useful
to the entire spectrum of people here.

28
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:23.440
So I'm gonna tell you that this is gonna
come from an engineering perspective,

29
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.435
because that's my background, is front-end
engineering and then eventually Node.js

30
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:30.600
back-end engineering and
kind of everything in between.

31
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.803
But I think this can be
useful to everybody.

32
00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:36.594
And if you've followed
any of my courses before,

33
00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:38.374
you know the way that I
like to break things down.

34
00:01:38.374 --> 00:01:42.354
So I like to break go down directly
into what makes something work, and

35
00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.250
then kind of build up from there.

36
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.404
And show you all the tools, and
what problems they solve are.

37
00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:47.827
So that's exactly what we're gonna do,

38
00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:49.420
we're gonna build
containers by hand first.

39
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.353
So who are you?
It's aimed at a developer demographic.

40
00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:58.624
That is again, not to say that
it can't be used by anyone else.

41
00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:02.620
This course does assume like a little
bit of Linux knowledge, right?

42
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.540
So I assume that you know
how to change directory and

43
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.090
the very kind of basic Linux sort
of interactions to command link.

44
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.728
So if this is your first
interaction with the command line,

45
00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:17.262
you'll probably still be able to follow
along but you may not get this much out of

46
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.935
it 'cuz you'll be learning
command line as you go as well.

47
00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:24.822
I would suggest taking Jim Young's class
for the masters with the full stack

48
00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:29.550
engineering which they just dropped
V2 of that, which is great.

49
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.850
Jim is my co-worker from Netflix.

50
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.018
So I love him.

51
00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:36.160
He goes over in depth with bash
types of interactions, and so

52
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.424
that'll be very helpful
if that's new to you.

53
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.590
What else?

54
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.061
So you can see here I have my Mac,
I'll be doing this on the Mac.

55
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:51.280
I've tested everything on Windows, and
I actually have a Windows laptop here.

56
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.280
So if anyone watching this live has
any questions about Windows stuff,

57
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.332
please feel free to ask.

58
00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:58.843
And we can switch over to Windows mode and
figure this out together.

59
00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:02.193
If you're on Mac or if you're on Linux,

60
00:03:02.193 --> 00:03:05.846
everything should just
be fine ready to go.

61
00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:07.546
All you need to do is install Docker.

62
00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:12.110
If you're on Windows 10, there's a couple
extra steps that you might need to go to.

63
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.190
If you have Windows Professional, and
it's key that it's Professional, not Home.

64
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.950
Professional, I'll suggest
that you install WSL 2.

65
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.380
But you can see here I
have a link to do that.

66
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.757
That stands for Windows subsystem for
Linux and it's the second version of it.

67
00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:31.760
It allows you to run like Linux
directly inside of Windows.

68
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.270
It's really cool to have my
favorite features of Windows.

69
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.234
And then there is a preview
release of Docker that will

70
00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:42.439
connect you into WSL from Docker or
from WSL.

71
00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.880
If you do not have Windows Professional or
you don't wanna set up the USL too,

72
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.983
cuz it's kinda annoying to
set up if we're being honest,

73
00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:54.764
then you need to download VirtualBox.

74
00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:57.721
And VirtualBox and instead of a Ubuntu VM.

75
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:01.700
And I have set up instructions here,
so if you click on this,

76
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.522
this will just take you to
the readme of the class repo, and

77
00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:09.210
you can see here I have some
instructions for everyone.

78
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.660
And if you have Windows Home,
then you can follow this blog post here.

79
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.175
Which is just a article
that someone wrote.

80
00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:25.139
If you wanna get ahead of the curve and
you have Docker running, just go ahead and

81
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.770
pull all of these images.

82
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.590
This will just save you some time later
when we're getting to this point so

83
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.330
you don't have to wait for
these containers to download.

84
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.654
You can also do at the time too,
there's no rush to as well.

85
00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.999
Lastly, if you're on Windows and
you know PowerShell very well,

86
00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:46.540
I think everything in here can be
done almost as is from PowerShell.

87
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.420
I don't know PowerShell,
I know I work at Microsoft.

88
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.830
But, yeah, I don't know PowerShell.

89
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.680
But I do know at least the Docker
commands work as is from PowerShell.

90
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.616
So that one kind of do at your own risk
because if you have questions about it I

91
00:05:02.616 --> 00:05:03.750
cannot answer them.

92
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.870
Okay, so that was set up instructions.

93
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.190
So we have a bunch of mini
projects in this class.

94
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.898
So it's a bunch of very small sections.

95
00:05:16.898 --> 00:05:22.032
So for the most part you can skip over
something if it's not interesting to you.

96
00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:27.216
And then here, in this repo, if you click
here, this will take you to a GitHub repo.

97
00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:31.450
And here all of the solutions to all
of the various different problems.

98
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.340
So feel free to clone this if you like.

99
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.310
Or you can just click in here and
reference this particular project,

100
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.235
that's kind of up to you as well.

101
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.204
All right.

102
00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:52.210
For your computer, I would suggest
having at least 8 gigabytes of RAM.

103
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.482
Containers can eat up a lot of resources,
particularly for not careful about it.

104
00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:58.480
I think this would be possible,
this computer here has 8 GB so

105
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.258
I can guarantee that everything
works well with 8 gigs.

106
00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:04.324
And I think you could get by with 4 GB.

107
00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:06.336
Good luck.

108
00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:11.395
[LAUGH] And the last thing is,
if you're on

109
00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:15.231
something that is bandwidth limited, this
course is gonna use a lot of bandwidth.

110
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:19.310
Cuz we're just gonna be pulling and
pushing images and stuff like that.

111
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.147
So just be aware that if you have if
you're in a bandwidth limited situation,

112
00:06:23.147 --> 00:06:24.396
that would be a concern.

113
00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:29.250
All right, where to file issues?

114
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.967
This is all an open source repo on GitHub.

115
00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:34.880
So I will drop to a link right
there that you can go and

116
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.620
file issues or open pull requests.

117
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.326
I very much encourage that it helps to
keep the course fresh and useful for

118
00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:42.004
everybody.

119
00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:45.642
So who am I?

120
00:06:45.642 --> 00:06:49.340
That's me in Paris like
two years drinking a beer.

121
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.140
It's a very large beer, was very good.

122
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.227
Thank you [LAUGH].

123
00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:54.604
My name is Brian.

124
00:06:54.604 --> 00:06:58.153
I do work at Microsoft Visual Studio Code,

125
00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:02.430
as well as I manage
JavaScript across Azure.

126
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.975
So I'm now a program manager, which is
just means that I read a lot of emails and

127
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.170
attend a lot of meetings.

128
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.386
But for most of my career, I've been a
senior JavaScript staff, Node.JS engineer.

129
00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:17.816
I've done that at LinkedIn, Netflix,
Reddit, and a couple other places as well.

130
00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:20.700
I'm also on the board for Vets Who Code.

131
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.639
I'm not a vet, but I quite appreciate
the stuff that they do, so

132
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.951
I really like that charity.

133
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.040
So I encourage you to take
a look at that as well.

134
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.832
And feel free to catch up with me
on Twitter, GitHub or LinkedIn.

135
00:07:33.832 --> 00:07:39.100
If you add me on any one of those
social networks I was except those.

136
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.990
And this course was created and
funded by Fronted Masters.

137
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.422
I am infinitely grateful for
them they give me time and

138
00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:51.878
incentive and we love Frontend Masters.

139
00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:56.038
And they let me open source the materials
as well to share that to everyone, so

140
00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:58.150
that everyone can take these courses.

141
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.817
And then yeah, I get to come film
these videos and it's nice even,

142
00:08:02.817 --> 00:08:05.222
when it's really cold
outside here in Minneapolis.

143
00:08:05.222 --> 00:08:09.660
[LAUGH] All right.

144
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.380
And as always,

145
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.840
it's very nice when people start the repo
on GitHub cuz it feeds my vanity.

146
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.300
That's mostly all that is.

147
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.500
No, it helps kind of
like surface the repo so

148
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.750
that other people can find it and
use the repo as well
