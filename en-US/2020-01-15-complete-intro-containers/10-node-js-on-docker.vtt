1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.820
So we're gonna move on to node.js on
Docker because I'm a node developer and

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.550
that's what I like, and so
you're stuck cuz I have the microphone.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.090
But pretty much everything that
I'm gonna teach you here, one,

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.820
you don't really need
to know Node that much.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.720
I'm gonna give you all of the code and not
necessarily expect you to understand it.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.930
And two, this could be applied to Ruby,
it could be applied to Go, it could be

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.590
applied to Java, Cobalt, Pearl,
I don't know, whatever suits your fancy.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.090
I'm not gonna shame.

9
00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.408
But just to kind of start getting
into some of these other flavors of

10
00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:32.932
containers that might be useful to you,
in particular,

11
00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.528
the node one because we are gonna
be using that one all day.

12
00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:42.130
So we're here in MacOS mode right now.

13
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.115
And I'm gonna say docker run dash it.

14
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.931
And I'm gonna say node,

15
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:52.650
which isn't the official node container
that Docker certifies as official.

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.810
These are actually built by
a company called NodeSource,

17
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.130
wonderful people that do
really great node consulting.

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.456
And they make wonderful containers,

19
00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:04.730
they're experts in it, that's why I
rely on them and I don't do it myself.

20
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.230
And then here, if I did node,
this would run latest,

21
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.160
which I think would be the same as
what I'm gonna tell you to do now.

22
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.008
But again,
I wanna kind of freeze in time, right?

23
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.709
Just like you pin your dependencies
before you send them in production,

24
00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.518
that's why I'm gonna give
you the correct tag here.

25
00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:25.310
So I wanna run node 12, and then I want it
to be tied specifically to Debian stretch.

26
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.098
So I'm gonna say 12 dash stretch.

27
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.374
So actually, that looks like
I don't have that locally, so

28
00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:35.960
it's actually gonna go out and pull that.

29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.682
&gt;&gt; Could you help me understand what do
you mean by tying node to Debian stretch?

30
00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:41.217
&gt;&gt; Sure.

31
00:01:43.064 --> 00:01:47.279
So whenever you run a Docker container,

32
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.260
There's multiple versions of
things going to it, right?

33
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.895
And the thing that I'm gonna care in this
particular case with the node image,

34
00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.255
the two things that I really care about
the versions of is I care about what

35
00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.696
version of Linux it's on and I care
what version of Node it's on, right?

36
00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:05.580
So the 12, that's node 12,
that makes sense.

37
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.200
Stretch is tying it to
a specific version of Debian,

38
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.380
which I believe is Debian seven.

39
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.530
Don't quote me on that,
cuz I don't really know Debian very well.

40
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.880
Now, why are we doing
Debian versus Ubuntu?

41
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.550
That is just what they build
the Node images with, right?

42
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.170
I think you can get it on Bionic and
other versions of Ubuntu,

43
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.840
but by default it's on Debian.

44
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.905
&gt;&gt; It is kind of like
a mash up on those two.

45
00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so actually literally the next
session I'll be talking about tags,

46
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.050
which is what this is.

47
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.170
But suffice to say it's arbitrary.

48
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.480
So whoever creates the container
chooses what the tags are called.

49
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.850
So they could have called
it stretch dash 12.

50
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.156
They could have called it
whatever they wanted to.

51
00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:42.170
That makes sense?

52
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Cool.

53
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.030
&gt;&gt; So
stretch is just a name does not have any?

54
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.570
&gt;&gt; It's a really easy way to remember
the version of Debian, right?

55
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.625
Again, like I can't remember what the
numbers of what Debian version we're on,

56
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.824
but I know that Stretch is the latest one,
latest LTS, that is.

57
00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:00.620
Does that make sense?

58
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wasn't sure if Stretch
was a term for latest or something.

59
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.440
&gt;&gt; It's not, no,
it's specifically for Debian.

60
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.905
It's like we've been using Ubuntu Bionic
this whole time, right, which is 18.04,

61
00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.790
that's what Stretch is for Debian.

62
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.325
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yep.

63
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:22.440
So we got, looks like two more layers that
it's gonna download here very quickly.

64
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.828
&gt;&gt; Brian, do you want us to
download this image, too?

65
00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:26.371
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably.

66
00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:30.835
Yes, the answer's yes cuz we'll
use it several times throughout

67
00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:31.497
the rest of the course.

68
00:03:34.503 --> 00:03:37.781
Then, it has to go extract everything and
then reapply everything, so

69
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.625
it takes a bit of processing.

70
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:44.388
So okay, we downloaded the image,
it pulled it and executed it, and

71
00:03:44.388 --> 00:03:47.606
now it drops us into some sort of REPL,
right?

72
00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:51.495
REPL being like a, god,
what does REPL stand for?

73
00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:52.109
I'm sure someone here knows.

74
00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:56.670
Anyway, it stands for something, R-E-P-L.

75
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.970
I'm sure there's nine people on
the chat saying it stands for this.

76
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.070
&gt;&gt; Read, Evalue, Print, Loop.

77
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.276
&gt;&gt; Yep, Read, Evaluate,
Print, Loop, there it is.

78
00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:14.160
And surprise, it's a JavaScript, right?

79
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.030
So I can say console dot log x, right?

80
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.230
And it'll do that, or
2 plus 2, whatever, right?

81
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.850
So this dropped us into the node REPL
inside of a Debian Stretch Linux, right?

82
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.300
Which may or
may not be what you're expecting.

83
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.350
But like I said, the container gets to
define what command actually gets run.

84
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.540
So this drops up into a REPL, which stands
for read, execute, print, and loop, right?

85
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.310
For node js.

86
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.050
So if I just say something like console
dot log x, it's gonna log out x, right?

87
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.030
Normal JavaScripty kinda stuff, right?

88
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.670
If you just do it on your computer and
you just write node,

89
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.470
this is what it does for you.

90
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.949
Like I was telling you before,
the containers themselves get to decide.

91
00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.505
If I don't specify command,
which you can see up here, right there,

92
00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:05.090
I didn't specify a command, right?

93
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.130
So it does whatever it defaults to,
in this case, it's like I'm gonna

94
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.990
put you into the node REPL because I've no
idea what you actually want to do, okay?

95
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.090
So that's what this does here.

96
00:05:16.578 --> 00:05:17.410
I see the exit.

97
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:20.901
There we go.

98
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:23.636
So hit Ctrl+C twice,
that'll get you out of the REPL.

99
00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:27.733
And then, it finishes
the container at that point, right,

100
00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:29.570
because that's the CMD that
it was designed to do.

101
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.640
But if I actually wanna be dropped
into just the Linux part of it,

102
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.230
I can say bash, right?

103
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.690
And now, I'm inside of this container.

104
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.990
But as opposed to the other ones,
first of all, if I say cat /etc/issue,

105
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.890
you can see I'm on, looks like it's
Debin nine is what stretch is.

106
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.555
I was wrong, I thought it was seven.

107
00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:53.800
Any case,
that's what kind of Linux we're in.

108
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.560
And Ubuntu is based on Debian,
so everything's gonna feel very,

109
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.540
very familiar to you.

110
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.037
But what's cool about this one
if I say node dash v, right,

111
00:06:02.037 --> 00:06:05.195
now it has Node installed because
I got the Node container, okay?

112
00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:08.354
So you can see here, I have Node 12,
which is exactly what I asked for.

113
00:06:14.682 --> 00:06:16.418
So that's kind of fun, right?

114
00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:25.339
So again,
something I think is quite useful, too,

115
00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.250
is just knowing this cat /etc/issue thing,
right?

116
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.065
If you run Node, right, and
I just run Node like this,

117
00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:33.224
which I'm not gonna do right now.

118
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:37.940
You might not know that this is Debian,
right?

119
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.650
I don't know if it's a faulty assumption,
but

120
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.930
I just assume most things are Ubuntu
because that's what I use.

121
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.880
But in this particular case,
they decided to go with something else.

122
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.219
But this is a good way to kinda say,
okay, where am I, what am I doing,

123
00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:50.393
what's the lay of the land there?

124
00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:58.058
We'll go into later which Linux
distributions you can select.

125
00:06:58.058 --> 00:07:03.410
But I mean, the sum of the story is choose
the one that you're most comfortable with.

126
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.870
All of these are really good.

127
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.796
Red Hat Linux is a good one.

128
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.275
Mint, Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu,

129
00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:12.424
they're all valid choices just
depending what you wanna do.
