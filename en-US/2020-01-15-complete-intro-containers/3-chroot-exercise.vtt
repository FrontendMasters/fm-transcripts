00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.961
So we're gonna do an exercise together,
we're going to,

2
00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:08.440
Make cat work in this particular
scenario as well, right?

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.640
So what I'm gonna have you do is you're
gonna type, echo "my secret soda recipe"

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.740
into secret.txt like that.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.230
Here, you can see that I have
a secret.txt, right there, right?

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.780
So now if I say, chroot.tash like that,

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.340
this drop soon into my Linux
jailed process, right?

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.420
If I type ls I can see this and
if I type pwd, you can see

9
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.237
that I'm in this root directory,
can't see outside of it, right?.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.825
Now if I type cat secret.txt,
command not found, right?

11
00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:53.540
Because cat is not in here, so
that's your assignment for this exercise.
