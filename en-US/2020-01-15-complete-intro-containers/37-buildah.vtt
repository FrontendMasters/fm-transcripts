1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.003
We just talked about multi container
projects and doing Docker compose and

2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.788
Kubernetes, doing some
really cool stuff like that,

3
00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:08.738
coordinating containers together.

4
00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.066
And we're gonna go into one more section,

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.856
we're gonna leave that
entire ecosystem behind.

6
00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:17.390
And we're going to talk about
something called OCI containers.

7
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.917
And OCI stands for
open container initiative.

8
00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.861
So these are going to be
like non-Docker containers.

9
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:27.015
So we're going to do containers but
without Docker.

10
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:31.314
Cuz I want to kind of prove the point to
you that Linux containers are not just

11
00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:34.127
Docker, Docker's not
just Linux containers.

12
00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:35.880
And so
we're gonna get into this OCI stuff.

13
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.779
So we're gonna talk about two different
technologies that are paired together.

14
00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.820
One's called Buildah, one's called Podman.

15
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.230
So let's go ahead and jump into Buildah.

16
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.930
So first of all,
these tools only work in Linux.

17
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.650
So we are going to be using actually
a Docker container that contains Buildah

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.802
to make all this work, which I know
is containers within containers.

19
00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:59.570
But that's just kind
of how that all works.

20
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.422
So if you're working with Windows and WSL,
everything should just work seamlessly.

21
00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:09.987
You shouldn't have to use necessarily
the container or anything like that.

22
00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:13.750
If you're on Mac OS, you're gonna have to
jump into the Buildah container with me.

23
00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.570
So I left a link there if
you wanna go check it out.

24
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.430
That's just on Docker Hub.

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.818
So the Buildah container, which is
buildah/buildah, has both Buildah and

26
00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.900
Podman in it, you don't need both.

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.200
You don't need two different containers.

28
00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:35.925
So a lot of the gravity
around containers and

29
00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:42.341
the container world is
centered around Docker, right?

30
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:49.308
That was the first to market.

31
00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:52.154
It's kind of the centre of gravity there.

32
00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:57.256
And in effort to not necessarily be
locked into one bender, because we don't

33
00:01:57.256 --> 00:02:02.123
want just one cloud provider, or
one operating system, or just iPhone or

34
00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:06.935
just Mac, it's a good idea to have
a competitive marketplace of ideas.

35
00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:10.020
And so that's when the open container
initiative kind of came to fruition.

36
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.130
So it is a product underneath
the Linux Foundation.

37
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.210
So there's a lot of support behind it.

38
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.200
And it's a good thing to keep in
mind that Docker is a part of OCI.

39
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.868
So this is not like Docker versus OCI,
right?

40
00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:27.650
They're both competing together and

41
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.780
helping each other,
it's a very collaborative environment.

42
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.793
So it's great.

43
00:02:32.793 --> 00:02:35.986
And the other thing is that you can
build containers with Docker and

44
00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:38.000
execute them with Podman and Buildah.

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.820
And visa versa, you can build
them with Buildah and Podman and

46
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.580
execute them with Docker.

47
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.876
So these tools interrelate and

48
00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:47.380
they're compatible with each
other in that particular way.

49
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.060
So it encourages a healthy
diversity of players in the market.

50
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.745
Everybody wins here.

51
00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.814
So Buildah and
Podman are not the only projects,

52
00:02:58.814 --> 00:03:00.590
I'll talk about a couple more at the end.

53
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.682
These are just the two
that have the most steam,

54
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.677
that are kind of rolling forward that
I wanted to get in front of you.

55
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.109
And so it's kind of strange
that we're taking Docker and

56
00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.238
we're splitting it into two different
products here, Buildah and Podman.

57
00:03:15.238 --> 00:03:17.666
But in reality,
Docker is actually split the same way,

58
00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.650
you just don't actually really realize it.

59
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.710
So Docker, there's actually Docker,
which is the client.

60
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.610
Which does the building and
things like that.

61
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.080
And there's a different thing running
in the background called Dockerd,

62
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.690
which stands for Docker daemon, which is
actually what's executing the code for

63
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.760
you, or executing the containers for you.

64
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.280
And so when you say docker run something,
it sends that to the docker daemon in

65
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.280
the background and it's running that
stuff for you via the Docker daemon.

66
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.073
So even though you didn't
know that that was there,

67
00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:46.435
that's actually what's happening.

68
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.996
And that's kind of how this is
split with Buildah and Podman.

69
00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.250
Buildah is going to build
the containers for you and

70
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.459
then Podman is going to be the one
that's actually executing it for you.

71
00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.010
The advantage of Podman over Dockerd is
it's actually not running as a daemon in

72
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.396
the background,
it's actually just executes it and

73
00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:01.841
that kind of gets out of the way.

74
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.550
So let's get started with Buildah.

75
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.799
So the funny thing about
how Buildah was named,

76
00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.623
it's named how you would say
builder with a Boston accent.

77
00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:16.583
Because apparently one of the core
maintainers of this project was from

78
00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.220
Boston and he always called a buildah.

79
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.540
Which I'm not doing a very good impression
of it, because I'm not from Boston.

80
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.980
But I thought that was very funny.

81
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.970
So you can follow the instructions
to download and execute and

82
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.860
all that kind of stuff
here if you want to.

83
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.740
I'm just gonna use it
direct from the container,

84
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.950
feel free to do the same with me.

85
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.799
If you are going to install it, which
I did do within my WSL computer here,

86
00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:44.378
you will very likely need to
put here at this registry.com.

87
00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:47.850
You will probably need to put this,
which I pasted in there.

88
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.591
Again, I am going to be
using the container, so

89
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:51.993
I'm not going to do anything like that,
but you might need this.

90
00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:58.834
And you're also gonna have to make
sure you have this thing called runc,

91
00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:03.080
which is another project, again, from
this open container initiative project.

92
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.470
And runc is just say, hey, take this
container and do something with it, right?

93
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.260
Execute it in some fashion,
that's what runc is.

94
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.901
Runc underpins Buildah and Podman.

95
00:05:18.562 --> 00:05:22.958
All right, so let's go ahead and

96
00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.360
run Buildah, or the container.

97
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.050
So I'm gonna run this in my environment.

98
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.410
And this will run
the Buildah container and

99
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.069
it will mount in your current directory,
wherever you are.

100
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.041
So I'm gonna come over here to this.

101
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:45.372
Let's do the more-complicated, cd, oops,

102
00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:49.914
../more-complicated-node app.

103
00:05:49.914 --> 00:05:51.060
This is something we did with,

104
00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.490
Yeah, this is great, perfect.

105
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.180
So we'll do this one.

106
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.390
So I'm gonna run that
Docker command right there.

107
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.350
Again, if you're gonna do this via Docker,
do it this way.

108
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.070
If you're not gonna do it via Docker,
you don't need to run this.

109
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:21.519
So this is going to mount in this
directory right there, source.

110
00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:29.367
Okay, so now I'm inside of a container,
which is going to be running.

111
00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.680
Let's check, I don't even know.

112
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.143
etc/issue.

113
00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:39.611
And I'm pretty sure that this is Red Hat.

114
00:06:41.578 --> 00:06:44.256
So let's go with that,
I think this is Red Hat Linux.

115
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.866
Okay, and so now I have access to Buildah.

116
00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:58.204
Version, there you go.

117
00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:03.024
Cool?

118
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:06.155
It's a tool written in Go,
in case you were curious.
