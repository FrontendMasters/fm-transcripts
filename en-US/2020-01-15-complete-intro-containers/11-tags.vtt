WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.010
So the next thing that we're gonna
be talking about is tags, right?

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:10.158
So you can see here on the webpage
we're gonna go into Tags, under Docker.

3
00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:13.188
And so we've kind of been dancing
around the topic a little bit.

4
00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:17.916
But I wanna kinda get into depth with what
tags are, why you use them, so on and so

5
00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:18.420
forth.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.630
So you can see right there if I do
docker run -it node right there and

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.540
I leave off anything else,
any sort of qualifier for that.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.000
It implies that you're gonna
put on the latest tag, right?

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.780
And latest is one of the few tags.

10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.260
It's actually like a special tag, right?

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.472
It implies the last one that you publish.

12
00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.820
That is the latest version of
whatever you're doing, right?

13
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.070
So this is fine when
you're messing around,

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.340
kinda like what we're doing right now.

15
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.260
It's fine to just say,
cool, give me the latest,

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.808
give me whatever the newest version is.

17
00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:55.409
But whenever you're making your
environments or whenever you're

18
00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.345
doing anything like that, you wanna
have it tied to a specific version.

19
00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:03.928
Because I'm sure we've all had issues
with appendices before where they've

20
00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:05.833
half-created and stuff broke, right?

21
00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.320
We wanna avoid that.

22
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.040
That's why in this particular course
I've been very careful to give

23
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.759
you specific tags to download.

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.460
Now, you might ask, is there any sorta
rhyme or reason of how tags are made?

25
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.950
And the answer is, not really.

26
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.380
It's not like npm, where they're expecting
semantic versioning or anything like that.

27
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.180
Docker tags are much more loose, right?

28
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.545
It's whatever the author
decides to name the tags.

29
00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.790
So an example of that would
be node:8 right here, right?

30
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.950
Let's say I had something that I had
an app that dependent on node 8,

31
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.184
I can say node:8.

32
00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.670
And this will give me whatever
the latest release of 8 is,

33
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.020
which I feel much more comfortable with,
rather than the latest of whatever.

34
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.190
Now, don't do this because
Node 8 is deprecated, right?

35
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.690
It's no longer in service, right?

36
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.330
So it's not getting security fixes or
anything like that.

37
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.260
But it's still out there.

38
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.346
If you needed it, you could do that, okay?

39
00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:01.030
So let's go ahead and take a look
at the Docker Hub page for that.

40
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.222
This is the Docker Hub page for
the Node container, right?

41
00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:08.916
And everyone at any one of these
containers are all gonna have

42
00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:11.240
some sort of Docker Hub page.

43
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.620
So you can see here, these all of
the labels that exist for this, right?

44
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.810
There are a lot of node containers.

45
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.682
Now, why is that?

46
00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:23.090
You can see here you can request
a lot of very specific things, right?

47
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.902
So if I come down here,
we've been asking for

48
00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:28.650
12 stretch which is this one right there.

49
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.198
But you can see there is a lot of
different things that all refer to

50
00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:33.900
the same thing, right?

51
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.280
We could've referred to
this as erbium-stretch.

52
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.450
Because, technically,
Node 12 is the erbium release of node.

53
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.350
Not that you ever needed to know that.

54
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.767
And I totally forgot that until
I just read it right now.

55
00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.850
So it does have a name,
not just no one ever calls it that.

56
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.730
But you could refer it to as
LTS stretch which LTS is like,

57
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.600
Node 12 is the latest LTS,
right, for a Node.

58
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.790
Or you could just actually
just said node:lts, right?

59
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.580
Which have been referred to the LTS of
stretch Debian and the LTS of node.

60
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.912
I'm still not gonna recommend that though
I don't think that's a good idea because

61
00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:17.136
as that LTS rolls forward, right,
when we move on to Node 14, and Debian 10.

62
00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:21.650
Or whatever the next version of Debian
that's gonna be the next LTS, right?

63
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.420
That LTS tag is going to
roll along with it, right?

64
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.685
And if you build an app and then it's like
sitting on the shelf for five years, and

65
00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.439
then you come back to it that LTS
is gonna be very different, right?

66
00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.371
So these are the kinda things you
wanna be thinking through is like,

67
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:38.010
how can I capture this moment in time so
this doesn't break in the future?

68
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.584
That's what you wanna do with containers.

69
00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:43.430
But there's other things here, right?

70
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.170
There's stretch-slim, right?

71
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.102
So so far, we've been downloading
the full Debian, right?

72
00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:51.032
But we could say 12-stretch-slim, and

73
00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:56.182
by their definition that there's no
special definition of slim but this will

74
00:03:56.182 --> 00:04:01.550
give us a more slender version or
like a smaller version of Debian, right?

75
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.179
In general you wanna have the smallest
container possible for several reasons.

76
00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:10.002
And there's a whole section on that so
we'll get to that later but

77
00:04:10.002 --> 00:04:12.995
there's even beyond stretch, right?

78
00:04:12.995 --> 00:04:16.370
There's Jesse and Buster and these are
other versions of Debian as well, right?

79
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.813
You can also see here that
we can run in Alpine, right?

80
00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:25.151
So I can say, give me node colon,
Alpine dash, whatever, right?

81
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.440
And all those versions exists as well.

82
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.520
What else is in there?

83
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.742
There's even chakracore down here.

84
00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:36.610
Which chakracore is actually
the JavaScript engine that's baked into

85
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.900
Microsoft Edge, the old version, right?

86
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.020
And they took that and
they put that into Node.

87
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.110
So instead of running V8,

88
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.400
which is what's in Chrome,
you can actually use chakracore.

89
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.131
Now, I don't recommend that,
even as someone who works in Microsoft,

90
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:53.652
because we don't even
support Chakra anymore.

91
00:04:53.652 --> 00:04:55.740
We're moving to Chromium as well.

92
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.622
So suffice to say there's
a lot of different versions.

93
00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:01.211
And so it behooves you and

94
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:05.380
figure out exactly which versions
of what that you want, right?

95
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.810
To figure out the right tags.

96
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.520
I think the one that I gave
you is a pretty good one.

97
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.730
If you give it stretch, right?

98
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.040
If there's more security patches that
come out later you want those, right?

99
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.030
You want those to automatically be
incorporated into your containers.

100
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.340
That's why it's good dependent to stretch,
right?

101
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.261
And then I think it's good dependence to
12 because it as minor patch versions come

102
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:27.320
out, you'll probably want those as well.

103
00:05:30.183 --> 00:05:33.570
But if you wanna mess around with node 13,
you can totally do that, right?

104
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.916
So you can see there,
that's what latest is, right?

105
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:36.451
It's 13.3.0-stretch.

106
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:41.286
In case it wasn't obvious,
each one these lines,

107
00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:45.343
these are all the same container, right?

108
00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:49.223
They're all various tags for
the same container.

109
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.590
&gt;&gt; How do you decide
which one do you want?

110
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.190
I know you mentioned that
depends on your needs.

111
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.061
But is this some kinda rule of thumb?

112
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.883
I know you just mentioned that
stretch is good version, but

113
00:05:56.883 --> 00:06:00.617
does every container have sort of like,
hey, here's kinda the default one.

114
00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:03.255
When in doubt, pick this one.

115
00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:03.965
&gt;&gt; Yes.

116
00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:08.095
So I think there are good
rules of thumb for

117
00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:11.885
something like this, like a Node container
and apply to Ruby or something like that.

118
00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:17.960
I would go find the latest LTS for the
Linux that I'm on and the latest LTS for

119
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.410
the Node or go or whatever I'm on and
then tie it to that, right?

120
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.600
So that's why the 12 stretch cuz of
the two latest LTS is for both of those.

121
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.471
Now, if I'm just messing
around with something,

122
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:34.695
I'll just do latest cuz I wanna play
the latest and greatest tech, right?

123
00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:37.080
But you don't wanna ship
Node 13 right now, right?

124
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.780
That's considered
the current version of Node,

125
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.150
which means that they're experimenting and
things like that.

126
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.399
There's no promises that it's not
gonna break or anything like that.

127
00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.758
So that's why it's good to be on 12 for
your production workloads.

128
00:06:49.474 --> 00:06:53.983
&gt;&gt; So [COUGH] when, for
example, 12.13.2 comes out,

129
00:06:53.983 --> 00:06:56.743
is that another entry in this list or

130
00:06:56.743 --> 00:07:01.263
do patches get overwritten or
overwrite this kinda list?

131
00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:02.185
Star.
&gt;&gt; Right.

132
00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:05.980
&gt;&gt; Cuz it seems like there'd be even
more than this if it was every single

133
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.880
patch version ever.

134
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.842
&gt;&gt; Yeah so you can definately tie
it to a specific patch release if

135
00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:13.312
you felt that was importnat.

136
00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:14.720
I would not suggest that.

137
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.021
&gt;&gt; Right.
I guess I was mostly asking,

138
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:20.036
cuz if you created it with 12.13.1,

139
00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:28.252
Do you just want us to say 12,
I guess is my question,

140
00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:32.700
the major version, and
then leave off the minor and patch?

141
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.821
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I tied it to 12.10, right,
or whatever, we're on right now, 12.13.

142
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:46.840
So if I did 12.13,
it would bump up to 0.4, right?

143
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.159
But it would not bump up to 12.14, right?

144
00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.469
It would keep it on 13.

145
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:53.767
So there are more versions
here that are not even listed.

146
00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:54.890
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

147
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.986
&gt;&gt; Yep.

148
00:07:56.986 --> 00:07:58.383
It's important stuff for
you to know, right?

149
00:07:58.383 --> 00:08:00.915
It's important stuff to know how to
tie it to the correct versions of what

150
00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:01.670
you're expecting.

151
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.164
And every Docker Page is
gonna have these for you.

152
00:08:09.484 --> 00:08:13.038
So there are people that would disagree
with me, like I do 12 stretch,

153
00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:16.769
there are people that would say
just do 12.13, right, dash stretch,

154
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:19.180
cuz they would keep it to
the same minor version.

155
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.490
I think everyone would universally agree,
it's a good idea to let patches roll

156
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.239
forward no matter what, because that
means you'll get the security patches.

157
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.830
I would assert that I've never had a minor
version of Node break what I'm doing.

158
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.170
They're pretty good about
major versioning with Node,

159
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.314
so I have a lot of trust in them.

160
00:08:38.314 --> 00:08:43.849
And I work with them at Microsoft and
they're very careful about it.
