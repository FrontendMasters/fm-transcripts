1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.750
You definitely can just go ahead and
use node alpine,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.920
it's 80 megabytes which is nothing, for
your production projects, always do that.

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.560
Now we're gonna be dumb and we're gonna go
make our own node alpine image because I

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.360
wanna show you how to do it,
how to set up all these different things.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.310
So, what we're actually gonna try and
do is we're gonna try and

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.450
get that 80 megabytes down even further so
you can get down to 50 megabytes.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.450
Let's do it.

8
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.267
Let's be ridiculous.

9
00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.636
So we're still in alpine-linux here,
we're in 12-alpine right here.

10
00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:38.508
And what I want you to do instead
of saying node 12-alpine,

11
00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:40.821
I want you to say alpine:3.10.

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.119
So, if I come in here and
say docker inspect alpine:3.10,

13
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.517
this is way easier if
I just colorize that.

14
00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:04.114
You can see here,
this is in bytes maybe, so,

15
00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:09.257
yeah, this is five point
six-ish megabytes.

16
00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:12.060
Pretty small, right?

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.207
That's significantly smaller than the 80
that we had coming from our other

18
00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:20.481
application from node alpine, and it just
includes some more node nicety stuff

19
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:24.217
like some good idea stuff that
you're probably gonna want on there.

20
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:30.649
Just include some of the stuff like that,
which for the most part you're gonna want.

21
00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.925
The node source people and

22
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.450
the near form is the other company
that works on these kinda things.

23
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.780
Take pretty good care to make sure
that these are as small as possible.

24
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.840
So, trust them because they're probably
better at docker than maybe you are,

25
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.410
I'm not gonna say that, but
they're definitely better than I am.

26
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.738
And if you're for
whatever reason listening to me,

27
00:01:47.738 --> 00:01:50.165
so let me proxy that goodwill to them.

28
00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:52.619
Or maybe you don't like me, I don't know,
then you can hate them too.

29
00:01:56.043 --> 00:02:01.107
So, we're gonna do from alpine:3.10 here,
and what we're gonna

30
00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:06.004
do is we're gonna say RUN apk which
is the name of the package manager,

31
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:10.360
not Android stuff,
if you're coming from Android.

32
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.530
APK is the Alpine Package Manager.

33
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.841
Add, I'm gonna say --update me which just
means run updates first before you, make

34
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:25.650
sure you're getting the latest versions
of these, and get nodejs and get npm.

35
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.259
Now we could tie this to versions, for

36
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.332
now I'm just gonna show
you how to do it this way.

37
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:39.235
Cool and for now I think that's actually
all we need to do to get all this running,

38
00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:41.529
I don't think we need to do anything else.

39
00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.576
And let's try this again.

40
00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:48.015
We have to run a build.

41
00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.142
So it's actually able to do this
pretty quickly it looks like.

42
00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:11.765
And again, this probably should be
enough that if we took a look at it.

43
00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:15.293
Let's just do my-node-app.

44
00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:21.299
Right there.

45
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.627
We're up to about 85.

46
00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:25.391
I guess that sounds about right.

47
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.283
So let's actually just restart
this entire Docker file.

48
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.676
All right.

49
00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:35.193
So we just add the FROM alpine:3.10,

50
00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:39.402
RUN apk, node npm and
we're gonna run this again.

51
00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:46.845
And now, if we inspect, take a look at
what this is, so this ends up being,

52
00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:49.168
there you go, about 50 megabytes.

53
00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:53.242
Just to get Alpine and NodeJs and
NPM, all on the same box.

54
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.364
Now, Alpine by default, doesn't
necessarily have the node user installed.

55
00:04:01.364 --> 00:04:06.666
That was something that the node
distribution is doing for us,

56
00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:12.780
so we have to do that for ourselves,
so we're gonna do RUN addgroup-S.

57
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.022
Again, this is something I
could never remember by myself.

58
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:18.441
I always have to Google,
how do I add user to LINUX.

59
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.053
I don't know,
it's just never something I can remember.

60
00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:26.147
So we're gonna just copy their best
practices and we're gonna add a user

61
00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:31.255
called node and we're going to add
user -S node, and in the group node.

62
00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:38.368
So now, this has added a user called node.

63
00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:41.322
And here we can say USER node.

64
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.582
And here we can say build.

65
00:04:59.248 --> 00:04:59.922
Did I miss one?

66
00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:01.691
Adduser, sorry.

67
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.500
Adduser right there.

68
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.456
This was saying add not found.

69
00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:09.893
It's adduser.

70
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.041
All right, now try it again.

71
00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.045
There we go.

72
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:19.028
Now if I say, node app right there, and

73
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:24.013
I say whoamI, should say node, cool.

74
00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:28.264
&gt;&gt; Brian, where did you specify what
version of node do you wanna get?

75
00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:32.573
&gt;&gt; So, I didn't,
here you would do it with apk.

76
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.604
Just for now we're not gonna worry about
it cuz this is something that you would

77
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:38.192
never really do.

78
00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.459
But we can see what version it is.

79
00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.474
So we can say node-- version.

80
00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:47.022
Hopefully it's 12, no, it's 10.

81
00:05:51.112 --> 00:05:54.157
And I think there is some nomenclature for

82
00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:59.030
this, you would say like,
at 10.16 or something like that.

83
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.470
I am not actually sure.

84
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.992
But it would be in there.

85
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:04.838
Again this is from Alpine, so
I don't know Alpine at all.

86
00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:19.266
So, Now is wherever you wanna go back and

87
00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:25.231
add all of our stuff back that we
had before which is USER node,

88
00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:28.472
RUN mkdir /home/node/code.

89
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:36.550
Then you wanna do WORKDIR /home/node/code,

90
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.086
COPY chown node node pack.

91
00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:45.627
I mean, you can literally copy this
from the last one that we used to have,

92
00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:47.982
package lock.json package.json.

93
00:06:47.982 --> 00:06:50.626
I'm gonna copy that to ./.

94
00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:54.460
Then we're going to RUN npm CI.

95
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.101
As you can see here,
whitespace is totally arbitrary.

96
00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:59.947
And I have no good reason for
any of it that I'm doing right now.

97
00:06:59.947 --> 00:07:05.575
And I'm saying COPY --chown node:node,
and.

98
00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:09.787
to copy everything else
into the same directory.

99
00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:15.215
I'm going to say CMD node index.js.

100
00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:20.584
So, let's go back and build this again.

101
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:23.664
And let's run it.

102
00:07:28.017 --> 00:07:30.046
So the link.

103
00:07:32.648 --> 00:07:34.406
There we go, still running but

104
00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:38.338
with a Alpine container that we're
continuing to build ourselves.

105
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:43.223
So all said and done, to see if we
actually saved yourself any space,

106
00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:44.707
I'm not actually sure we did.

107
00:07:44.707 --> 00:07:50.898
Docker inspect my-node-app.

108
00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:55.774
Pipe to jq to get some colors
because it's a lot easier to read.

109
00:07:57.787 --> 00:07:58.490
There you go.

110
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.612
So we got down to about 56 megabytes-ish.

111
00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:03.218
We can go lower.

112
00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:03.718
[LAUGH]
