00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.652
So I'm gonna type exit to get out of this.

2
00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:07.961
So now I'm back in my normal environment,
and

3
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:14.270
then the first thing I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna say ldd/bin/cat.

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.750
You can ignore this one.

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.165
It has this one and this one.

6
00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:22.380
And I'm actually pretty sure that
we already copied both of these.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.635
So if I go into my new root ls lib,

8
00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:32.806
it's asking for libc.so.6 which is here.

9
00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:38.265
And if I do lib64,
it has for so.2, it does.

10
00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.375
So we actually don't
have to copy anything.

11
00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.245
They're already there.

12
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:47.092
So the only thing I have to do now is
I have to copy from /bin/cat into bin.

13
00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:54.678
And so now if I look inside of bin,
you can see here I have cat as well.

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.551
So now if I do change root bin per size,
bash like that,

15
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.635
to go back into my jailed process.

16
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.710
I can see, I type ls, that works and
now if I type cat secret.txt,

17
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.110
it tells you my secret soda recipe.

18
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.950
&gt;&gt; So then, it has the binaries that
you need to each copy over, got it.

19
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.070
And then it will use
the libraries that you copied.

20
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.163
&gt;&gt; Exactly, because it cannot reach
outside of the jailed process

21
00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:30.140
to be able to reach the other binaries.

22
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.940
It's totally locked off.

23
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.520
So anything that you don't put in
here doesn't get put in there at all.

24
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.975
&gt;&gt; So when you run LDD and it kind
of lists the different requirements,

25
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.350
why were we able to ignore
the first one again?

26
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.913
&gt;&gt; I will tell you, so if I do l bin cat,
so you can see this one right here?

27
00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:47.413
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

28
00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.869
&gt;&gt; If you're asking for the actual
reason of why we can't ignore it,

29
00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.683
I don't actually know,
to be honest with you.

30
00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.416
I just know that if it doesn't give you
a fully qualified path like it does like

31
00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:58.820
this, then you're free to ignore it.

32
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.320
&gt;&gt; Cool.
