1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.488
So I just showed you how to do
a multistage build with a Node.js

2
00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:05.390
application, right?

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.693
So what I'm gonna have you do now is I'm
gonna have you do a multistage build with

4
00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:10.992
like a static website.

5
00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:14.928
This one down here that's
called Static Assets Project.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.099
So, here's all the instructions and

7
00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.393
then if you see right here to scroll
down to see my answer, I just feel like

8
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.700
a big space if you scroll all the way
down here it will show you the answer.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.270
It's also in that GitHub repo
that I showed you earlier.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.000
So how many of you are familiar
with Create React App?

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.780
Imagine many of you, right, if not there's
a great coarse in Frontend Masters

12
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.070
that's called the complete
intro to React version five.

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.970
All right, you don't have to do
any of the React parts of it.

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.223
We are just gonna do Create React App
to scuffle out a project for you.

15
00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.930
So, let's actually just go ahead and
get started.

16
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.638
Like I'll get you up and
running with the React portion of this and

17
00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:02.705
then I'll leave you to build
the actual Docker file.

18
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:07.982
See, the idea here is that we're
gonna create a Create React App.

19
00:01:07.982 --> 00:01:11.588
We're gonna build that into
a built project, right?

20
00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.055
And then we're gonna copy all those
files into an Nginx container and

21
00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:21.300
the Nginx container is gonna serve all
of our static assets for us, Okay?

22
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.220
So let's go ahead, I'm gonna just
copy this cuz it's really long.

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.450
Npx, this is gonna run create-react-app.

24
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.210
They recently like probably last week,
changed how create-react-app works so

25
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.640
I had to totally change this.

26
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.395
It's a good thing I tried this last night.

27
00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:40.190
[LAUGH] Cuz that would have
been real embarrassing,

28
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.540
the React teacher doesn't
know shit about React.

29
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.912
I mean, might be true, who knows.

30
00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:48.780
All right, so we're gonna go back in,
what are you doing?

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.280
Stop that.

32
00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.779
All right, so I'm here in my
intro-to-containers project, right?

33
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.120
I'm gonna run that command
that I said in there,

34
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.770
which is gonna run it off of npm directly.

35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.070
It's gonna run create-react-app.

36
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.513
It's gonna create a project
called static-assets-project.

37
00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:11.200
And it's gonna be the typescript
version and we're not confused yarn.

38
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.430
Why are we gonna use TypeScript?

39
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.043
It's another ploy for me to get you
to use more Microsoft products.

40
00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.854
Actually, I just wanna show you like
as involved as a build process as

41
00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:21.220
possible, right?

42
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.550
And that doesn't actually really matter.

43
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.940
So this will take a couple
minutes to get everything set up.

44
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.750
If you get a note that says, you don't
have a template associated with your

45
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.470
project or something like that, which is
what I was seeing when I was doing this

46
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.030
last night, uninstall your global
installation of create-react-app.

47
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.401
That's what eventually solved it for me.

48
00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:48.941
This ignore existing,
hopefully should sidestep that for

49
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:54.433
you, But if it doesn't, that's how
I was eventually solved problem.

50
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.130
Okay, this will take maybe, I'm gonna
guess like 30 more seconds to get through.

51
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.200
So, this is gonna go install a React
project that uses TypeScript.

52
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.810
And then just for fun, you and

53
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.050
I are gonna go put in SAS as well just
to have like a bunch of dependencies.

54
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.030
So you'll see here my notes,
I have this where it says optional.

55
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.550
I'm gonna do this but you could totally
skip this if you're not feeling it or

56
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.818
something breaks for you.

57
00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:28.851
But the reason why I'm putting this in
there is if you run the node modules and

58
00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:34.042
the npm install locally, this will break
when you copy it in the container.

59
00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:37.478
Cuz it'll build it for Mac or for
Windows and it won't build it for Linux,

60
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:40.591
unless you're on Linux then I don't
know how to break a computer.

61
00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:42.959
I could try.

62
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.700
What is going on here?

63
00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:50.862
Well, that's nice of you.

64
00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:56.632
All right, there we go, happy hacking.

65
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.455
So now if we go into
the static-assets-project, You'll

66
00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:08.687
see here you have a relatively
full project here.

67
00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:13.259
The first thing I want you to do is
I want you to create a dockerignore.

68
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:22.502
And let's open and edit that dockerignore
file cuz that won't come by default.

69
00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.937
Inside of here, So

70
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.573
you can also just come in here and
say New File, dockerignore, right?

71
00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:36.506
We're gonna ignore .git directories and

72
00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:41.485
we're gonna ignore node_module
directories and we'll also ignore,

73
00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.253
Yeah, anyway, that's fine.

74
00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.516
There might be a cache in here as well.

75
00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.703
No, I don't think there is.

76
00:04:53.703 --> 00:04:57.282
Anyway, So we'll do that first, okay?

77
00:04:57.282 --> 00:05:02.200
The next thing I want you to go in
here is I want you to say npm install.

78
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.091
This is the optional part, node-sass.

79
00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:13.162
And then while that's doing that,
we're gonna come in here and

80
00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:15.580
we're going to rename our source file.

81
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.975
So there's App.css,
just right click on that and say rename.

82
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:22.942
And just put an s in front of the css.

83
00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:30.590
So this is not a SASS class,
I'm not teaching you any SASS.

84
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.170
I'm not even necessarily
endorsing the use of SASS, right?

85
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.290
I don't use it myself anymore.

86
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.580
But, all css is valid SASS or
valid scss, right, so

87
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.960
that's why you're able to just change it
without changing anything inside of it.

88
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.100
So we name both of these to be s.css.

89
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.280
And then in two places
you need to go change.

90
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.350
So, App.tsx, just change that to scss.

91
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.500
They're on line 3, and then on index.tsx,

92
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.810
same thing here scss, okay?

93
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.615
So now we have a SASSified project as
well, so it's TypeScript, it's SASS so

94
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:10.570
there's a lot of dependencies
flying around here, right?

95
00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:16.519
So just to make sure
that everything works,

96
00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:21.607
we're gonna say npm run start,
I think is what it is.

97
00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.963
And our project should start
locally in the development mode.

98
00:06:31.553 --> 00:06:36.756
I might still have something
running on port 3,000, To start.

99
00:06:42.874 --> 00:06:44.345
There we go, there you go.

100
00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:50.911
So, pretty vanilla node project here,
right, or not node, but React.

101
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:54.751
Little did you know this is actually
the complete intro to React v6 and

102
00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:56.848
we're starting now, just kidding.

103
00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:58.308
That would be an intense course,

104
00:06:58.308 --> 00:07:01.310
containers all the way to
React back to containers.

105
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.590
Challenge accepted.

106
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.560
That's all you need to know about React
for this particular piece of the course.

107
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.570
So go ahead and stop that server.

108
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.020
So the way that you build this project is
you're gonna say npm run build, right?

109
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.167
This is a note to take cuz it's probably
gonna go into your Dockerfile, right?

110
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:23.694
And this'll go through and
this'll actually build everything out into

111
00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:28.307
a directory, so it's creating
an optimized production build, right?

112
00:07:30.175 --> 00:07:34.728
So this is gonna generate all of your
index.html, your CSS's, your JavaScripts.

113
00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:41.109
And so now we have this build directory.

114
00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:44.969
So if you look inside of your
build directory, you can see here,

115
00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:50.230
it's got a favicon, it's got a manifest,
it's got a bunch of stuff in here, right?

116
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.482
Then the key here being that
you have a static directory

117
00:07:55.482 --> 00:08:01.288
build/, Static.

118
00:08:01.288 --> 00:08:05.240
You can see there's the CSS,
there's JS, there's media, right?

119
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.220
Suffice to say, if you copy
the entire build directory across,

120
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.200
that's gonna be your
finally built project.

121
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.992
So as such,
I want you to go into your dockerignore,

122
00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:20.682
Inside of your stochastics project.

123
00:08:20.682 --> 00:08:23.505
And we're gonna add one more line
here to our dockerignore and

124
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:28.764
that is going to be, Built, like that.

125
00:08:31.324 --> 00:08:34.133
So that we won't accidentally
copy like a pre-built project.

126
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.360
Okay, so at this point, this is where
I'm gonna leave you to do the project.

127
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.710
So what you're gonna need to do is you're
gonna have a multi-stage build, right?

128
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.860
And you're gonna go and
you're going to copy in the project,

129
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.050
you're gonna build the project, right?

130
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.630
And then,
you're gonna take that output and

131
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.670
you're gonna copy it into
a Nginx container, right?

132
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.962
So the container that I want you to use,

133
00:08:59.962 --> 00:09:07.081
if we come back here,
I mean it's anything in here.

134
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.333
You can do Nginx latest,
you can do alpine.

135
00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:14.770
I think I have it so you can use Nginx
117, which I believe is the latest.

136
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.839
So if you wanna tie it to a proper version
like I've been telling to do I think

137
00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:18.976
117 is the correct one.

138
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:26.481
Let me just triple check that that's the
correct, cuz I have it written out here.

139
00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.494
The correct version is NGINX 1.17.

140
00:09:31.494 --> 00:09:33.535
So this is the one that I
want you to use right there.

141
00:09:36.756 --> 00:09:41.341
Okay, and then, so
there's a very specific place that you

142
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:45.840
have to copy it, Which is here.

143
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.320
So copy the build files
to user/share/nginx/html,

144
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.630
everything goes into that directory,
right?

145
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.311
And then don't modify the CMD, because
Nginx knows how to start itself and so

146
00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:56.963
you don't wanna overwrite that.

147
00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:02.563
So if you just copy everything into this
correct directory Nginx will take care of

148
00:10:02.563 --> 00:10:03.287
the rest for you.
