00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.212
That is like the whirlwind oversimplified
version of the terminology

2
00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:07.283
associated with Kubernetes.

3
00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:09.682
I am skipping a lot of
things here as well.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.431
So here's the kind of the sad thing, doing
this within the Windows subsystem for

5
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.920
Linux is basically impossible right now.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.760
It's not something that the Windows
team has focused on yet, it is coming.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
So don't try and
do this within WSL at the moment.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.320
Or you can go look it up and
see if it's been fixed right now,

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.891
but today at this moment, with WSL,
it's basically impossible.

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.016
So if you're doing this alongside
with here in Windows, either to open

11
00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:44.709
Ubuntu VM and try this or just grab
a coffee and enjoy the journey [LAUGH].

12
00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:53.560
All right, so we're gonna do a very,
very basic interaction with Kubernetes.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.880
So I'm gonna show you up here,
where's my Docker?

14
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:07.140
So I have my Docker whale right there and
there is a tab here for

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.770
Kubernetes, and you can switch contexts.

16
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.985
I have two context and so you likely will
just have one which is Docker Desktop.

17
00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:19.460
But there's another one called
Minikube that you can run as well.

18
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.225
If you're in Linux,
you'll need to use Minikube,

19
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:29.598
and it's basically like a control
structure for Kubernetes.

20
00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:32.620
But we're gonna have Docker Desktop
running for us on Mac OS so

21
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.480
make sure that it's done that and then
I want you to enable the local cluster.

22
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.782
If it's not already enabled,

23
00:01:37.782 --> 00:01:40.000
some of you will probably
will have it already enabled.

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.408
And you can see up here I have
Kubernetes is starting, and

25
00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:46.910
then we're gonna go over
here to our Docker Desktop.

26
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.265
You can see here my prompt actually
already shows me that I'm using

27
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:52.443
Docker Desktop.

28
00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:59.340
But if I switched it to,
come back over here,

29
00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:06.204
I could switch to Minikube just like that,
and if I hit Enter,

30
00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:08.428
you'll see that it
switches here to Minikube.

31
00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:12.711
Let us go back to Docker Desktop.

32
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:20.536
All right, so the next thing I need
you to install is kube control or

33
00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:26.381
kube cuddle, it depends on who you ask
of how you pronounce it, which is this.

34
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:30.420
It obviously means kube control, but
people like to say that is kube cuddle.

35
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.192
So you can click here for instructions on
how to install in your operating system.

36
00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:40.594
For Mac OS, you can just do
this curl command right here.

37
00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:46.043
And then you make it executable, and
then you move it into your path.

38
00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.059
So I already have it installed but
again, just do this.

39
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.524
Copy that, it will be a curl command, so
I'll come over here and say that, oops.

40
00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:12.540
Okay, so you'd do that first,
then you'd do a chmod,

41
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.710
this makes it executable, so you do
chmod + x, that makes it an executable.

42
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.729
And then you're gonna move this from
wherever that is into your local bin, or

43
00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.870
somewhere that's gonna be in your path.

44
00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:34.695
So at some point, you should be
able to say kubectl --version.

45
00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:40.592
Or is it just version?

46
00:03:43.217 --> 00:03:44.434
There you go.

47
00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:47.925
So that's what I'm running right now.

48
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.007
Okay, and

49
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:56.861
again here I say that you can make
a choice between using Docker Desktop.

50
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.931
If you're on a Mac, and everything's
working fine, then I would just suggest

51
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:05.080
using Docker Desktop because it works,
it's already installed.

52
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.950
But if you're on Linux,
you have to use Minikube,

53
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.010
so you're gonna have to go through
the Minikube installation process.

54
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.822
I think I got it through Brew,
if I remember it correctly.

55
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:23.132
Yep, so
I have a link there to install it as well.

56
00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:32.113
So here down in Minikube,
see here for how to install,

57
00:04:32.113 --> 00:04:37.861
Mac OS, Installing Minikube,

58
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:41.994
you should have virtualization already
running, because we've been doing Docker.

59
00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:45.871
All this stuff should work,
so yeah, this is what it is,

60
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:47.261
brew install minikube right there.

61
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:56.270
Now if you're on Windows, you probably can
get this stuff running via PowerShell.

62
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.093
Again, I just don't know PowerShell, so

63
00:05:00.093 --> 00:05:05.401
that's left to you, so
if you have both installed like me,

64
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:09.452
you can say, kubectl config use-context.

65
00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:16.730
And you can switch between them by saying,
minikube or you can say docker-desktop.

66
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.030
So if I said minikube right now,
you can see now it says minikube and

67
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.350
I can go back to docker-desktop like that.

68
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.150
Again, I'm sticking with docker-desktop.

69
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:34.051
If you're using Minikube,
you have to say minikube start as well.

70
00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:40.330
Okay, so that has gotten everything
running with Kubernetes.

71
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.063
It should be executing now on your
computer, so let's go ahead and

72
00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:48.934
get into this, now, Normally,

73
00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:52.248
what you would do is you would define
each one of your services with

74
00:05:52.248 --> 00:05:56.180
their own Kubernetes YAML files that
define, it needs this, it needs that.

75
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.200
It needs a bunch of different stuff,
it's a lot of setup.

76
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.130
It's pretty involved understanding all the
various different configuration knobs and

77
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.660
stuff like that.
