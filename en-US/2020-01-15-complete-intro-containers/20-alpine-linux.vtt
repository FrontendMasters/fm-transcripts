00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.680
So so far, we've built a nice
little Node.JS application.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.270
It's been running on Debian,
which is a perfectly valid and

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.630
perfectly great operating system.

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.786
There's lots of reasons that you
would run something inside of Debian.

5
00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.880
But there's an issue with the fact
that Debian is quite large.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.140
This Node package, I think, ends up being
almost a gigabyte, something like that.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.339
It's quite large, right?

8
00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.460
It's a whole operating system basically,
at least the file structure for it.

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.380
So it'd be great if we could
make something smaller, right?

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.930
So I wanna introduce you to
something called Alpine Linux.

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.630
It's something that we've actually kind
of already accidentally been using

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.160
because a lot of things
are built in Alpine Linux, but

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.910
let's go ahead and
just have a little chat about it.

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.334
So Alpine Linux is the most bare bones,

15
00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:48.867
smallest distribution of Linux
that it can possibly be.

16
00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:53.290
And it includes just the tools that it
thinks that you're gonna need to run your

17
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.446
application and literally nothing.

18
00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:58.140
Everything else you have
to put in yourself, right?

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.463
The advantage is,
is you go from 900 megabytes to 5, so

20
00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:05.320
Alpine's base layer is 5 megabytes.

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.600
And actually just so you know,

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.760
Alpine is actually based on another
distribution of Linux called BusyBox.

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.307
And BusyBox I believe came out of Samsung,
may want to look me up on that one.

24
00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:20.110
But BusyBox is two megabytes,
and it's even more bare bones,

25
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.830
I would suggest just going with Alpine.

26
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460
Those extra three megabytes are almost
all things that you would need anyway.

27
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.260
So you would end up
reinstalling that stuff anyway.

28
00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:31.850
The tradeoff here with
Alpine Linux is that

29
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.280
it just requires a lot more work
to get stuff working, right?

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.910
It doesn't even include
certificate authorities.

31
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.550
It doesn't include a bunch of stuff
that you would likely need, but

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.440
the good news is,
it includes nothing that you don't need.

33
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.450
A great example of this is
like if you include Debian,

34
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.106
on Debian by default is Python.

35
00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:51.150
It's a great language.

36
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.700
We did not use Python at
all in our application.

37
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.090
So it's actually a security vulnerability.

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.820
So if someone can get onto our server and
download a Python file, they can

39
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.030
execute it right away with the Python
interpreter that's on the server, right?

40
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.250
But if there's no Python interpreter,
they'd have to find a way to install it,

41
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.580
and that's a lot more difficult
than just connecting to a server.

42
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.410
So that's why Alpine Linux is secure,

43
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.900
it's secure by just having
less stuff on it, right?

44
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.210
You just eliminate a whole class of
security vulnerabilities that you'll have.

45
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.680
The other thing is, things that download
a lot quicker, they're cheaper to store,

46
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.040
they're cheaper to run.

47
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.470
I don't necessarily think that's
the biggest part of this,

48
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.750
maybe the pricing rights, because I know
things like Azure Container Registry,

49
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.140
which is a private registry for
containers, does charge by size.

50
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.350
So you'll save yourself a little
bit of money in that respect,

51
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.710
but it's not much, right?

52
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.897
So that's a nice side effect, the security
part is actually what I think is

53
00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:49.097
the compelling reason to use
a smaller version of Linux.

54
00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:58.130
So how hard is it to switch your
project from Stretch to Alpine?

55
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.115
Well, let's go give it a shot.

56
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.445
So what I'm gonna do, because I'm lazy and
I don't wanna restart

57
00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:12.228
my entire project,
is I'm gonna say cp- r everything in.

58
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:17.319
Actually I'm gonna cd out of this and I'm
gonna say cp- r, more-complicated that,

59
00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.248
and I'm going to put that into
a directory called alpine-linux.

60
00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:23.994
So now I have another directory
called alpine-linux and

61
00:03:23.994 --> 00:03:25.834
I just copied everything over there.

62
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:32.478
I'm doing this so hopefully you can go
back and reference what you built later.

63
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.720
So inside of here, as you may imagine,
everything's literally the same,

64
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.625
but I wanna change this from Debian
project to a Alpine project.

65
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.532
And there's a bit of witchcraft
that you have to do,

66
00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:51.690
you have to change the word
stretch to alpine.

67
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.020
That's it, that's all you have to do.

68
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.960
So now if we go back in here and
say, am I in the right directory?

69
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.549
I'm not, I have to go into alpine-linux.

70
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.553
We're going to run build again, and again,

71
00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:14.635
you could put different tags
on all these if you wanted to.

72
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.523
I'm not going to.

73
00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:23.530
So you can see there's
a couple more layers.

74
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.272
I think the Node one, once you add Node
into it, ends up being about 20 megabytes,

75
00:04:27.272 --> 00:04:30.330
right, cuz there's some tools that
come around with Node and NPM and

76
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.400
all that kind of stuff.

77
00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:36.863
Plus you're gonna include a bunch of Node
modules, they'll take up space as well.

78
00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:40.750
I think all said and done,
I measured this earlier, and

79
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.797
I believe this container that we just
built I believe is 80 megabytes,

80
00:04:45.797 --> 00:04:50.210
as opposed to 913,
I think is what I measured the other one.

81
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.473
So yeah, 913 to 86.

82
00:04:53.473 --> 00:05:01.860
And if we just go to
docker inspect my-app.

83
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.210
Somewhere in here it will tell you
how big it is, size, right there.

84
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:13.620
So you'd have to go and calculate
how many bytes that translates into.

85
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.095
According to my documentation here,
that's 86 megabytes.

86
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.837
All right, so now if we go ahead and
try and run this again.

87
00:05:27.047 --> 00:05:28.660
Right there, right there, right there.

88
00:05:31.576 --> 00:05:32.490
Works just fine.

89
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.130
But instead of using Debian,
we're now on to Alpine, but

90
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.150
we just saved ourself an entire class
of bugs by including much less.

91
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.059
Now, there is a Debian distribution called

92
00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.950
Debian SLiM, so if I went 12-stretch-slim,

93
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.300
I think you go down to about 150
megabytes, but you still get full Debian.

94
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.470
So that's a possibility as well.

95
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.230
I know lots of people do that,
Ubuntu used to do that as well,

96
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.590
that there was Ubuntu slim and
now actually there is no full Ubuntu.

97
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.040
It's just Ubuntu slim and everything
else you have to build yourself.

98
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.548
There might be a full one somewhere,
but I don't know how to get it,

99
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:11.475
cuz it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:19.790
So, pretty good.

101
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.616
Yeah, node latest,
last time I checked was 908 megabytes.

102
00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:29.781
Whereas node:12-alpine is about 80.

103
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.861
Pretty stark difference.

104
00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:38.960
So this is kind of where I wanted to talk
a little bit about distributions of Linux.

105
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.990
One, I'm not a Linux master by
any stretch of the imagination.

106
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.210
When I use Linux, I use Ubuntu just
because that's the one I know.

107
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.460
That's the one I've always used.

108
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.690
By some proxy, I know a bit about Debian
because Ubuntu is based on Debian, right?

109
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.910
So my default is I use Ubuntu or Debian
for anything that I'm doing locally.

110
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.140
It has all the tools I know how to use.

111
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.480
And then any time that I'm sending
stuff out to production, I try and

112
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.360
get it on Alpine.

113
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.870
Because then it's smaller,
right, and more secure.

114
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.598
But you can totally do things with RHEL,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

115
00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:17.420
that's another great
distribution of Linux Mint.

116
00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:23.159
SUSE, Kali,
they're all good distributions of Linux.

117
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.310
The last thing I wanted
to mention about Alpine.

118
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.400
So it doesn't even include bash.

119
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.689
That's probably the hardest part about
this for me is that I have to do -it.

120
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:49.148
There's a bunch of stuff that,
it's using something called ash,

121
00:07:49.148 --> 00:07:52.552
A-S-H instead of bash,
which is a minimalistic shell and

122
00:07:52.552 --> 00:07:56.110
not a full born-again shell,
which is what bash is, right?

123
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.810
So there are differences and
I don't know them, right?

124
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.870
So that, for me, is one of the reasons
that I don't use Alpine all the time is

125
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.848
because I don't know Ash very well.

126
00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:07.970
That was the last thing
I wanted to mention.
