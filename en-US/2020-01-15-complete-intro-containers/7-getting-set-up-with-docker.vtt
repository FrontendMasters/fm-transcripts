00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.212
So you should have Docker Desktop
installed at this point for MAC and

2
00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:03.714
Windows.

3
00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:05.890
There is no Docker Desktop for Linux,

4
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.792
in which case you'll need Docker
engine which doesn't have a GUI.

5
00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:14.850
You can see here this little Docker whale
will be at the bottom in the system tray

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.710
if you're in Windows.

7
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.140
You can see here I have
Docker Desktop running.

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.030
The next thing I wanna get you more
acquainted with is Docker Hub.

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.200
So you can just go to hub.docker.com.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.160
This is probably one of
the best parts about Docker,

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.560
is that they basically made these node
terms and then npm for containers, right?

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.390
So I can just say hey, Docker,
give me a MongoDB container and

13
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.110
you just pull it down.

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.480
It starts running it and
it knows everything it's supposed to do.

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.740
It's a bit of a black box, right?

16
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.370
I don't know exactly what it's
doing underneath the hood,

17
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.719
I just know that it runs Mongo.

18
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.367
And that's great!

19
00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.671
Cuz I didn't wanna know how to run Mongo,
if you know how to run Mango,

20
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:59.090
you wish you didn't know how to run Mongo,
right, one of those things.

21
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.680
And it has, I'm gonna say thousands and
tenths of thousands of containers, right?

22
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.936
So you can see here it has
official ones from Oracle,

23
00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:14.825
has an official MySQL one,
Couch Base, DB2?

24
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.540
Does anyone use DB2?

25
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.980
My dad was a DB2 salesman,
that's true story.

26
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.301
That's why I grew up around computers.

27
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:25.693
I don't know why I thought that was
necessary to share but it's sharing time.

28
00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:30.364
[LAUGH] Yeah, you can see here
there's literally anything.

29
00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:35.873
So if I type Mongo, you'll see that the
official Mongo one comes up right here and

30
00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:40.830
you can see this has been downloaded
10 million times, so a few times.

31
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.560
So feel free to sign up for
an account if you want to.

32
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.030
It's free, there's no reason not to.

33
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.940
I have one.

34
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.700
And I have published one container which
we will be using during the class today.

35
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.973
But that's when if I go in here and
say docker mongo:3 like this,

36
00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:02.158
that's where, I need to get out of this.

37
00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:06.040
So you can be done with this environment
now so we can safely exit out of it.

38
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.590
Hence, just so

39
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.515
you know if you do exit out of it you've
thrown away the entire environment, right?

40
00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:15.150
Because containers, once you close them,
disappear into the ether,

41
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.250
they don't save anything.

42
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.657
So let's just see,

43
00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:24.027
if you type docker ps it'll show you
all your containers that are running.

44
00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.535
If your Docker is not working,
you'll see an error message,

45
00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:28.382
if you try to run docker ps,
it'll fix that.

46
00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:35.346
And if I say docker
pull mongo:3 it's gonna

47
00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:39.508
go get this off of Docker hub, right?

48
00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:40.810
It'll look something like this.

49
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.113
So you can see, again,
I'm just reminding you,

50
00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:49.870
some of these containers are quite big.

51
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.290
This one is 117 megabytes.

52
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.670
So let that run in the background for
a little bit, so yeah, again,

53
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.240
there's Docker containers for
just about anything, right?

54
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.930
There's ones for node, there's ones for
Ruby, there's one for Go.

55
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.566
There's just about anything you can
imagine someone's probably built

56
00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.243
a Docker container for, right?

57
00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:12.317
It's like node when you're writing
something if you need a module,

58
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.720
chances are someone's written that
module and you can just npm install it.

59
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.060
In this case,
we can use Docker Hub for this.

60
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.780
So before you start going and building
your own bespoke artisanal containers,

61
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.850
check out to see if
Docker Hub has it first.
