00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:03.370
So I have a little section here
just to note on expose, right?

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.893
So far we've been talking
about using publish, right?

3
00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:11.120
So if you look here, shut that down.

4
00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:19.769
I've been using publish 3000:3000, right?

5
00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.409
You can technically write in here,
I could say EXPOSE,

6
00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.292
3000 and I can expose 3000.

7
00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:30.680
It totally would work.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.503
So let's get rid of this.

9
00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:37.522
The issue here is first of all,
I still have to run it with a flag,

10
00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:41.040
which is, What is it?

11
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.510
Okay, so that's running, and actually,
let's do it this way, so it just attaches.

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.980
So, I have to build it first,
let's build it.

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.370
Did I save that?

14
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.800
Did it run EXPOSE?

15
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.200
And the correct one.

16
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.170
No, I'm in the wrong one, that's why.

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.230
Docker file for more complicated node app.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.880
And then here I'm gonna say EXPOSE 3000,
and I'm gonna build it again.

19
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.766
And then I try and run my node app again.

20
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.710
But I'm gonna run it without publish.

21
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.050
I'm gonna say detached, so
it's running in the background.

22
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:45.290
Now, if I say docker ps.

23
00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:51.879
First of all if I try and
go over in here and go to localhost:3000,

24
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.810
it's not gonna work, right?

25
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.220
Cuz it's not actually technically
exposed on that particular port.

26
00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:05.019
So what you actually have to do is
you have to tell docker, docker kill,

27
00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:07.280
this one that I just ran my node app.

28
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.350
That's the image, right?

29
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.100
So you have to kill this way.

30
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.366
Docker kill that.

31
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.425
&gt;&gt; Mystifying journey.

32
00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:17.940
&gt;&gt; What's that?

33
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.430
&gt;&gt; The name of it, mystifying journey.

34
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.370
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that will work too.

35
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.390
So you have to do it with,
let me see if I can docker run --help.

36
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.000
There is an extra flag that you have
to pass and it might just be EXPOSE.

37
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.504
EXPOSE, it's dash -P, there we go.

38
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.989
So instead what I have to do, is I have
to say dash -P, which is gonna go and

39
00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.594
expose all of those
ports that I put it on.

40
00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:51.914
And now if I say docker ps,

41
00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:56.330
I actually don't know what port is going
to expose it, just picks one for me.

42
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.849
So you can see now that I have 3000,
which is gonna go into the container.

43
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.280
But coming out of the container
is gonna be 32768.

44
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.661
So now, I can come over here and
put that in here And

45
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.590
it works, right now,
it's mapping into the container.

46
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.020
Does that seem less convenient?

47
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.580
I would assume it probably is, right?

48
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.650
And for the most part people don't
really use expose for this reason.

49
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.461
I've heard some people say that they'll
still put expose in here just to let

50
00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:31.200
people know is like hey, just so
you know, publish on 3000, right?

51
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.880
That's what we're expecting here.

52
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.375
It's kinda like documentation, you can
easily just put that in the read me.

53
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.850
I don't know why you'd necessarily
put it in the Docker file.

54
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.798
I don't go to the Docker file for
documentation.

55
00:03:42.798 --> 00:03:47.766
So that's EXPOSE, that was very confusing
to me when I was starting out with Docker,

56
00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:51.641
so I thought I would hopefully
demystify that a little bit for you.

57
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:52.550
&gt;&gt; So what does publish do?

58
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.106
It just kind of packages it all together
and like, hey, you can ship this.

59
00:03:57.106 --> 00:04:01.481
&gt;&gt; So publish says like I have this port
internally and have this port externally

60
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:06.190
and I want you to plug those two things
together, like tunnel out together.

61
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.937
So I can port 8080 inside the container
published at the port 3000,

62
00:04:10.937 --> 00:04:15.180
it'll connect to those two containers or
those two ports, right?

63
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.380
So it's port mapping, it's literally
what it is, it's just port mapping.
