1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.020
Now, I just wanna set
up the basic commands.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.920
They're not gonna do anything right now,
we're gonna do that later, and

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.450
actually have the commands do things.

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.220
But for now, we'll just set up the
commands that don't actually do anything.

5
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.590
So I have them all here, but
I'm just gonna write them out.

6
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.270
So let's think about all
the stuff we wanna do for a note.

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.350
I'm gonna get rid of this command here,
we don't need the curl one.

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.219
Instead I wanna make a command that
you can use for creating a new note.

9
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:28.343
So I'll call it new like this.

10
00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:33.244
And it's going to take an argument called
the note or you can call it the content,

11
00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:37.442
you can call whatever you want but
the actual note that you wanna pass.

12
00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:42.650
So this will allow me to
go to say note new and

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.907
then pass in something like
this without the tags, right?

14
00:00:49.907 --> 00:00:54.652
So we got the note,
I'm going to describe it,

15
00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:59.033
I'm gonna say create a new note like this,

16
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.550
Oops, right, don't do that, thank you.

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.360
And then there's basically two
functions that come after this.

18
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.400
So it's four arguments.

19
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.860
So the first argument is the command you
want, followed by any arguments for that.

20
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.490
The second one is the description for
it, the third one is optional.

21
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.140
We won't use this for everyone, but
it's great for formatting things.

22
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.613
In this third function right here,
I'm gonna get another instance of yargs,

23
00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.750
which is not the same yargs
as the one that we imported.

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.730
This one is scoped to this command,
so you have to use it.

25
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.613
You can call it the same,
it's fine to shadow it.

26
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:43.136
And I'm gonna return yargs.positional(

27
00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:47.366
'note') like this, and

28
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:52.653
I'm gonna say its type is a string,

29
00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:55.473
its description,

30
00:01:55.473 --> 00:02:01.302
is the note to create, or the content.

31
00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:06.344
You can call it wherever you want,
the content of the note

32
00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:11.892
to create and, You can put
a default here too if you want but

33
00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:13.600
we don't want a default, so we got that.

34
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.006
And then now here I'll get argv and

35
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:22.176
yeah we're not gonna do
anything with it right now,

36
00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:27.462
we'll do that later but for
now we could just log it and

37
00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:34.418
we could just say argv.note, and
we should be able to get something.

38
00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:41.650
So this is basically saying get the note
argument, ensure its type string.

39
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.031
Here's the description for
if somebody asked for help,

40
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.760
and then this is like okay, someone called
that command, what do you wanna do?

41
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.339
Right now we're just logging in,

42
00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.049
eventually we'll actually add a new note
somewhere, but for now we are just going to log it.

43
00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.385
So to test that out, I can run that.

44
00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:02.857
And you can see it does return back
the content that I put clean my room

45
00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:05.302
because that's what I logged here.

46
00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:13.536
All right, just so I can just tag
this just so we can see hello.

47
00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:24.990
So this is a way better way to build a CLI
than what we were gonna do, which would have

48
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.325
been a bunch of if statements and regexs
everywhere, so this is much better.

49
00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.136
Any questions on this or
how to like create the command?

50
00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.296
Cool, well then we just have the other
ones that we can go through.

51
00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:48.200
Actually, I do wanna add one more for
a note, I wanna add an option here.

52
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.120
So, it's an option or
options, there we go.

53
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.450
So I wanna add an option here,
I'm gonna call it tags.

54
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.266
So I wanna be able to tag
our notes with tags so

55
00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:04.420
we can search by them if we want to or
however we wanna do it.

56
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.370
And that one's pretty easy,
you just add an option after a command and

57
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.322
you pass it an object.

58
00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.970
Like this, and I can set an alias to t,
I'll show you what that means in a minute.

59
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.408
I can enforce the type to be string in
this case, and then put a description if

60
00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:24.390
someone asks for help,
It'll tell you what the description is.

61
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:31.745
So now we have tags, and I'm able to
access those tags on the argv as well.

62
00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.100
So what does that actually look like?

63
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.824
Well now if I go here, I can do
something like --tags like this and

64
00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:43.810
I can parse in a string.

65
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.590
In this case, I can separate them by,
I'll say, for me, I'll do commas.

66
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.290
It doesn't matter, so
I can say this is work, this is serious.

67
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.940
This is whatever these are my
tags that I wanna add.

68
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.930
That's what an option is or
a flag is or an option.

69
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.294
And when we said alias t,
that just means we

70
00:05:05.294 --> 00:05:09.977
could do like a shorthand like that or
maybe T or lowercase.

71
00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:14.816
This means you could just one dash t or
you could do like two dashes and

72
00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:18.689
you can spell the whole thing out,
every CLI does that.

73
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.039
They have an a list for all their flags.

74
00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.970
I'm not cool enough, so I'll just do
the longhand one cuz when you see like

75
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.260
some command with like -t, -a,
-m, -v, I'm like, what is this?

76
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.027
Just spell it out,
I don't know any of this shit is, so

77
00:05:38.027 --> 00:05:41.044
I'm just gonna spell myself out.

78
00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:47.690
Cool, all right, and then yeah from there,
we have all these other commands.

79
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.274
We can just copy these in here if you
want, but basically we have one for

80
00:05:52.274 --> 00:05:56.080
getting a new note, one for
getting all the notes, one for

81
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.300
finding a note by a search criteria.

82
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.941
One for removing a note by an id,
got this crazy one called Web,

83
00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:06.060
which we'll launch a website
to see all of our notes.

84
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.760
And then the last one is just like,
delete everything, right?

85
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.266
So we're gonna add all of those and

86
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:18.550
I'm just gonna just paste them in cuz
they don't do anything right now.

87
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.890
You can grab them off
the notes website and boom.

88
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.770
So now we have all of those.

89
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.286
Like I said,
they don't really do anything,

90
00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:30.940
I'm not really introducing
anything new here.

91
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.963
The only I guess that's slightly new
than what I've just talked about is just

92
00:06:33.963 --> 00:06:35.330
one for port.

93
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.946
This one has square brackets around
it other than the angle brackets,

94
00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:40.670
that just means it's optional.

95
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.149
Angle brackets means it's required, square
brackets means this is an option cuz I

96
00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:48.056
have a default here if you don't pass it.

97
00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:52.506
That's all that means.

98
00:06:55.723 --> 00:07:00.930
So to verify that all that is
working I can just say note --help.

99
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.788
And there you go, there's all my commands.
