1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.550
All righty, okay, let's write some code.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.691
I've been talking too much.

3
00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:05.733
I just wanna write code.

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.740
That's what I'm here for.

5
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.970
So let's write our first Node.js program.

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.130
But in order to do that,
we need to install it.

7
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.275
So there's many ways to install it.

8
00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:19.910
I already have it installed.

9
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.120
You can walk through what I'm
about to show you to install it.

10
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.178
You can also just use something
like CodeSandbox in this example.

11
00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:28.963
And most tutorials probably would
just use something like CodeSandbox,

12
00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:31.290
but I wanna walk through
how to install Node.

13
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.624
I think that's important to know.

14
00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:36.143
If you're gonna be using it, know just how
to install it cuz there's many ways to do

15
00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:37.468
it and there's some gotchas.

16
00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:41.180
So I'm gonna walk you through my preferred
way, which is using something called NVM.

17
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.150
So NVM stands for Node Version Manager,
and it's exactly what it sounds like.

18
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.400
It manages your versions of Node.

19
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.220
So if you wanna use NVM, you can actually
head over to their documentation.

20
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.341
And you can copy their install scripts.

21
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:06.740
I believe this install script is universal
and it works pretty much any machine here.

22
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.767
So you can copy this one right here and
run that in your terminal.

23
00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:17.629
And then once you have that,
depending on your setup,

24
00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:22.218
whether you're using Bash or
Zsh or whatever, you wanna add,

25
00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:26.130
you wanna copy this and
add it to your specific setup.

26
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.887
In my setup,
I'm pretty sure I'm using Zsh, so

27
00:01:29.887 --> 00:01:33.510
I might have this in my Z-S-H-R-C file.

28
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.812
This might be your Bash profile file.

29
00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.184
If this sounds too complicated to install,

30
00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:42.170
don't worry about it [LAUGH] we'll go
the other way to install something.

31
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.070
It'll be some gotchas there,
but it'll work for today.

32
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.319
This is just my preferred method.

33
00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.680
And the reason I like NVM is because
it allows you to switch versions.

34
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.150
You can literally change a version
of Node whenever you want.

35
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.471
Whereas if you go through the Node.js
documentation website and

36
00:01:56.471 --> 00:02:00.393
install it that way with the installer,
you'll get the latest version, but

37
00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:01.918
you can't switch versions.

38
00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:07.478
And then there's a lot of security issues
around how that installation access files

39
00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:12.892
on your computer, which makes installing
things kinda complicated sometimes.

40
00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:16.582
So to avoid that whole issue,
I just use NVM.

41
00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:17.679
So you have NVM here.

42
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:22.509
Once we have that, you should be
able to go to your machine and

43
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:28.209
do something like nvm, and
if you hit that, you'll see some version.

44
00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.153
If you get an error here,
that means either a,

45
00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:35.840
you didn't do this part correctly.

46
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Where you paste this into either your bash
profile, your bashrc, your zshrc file.

47
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.330
And which, by the way, once you do that,
if and when you do that,

48
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.440
you can't use the same terminal window
because it needs to reevaluate that file.

49
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.522
So the best thing you can do
is you can type in source,

50
00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:59.026
followed by the file that you just edited,
whichever one you added that to.

51
00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:01.880
Or the easier way is just open
up a new terminal tab, and

52
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.629
that will reevaluate that file.

53
00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.610
Cuz you can't use the same tab that
you were in when you added it.

54
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.259
It won't know that you updated that file.

55
00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:19.125
So once you have it,
you'll see nvm version.

56
00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.771
Now, if you're having trouble with this,

57
00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:25.855
then the easy way to install it is
just to go to the Node.js website.

58
00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:30.638
Gotta make sure I Google that cuz I
think someone owns the Node.js.com or

59
00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:33.764
something like that, and
it's an inappropriate website.

60
00:03:33.764 --> 00:03:35.145
So I never [LAUGH] never go to,

61
00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:38.650
it's always just Googling to
make sure I got the right one.

62
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.801
But you just click right here, right?

63
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:41.940
It'll detect what system you're on.

64
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.002
And you can just click this one here,
18.6.0 LTS.

65
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:50.762
LTS stands for long-term support.

66
00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:53.046
Basically, every other version,

67
00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:58.860
they have a long-term support version in
which they plan on supporting for a while.

68
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.046
But then every odd version,
it's not a long-term support version and

69
00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:04.860
it's gonna get thrown away.

70
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.929
So almost never installed
the odd number ones.

71
00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.425
I always just install these.

72
00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:10.946
You can do 20.
I just haven't tested this app on 20, so

73
00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:13.370
I don't know if there
are any breaking changes.

74
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.174
But we're gonna use
the latest of 18.16.10.

75
00:04:15.174 --> 00:04:18.390
So you can click this,
it has an installer.

76
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.554
It's very easy to install.

77
00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:21.370
It'll do all the work for you.

78
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:27.447
And then once you have that installed,
you should be able to do node version and

79
00:04:27.447 --> 00:04:28.651
see what version you have.

80
00:04:31.222 --> 00:04:34.597
I'm a little behind with 18.14,
but that's a minor version, so

81
00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:39.140
it shouldn't be any difference between if
you had 18.16, so don't worry about it.

82
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.785
Okay, hopefully, everyone had
enough time to get Node install,

83
00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:45.728
whether it was with NVM or
from the Node.js website.

84
00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:51.255
If you did do NVM, just make sure you
also, once you have NVM installed

85
00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:57.450
that you then install Node using nvm
install followed by the version you want.

86
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.115
So that would be nvm install 18, and

87
00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:05.128
that would install the version 18,
and then you should be good to go.

88
00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:09.078
Okay, so once you have that going,
you can doubl-check,

89
00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:13.520
node --version, and
you can see what version you have.

90
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.827
It'll also tell you the path on which
it was installed, things like that,

91
00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:18.153
depending on your terminal.

92
00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:24.060
Now, what we can do is we can
write our first Node.js program.

93
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.910
So I'm just gonna make
a new repo here to folder.

94
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.651
I'm just gonna call it intro-node.

95
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.714
Okay, so many things, there we go.

96
00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:47.439
And I'm just gonna open
this up in my VS Code.

97
00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.963
And I'm just gonna make a new file here,
call it index.js.

98
00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:54.916
You can call it whatever you want.

99
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.902
I'm just gonna call it index.js.

100
00:05:56.902 --> 00:06:00.490
And I'm just gonna write some JavaScript
that you've probably already seen before.

101
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.629
I'm gonna write console.log.

102
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.676
And I'm just gonna say, hello world.

103
00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:06.712
I'm gonna save that.

104
00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:13.810
And then once I do that, I'm just gonna
say node and then the path to that file.

105
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.876
Seeing how this terminal
is already in this folder,

106
00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.670
I can just type index.js and execute that.

107
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.740
And then I should see the output
hello world in the terminal.

108
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.270
So what's actually happening here?

109
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.650
Well, this is how you execute JavaScript
with Node outside of the browser.

110
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.784
Before you typically would have
the written code in a script tag or

111
00:06:35.784 --> 00:06:39.395
another JavaScript file
included that in the HTML file,

112
00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:44.730
go to the browser, let it run, open up
the console, and then you can see it.

113
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.610
Or you could just open up the console and
write JavaScript in there,

114
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.146
which is not a good experience, but that's
how you'd have to write JavaScript and

115
00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:52.680
evaluate it and execute it before.

116
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.740
Now you can just write it in a file and

117
00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.040
point to it with this node command here
in your terminal and it will execute it.

118
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.800
So any arbitrary JavaScript you can write.

119
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.933
So if you go in there and
write some things, run it,

120
00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:06.534
you'll see what I'm talking about.

121
00:07:06.534 --> 00:07:07.540
It's pretty simple.

122
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.826
Also the other thing to note is that
we were able to use something familiar,

123
00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:12.900
console.

124
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.479
Whereas before in the browser
when you do console log,

125
00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.030
that actually goes to the browser console.

126
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.820
Whereas in the terminal,
the console is the terminal.

127
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.460
So in most languages on the operating
system, you might see this as print.

128
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.370
It might say something like print,
print line, or print something.

129
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.245
Whereas in JavaScript, it's still console
because JavaScript was made in the browser

130
00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.460
where there was a console.

131
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.081
So when they brought it over,
they decided to just keep it console,

132
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:44.510
but it's the equivalent of print and other
OS level languages, if that makes sense.

133
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.450
Any questions on that?

134
00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.780
Okay, and yeah, I mean, get in here.

135
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.084
See what happens if you try to do
something that you normally would do in

136
00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:54.646
a browser.

137
00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:59.270
Anyone knows, anyone wanna guess if I did
something like alert what might happen?

138
00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:04.298
&gt;&gt; I can guess.

139
00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:07.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're gonna get a dialog box in

140
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.545
the browser.

141
00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:13.030
I guess I don't know what would happen
if you run it in your terminal, though.

142
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.145
&gt;&gt; Right, so yeah [LAUGH] exactly.

143
00:08:15.145 --> 00:08:19.834
So what do you think would happen
if I ran this on a terminal?

144
00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:20.771
&gt;&gt; Nothing?

145
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.631
&gt;&gt; Let's see, so
I run this in the terminal.

146
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:28.772
Boom, I get an error,
alert is not defined, and

147
00:08:28.772 --> 00:08:33.050
that's where we start
to see the differences.

148
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.983
Like I said, there are some things
that carry over, like the console, but

149
00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.046
there are other things like
an alert that doesn't.

150
00:08:38.046 --> 00:08:41.953
And the reason something like an alert
probably wouldn't carry over because alert

151
00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:45.050
does something visual,
like you said, a dialog box.

152
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.248
There's no visual output for
terminals that's text based.

153
00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:51.402
So you probably wouldn't get
an alert on the terminal.

154
00:08:51.402 --> 00:08:55.310
I guess maybe it would make sense to get
a desktop notification or something.

155
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.490
And I'm sure someone's made a package for
that,

156
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.755
and we'll talk about packages and
modules later.

157
00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:03.810
But yeah, by default,
we're not gonna get that.

158
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.826
So this is where being in
JavaScript is the same, but

159
00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.580
it's in a different environment.

160
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.560
So it has access to different things.

161
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.578
So alert is not one of those
things that it has access to.

162
00:09:14.578 --> 00:09:16.230
Does that make sense?

163
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.221
And this is what an error looks like, very
similar to what an error looks like in

164
00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:24.135
the console in the browser,
cuz it's still just JavaScript.

165
00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:26.960
You still get a call stack and
things like that.

166
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.561
Don't worry about this module stuff.

167
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:32.005
We'll talk about that some other time,
but yeah, it's just an error.
