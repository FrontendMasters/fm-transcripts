00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.200
How's it going everybody?

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.938
Welcome to Intro to Node.js V3.

3
00:00:03.938 --> 00:00:07.473
I'm your instructor, Scott Moss,
I am a software engineer.

4
00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:10.809
Well, I guess technically I'm an investor
now, I don't write code full time.

5
00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.856
But I was a software engineer for
over 15 years now.

6
00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:18.578
Where I've worked at various
companies like Netflix and

7
00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:21.299
doing consulting with other companies.

8
00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:25.373
At this point coding is more than just
something I do for work cuz I don't do

9
00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:29.071
the work, I do for fun,
it's it's something that I enjoy doing.

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.412
I dream in code, I build things, I'm
constantly staying up to date with stuff.

11
00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:37.290
And Node.js is just one of those
technologies that when I started

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.463
learning to code it was brand new, so
it was the thing that I picked up.

13
00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:43.545
It's my native language, I guess.

14
00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:46.050
[LAUGH] So
I'm very much in love with Node.js.

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950
And recently there've been a lot of
changes in Node.js with the newest

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.540
version.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.510
So this course is gonna go over
a lot of those changes and

18
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.166
my new approaches on how
I do things in Node.js.

19
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.330
I think some of the things have
evolved since last time I taught this.

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.460
The fact that you can't even do frontend
without touching Node.js is kind of crazy

21
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.070
now, maybe in a good way.

22
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.948
But pretty much everything that we're
gonna be covering is gonna be in

23
00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:09.640
the notes here.

24
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.565
Although if you've ever taken any of my
courses you know my style is just to hop

25
00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:15.780
right in and do things.

26
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.581
So it'll be more of a reference and
a tool for

27
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:23.300
you all to use as you're taking
the course, after the course, later on.

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.734
But for me, I'll just be referencing it.

29
00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:28.034
But most likely I'll just want to get
in the text editor and do things and

30
00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:31.020
show examples that way versus
just talking through some notes.

31
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.970
So it's a resource for you all,
take advantage of it if you need to.

32
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.106
But you can also just follow along,
ask questions, and

33
00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:40.670
have a conversation as we make things.

34
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.100
What is this course?

35
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.180
Well, it's intro to Node.js.

36
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.232
But at the same time, it's not just gonna
be me listing documentation of Node.js and

37
00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:51.880
going through different concepts.

38
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.260
We'll actually be building something.

39
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.746
So basically what we're gonna
do is we're gonna cover

40
00:01:56.746 --> 00:02:00.705
all the little things that I
think are important in Node.js.

41
00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:04.683
From things like modules and
NPM and all that stuff.

42
00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:08.942
But also just the different types
of apps you can make in Node.js,

43
00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:13.828
from CLIs to servers and interacting
with file systems and stuff like that.

44
00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:17.803
So we're gonna combine that
all to create a notetaking app

45
00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:20.327
that you can use from your terminal.

46
00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:24.003
And then add a website component to
it where you can see those notes.

47
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:25.781
So sounds very simple but

48
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:30.870
it covers pretty much everything
you'll ever do a Node to some degree.

49
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.156
Pretty much everything, and Node is
built on top of these foundations and

50
00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:35.589
just become more complicated.

51
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:40.002
But at the end of the day there,
probably a CLI, probably a server,

52
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:45.594
probably touching some files somewhere, or
the combination of all or some of those.

53
00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:47.058
So by the end of this course,

54
00:02:47.058 --> 00:02:51.459
you should have a solid foundation on what
Node.js is as far as like getting started.

55
00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.784
What it looks like, how to use it, and

56
00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:58.820
then the types of things you can do with
it, the capabilities and stuff like that.

57
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.352
And then, if you come from
another language like PHP,

58
00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:03.399
you should be able to
see some comparables.

59
00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:07.130
And they're like, this is how you
would've done that here or there.

60
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.201
So you'll definitely have a sense of that,

61
00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:13.361
and if not, ask questions and
I'll dive in.

62
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.207
I'm purposely not getting
into anything advanced here,

63
00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:18.300
seeing how it is an intro course.

64
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.170
But if someone has an appetite for
something more advanced, let me know.

65
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.130
I'm not afraid to dive in, even if I
don't know, we'll figure it out together.

66
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.763
So please ask those questions.

67
00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:28.350
And then here are the resources.

68
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.260
So here's a repo to the actual
app that really make it,

69
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.480
it's the completed version.

70
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.548
You can check it out, it's there to
reference if you just wanna get caught up,

71
00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:41.216
if you wanna compare what
you did to what's there.

72
00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:44.360
Like I said, I'm just gonna be
redoing this anyway from scratch.

73
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.186
So what I do live here might not be
exactly one for one whatÂ´s in that repo,

74
00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.927
cuz I just do things
differently every single time.

75
00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:52.337
But it's mostly the same.

76
00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:55.958
And that repo follows all the code
that's gonna be here in the notes,

77
00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.278
so they're one for one.

78
00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:02.147
But I'm super random and sporadic, so
I might do something different today as

79
00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:05.039
far as the code that I write,
but it's there.

80
00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.779
And then just some other links
to some important resources.

81
00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.083
NPM, which we'll talk about, if you've
never heard about it, don't worry.

82
00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.927
And then documentation website for
Node.js,

83
00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:16.630
if you are into reading complicated
docs it's there for you.
