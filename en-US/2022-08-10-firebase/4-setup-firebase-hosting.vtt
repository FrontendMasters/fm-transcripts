WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.624
So I feel good about this app, right?

2
00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:04.398
Why should I not feel good about this app?

3
00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:06.706
It looks great,
it has all these great features to it.

4
00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:10.843
I want to deploy it out into the world for
everyone to use.

5
00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:18.982
So what I'm gonna do is is
I'm going to set up this.

6
00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:20.615
Okay, what is it doing?

7
00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:24.746
I'm going to set up this
app with Firebase Hosting.

8
00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:26.681
So let me see here.

9
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:33.205
I have installed as a dev dependency,
Firebase tools, which is the Firebase CLI.

10
00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:34.254
A question?

11
00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:37.895
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
the dock versus the set dock method.

12
00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:42.905
So the dock method creates just

13
00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:47.918
a document on the client only.

14
00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:51.034
&gt;&gt; No, so this will create it
on the server when you call.

15
00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.612
&gt;&gt; When you're adding a new document.

16
00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:56.040
&gt;&gt; Right here and set doc.

17
00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:58.068
Sorry convert me go to.

18
00:00:58.068 --> 00:00:58.690
You're right.

19
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.090
We're going to dashboard right here.

20
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.277
&gt;&gt; Yeah, can you explain the difference
between the doc and the set document?

21
00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:10.005
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's two parts to
doing any type of data manipulation.

22
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.857
There is the reference.

23
00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:14.895
So which is where is it?

24
00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:17.245
And then that has nothing
to do with the server.

25
00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:19.406
It just doesn't try to
connect up to the server.

26
00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:23.096
It just builds up the recipe
to go speak to the server.

27
00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:28.182
Then set Doc is what is
called a mutation function,

28
00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:33.758
which says, hey,
let me update the server in some way.

29
00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:38.156
So a set will do what we'll learn in
a minute here called a destructive update.

30
00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:41.868
Says I don't care about what existed
beforehand, I'm just gonna write over it.

31
00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.913
And it's really good for creation.

32
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:46.122
There's other ones, there's update,

33
00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:49.605
there's lots of other advancements
we'll see here in a minute.

34
00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:53.691
And what this will do is this will go
out to the server and make that update.

35
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:57.408
This tends to be confusing it with first
cuz most people are used to like I'm

36
00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.654
saying awaiting these, you don't have to.

37
00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:05.611
And actually it is but very bad to await
these because FireStore works offline and

38
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:10.427
this await says I'm gonna wait to
get a result back from the server

39
00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:12.546
before I continue going on.

40
00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:16.798
So if I await it it's just gonna sit
here and wait until I regain connection.

41
00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:20.002
Whereas I don't await it will
actually continue to work against

42
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:21.018
the offline cache.

43
00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:25.268
So waiting for this stuff tends to be
while there are situations where I've seen

44
00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:27.692
it's necessary for the most part it's not.

45
00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:31.842
So this doc creates the reference
this set doc just says, hey,

46
00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:34.361
let me save the data at that location.

47
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:37.308
So those are the two differences.

48
00:02:37.308 --> 00:02:42.214
So now with that done,
I'm going to just set up.

49
00:02:42.214 --> 00:02:45.712
I have the Firebase CLI which
you can install globally.

50
00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:50.587
I like to install it locally at the node
modules folder because just less problems

51
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.746
when you have local versus global.

52
00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:56.176
And for what I can do is I can say MPX.

53
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.030
I'm using MPX.

54
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.990
But you could use NPM or for for
global and say Firebase in knit, and

55
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.698
I'm gonna write Firebase and knit hosting.

56
00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:10.830
And this is my favorite part,
the little Firebase thing right here.

57
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.463
And so, what this says is like okay,
cool, let's set you up to deploy.

58
00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:16.132
What do you wanna use?

59
00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:18.909
You wanna use an existing project,
create a new project.

60
00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.312
We have an existing project.

61
00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:28.841
We called it Mark Down-me Let's
see here what did I do?

62
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.382
I think I may have give it the wrong name.

63
00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:35.951
Hold on I know why I'm in
the wrong well we get,

64
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.304
I'm incorrectly authenticated.

65
00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:44.214
So I'm going to clear out the terminal.

66
00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:46.382
What did I do?

67
00:03:46.382 --> 00:03:48.567
Okay, so put a new one here.

68
00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.756
I'm gonna say MPX Firebase.

69
00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:54.803
Logout because I'm logged in
as the wrong one right now.

70
00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:58.899
And I'm gonna say MPX Firebase login.

71
00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:03.488
And this is going to take me over here.

72
00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:05.994
I'm going to log in as this user.

73
00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:09.326
It's gonna say hey, I'm gonna need
to be able to do stuff to deploy.

74
00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:11.777
So I allow it and we're logged in.

75
00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:16.814
So now I'm back into the console
logged in and I'm gonna

76
00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:23.905
go through that process again we're
gonna say MPX Firebase and knit hosting.

77
00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:28.136
I'm going to create a nicer update.

78
00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:32.935
Enter an existing project which
is here it is marked down me.

79
00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:35.990
It's gonna ask us it's always so small.

80
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.507
What do you want as your public directory?

81
00:04:40.507 --> 00:04:44.695
The way that view does it I believe it
builds out to a folder called Dist.

82
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:46.349
So I'm gonna specify this.

83
00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.926
It's gonna ask me if I want to
configure as a single page app,

84
00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:51.553
which yes I do in this case.

85
00:04:51.553 --> 00:04:55.077
I'm not gonna set up deploys with GitHub,
which is a cool feature, but

86
00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:56.386
we'll get to that later.

87
00:04:56.386 --> 00:05:01.950
So now I have this dist folder
that view will overwrite.

88
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.263
I'm gonna do NPM run
build just to build out.

89
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:12.143
This isn't important but it builds
out my view app, all exists here.

90
00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:17.725
And if I say now MPX Firebase deploy.

91
00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:23.694
It's gonna say all right,

92
00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:26.502
great we're gonna do all this stuff
we're going to deploy out your app.

93
00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:27.815
Awesome, and

94
00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:33.842
then now at mark down-me.web.app
are really cool app exists.

95
00:05:33.842 --> 00:05:36.754
So if you all wanna go out to this and

96
00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:42.739
go to mark down-me.web.app,and
watch the chaos ensue.

97
00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:44.662
This one.

98
00:05:44.662 --> 00:05:47.366
We can just start writing.

99
00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:53.800
And actually one of the things I think is
really cool is if I go into the console,

100
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.715
someone right to the app,
yeah, look at that.

101
00:05:57.715 --> 00:06:00.030
It's like a Christmas tree.

102
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.570
It's just everything lights up.

103
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.813
This is all the things
that people are doing.

104
00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:11.208
And so this is a very quick dirty
way of getting a Firebase app up and

105
00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:14.580
running we authenticated a user,

106
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.481
we got data syncing in real time,
all this stuff.

107
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:23.606
But there are a lot of mistakes
that we made along the way.

108
00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:24.525
And this is fun.

109
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:27.599
I can watch this happen for days.

110
00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.532
My gosh, you all right and
a lot of documents.

111
00:06:32.532 --> 00:06:35.413
But there's a lot of mistakes that
were made along the way here.

112
00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:41.601
One of the mistakes is that if I
want to delete all of this data,

113
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:47.205
it's actually I can do so
with just like a curl command.

114
00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:50.992
This right here is a REST API for
fire store.

115
00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:55.750
So you can talk to fire server
REST API If I plugged in my project ID and

116
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.529
I ran a curl command against this, just
delete the whole database just like that.

117
00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.451
That is not very secure or if I wanted
to add data in I could add data.

118
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:08.967
And that's because we have
no security setup for this.

119
00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:10.400
And so that's a bad practice.
