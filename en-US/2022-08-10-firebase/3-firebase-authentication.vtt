00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:03.214
So the last thing we're
gonna do in this simples,

2
00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:06.126
I'm gonna go kind of went backwards,
but that's okay.

3
00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:10.221
At home, I'm going to set
up Firebase authentication.

4
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.278
So every time you set
up a Firebase service,

5
00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:15.738
it's important to make sure that you
have things enabled in the console.

6
00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:21.835
So I've enabled my Firestore,
I'm going to go and enable authentication.

7
00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:26.366
Authentication is especially important to
be very explicit about enabling because

8
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.800
you only wanna support specific providers.

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.497
You don't want all of a sudden people
are trying to sign in with, Google, but

10
00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:36.337
you only wanted people
to sign in with GitHub.

11
00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:41.901
So you want to be able to manually say
these are the providers I support.

12
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:47.500
So we're gonna support just my, this is
my most favorite of all auth providers.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.205
It's called anonymous authentication.

14
00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.102
And there's two benefits to it.

15
00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:52.152
One, the user,

16
00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.819
you can authenticate them without
them entering any credentials at all.

17
00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.021
It sort of authenticates them as a guest.

18
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:04.868
And it's a short lived time period,
so eventually I think after

19
00:01:04.868 --> 00:01:09.194
a certain session length
they become unauthenticated.

20
00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.928
So it allows you to just sort of take
a user in as sort of a guest process and

21
00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:14.669
then if they do decide to sign up,

22
00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:18.692
you can actually link their account
with all the data that they've stored.

23
00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:22.642
And another benefit of anonymous
authentication is that when you

24
00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:26.177
write with Firebase SDK you
learn how to spell anonymous.

25
00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:30.724
It's a very difficult word to spell but
you write it all the time.

26
00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:34.745
So, if you're ever in a spelling
bee you're gonna get this one.

27
00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:39.762
So every provider needs to be enabled,
that's a very important thing.

28
00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:44.771
If not we'll give you an error in
the console that's in the browser console

29
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:50.596
that's, hey, you probably didn't enable
this and you're trying to log in with it.

30
00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:55.259
But it's good to know that we need
to enable all providers before use.

31
00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.573
So just like before,

32
00:01:56.573 --> 00:02:01.394
I'm gonna go and I'm just gonna copy code
just to make this go a little faster.

33
00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:06.411
I want to copy just the Firebase app

34
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:12.301
config And now I have this.

35
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.160
So I have my Firebase app.

36
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.428
So I wanna talk to
Firebase authentication.

37
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:19.686
And just like I said previously,
all services or

38
00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:23.267
all Firebase services are in
their own sub packages.

39
00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:25.073
So this is in Firebase off.

40
00:02:25.073 --> 00:02:28.570
All have getter functions so
I can call get auth,

41
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.080
and then now if I want to
pass in the Firebase app.

42
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.978
And from here I can start
signing in users, so

43
00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:40.811
I'm gonna import a method
called signInAnonymously.

44
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:47.856
And so when a user signs in I want to call
signIn Anonymously with the auth object.

45
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:53.150
And then if I wanna get the results
of this user I can say,

46
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.431
const result = await signInAnonymously and

47
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:01.386
then this will give me a user credential.

48
00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:04.654
Which I could say, results.user and

49
00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:09.564
it gives me all this important
information about a user.

50
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:13.946
Now, one thing that you might be noticing
is that just a minute ago I said,

51
00:03:13.946 --> 00:03:16.930
we will never,
ever await the results of things.

52
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.774
We will always do things in loops.

53
00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:21.325
We will be doing that, but

54
00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:25.212
I'm breaking this rule to show why
this is not a good idea to do it.

55
00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:29.741
This is possible, but there's
a better practice, which we'll find.

56
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:35.023
So await that the user will get logged in,
and then we'll push him over to dashboard.

57
00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:39.646
And then within dashboard,
if I wanna get that user,

58
00:03:39.646 --> 00:03:44.804
let me copy some code over and
I copy the Firebase auth code,

59
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:57.546
And let's get auth, And

60
00:03:57.546 --> 00:04:02.986
from here what I actually
can do is I can see

61
00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:09.368
what the user is by
calling auth.current user.

62
00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:12.833
And so this will kind of spit that out and
I'll even just for

63
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.682
visual effects not sure
if I'm displaying it.

64
00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:19.262
I'm going to log off that current user.

65
00:04:19.262 --> 00:04:26.642
All right, so let's start home,
Let's click Sign In.

66
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.205
All right, we signed in.

67
00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:34.038
And we can see we have this
user implementation and

68
00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:37.348
we can say, look at that is anonymous,
this is true.

69
00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:43.825
Let me bump that up, is anonymous is true,
we have metadata created at these times.

70
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:48.987
We have provider ID, Firebase, but
we have what is most important is the UID.

71
00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:55.276
So this UID is how you start associating
user information with data in FireStore.

72
00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:59.060
So as I create documents, I can say,
hey, this document belongs to this user.

73
00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:07.570
And I could do that when I go
here to create a document.

74
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.505
So there's this new markdown.

75
00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:12.291
So right now I'm just kinda
creating this new string.

76
00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:17.320
So instead of doing that,
I'm going to create a new document.

77
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.664
So I'll say const newDoc = doc,
use the markdowns Collection.

78
00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:26.555
And then what do I use as an ID?

79
00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:31.938
Well, if I leave this ID blank it
will actually generate an ID for

80
00:05:31.938 --> 00:05:33.841
me just out of the box.

81
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:40.116
And so now I can say newDoc.id and
all that generation happens on the client.

82
00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:43.535
We don't have to wait to go to
the server to see what our ID is,

83
00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:45.154
all of that is client based.

84
00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:49.413
You'll find that a lot in using
the SDKs happens on the client.

85
00:05:49.413 --> 00:05:53.089
While a lot is async
a lot is also not async.

86
00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.233
It's interesting how it works.

87
00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:57.856
And so now what I need to do though,

88
00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:02.022
I have this document I have
it's ID I want to create it.

89
00:06:02.022 --> 00:06:05.321
So I'm gonna call setDoc, And

90
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:10.132
what I'll do is I'll pass a new doc and
then I wanna give it data and

91
00:06:10.132 --> 00:06:14.960
I'm just gonna fill it with blank
markdown and blank converted.

92
00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:22.315
All right, so now when I click New.

93
00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:26.006
Look at that, up top here, it's kinda
hard to see, but that's a generated one.

94
00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:31.817
So this is a new doc with cool markdown,
okay,

95
00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:37.484
if I click back, there it is right here.

96
00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:39.905
So this is really cool
