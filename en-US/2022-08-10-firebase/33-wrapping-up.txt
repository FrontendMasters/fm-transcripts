[00:00:00]
>> So that is everything I have today. So this doc is full of tons of information to walk through the code examples are everything is located. I hope you've seen that with Firebase that you can use FireStore for real time updates. Now that you can use authentication to sign in providers we can secure it all at security rules with great testing as well as well as doing advanced things with Functions and Firebase Hosting.

[00:00:30]
And we all have the space to do it with an emulator or then deploying to production. So that is the fundamentals of Firebase and thank you all for watching. Wait we have a question.
>> This is more focused on functions. Let's say using your expenses example I have expenses that are actually originate on an outside system, so now in Firebase.

[00:00:52]
If is that a situation where I would use an HD PBS trigger to like that expense gets created that other system that makes that request and then populate Firebase?
>> So where is the or so they say expense lives on another or another server somewhere.
>> Yeah, it's generate.

[00:01:10]

>> Exactly as generate, how would you normally get that? Would that be through like a rest API that you would get that back?
>> Yeah, on some of the system that comes into like, yeah, or like a rest API. Now it exists on that system. Right.
>> Really I want everybody to look at like a Firebase.

[00:01:28]

>> so there's a couple of ways to go about it you could say hey when a user is created or when certain event happens go out with that pert information call to the REST API and store it back in FireStore. So then there's sort of the sync, so I guess the two ways of doing it is either you're figuring out a way to use triggers to synchronize external state of API data on an external network or several servers somewhere within FireStore.

[00:01:54]
So every time something gets updated, it knows to go and call that again. You can even create web hooks also with we have an example. And we have a huge functions, repos functional function sample repo that shows how to do that. But you can create a web hook that will call out to your own request function is another way you could do it.

[00:02:15]
But you have to ask yourself, do I wanna sync that data in with FireStore or do I merely just want an avenue, again API gateway to go out and grab it? So those are really your two ways. You can either sync or you can just use a cloud function to retrieve and then kinda merge together on the client.

[00:02:30]
So hope that was helpful. Okay, cool. All right, and if there's no more questions, thank you all for coming out. [APPLAUSE]
