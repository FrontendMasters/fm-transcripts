1
00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:04.394
So, I'm gonna go inside this Onmounted
because this is what you uses to say, hey,

2
00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.424
when this component's kinda
ready to start doing things.

3
00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:14.161
I'm gonna say onSnapshot, I'm going
to pass in that markdown collection.

4
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.950
And then, this is gonna take a callback.

5
00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:22.770
And this right here is what is
referred to as a data snapshot.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.345
And so a data snapshot is not just
your data, it is a bunch of other

7
00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:33.733
important metadata about it and
other helpful information.

8
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.722
We can get the data by
calling snapshot.data and

9
00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:40.747
then it spits out the data from that.

10
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:43.590
But, we'll see later on as
we get more into FireStore,

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.656
there's a whole lot that we can do here.

12
00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:51.758
And so from here, what I wanna do is,

13
00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:55.490
I want to sync this to view state.

14
00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.157
So I can say state.converted.

15
00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:08.916
State.converted=data.converted and

16
00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:13.930
state.markdown = data.markdown.

17
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.097
So, whenever something syncs,
it will sync to the state and

18
00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:22.279
then that kinda binds to this UI in here,
I call it firebase.

19
00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:28.456
All right, firestore, okay,
it should be good now, cool.

20
00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:33.557
Now, snapshot.data is not
a function probably because of,

21
00:01:33.557 --> 00:01:36.504
something I'm doing on snapshot.

22
00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:39.261
Let's just drop in a good
old debugger statement.

23
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.630
Snapshot.oh, it's cuz
I'm doing collection.

24
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.120
Yes, so this is a really good point here,

25
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.904
this is something that
you'll run into a lot.

26
00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:56.103
Right here, I'm asking to get all of the
documents within the markdown collection.

27
00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:57.788
And I'm saying, let me get its data.

28
00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:00.605
Well, I have a whole list so technically,

29
00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:04.610
what I would need to do is,
I would need to say .docs.

30
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.220
And then within here I have a whole array
of them, and then I can call each one and

31
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.600
get its data.

32
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.863
I don't want to do that, what I wanna do
is, I wanna get an individual document.

33
00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:20.060
And so to do that, I can come into here,
and I can import a document reference.

34
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.240
So we have a collection reference,
I'm gonna use that to get a document.

35
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.020
I'm gonna say markdowndoc is document
passing the markdowns collection.

36
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.996
And then from here, I can say hey,
what's the ID of the specific one?

37
00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:39.278
We're gonna get more into
managing IDs in a bit, but

38
00:02:39.278 --> 00:02:42.049
let's just get it from the route actually.

39
00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.120
So I'm gonna pass it down here and

40
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.490
I can say route.params.id which I
believe it is if I go into main JS.

41
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.450
Yes, this is what we're
capturing the ideas.

42
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.881
And so now whatever the route ideas will
sync up to a document did not pass in

43
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:01.520
the doc is early.

44
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.260
Okay, so now just to recap.

45
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470
I'm saying on snapshot.

46
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.868
Whenever I see a document
the database in real time,

47
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:14.360
I'm going to get its data and
spit it out here and sync it to the state.

48
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.544
Now, this is going to be
a problem because it's saying,

49
00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:22.350
Hey, I don't have any of these properties.

50
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.930
So I'm going to go into the database and
kind of hard code that in.

51
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.170
So if we look at In this, this is RID.

52
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.092
And to go into here into the database,

53
00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:38.014
I'm going to add a document of that and

54
00:03:38.014 --> 00:03:43.531
we're going to say that it's
marked down is hello and

55
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:48.803
I'm just gonna cheat for
now and converted is going

56
00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:54.470
to be like h one of Hello Save Let
me give this a refresh.

57
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.180
All right.
And so, we have this document right here.

58
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.730
And now when I come back to this and
give it a refresh, look at that.

59
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.420
We have that synchronizing
from the database.

60
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.020
If I refresh, it pops in.

61
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.807
But that's just loaded in if I want to
write in I can call a method called

62
00:04:14.807 --> 00:04:20.102
Set doc and so now that I have
the markdown doc that's synced with

63
00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:26.969
the Parameter ID in this convert function
which just says hey whenever there's a,

64
00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:32.265
The key app method on the text area
instead of setting it straight

65
00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:37.855
to the state I'm going to call set
doc with the markdown document And

66
00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:43.990
then I'm going to pass in data of
converted,and then also the markdown.

67
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.129
And I'm going to delete it from here
because this is one of the most important

68
00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.950
concepts and I'm going to actually every
time we run into this concept all day,

69
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.290
I'm going to be talking about
this over and over again.

70
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.801
One of my favorite front of masters
courses is when will sentence does

71
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:07.090
the JavaScript the hard parts and then it
keeps going always goes to the execution

72
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.143
context with the arms out this is like one
of those moments where every time I do

73
00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:17.353
this I'm gonna to point this out and many
back end systems you're used to saying

74
00:05:17.353 --> 00:05:22.482
let me request out this data okay I have
it now I'm going to display it here let me

75
00:05:22.482 --> 00:05:27.689
make an update Let me wait for it Okay now
I'm going to display it here we don't do

76
00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.819
that in the Firebase world what we do is
we have more of a Redux style system where

77
00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.970
we dispatch changes it is very rare that
you will ever say I wanna update data.

78
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.785
And I'm gonna wait for it back or

79
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:43.270
I'm gonna wait to know that
operation has completed.

80
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.490
We're gonna get more into why
that works as we go along.

81
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.320
But right here we're calling set doc,
and we're passing in this data object.

82
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.040
And that's gonna save to FireStore.

83
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.220
And we're not waiting for it to get done.

84
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.000
We're not writing like a weight set doc or
we're not getting back the Document.

85
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.740
What we're doing is we're
triggering on snapshot.

86
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.456
So this is one of the most key things in
all Firebase development you will see this

87
00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:09.580
in Firebase authentication, you will see.

88
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.640
This across the board this is
a unidirectional data flow.

89
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.129
So call a set method call an update,
call delete,

90
00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.530
it will trigger this callback right here.

91
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.030
And this is how we keep
things in real time.

92
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.079
This is how we keep things
very snappy in the UI,

93
00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:29.460
is we say I want to make an operation.

94
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.010
I want to set a document I
want to delete a document.

95
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.330
And I will get its
results in this callback.

96
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:46.530
So now when I save, let's see here
if I say this is working, right?

97
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.860
No errors, so that's great.

98
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.608
And then here we go,
this says this is working right so

99
00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:56.680
now I know that this is working.

100
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.162
And what I want to do now is since
I have this I want to be able to

101
00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:06.583
display the list of these so
I can see that I can write to one and

102
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:09.877
I want to be able to write
create a whole list so

103
00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:15.342
now in dashboard what I'm going to do
is I'm actually just going to copy and

104
00:07:15.342 --> 00:07:20.198
paste code like I said I'm going to
make a lot of mistakes at first so

105
00:07:20.198 --> 00:07:25.922
I'm going to just copy all of this right
here During a copy all of this I'm going

106
00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:31.737
to copy initialize that all my FireStore
imports my config initializing app and

107
00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:36.425
getting my services as well as
the collection reference because

108
00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:41.023
I'm going to want all these things
in the dashboard Hi I'm just

109
00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:45.963
going to paste them in here and then
what I want to do now is I want to say

110
00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:50.905
okay I want to get all of the documents
and display them to this ui li so

111
00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:56.580
if I just assign it to state DOT markdowns
view will take care of the The rest.

112
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.980
And so we'll do what we did before.

113
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.040
We'll call on snapshot.

114
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.390
We'll pass in the collection.

115
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.440
What is it?
Markdowns calls what I called it.

116
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.160
We get our snapshot callback.

117
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.084
Unlike before I showed before this is for
a collection so

118
00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:20.011
it's gonna have a whole list whereas
documents are a single object and

119
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:24.936
so what I can say right here is I can
say state.markdowns to bind to that

120
00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:27.940
list I can tap into
the snapshot Call docs,

121
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.330
since it's just a plain old
JavaScript array, I can call map.

122
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.440
And from here, I can say d for data or
for actually stands for document.

123
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.320
That's why you should have
better naming than that.

124
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:49.150
I can return an object and
I can say that it's ID is d.id.

125
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.830
Because I'm not storing
the ID within the data.

126
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:57.259
And then I can do this cool
JavaScript trick which I spread

127
00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:03.250
the rest of the data out so
kind of merges it all into one object so

128
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.680
now when I save we We
have ourselves markdown.

129
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.700
So if I click into this one,
this is so cool.

130
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.360
All right, need to put a space there.

131
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.690
So now I have this little Markdown editor.

132
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.270
If I click back, back in,
it's still there.

133
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:24.930
That's awesome.

134
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.910
So the last thing I want
to do is sign users in.

135
00:09:29.924 --> 00:09:30.720
Yes question.

136
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.125
If that method is unit directional,.

137
00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:37.260
&gt;&gt; How do you manage errors if
you don't get any feedback?

138
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.890
&gt;&gt; That is a great, great question.

139
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.552
For the most part the fire when I'll
be getting an interest in the fire

140
00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:50.107
store section In the FireStore
are most of the SDKs try

141
00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:53.110
to handle a lot of the errors for you.

142
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.700
You most of the rejection errors you are
going to get are due to security roles.

143
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.290
Someone trying to write data to
locations that they are not allowed to.

144
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.915
So it is not actually all that common,

145
00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:09.870
you will need to handle those cuz the SDK
handles that behind the scenes for you.

146
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.675
But if you need to listen,

147
00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:17.020
there is another callback where you can
check the error state inside of here.

148
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.819
This is, if you're used to RX js,
or observables in general,

149
00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:25.622
this follows a whole observer
pattern from here So

150
00:10:25.622 --> 00:10:30.243
if you need to get errors you get
it inside of this callback but

151
00:10:30.243 --> 00:10:34.610
you'll find that that is less
common than you might think
