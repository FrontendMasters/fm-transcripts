WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.361
To demonstrate this,
I'm gonna build a simple, naÃ¯ve,

2
00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:08.510
Firebase site, and
I'm gonna make tons of mistakes.

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.455
So this is not the best practice section,
this is the,

4
00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:14.000
let's learn from the mistake section.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.697
So if you wanna follow along, you can,
I'm gonna be going pretty fast,

6
00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:22.326
so, you can just kinda can watch me,
go through it too.

7
00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:25.780
But this is in
the 1-fast-but-not-good-setup.

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.346
And from there, if you have npm install,
and npm run dev, it'll boot up a Vue.js

9
00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:37.096
app, and if you're not used to Vue,
don't worry, it's actually pretty simple.

10
00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:41.620
So, I'm at the root of this directory,
and I'm gonna say,

11
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.210
cd 1-fast-but-not-good-setup, and then
go to start, and then open up my code.

12
00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:52.983
All right.

13
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.654
So the way this app works is that
everything starts in main, just to kinda

14
00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:02.376
show how it works, we have a router,
this is not related to the Firebase code.

15
00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:06.941
But just kinda acclimate
everyone to the code base router,

16
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:11.321
it goes to a home component,
a dashboard component, and

17
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:16.636
then editor, we're gonna be making
a real-time Markdown editor.

18
00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:22.696
And if I go and run,
I have my node modules installed,

19
00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:26.617
so I am just going to do npm run dev.

20
00:01:26.617 --> 00:01:31.173
And that's gonna boot me up on localhost:

21
00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:36.369
3000 by default,
which I think I need to go.

22
00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.071
Google's 2000 right here and this is just
this beautiful page, as you can see.

23
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:43.726
Zoom in we're going to
sign into user right now.

24
00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:46.036
None of that's happening
just clicking through it and

25
00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:49.109
then it's going to show a list of
Markdown documents which none exists.

26
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:56.069
And then when we click New we'll be able
to write mark down on one side and and

27
00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:03.052
it will all show up in real time because
right now I'll just lose any changes

28
00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:09.793
So going to, I'm going to start,
let's start with the fun spot.

29
00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:14.152
Like what I really want to do is I
want to synchronize data in real time

30
00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:15.148
to the editor.

31
00:02:15.148 --> 00:02:20.827
So the first thing if I want to
connect out to a Firebase project,

32
00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:25.980
or data to Firebase back end,
I need to create In project in

33
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.026
the Firebase console and so
the way with that is if you go to

34
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:36.733
console.firebase.google.com this
will sign you in with a.

35
00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:42.139
If you're with a Google account and then
this is my project, but this is the Front

36
00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.928
of Masters projects I'm making but
I'll go and make one from scratch.

37
00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:51.309
Now I'm gonna ask the audience
participation what's a good name In no

38
00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.911
numbers less less it's got a good rate
of like because there's going to be

39
00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.364
a point behind this too so like think
about this as like this is a Markdown

40
00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:05.143
editor like what what would you want to
type into it Were URL to go to a web app.

41
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:09.771
Like markdown me.

42
00:03:09.771 --> 00:03:12.006
Like, markdown dash me.

43
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.774
I don't know I kind of
like is that we get there?

44
00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:15.298
&gt;&gt; Yes.
Good.

45
00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:16.033
&gt;&gt; Okay.

46
00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.307
All right.

47
00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:20.411
So you can enable enable Google Analytics.

48
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.330
I'm not going to use that for now.

49
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.925
So I'm just gonna go through and
create the project.

50
00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:28.582
So there's the jam stack
like can you maybe talk

51
00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:33.267
about how that's related or
&gt;&gt; yeah Firebase and

52
00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:37.158
the jam stack go very well together so

53
00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:43.571
with jam stack you have you JavaScript,
and Markdown work.

54
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:44.769
I can't remember what it is.

55
00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.042
There's so many acronyms, but

56
00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:52.092
with JAMstack the philosophy is I
have all these static documents, and

57
00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:57.056
I can render things out as statically
as possible, but where needed,

58
00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:01.852
I can talk to some back end service Us and
from that backend service,

59
00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:06.679
render you know whatever or
do it make a payment to do all this stuff.

60
00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:11.342
Firebase works really well because
JAMstack works great with serverless

61
00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:15.175
architecture and Firebase is
all serverless So jam stack and

62
00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:17.292
Firebase go very well together.

63
00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:21.170
You know, regardless of what you're
choosing to deploy on or whatever,

64
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.430
you can store data in your, in FireStore.

65
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.050
You can authenticate users
to Firebase authentication.

66
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.399
And it's it's very jammy.

67
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.549
I don't know if that's what they
say the jam stack world, but

68
00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:33.680
I'd like to think that's what they say.

69
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.444
So now I have my project created And

70
00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:41.606
the first thing you wanna do is
you want to create a Firebase app.

71
00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:46.597
So Firebase projects they house all
of this stuff don't worry too much

72
00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:51.604
about it these are all the things that
we gonna be using in the console.

73
00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:56.930
But to talk to these,
&gt;&gt; Services we need to create an app.

74
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.792
And so app it doesn't matter
much what you name your app,

75
00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:05.310
I call all my apps defaults because
I really only use the first one.

76
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.723
And then I just click Register.

77
00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:11.059
And this is going to
give me a very important

78
00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:13.940
object called the firebase config.

79
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.811
Now, this configuration object right
here It can be a little scary for

80
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:21.890
people at first, especially because
they see this thing called API key.

81
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.363
So we're gonna put this in
our client side application.

82
00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:28.659
And it's gonna be just fun.

83
00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.435
The amount of times I have answered
Stack Overflow questions or

84
00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:36.581
let people know these are not
the security keys are not the problems.

85
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:41.234
This is all Client side keys
these are all publishable.

86
00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:45.689
This is, basically, just how Firebase
knows how to speak to your specific

87
00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.017
back end if you're worried about well
what happens with all my data how.

88
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.223
Hey, how do I secure that?

89
00:05:51.223 --> 00:05:54.547
We have a whole section today devoted
to how we're going to keep everything

90
00:05:54.547 --> 00:05:55.296
really secure.

91
00:05:55.296 --> 00:05:58.119
And this is not a problem.

92
00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:01.722
So we're gonna copy all
of this right here.

93
00:06:01.722 --> 00:06:07.000
And going back into an app,
I'm going to create a new file.

94
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.814
And I'm just actually I have
a flower here config And

95
00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:14.369
right here it says Export
consequence config and

96
00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:19.396
I'm just going to paste in all of that so
now I have my config in here and

97
00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:24.685
I can start connecting out to Firebase so
I'm gonna go into the editor dot

98
00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:29.972
view because I want to I want to make
this a In real time so the way this works

99
00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:35.001
is it just uses some some of us like
lifecycle and reactive methods and

100
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:40.549
it's used as its router so I know what
route I'm on and then I use this library

101
00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:45.718
called snark down which is like
a super lightweight Markdown editor.

102
00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:48.143
And I just do a little bit
of like enhancing on it.

103
00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:50.510
So, just some customization.

104
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.496
But now I'm gonna import, from Firebase.

105
00:06:57.496 --> 00:07:02.654
If this already comes pre baked with all
Firebase installed, but normally what you

106
00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:07.660
would do is, you would Here in the editor
you would just do, I was really far off,

107
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.956
but you would do npm i firebase,
and that's it, it's really tiny.

108
00:07:11.956 --> 00:07:16.974
So I'm going to kinda just show right
here, you would just npm i firebase,

109
00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:20.411
npm install if you wanna
write the whole thing out.

110
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:23.530
But that installs
Firebase JavaScript library, and

111
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.280
the JavaScript library is how
we're gonna talk to everything.

112
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.288
So the first thing we're gonna
do is we're going to initialise

113
00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:31.546
a firebase application.

114
00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:34.819
So it knows how to speak to the back end.

115
00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:41.984
So using that,
I also want to import my config../config.

116
00:07:41.984 --> 00:07:43.490
There we go.

117
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.083
And that has a config object.

118
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:51.223
And then from here,
I can create a firebase app.

119
00:07:51.223 --> 00:07:55.976
So initializeApp and
then I'm going to pass in config.firebase.

120
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.937
So this right here,
it sets up the foundation for

121
00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.428
being able to talk to apps, but
we're not actually talking to anything.

122
00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:06.736
So what I want to do is I want to be able
to say, hey, I want to go on to FireStore.

123
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.249
And I want to synchronize data.

124
00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:12.094
&gt;&gt; Well here in the console.

125
00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:15.579
If I open up and I click FireStore
database, the first thing

126
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:20.058
I'm going to need to do when you set this
up is you want to provision this out.

127
00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:23.110
So this is kind of a lot
of steps at first, but

128
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.164
we still automatically provision
your database for you.

129
00:08:27.164 --> 00:08:31.040
But what we found is is that it's
probably best to not create resources.

130
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.661
That you don't need at first,
this is more so for security.

131
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.528
And then we also kind of prompt you.

132
00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:39.270
This is sort of a taste
into security roles.

133
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:44.031
We're going to start in test mode,
which is not good to do long term.

134
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:47.830
Basically, all this is saying is,
is that anyone can read and

135
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.305
write to this database until,
By this date right here, so June 30th.

136
00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:57.542
Then you can select where you want your
database to be, I'm going to have mine

137
00:08:57.542 --> 00:09:03.283
be in US Central, and that's going to go
out and create a cloud FireStore database.

138
00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:10.002
And then when I start writing to it,
we'll see all the updates appear and

139
00:09:10.002 --> 00:09:13.541
everything that's gonna go out you.

140
00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:18.353
&gt;&gt; Great and so this is where I could
create data I could start writing in,

141
00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:23.412
we'll have something like markdowns
would be the name of a collection and

142
00:09:23.412 --> 00:09:28.388
then the document ID I can click an auto
ID And then you would have markdown

143
00:09:28.388 --> 00:09:32.710
it'd be like hello something like that and
then when I save it,

144
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.767
we have ourselves a little document
right here so this is sort of your basic

145
00:09:37.767 --> 00:09:43.024
structure we're gonna get way more into
this This in the upcoming section.

146
00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:46.213
And so what I'm gonna do now is I
wanna connect out to fire store.

147
00:09:46.213 --> 00:09:51.263
So I'm going to import a subpage
from the fire base library.

148
00:09:51.263 --> 00:09:55.295
So the way that everything works within
fire base, if you, everything has to use

149
00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:59.050
app because the app will share
authentication state across all services.

150
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.955
&gt;&gt; But first but any other sub package
you're using, so whether it be off or

151
00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:09.185
FireStore or remote config or you know
a bunch of other things that I'm can't

152
00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:14.594
remember off the top my head right now,
they all contain in these sub packages.

153
00:10:14.594 --> 00:10:18.714
And each sub package will have
a getter method that says, hey,

154
00:10:18.714 --> 00:10:20.363
let me get that service.

155
00:10:20.363 --> 00:10:25.658
And then from there we'll have access
to FireStore called Get FireStore.

156
00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:30.600
And optionally, if you want you can
pass in the Firebase app because then it

157
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.543
knows what app it's associated with
behind the scenes if you don't pass it

158
00:10:35.543 --> 00:10:40.094
in it will still figure it out I like
to pass it in just to be explicit And

159
00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:45.448
then if I want to grab data, I'm gonna
start by calling this collection method.

160
00:10:45.448 --> 00:10:50.157
And what this will do is I can
say all right, let's go out to

161
00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:55.080
the markdowns collection and
let's see what exists there.

162
00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:04.625
So this right here is
referred to as a reference.

163
00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:07.964
It doesn't actually get any data
unless we do something with it,

164
00:11:07.964 --> 00:11:10.225
but it refers to a location
in the database.

165
00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:15.560
So right here, this refers to this
collection of markdowns, and it would

166
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.653
be able to reach out to this document and
be able to show me everything.

167
00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:21.978
I got a little error right there.

168
00:11:21.978 --> 00:11:24.507
&gt;&gt; But basically this would say like, hey,

169
00:11:24.507 --> 00:11:27.624
this is this is how you get
to a spot in the database.

170
00:11:27.624 --> 00:11:30.564
And if I want to read
the spot in real time,

171
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:33.510
I can use this method called on snapshot.

172
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.771
And on snapshot receives
a collection reference and

173
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:42.193
then every single time any update happens
whether that's a delete An update, right?

174
00:11:42.193 --> 00:11:45.810
It will trigger a callback that
gives you the new data automatically

175
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.340
that can surface to the app.

176
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.223
Yes, Mark.

177
00:11:49.223 --> 00:11:56.858
&gt;&gt; Is the initialized app config different
in a SSR library, such as Next.js?

178
00:11:56.858 --> 00:12:00.136
&gt;&gt; So the Firebase SDK.

179
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:05.320
Has ability to like handle
like Node environments up to

180
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:12.882
a certain point certain features are not
notable because they rely on browser.

181
00:12:12.882 --> 00:12:16.815
We do our best to know up in those
cases there's some edge cases I believe

182
00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:21.210
specifically with next where you might
need to write like an if statement around

183
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.406
stuff but we have a current project we're
working on trying to make that a lot

184
00:12:25.406 --> 00:12:29.735
easier so hopefully by the time that this
is all cut up and everything yes it will

185
00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:33.341
work very good with next if not just
If statement here are there for

186
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.687
things that rely on browser
API's Great question though and

187
00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:40.819
there's also a server library that you
can swap Firebase out for as well but

188
00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:45.260
that has different implications and
we'll get to that here in an upcoming one.
