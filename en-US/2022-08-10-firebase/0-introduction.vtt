00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.250
Hello, everyone,
this is Firebase fundamentals.

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.090
I have one goal today, and
that is to teach you all how to build real

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.440
time authenticated, secure and
scalable websites on Firebase.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.500
My name is David East.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.348
I'm a developer relations engineer and I
am very excited to be here today because,

6
00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:24.590
well, I love teaching people Firebase and
also I love FrontedMasters.

7
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.751
I mean, it's not related to the course,
but I have been here, I've been watching

8
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.870
fFrontedMasters since 2013, so this is
a nice check on the bucket list item.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.200
So we're gonna have
a lot of fun here today.

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.418
So ,before I jump into everything
that we're gonna be doing,

11
00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:43.220
I wanna kinda go through
the logistics of this course.

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.610
So things that you need
to have installed and

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.723
where we're gonna be getting
the course material from.

14
00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:53.189
I'm gonna have this site deployed,
this is fronted-masters.web.app,

15
00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:54.293
you can go to that.

16
00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:57.296
Also everything in this course or
in this site,

17
00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:02.329
I like call this the companion guide,
but everything in this companion guide,

18
00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.406
all that we're gonna be doing is
on this GitHub repo right here.

19
00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:10.625
So if you clone that down and
you wanna run this site locally,

20
00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.202
you can do that just cd into the guide and
npm i and then npm run dev.

21
00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:19.627
But also we want to make sure that we
have Java 18 is the one I recommend

22
00:01:19.627 --> 00:01:23.377
installing because that's what
worked on my machine, but

23
00:01:23.377 --> 00:01:28.627
anywhere between Java 12 to 18 should be
good and Node 16 also recommended but

24
00:01:28.627 --> 00:01:32.870
I believe anything Node 12
through 16 should be good.

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.344
The GitHub repo the way it works is
that we have all these folders which

26
00:01:37.344 --> 00:01:41.896
are numbered off of the sections that
we're gonna be going through and

27
00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.996
each one has a start and a final.

28
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:47.296
Final is obviously everything
that's finished and

29
00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:50.976
started just kind of gonna
have all the boilerplate code.

30
00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:55.907
So when we get to the exercises and demo
parts of this, we're gonna go to that cd

31
00:01:55.907 --> 00:02:00.340
internet, npm install it and
then run all the code and see it all work.

32
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.700
So that's how it's gonna go.

33
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.551
So I'm going to start out with a little
bit of an intro about Firebase.

34
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:14.580
And so with this,
you can kind of think about this companion

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.710
guide is like a bit of an e-book
it's got a ton of information

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.337
I wrote through it with
a little table of contents, but

37
00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:29.190
if you hit the period key,
it turns into slides.

38
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.600
I was really proud about that one.

39
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.816
&gt;&gt; Why do we need to install Java?

40
00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:36.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, great question.

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.310
Why do you need to install Java?

42
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.922
Because Java is similar to JavaScript,
and I'm just kidding.

43
00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:46.516
Because we're gonna be using
the Firebase emulator suite, and

44
00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:49.748
the Firebase emulator suite is a big jar,
and

45
00:02:49.748 --> 00:02:53.950
it actually has a bunch of
Java code that needs to run.

46
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.514
You won't be writing any Java, but you
need to do that to run Firebase services

47
00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:01.922
locally, which is a best
practice in the Firebase world.

48
00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.070
So what is Firebase?

49
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.243
Firebase is a platform for
building mobile and web applications,

50
00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:17.245
and it has over 20 products or
services or features,

51
00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:23.004
however you wanna call them, and that
can feel kind of overwhelming at first.

52
00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:27.783
We could go into the Firebase site,
which I think this one right here,

53
00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:32.400
and you can see that there's even
three pillars, there's Build,

54
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.840
Release and Monitor, and Engage.

55
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.596
Now we're going to be focusing
on this Build pillar, but

56
00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:43.053
even within Build, we have one,
two, three, four, five, six,

57
00:03:43.053 --> 00:03:47.380
seven, eight, nine, ten,
11 products or services on here.

58
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.900
And then even in these ones Release and
Monitor, Engaged is even more in there.

59
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.805
I think the total number depending on how
you count, it is like anywhere to 24 and

60
00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:56.410
26 things.

61
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.490
But the good news is you don't have to
worry about learning 24 or 26 different

62
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.810
things, you just need to kind of think
about Firebase in two different ways.

63
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.642
I'd like to say that Firebase
is serverless infrastructure for

64
00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:15.370
developers and growth tools for
business developers and marketers.

65
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.565
So both parts are important, one will
help you build all your stuff out and

66
00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:23.828
the other will help you kind of help
with a lot of KPIs, statistics, ARPU,

67
00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:28.496
a lot of other business words that I'm not
super great at because I like to hide over

68
00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:31.947
here in the Build section, and
let the Release and Monitor,

69
00:04:31.947 --> 00:04:35.290
Engaged people tell me things
about how that world works.

70
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.557
But so today we're just going to
be working all on the serverless

71
00:04:39.557 --> 00:04:43.240
infrastructure side and how we're
going to be building with Firebase.

72
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.380
And I love to tell the story
about how Firebase got started.

73
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.405
So Firebase is over ten years old at
this point and even before Firebase

74
00:04:55.405 --> 00:05:01.708
started out back I think in 2011 or so,
2012 something around that timeframe,

75
00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:07.669
Firebase was actually a startup called
Envolve, kind of like evolve, involve and

76
00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.960
it was a chat widget that was very popular
to be embedded on celebrity websites.

77
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.776
And you would just kind of put that on
there and then everyone on a fan site can

78
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.880
all talk to each other or
to the celebrity of choice.

79
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.220
And that was something that
was going really popular, but

80
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.710
they started noticing a trend
with a lot of their customers.

81
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.218
They would have these feedback sessions,
and they would ask them like,

82
00:05:31.218 --> 00:05:34.300
Hey, what would you like
to do with the chat widget?

83
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.699
And they had a lot of customers that say,
Actually, what we're doing is we're

84
00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.430
setting display none on your chat widget
and we're just writing JavaScript messages

85
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.043
as JSON and then we're deserializing
them on other clients, and

86
00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:51.250
we can run our entire application state
that way through your chat widget.

87
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.631
And they realised, people are using
this as a real time database, so

88
00:05:55.631 --> 00:06:00.170
they went and they pivoted and they
rebuilt the whole platform as Firebase.

89
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.180
Today, we're gonna be covering
all from that perspective,

90
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.574
we're going to be talking
about Firebase Hosting,

91
00:06:07.574 --> 00:06:11.753
which is how you can deploy your
site from the CLI to a Global CDN.

92
00:06:11.753 --> 00:06:16.269
We're going to be covering FireStore,
which is a cloud hosted real time

93
00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:20.047
database, Firebase authentication so
you can sign users up

94
00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:25.460
without having to run a server and
manage accounts and things like that.

95
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.480
We're gonna also talk about security, how
we're gonna make sure all this is secure.

96
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.288
Since it's a serverless system,

97
00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:34.010
the security is a bit different
than a traditional system.

98
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.805
And then we're gonna end up the day why
talking about Cloud Functions about all

99
00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:40.219
the times where you do need
to run server code, and

100
00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:42.749
it's really cool to do it
in response to events, and

101
00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.340
that we're going to learn all those
events before we get to that section.

102
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.150
So for me, my name is David East.

103
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.939
I've actually been working on Firebase
since 2014 back when it was a little

104
00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:55.590
startup.

105
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.022
This is my picture from my Week 1.

106
00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:01.807
Yeah, that was me over eight
years ago with the hair and

107
00:07:01.807 --> 00:07:04.933
my wife begged me not to use this picture,
but

108
00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:10.640
I think it's kind of shows maybe the
wisdom, maybe I've grown since those days.

109
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.951
I had no idea what I was doing then.

110
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:18.194
And so with Firebase, it can be kind of
a perspective shift when you first start

111
00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:23.280
out, because if you've been used to
building traditional applications or

112
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.056
as Firebase applications,
things are going to be a little different.

113
00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:31.312
With a traditional architecture,
you have a client,

114
00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:36.261
it could be a phone, it could be a laptop,
it could be so many different things, and

115
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:40.643
if it wants to reach out to your back end,
you are going to do, let's say,

116
00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:44.650
a get request through to some
API that lives on your server.

117
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.230
And then that's going to go
out to some storage layer.

118
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.988
And then maybe that also reaches out
to some authentication system, but

119
00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:56.902
your server acts as a sort of centralized
API gateway is a common term people

120
00:07:56.902 --> 00:07:58.050
have for that.

121
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.076
And so you reach out to one server or
what you kind of see as one server, and

122
00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:05.650
then you reach out to all of
the solutions hosted on that server.

123
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.770
With Firebase, it's a lot different
because you just reach out to the service.

124
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.148
That's it, there's no common API gateway.

125
00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:17.265
You could make one with Cloud Functions,
but

126
00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:19.979
you'll lose a lot by doing it that way.

127
00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:23.911
You say hey I want to talk to your
database, you go talk to the database.

128
00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:26.682
You say,
Hey I want to go upload some binary files,

129
00:08:26.682 --> 00:08:28.303
you go talk to Cloud Storage.

130
00:08:28.303 --> 00:08:31.146
You want to say,
Hey I want to talk to my Cloud Function,

131
00:08:31.146 --> 00:08:34.851
you go talk to your Cloud Function,
you This go straight to the service.

132
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:38.928
And so that is a bit of a perspective
shift because you aren't just wrangling

133
00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:43.388
everything up on a server and sending it
down, you are thinking about everything as

134
00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:45.831
talking to one individual
service at a time.
