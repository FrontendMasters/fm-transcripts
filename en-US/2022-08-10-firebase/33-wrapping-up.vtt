00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.980
So that is everything I have today.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.894
So this doc is full of tons of
information to walk through the code

3
00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.810
examples are everything is located.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.851
I hope you've seen that with Firebase
that you can use FireStore for

5
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.363
real time updates.

6
00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:22.893
Now that you can use authentication
to sign in providers we can secure it

7
00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:26.519
all at security rules with great
testing as well as well as

8
00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.467
doing advanced things with Functions and
Firebase Hosting.

9
00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:35.633
And we all have the space to do it with an
emulator or then deploying to production.

10
00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:41.622
So that is the fundamentals of Firebase
and thank you all for watching.

11
00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.836
Wait we have a question.

12
00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:45.225
&gt;&gt; This is more focused on functions.

13
00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:49.720
Let's say using your expenses example I
have expenses that are actually originate

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.370
on an outside system, so now in Firebase.

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.447
If is that a situation where I would use
an HD PBS trigger to like that expense

16
00:00:57.447 --> 00:01:03.188
gets created that other system that makes
that request and then populate Firebase?

17
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:07.098
&gt;&gt; So where is the or so
they say expense lives on another or

18
00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:09.143
another server somewhere.

19
00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:10.117
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's generate.

20
00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:16.010
&gt;&gt; Exactly as generate,
how would you normally get that?

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.153
Would that be through like a rest
API that you would get that back?

22
00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:23.132
&gt;&gt; Yeah, on some of the system that comes
into like, yeah, or like a rest API.

23
00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:24.551
Now it exists on that system.

24
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.241
Right.
&gt;&gt; Really I want everybody to look at like

25
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.030
a Firebase.

26
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.319
&gt;&gt; so there's a couple of ways to go
about it you could say hey when a user is

27
00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.977
created or when certain event happens
go out with that pert information call

28
00:01:36.977 --> 00:01:39.836
to the REST API and
store it back in FireStore.

29
00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:44.617
So then there's sort of the sync, so
I guess the two ways of doing it is either

30
00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:49.553
you're figuring out a way to use triggers
to synchronize external state of API

31
00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:54.458
data on an external network or several
servers somewhere within FireStore.

32
00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:58.527
So every time something gets updated,
it knows to go and call that again.

33
00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:03.444
You can even create web hooks
also with we have an example.

34
00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.061
And we have a huge functions,

35
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.631
repos functional function sample
repo that shows how to do that.

36
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:13.495
But you can create a web hook that will
call out to your own request function is

37
00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:15.319
another way you could do it.

38
00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.228
But you have to ask yourself, do I wanna
sync that data in with FireStore or

39
00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:23.070
do I merely just want an avenue,
again API gateway to go out and grab it?

40
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.410
So those are really your two ways.

41
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.349
You can either sync or you can just
use a cloud function to retrieve and

42
00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.130
then kinda merge together on the client.

43
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.840
So hope that was helpful.

44
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.110
Okay, cool.

45
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.425
All right, and if there's no more
questions, thank you all for coming out.

46
00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:42.780
