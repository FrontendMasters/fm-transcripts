1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
All right, so we are going to just create
some real-time streams in mapover app.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.256
And so, if you want to follow
along with this exercise, you can.

3
00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:10.387
I will ask you all to do it.

4
00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:12.695
If not, you don't have to worry about it.

5
00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:19.467
So, in the terminal here,
I'm going to CD into 3-cloud-firestore,

6
00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.756
and then I am going to CD into start.

7
00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.592
And let's see here.

8
00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:26.861
[INAUDIBLE] in here,
yeah, okay, we're good.

9
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.365
Let's open that up.

10
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:39.676
And then now,
I'm gonna run everything locally here.

11
00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:44.463
So I'm going to do an npm run dev and
this is gonna boot up.

12
00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:48.321
And what you can see right here
it says importing data from.

13
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:53.034
And that's because here, in this local
folder, I have a whole export of users and

14
00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.417
then Firebase Export.

15
00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:59.310
Now, I don't write any
of this local folder.

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.370
This gets generated for
me by the emulator itself.

17
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.730
So any data that I seeded by scripting, or

18
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.111
any data that I just manually did,
can be saved out to this folder.

19
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.123
All right, so we are on what ports?

20
00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:17.513
3000.

21
00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:18.658
So here are the exercises.

22
00:01:18.658 --> 00:01:20.889
We're gonna start with
creating real-time streams.

23
00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:23.323
And so I have this little table.

24
00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:26.528
We are going to just
write data to this table.

25
00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:27.416
That's all we're gonna do.

26
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:30.507
It's pretty straightforward.

27
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.981
So let's go into components.

28
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.847
So now, let's go into source, components.

29
00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:44.194
And then this one is in, sorry, pages and
this one is in RealtimeStreams.

30
00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:48.026
So to get this to work with view,
I kinda set up some boilerplate.

31
00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:50.951
The first thing we're gonna wanna do is
we're gonna create a real-time stream and

32
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:52.552
that's going to give
us back snapshot data.

33
00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:57.733
And then from there, we're gonna wanna
transform the object that's returned.

34
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:03.864
So what we're gonna do is, we're going
to make sure we have on snapshot.

35
00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.048
And we're going to use
the users collection.

36
00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:09.048
So I've created a collection
to start out with.

37
00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:13.978
Pass in Ffreftore and
we have referencing out to users.

38
00:02:13.978 --> 00:02:18.526
And just also, I want to point out,
is that this is connected out to

39
00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:23.903
the emulator suite, which is running
right now for me on localhost 4000.

40
00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:28.076
And if I click into authentication,
I have a ton of users that we've set up.

41
00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:32.404
And then I also have a very complex
data structure full of users.

42
00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:36.485
And the data structure's not complex, but
a big data structure full of users and

43
00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:37.092
expenses.

44
00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:40.081
So we're gonna be reading
from these users right here.

45
00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:45.320
So I have a users collection.

46
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.317
Well, what method do we use to read in
real time, or function I should say?

47
00:02:50.317 --> 00:02:53.244
What function do we use in real time?

48
00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:53.984
&gt;&gt; Snapshot?

49
00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.884
&gt;&gt; Yes, see,
these moments are important to me.

50
00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:59.675
I have my hand up for the high five, and

51
00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:05.094
I don't wanna be walking around the bench
and no one giving me a high five.

52
00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:08.995
All right, so exactly,
I'm gonna call on snapshot and

53
00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:11.903
I'm gonna pass in the users collection.

54
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:17.669
And then this is gonna give
us our callback, and awesome.

55
00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:22.574
So, now, I've done this, and
what I wanna do is that I have it all

56
00:03:22.574 --> 00:03:26.424
abstracted out to components
that do to the table.

57
00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:32.080
It's not important to know how it
works but it binds the state.results.

58
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.507
So I can say state.results =.

59
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:39.850
And what I want to do is I
want to say snapshot.docs,

60
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.424
because it's a collection of documents.

61
00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:47.978
Call map, and then what's great about
the map function is that what I really

62
00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:51.048
wanna do is I wanna pass in
a general function to it.

63
00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:53.614
And then do some work within there.

64
00:03:53.614 --> 00:03:56.176
So I wanna pass in format user.

65
00:03:58.252 --> 00:03:59.811
And then, within here,

66
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:03.906
this will call it with the document
snapshot that gets passed in.

67
00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:07.886
And then I can start plucking data off and
returning the object I want.

68
00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:09.149
So what object do I want?

69
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:13.736
We wanna get a Uid, First name,
Last name, Highscore,

70
00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:17.860
City, and
don't worry about FromCache from now.

71
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.645
If you want to try to
fill that in you can.

72
00:04:19.645 --> 00:04:21.540
If not, don't worry about it.

73
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.210
And now I'm gonna turn it over to you all,
for those who are doing the exercise.

74
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:35.380
See if you can return with this snapshot,
its data, and get it bound to the table.
