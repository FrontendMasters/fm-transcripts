00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.894
I got a question about anonymous auth and
kind of, so my understanding,

2
00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:08.278
really with apps in the Apple ecosystem,
right?

3
00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:09.857
Usually you have to,

4
00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:13.083
one of the requirements I believe is-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

5
00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.756
&gt;&gt; The app has to work without signing in,
right?

6
00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.779
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So they don't just download an app and

7
00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.160
then it does nothing, right?

8
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.923
So yeah, what's that look like, I guess,

9
00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:23.848
anonymous login and
then to iCloud or Google?

10
00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:25.662
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, you're 100% right,

11
00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:28.736
this is actually one of my favorite
features of anonymous auth.

12
00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:30.776
And I did a talk in the past on this one.

13
00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:35.425
So let's say you have an iOS app and
we also have a feature called

14
00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:40.806
Dynamic Links that allow you to link
out to deep link someone into an app.

15
00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:45.334
So if someone's like check out this recipe
in your recipe app and they tap on it.

16
00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:48.873
No one likes tapping the link and
then it pops up and it's like login, and

17
00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:51.151
you're like I just wanted
to read the recipe.

18
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.220
So what you can do is
you can do a deep link.

19
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.642
And then instead of logging in, you can
say this user doesn't have an account,

20
00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.404
let's log them in anonymously.

21
00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:04.778
And so they get access to these pages and
everything, but

22
00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:08.708
they're not a long term
user of this application.

23
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:12.163
And then if they're clicking around and
they're like, I wish I could save recipes,

24
00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:13.036
I wish I could do that.

25
00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.825
You can say, great,
upgrade to full account with us, and

26
00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.839
then you do the account linking.

27
00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:23.918
So it does allow you to write your
whole app as if it is only allows for

28
00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:25.384
authentication.

29
00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.834
But when someone comes in who
you want to use as a guest or

30
00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:33.034
just not have to create a profile,
anonymous auth is the way to go.

31
00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:36.034
And then any state that they save,

32
00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:41.007
they can still persist that
UID onto a full time account.

33
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.913
So it's a really nice upgrade and without
having to put a big wall in front of them.

34
00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:47.808
So yeah, you're 100% right.

35
00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:48.992
All right, your question.

36
00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:53.146
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to implement a custom auth
provider is there any specification you

37
00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:56.433
have to follow or is it OAuth or
can you say more about that?

38
00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:59.653
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like custom auth
involved some server code,

39
00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:02.106
cuz we have to connect out to your server.

40
00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:05.194
It's the most involved,
I would say, of all the setups.

41
00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:09.546
But basically we need to know some
things about how to make sure that

42
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:13.743
when users are coming in from
your back-end that were minting,

43
00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:16.945
we're able to verify and
mint things properly.

44
00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:20.231
But then at that point, they are using
Firebase Authentication, but

45
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:22.413
they're still a part of
your account system.

46
00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:26.600
We're just using them as a token
generator, basically, so

47
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.277
you can be secure with other Firebase
services, which we're about to dive into.

48
00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:35.891
&gt;&gt; So would you send like an email and
password to our token service,

49
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:37.541
get token back, similarly?

50
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.970
&gt;&gt; Depending on how
your auth system works.

51
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.919
So your auth system very well could
be an email and password-based one,

52
00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.038
you'll have to create sort
of like a custom credential.

53
00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:52.289
But you also could have a OAuth
system that could be, or

54
00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:59.381
also we supply a lot of OAuth providers,
but we don't provide many more.

55
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:03.872
And so I don't think you can
log in with Instagram or

56
00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:07.957
LinkedIn, I don't believe those are there.

57
00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:12.185
But in those cases you can use
custom auth to log in with those.

58
00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:13.934
And so custom auth's very flexible.

59
00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:17.027
So it depends on what provider
you're using, however it goes.

60
00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:18.709
Yeah, you just kinda link it up together,

61
00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.139
it's kind of hard to say off the top of my
head, it's kind of this mult-step process.

62
00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.890
But it's not too intensive and there's
a ton of documentation on how to do it.

63
00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:28.714
All right.

64
00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:32.526
&gt;&gt; I liked your comment about
custom auth versus going all in,

65
00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:37.278
I don't know if you can talk to that-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so someone asked when you would

66
00:03:37.278 --> 00:03:41.696
do something like Firebase Authentication
or when you should do your own.

67
00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:44.518
I would just always say that
authentication is very important,

68
00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:46.145
it's super important to get right.

69
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:51.537
So no matter what you do, you just go all
in on whatever approach you want to do.

70
00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:55.250
So if you want to use something
like a third party tool,

71
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.032
like Firebase Authentication to
manage your users, that's great.

72
00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:04.858
We care deeply about security and
all the tooling we have around that.

73
00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:09.291
But if you do your own, then also do the
same, care deeply about it and do that.

74
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:13.317
Just I would say that don't go into
the mindset of your app saying like, well,

75
00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:16.071
let's kinda start rolling
our own authentication.

76
00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:19.179
And then if it doesn't go well,
then maybe we'll go use a provider.

77
00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:21.907
That ends up being more
trouble than it's worth.

78
00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:26.007
So I find that you either feel really good
and secure about your own solution or

79
00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:28.420
you go into a solution that is tried and
true.
