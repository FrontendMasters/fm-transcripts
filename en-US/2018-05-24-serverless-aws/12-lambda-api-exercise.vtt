00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.151
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, all right.
So what you're gonna be tasked to do

2
00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:06.970
is if you look in the serviceless.yml,
there's two functions todos and todo.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.067
And in the API folder they
already have handlers.

4
00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:15.511
What you're gonna do is you're gonna hook
up the events inside the functions of

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.734
the severless.yml so that you're able
to access them on whatever routes.

6
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:25.618
Maybe /todo, maybe /todo/id,
I did'nt tell you about parameters.

7
00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:29.082
So good luck trying to figure that out.

8
00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:33.259
[LAUGH] But yeah, I would recommend
trying that on this to-do one.

9
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.110
See if you can set up a parameter.

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.238
Even if you don't use any
of your lambda functions.

11
00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:38.851
See if you can actually set one up.

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.756
And then yeah, get those to run and

13
00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:44.642
then see if you can access them with
some HTTP client or in the browser.

14
00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:45.940
And see what happens
