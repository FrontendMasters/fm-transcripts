00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.410
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Serverless,
like what is that mean and

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.660
what is the difference between
Serverless and the framework severs.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.285
So know when people say
the word serverless,

4
00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:09.222
they're actually not talking
about the framework.

5
00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:12.735
The framework does a really good job for
taking that name serverless, but most some

6
00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:16.048
people say, I'm using a Serverless
architecture, they're probably not

7
00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:19.438
talking about them using this framework
of servers that we're gonna be doing.

8
00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:23.151
They're just saying, we have a functions
as a service architecture on Lambda, or

9
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.170
Azure, or Google.

10
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.790
That's normally what they're saying.

11
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.190
Now, yes,
that's what we're doing today too.

12
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.650
But we're also gonna be using
a framework called Serverless.

13
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.936
Good SCL for them, cuz that's a good name.

14
00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:36.247
But basically,
the sweet thing about Serverless,

15
00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:41.136
the framework, is that It's, you could
think of it as like a build system and

16
00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:46.104
an environment around all the platforms
that have functions as a service, and

17
00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:50.956
it kind of give us like a common API
to interact with those functions.

18
00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:55.890
So it doesn't matter where we deploy to,
in fact, if we go to Serverless and

19
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.250
we click on docs, you can see they support
all these providers, AWS, Azure, Google,

20
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.310
OpenWhisk, Kubeless, Spotinst, and
Webtasks, and probably some other stuff.

21
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.304
So they pretty much support
everything with a single API,

22
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.188
which allows you to do some
pretty interesting things.

23
00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:17.590
And you can, it helps you bundle,
package, go to CI, go to deployment,

24
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.120
all different types of things.

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.886
So that's why Serverless is great.

26
00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:23.838
Without Serverless, Lambda's actually,

27
00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:26.605
it's actually a lot easier now than
it used to be at the age of us,

28
00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.300
updated some stuff, and
I'll show you what that looks like.

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.410
But it's still pretty difficult for

30
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.520
someone who doesn't have extensive
experience with some type of Cloud

31
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.253
platform to deploy these
types of functions.

32
00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:42.090
But Serverless makes it like, stupid,
like If you can deploy to a CDN

33
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.965
hosting site like Netlify or anything,
then you can deploy a Lambda function,

34
00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:47.630
like that's how simple
it is with Serverless.
