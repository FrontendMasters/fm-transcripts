&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so what you're
gonna be doing is exactly what I just did,

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.580
if you check out to lesson three
if you haven't done already,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.540
this is gonna convert what you
have over to an express app,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.970
redeploy it, and see if it works.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.508
Do some post requests,
do some get requests, set up some nested,

6
00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:22.409
if you know Express you can
set up nested routers on here.

7
00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.541
All right, so you can say,
you can make a new router that looks

8
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:32.200
like express.Router and
then you can add this router.

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.930
You can mount it on some other apps.

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.300
So do that and
see if it works as expected.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.850
Maybe it doesn't.

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.110
Maybe it does, I don't know.
