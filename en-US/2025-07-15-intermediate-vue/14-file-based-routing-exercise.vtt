00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: So our fun little exercise,
this shouldn't take as long.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm going to push up my branch
to the 04 exercise branch.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.730
And your task,
should you choose to accept it,

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.520
is to migrate everything from
the routes into file based routing.

5
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.228
So I kept this one a little bit on
the shorter side because, you know, again,

6
00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.351
it's kind of like a fun thing
to kind of get used to and

7
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.970
I figured it's kind of easier for
you to play with on your own also.

8
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.810
So let's go ahead and just, let's.

9
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.330
Let's migrate the whole thing, shall we?

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.896
So when I'm doing the migration for
something like this, something actually,

11
00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:46.868
the first thing I actually want to
emphasize here is actually that you

12
00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:50.250
might notice that these two approaches
are actually coexisting right now.

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.956
There is the pages approach and

14
00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:55.580
you technically have some
views being manually defined.

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.820
I do think this is a big philosophy
that I've always enjoyed about VUE and

16
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.323
kind of its community is that it doesn't
try to force you one way or the other and

17
00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:05.932
it basically lets you, I mean to kind of
what we were talking about earlier in this

18
00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.780
workshop kind of composes of
things that make sense to you.

19
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.459
Because I don't know if some of you
got to the challenges part, but

20
00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.100
this not found doing
wildcards is a little bit.

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.660
It's actually.

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.060
You actually have to look in the docs for
this.

23
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.120
It's not incredibly intuitive.

24
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.240
I mean there is a world where some people
like, because this is just easier for

25
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.364
them to understand, they'll configure
some of their routes still manually

26
00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.956
because maybe they also have some
custom things they want to do,

27
00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.720
maybe programmatically that doesn't
fit the file based routing.

28
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.732
Because that's usually what I hear when
people criticize file based routing and

29
00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:38.360
they're like, I have this one edge
case that doesn't apply to that.

30
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.400
It's like, that's cool.

31
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.770
But for 95% of the other things,
file based routing works great.

32
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.304
So this is my reminder to you that like,

33
00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:48.410
while I'm going to migrate everything
over, you certainly don't have to.

34
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.995
And more importantly, should you need to
manually define your routes in the future,

35
00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:56.879
it is really just a step away by just
adding something inside of this route

36
00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.090
configuration.

37
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.330
Okay, so that said,
let's go ahead and move on.

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.890
Okay, first thing first, reflection.

39
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.690
I'll drop that one first.

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.419
So I'll move that over and
then I'll just call it reflection and

41
00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.760
then we'll get rid of it
inside of the routes page.

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.260
Here.

43
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.560
Boom.

44
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.200
Save.

45
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.880
I think that's good.

46
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.080
So we're going to test it, though.

47
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.600
We always test our things.

48
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.200
All right, that's up.

49
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.880
We go to reflection.

50
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.200
Great, it's working.

51
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.560
All right, moving on.

52
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800
Let's just do the sandbox
page because we can.

53
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.290
Yes.
Move.

54
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.130
And then we'll just rename that sandbox.

55
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.530
And then inside of our routes,
we delete the sandbox page here.

56
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.770
Check it.

57
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.890
Yep, there's our sandbox page.

58
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.370
Okay, keep going.

59
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.970
Let's do Settings next.

60
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.530
So drop that over there.

61
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.530
Settings.

62
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.090
Delete from here.

63
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.700
There we go.

64
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.580
And then let's click Settings.

65
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.780
Hey, there's our settings.

66
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.660
Everything still works great.

67
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.500
All right, now the coup de grace.

68
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.900
All right, so the planner section.

69
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500
Let's take a look at how we
intended this to be routed.

70
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.500
So, the planner page itself looks
like it's just slash planner.

71
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.620
So one way we could do this.

72
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.800
So you saw that earlier for slash tasks,
I did, like an index under the folder.

73
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.695
This should work the way I think it does,

74
00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.120
which is that you can
still just make this like.

75
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.440
Just Planner like this.

76
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.512
And so now that that's Planner,
we should be able to then come in.

77
00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:46.880
Wait, I didn't delete the other record.

78
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.040
So now Planner should be here.

79
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.900
And there you go Planner and
renders as expected.

80
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.780
Okay, here is then the tricky part.

81
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.940
So now you have this week
as well as this ID here.

82
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.020
So we need to do.

83
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.540
Here is we need to do a folder for
week and then we create a.

84
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.740
Well, actually take the back.

85
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.340
I don't need to create.

86
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.717
I just need to drag week
detail page in here and

87
00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:18.220
then swap out the name for
a square bracket id.

88
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.150
This should be.

89
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.710
Okay.

90
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.350
About to find out if I'm wrong.

91
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.870
Now that we have this,
let's just refresh it real quick.

92
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.670
And then we're going to
look at the week itself.

93
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.910
Up, page not found.

94
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.270
What happened?

95
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.270
Failed to resolve.

96
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.350
That shouldn't be the reason.

97
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.870
Let's debug this together.

98
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.750
Let's see.
We have it here.

99
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Don't we need to
put it in a planner folder or

100
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.612
something like that to match
the original way that it was?

101
00:04:55.612 --> 00:04:58.470
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah, you're totally right.

102
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.990
I got ahead of myself.

103
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.750
Let me undo this real quick.

104
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.990
I guess I thought I created.

105
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.550
I will tell you in my head,
I created a planner folder.

106
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.630
I clearly did not.

107
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.270
You are 100% right.

108
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.590
So that means week needs
to be nested under here.

109
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.230
There you go Planner Week id.

110
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.160
All right, now let's try this again.

111
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.600
Sorry.
Let me delete this.

112
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.200
All right, this is a fun little tidbit.

113
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.680
Okay, tip here.

114
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.400
So, you may have noticed we
have a lot of broken paths.

115
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.440
I don't know if you notice this
pattern I was using, the at symbol.

116
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.840
Are people familiar with this?

117
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.720
Okay, great.

118
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.651
For those who are not, this is something
that comes from the vite configuration and

119
00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:44.900
it's actually an alias.

120
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.900
So this is not magic.

121
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.380
It's actually something you can configure.

122
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.549
And it basically says, hey, for these
paths, whenever you prefix it with at,

123
00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:55.700
I want you to start from the root
directory and go straight into source.

124
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.374
And so this makes it a lot easier to deal
with moving things between directories,

125
00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:05.140
because you know that everything is
always going to start at the source.

126
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.700
Although, granted,
I'm not sure why it's still yelling at me.

127
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.270
But one thing at a time.

128
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.910
Okay, now that that's done, let's refresh.

129
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.870
And then that did not work.

130
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.230
Planner is good week did not happen.

131
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.710
Okay, what's the problem here?

132
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.630
So, I assume this is
what you were mentioning.

133
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.980
So what I'm going to do now is we're going
to take a look at the typed router to see

134
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.900
what it's generating.

135
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.900
So, we see that there's Planner here.

136
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.380
Planner Planner here.

137
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.420
Planner week.

138
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.220
ID here.

139
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.540
Param id true.

140
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.500
Id param false.

141
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:54.980
So that seems like it's
sound to Planner Week.

142
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.380
And then this is also.

143
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.780
I assume this is Planner Week.

144
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.620
Let's find out.

145
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.580
H.
wait, why is this an H3?

146
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.180
This seems suspicious.

147
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.140
H3 card title.

148
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.020
I have a guess.

149
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.260
This is in our planner.

150
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.180
No weeks available.

151
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.390
That's not it this year.

152
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.630
Yeah.

153
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.270
Remember what I mentioned
about AI doing funny things?

154
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.830
This is the goToweek and
then it rather push.

155
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.350
Okay.

156
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:44.470
So yeah, it is pushing the weak ID and
that is causing it.

157
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.887
We are noticing, I think everyone knows
that it crashes on their end as well when

158
00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:48.990
they get to this point.

159
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It works for me.

160
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.480
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: It works for you.

161
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.920
So yeah, this is a smidge odd.

162
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:07.720
See what errors am I getting
new Planner Cardbody.

163
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.680
Is that why it's yelling at me?

164
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.520
No, you all should have the same code.

165
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.040
Did you also do it the same way where you
had the planner out here rather than like.

166
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No,
I have Planner as an index.

167
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.360
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: As an index.

168
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.430
Okay, let's try this.

169
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.790
And perhaps this is a bug.

170
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.058
I was trying to be a little
cheeky by jumping ahead,

171
00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:30.950
but that may have
ultimately been a mistake.

172
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.550
I'm going to go ahead and
update these real quick.

173
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.310
Okay, great.

174
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.670
Planner week.

175
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.760
Wow.

176
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.760
Really doesn't like it
this is why we debug live.

177
00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.416
Okay, let me just fix this
icon thing then let's make

178
00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:04.160
sure we remove all issues that we have.

179
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.728
So, where's it getting an icon?

180
00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:07.680
Okay, got it.

181
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.360
But to be honest, at that point I'm
just going to import base icon.

182
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.455
If I'm going to solve this and
just do base icon and set of icon,

183
00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:21.770
its name and then sure,
with height, whatever.

184
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.154
Okay, so now this.

185
00:09:24.154 --> 00:09:25.610
Wait, what is this?

186
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.970
This does not like it.

187
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.890
Okay, you know what I'm
going to do though?

188
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.336
On the planner new planner body,

189
00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:38.650
we're just going to delete this for now.

190
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.470
Okay, so now no errors, but for
some reason it still cannot find the page.

191
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.746
For those of you running into it,
I believe somewhere in the hot

192
00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:53.550
module reloading something,
some wires got crossed.

193
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.430
So if you shut down your server, reboot
it, it's able to reconnect all the dots.

194
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.870
So I guess some people
didn't have that issue.

195
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.590
And then clearly I was able
to duplicate it by accident.

196
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.320
So yeah, so the good old turn it off and
on again saves the day.

197
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.440
All right, excellent.

198
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.649
So with that I think we're almost done
actually we just have one more thing and

199
00:10:14.649 --> 00:10:17.000
that's this not found page.

200
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.218
And so I'm going to go ahead and
just so you all know because again I'm

201
00:10:21.218 --> 00:10:25.560
never going to memorize this and
I don't expect any of you to ever.

202
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.200
So you know, we look for the docs.

203
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.840
That's what the docs are for.

204
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.730
We are going to search for
what they call this is like a catch all.

205
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.210
So you see here catchall
not found 404 route.

206
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:44.810
And so the way this works is you
actually do a behind the path.

207
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.880
So if you think about It From
a JavaScript perspective,

208
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.929
it is essentially a spread operator
saying whatever the heck the path is,

209
00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:56.370
if you can match this at the very,
very end, then go to this thing.

210
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.851
And so in our case, so
if we look at our routes and

211
00:11:00.851 --> 00:11:06.930
then I go ahead and
delete this last one, now it's reloaded.

212
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.603
If I go to my route and this time,

213
00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:14.170
I'm going to say something funny,
nothing shows up.

214
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.410
This makes sense because
now there's no catch all.

215
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.730
So let's try this again.

216
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.450
Not found.

217
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.680
Move it in.

218
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.560
And again we want it to be.

219
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.160
So, if you think about a catch all,
again it's that asterisk concept.

220
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.200
It's a dynamic property path.

221
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200
It's really what we're doing.

222
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.880
All right, it's reloaded, typed router
think, it already did it for me.

223
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.040
Hot module reloading.

224
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.165
And that's how you'll catch
any routes that haven't that

225
00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:43.680
are unable to be matched.

226
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.452
And actually, I guess, you know,

227
00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:48.530
if you want to talk about final reroute
route things, since we know for

228
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.210
a fact that, at least for now, again, I
can always recreate this whenever I want.

229
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.006
This is effectively empty
because at this point,

230
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:59.130
I don't foresee a world where I
need to manually configure a route.

231
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.050
So I can delete the routes file.

232
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.970
I can delete this import.

233
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.970
To be honest,
I don't mind calling it Auto Routes.

234
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.170
It's kind of explicit.

235
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.290
So this is fine.

236
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:13.490
But obviously if you want to just be even
more succinct, you can just do this.

237
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.210
This is fine.

238
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.130
That is a full refactor.

239
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.232
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You didn't have to
then update any if you've got router

240
00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:24.370
pushes anywhere.

241
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.930
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Nope.

242
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.810
Isn't that so great?

243
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's amazing.

244
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.770
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: It's such a nice
developer experience for me.

245
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.810
Whenever I'm on a project without it,
I'm like, I have to type the object.

246
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.950
I got to type and
then I got to configure it.

247
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.750
Just makes it so
much more fun to just try stuff out.

248
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.150
And I feel like that's what
a lot of development is,

249
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.270
creating a faster feedback cycle so
that we can try more things.

250
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.710
The more feedback loops we have,
the more we can iterate and do cool.
