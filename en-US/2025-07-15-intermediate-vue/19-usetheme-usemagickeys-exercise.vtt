00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.162
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: You all have now gotten
essentially a good overview of what

2
00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:05.424
composables are, what they're capable of,

3
00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:08.160
and some different patterns for
implementing things.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.720
So what I have for
you here is a fun challenge.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.767
We are first going to start by creating
a use theme composable that allows you to

6
00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:21.280
switch between the different themes and
you'll find this on the Settings page.

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.767
Then I want you to combine
this with the viewus,

8
00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:30.433
which is already installed as a dependency
in your app, the Use Magic Keys for

9
00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:36.340
a way to switch between different
themes using just keyboard shortcuts.

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.180
Your mission is to go explore the docs,
okay?

11
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.514
So you should know how to go through
the use theme, go into the settings, but

12
00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:48.308
now you're going to want to figure
out how you can combine that with

13
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:52.912
Vue Uses Use Magic keys, which, by the
way, one of my favorite things they did,

14
00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:56.946
which part of the reason I want you
all to play with it and combine them.

15
00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:01.260
And I'm kind of curious to see what you
all wanna do or end up doing with that.

16
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.711
That said, in the event you're like, eh,
I don't know, I don't want to do that,

17
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:09.260
then the exercise here is to use
what you know about Composables.

18
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.266
Pick something in Vue Use that
looks like it might be fun or

19
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.187
might apply to your project, and

20
00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:22.630
then basically combine those and
then see how it works again.

21
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.910
What's fun about Composition API is that
you have a lot of different ways to do it.

22
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.587
So what I'm going to be proposing is one
way of doing it, and then, you know,

23
00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:32.870
compare, contrast and
see how it compares to yours.

24
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.740
Okay, so first thing first,
we look, actually,

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.750
we can look at the docs in a second.

26
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.885
So first thing first,
we know that we need to go ahead and

27
00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:46.759
abstract out the functionality that
we see inside of Settings View,

28
00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.530
because this is ultimately where we see
the theme being ultimately managed.

29
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.285
And so my first instinct with this is to
go ahead, as I think a lot of you did.

30
00:01:56.285 --> 00:02:01.130
We just have a useTheme.ts,
we don't need to get too fancy.

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.090
And then I'm actually just
gonna grab everything.

32
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.730
I don't think there's
kind of a point not to.

33
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.010
And so what we do know is that here we
are clearly watching some of this stuff.

34
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.232
So honestly, at this point,
to keep it easy, I am of the mind,

35
00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:22.960
I'm just gonna make all of these
individual things that I can export.

36
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.880
I don't think I need a full
store model just yet.

37
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.482
Now, the tricky thing, though,

38
00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:32.000
is that this Watch Lifecycle Hook is
not something that you can just like.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.400
You can't just like export this.

40
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.120
That's not like a thing.

41
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.727
And so what you need to do instead is to
have a function that's basically something

42
00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:40.680
like use theme.

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.090
So this is where the factory
does come into play.

44
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.178
Because then you're basically saying when
you initiate this, initiate the watch and

45
00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:48.410
then set it accordingly.

46
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.753
And then to make sure this is working,

47
00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:54.530
we just need to import
everything from the composable.

48
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.090
So composable slash, use theme.

49
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.370
Great.

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.490
All right, so what do we need?

51
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.250
We need current theme and
we need on theme change.

52
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.360
Ooh, what was on theme change?

53
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.340
Okay, looks like on theme
change was most likely some

54
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.840
sort of watch effect in that regard, so.

55
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.170
Nope, that doesn't make.

56
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.280
Okay, I know what it is.

57
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.800
So we need to actually set the setTheme.

58
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.440
Yep.

59
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.680
So we need to set the theme every
time the select thing changes.

60
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.880
And then why is it yelling at me now?

61
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.170
Theme string is not
available to parameter.

62
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.370
What did I forget?

63
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.066
onThemeChange.

64
00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:51.050
Yep, that did not exist, though.

65
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Aren't we
doing it with the watcher?

66
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.730
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah, that's kind of funny.

67
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.250
So I don't.

68
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.770
Yeah, so actually, you know what?

69
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.970
I think now I remember.

70
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.625
I think this is actually not relevant,
this code,

71
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.080
because we have a V model here already.

72
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.400
So having a second function
method on that is irrelevant.

73
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.040
So, yeah, I think you're spot on on that.

74
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.960
So we have our themes here,
which is great.

75
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.040
Now everything's good.

76
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.280
But I think you all know
where I'm headed with this.

77
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.720
If we go ahead and test this out
right now inside of our app, okay?

78
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.400
We're still up and running.

79
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.360
Nothing is happening.

80
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.630
And the reason for that is because we
need the ability to watch the thing.

81
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.470
So this is where our use theme function
is going to come into play here.

82
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.350
So like this and then useTheme like that.

83
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.190
And I think refresh.

84
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.830
There you go.

85
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.670
Now it works.

86
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.790
Okay, so here's the question, right?

87
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.825
We wanna now use the vueUse magic key.

88
00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:57.977
So we look at the magic keys and
again, this thing, I just love it.

89
00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:01.320
The fact that it just makes it like,
look at that.

90
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.560
If you push and it rotates.

91
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.120
So it's like if you do vue and
then shift, it'll rotate.

92
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.800
I don't know.

93
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.639
Great demo.

94
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.880
Whoever came up with that.

95
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.440
And so the fact that you can
just name it by namespace.

96
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.040
This is great.

97
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.920
Okay, so knowing this is how
it's possible to be used.

98
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.290
Let's see, how do I want to do this?

99
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.930
You can export them out this way or
we can just do it.

100
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.535
Let's see.
And

101
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.210
then also we can do combinations here,
right?

102
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.530
So this, we can just plus them together.

103
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.610
Looks like this is another alternative
as well to like use underscores.

104
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.461
So I'm going to do something
like control shift and

105
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:42.690
then like a number to represent like the
number to the correspond with the themes.

106
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.570
So in my mind when I'm looking at this.

107
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.908
So let me go ahead and
I just need to grab this, actually,

108
00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:50.285
I'll just grab this right here for now.

109
00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:54.104
I'm thinking, okay, so yes,
this composable is responsible for

110
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:59.062
changing the theme, but I'm now gonna have
this different composable because now I'm

111
00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:01.190
doing reactivity with hotkeys.

112
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.550
So for
me I'm going to do one called use hotkeys.

113
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.910
And then inside of here
we're basically going to do.

114
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.790
Let's see, how do we want to do this?

115
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.076
We need to instantiate it because
ultimately what we need to do is be

116
00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:16.600
able to listen for it.

117
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.925
And so I've read this, the docs on this
and so there's actually this thing called

118
00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:23.960
whenever, which is a great,
great utility function.

119
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.240
Whenever this thing happens,
this gets pressed.

120
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.760
Then do a callback
function to do said thing.

121
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.800
So this is where the composition
starts to come into play.

122
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.969
Right.
So in my mind, so export function,

123
00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:38.120
use hotkey.

124
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.690
Let's see, I'll say hot theme keys.

125
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.570
That's what I'm gonna call it because
that's what specifically these hotkeys do.

126
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.170
And so I'm gonna say const
keys equals useMagicKeys().

127
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.701
And then just to make things a bit easier,

128
00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:59.160
then we'll basically say whenever
keys dot and inside the control

129
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.930
shift one then we get a function and
what do we want this function to do?

130
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.192
Well, I wanted to change themes,
so I'm going to import my themes,

131
00:07:10.192 --> 00:07:13.970
let's see, set theme from my composable.

132
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.090
But I also need to be able to
reference the themes themselves.

133
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.650
So that way I should be able
to do something like this.

134
00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:24.770
I need one of her too.

135
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.490
Okay, and so in terms of where
I want to listen to this,

136
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.450
if you put this on the settings page,
that means it only will work on there.

137
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.504
So my first instinct then is
to go to the app view page and

138
00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:43.840
inside here is where I would
say import use hot theme keys.

139
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.160
And then here let's do use
hot theme keys like that.

140
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:58.560
Okay, so let me just do a couple
real quick and see if this works.

141
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.840
We could obviously just loop it, but
Just for now, for simplicity sake.

142
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.330
Okay, Refresh.

143
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.490
Okay.
We go to the home and then control shift.

144
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.690
1, 2, 3, up.

145
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.410
There we go.

146
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.290
And it's shifting.

147
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.610
I did in my demo, for some reason, the.

148
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.530
It's not respecting the second theme.

149
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.067
I don't know why, to be honest with you.

150
00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:27.290
I'm hitting two and it's doing nothing,
but it gives me the other ones.

151
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.550
So that's something else to debug for
another time.

152
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.567
But this is, I guess,
one version of how this

153
00:08:35.567 --> 00:08:41.390
might be implemented the way
I was thinking of this.

154
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.470
And this is where
the composition comes into play.

155
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.326
Because what we've done is we've taken
this use theme here, which definitely

156
00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:54.060
lives on the settings page right here, and
it's doing all the watching at this level.

157
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.860
But then Use Hotkeys only has to worry
about setting the theme because we know

158
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.900
that it's being watched elsewhere.

159
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.780
And then I guess from what we can see,
it's reactively updating accordingly.

160
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.972
So then I think that solves the multiple
watchers thing that you were

161
00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:13.100
running into, right?

162
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.540
So, yeah, how does that compare to
some of the stuff you all tried?

163
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.849
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I did that cycler that just
ran through the indexes of the theme and

164
00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:29.664
then gets back to zero.

165
00:09:29.664 --> 00:09:32.485
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Nice.
Yep, definitely more elegant than this,

166
00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:33.076
for sure.

167
00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:39.610
[LAUGH] Yeah, and so
this kind of fun stuff.

168
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.930
One thing I like about things like vueUse,
right?

169
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.271
Because something like Hotkeys is actually
traditionally kind of a tricky thing to

170
00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:47.370
implement, right.

171
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.810
If you're gonna do it from scratch.

172
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.094
And I do think as more and more we look at
software where we're looking at keyboard

173
00:09:52.094 --> 00:09:55.287
accessibility and stuff, being able to
let users customize their hotkeys and

174
00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:57.605
do all sorts of cool combinations
of whatever they want so

175
00:09:57.605 --> 00:09:59.330
they can run whatever command they want.

176
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.810
Like, I do think that opens the doorway
for just all sorts of customization.

177
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.564
So personally, this is one of the reasons
this is one of my favorite utilities

178
00:10:09.564 --> 00:10:12.210
that they provide, because then it just.

179
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.610
It becomes so easy to allow users
to determine what they wanna add.

180
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.350
And then all of a sudden, boom,
you have personalization to that degree.

181
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.950
And so I can't stress this enough.

182
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.030
This is just one way to do it.

183
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.950
We already heard doing more of
a cyclical going through the themes.

184
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.085
Again, this is very hard coded, but yeah,

185
00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:31.870
this is just wanted to have
some separation of concerns.

186
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.812
I mean, some people you could
even theoretically all do within

187
00:10:34.812 --> 00:10:35.710
use theme as well.

188
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.870
It's just up to you.

189
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.310
And so that's why it's very much.

190
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.421
Programming is an art in that way as
we decide what tools we want to use,

191
00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:45.383
how we want to architect things and

192
00:10:45.383 --> 00:10:49.711
what we think makes the most sense as a
final shout out to the things that I also

193
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:53.590
think you should consider whenever
you have a chance for your apps.

194
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.429
So earlier you mentioned
the useMedia player.

195
00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:05.350
So for those who in the was
it using controls, right?

196
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah.

197
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.124
So if ever you had to create like
a video player, you have to, you know,

198
00:11:10.124 --> 00:11:13.400
if you ever done in the old days,
you know, it's incredibly painful.

199
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.080
Usually there was like a dedicated
library that did it all for you.

200
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.657
This thing can break it down.

201
00:11:17.657 --> 00:11:20.160
I think I don't want the sound to come on.

202
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.120
We can see that it has all these reactive
properties of the time being set,

203
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.080
duration is waiting, seeking, stall.

204
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.560
Like just actually it even
tells you how much is buffered.

205
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.120
It's just the level of thought that's
gone into some of this stuff is wild.

206
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.810
Honestly, just kudos to the team
who spent the effort to do this.

207
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The whole tracks piece
which lets you do the subtitles.

208
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.490
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah.

209
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.351
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or closed captions for
the video is also super helpful for

210
00:11:51.351 --> 00:11:52.570
accessibility.

211
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.290
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah.

212
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.690
So this is a fun one again.

213
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.654
So if you're ever doing like,

214
00:11:58.654 --> 00:12:03.650
eyedroppers is a fun one if you ever just
wanna pick colors and then clipboard.

215
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.588
Again, if you ever need access
to user clipboard history,

216
00:12:06.588 --> 00:12:08.950
it's just use clipboard and
then it's there.

217
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.590
I mean it's that easy.

218
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.440
And then the one that though I think most
of us basically need though is useref

219
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.470
history.

220
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.516
They also have a use debounce ref
history in case it's too much and

221
00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:26.564
basically allowing you to then
watch what happens to the count and

222
00:12:26.564 --> 00:12:30.620
then actually then track
have some basic history.

223
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.811
Because undo and redo is a thing that
I think users are becoming more and

224
00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:36.135
more used to being able to
do as we see with emails and

225
00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:39.340
stuff like,
do you want to undo what you just sent?

226
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.184
So this kind of helper
can be a lot of help for

227
00:12:42.184 --> 00:12:46.220
those of us that are like,
actually how do we undo this?
