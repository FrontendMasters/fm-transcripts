1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.905
Welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:03.800
Hopefully you all are here for
intermediate view with Frontend Masters.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
My name is Ben Hong.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.400
I'm on the Vue core team and I actually
recently joined the Angular team as well.

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.688
So I do a lot of things for
the web and open source and so

6
00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:13.016
primarily I get to do a lot of docs work
and then basically just helping to make

7
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.720
the web technology more accessible
to everyone out there, so

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.560
that everyone can keep building
awesome things on the web.

9
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.980
As far as prerequisites for this course,

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.280
basically we expect that you've taken
some sort of Vue 3 Fundamentals.

11
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.993
So if you haven't, if this is
your kind of first foray into it,

12
00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:31.470
we have a Vue 3 Fundamentals
workshop that I've taught before.

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.430
So I also expect that you have a basic
understanding of Composition API.

14
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.652
This workshop really is about
diving more in depth into it and

15
00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:39.430
what we can do with it as a result.

16
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.111
Also, we'll be doing a lot with script
setup, so if you're new to that,

17
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.310
don't worry about it.

18
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.738
It's basically just all Composition API,
as opposed to some options,

19
00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:47.870
some Composition API.

20
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.150
Essentially all it is.

21
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.200
Once we dive into it,
you'll get right into it.

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.309
And then I say this with the utmost in
quotes, basic understanding of TypeScript,

23
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.610
in the sense that there is TypeScript
in the code that you'll see.

24
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.670
But we're not doing heavy type creation or
anything, it's just there to help with

25
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.720
some of the auto completion type
inferences, that kind of thing.

26
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.479
Fear not,
if you see the typescript in there,

27
00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480
that's not what this course is focused on.

28
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.720
So as far as setup goes.

29
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.587
For those in the chat and those here,

30
00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:19.805
hopefully you've had a chance to check
out the repo on github.com, so it's under

31
00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:23.160
github.com/bencodezen/intermediate-view.-
git.

32
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.480
And if you go ahead and clone that down,

33
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.600
basically that's where we'll
be doing all our exercises.

34
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.324
So as you see the main branch right there,
you can go ahead and

35
00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:32.600
basically NPM install and that should
basically get you up and running.

36
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.240
And then basically going forward, I'll be
checking out branches as we go through.

37
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.614
So you have different stopping points and
checkpoints for

38
00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.200
you to kinda check back and
go over different things.

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.128
As far as the things we're gonna cover,

40
00:01:43.128 --> 00:01:46.753
we're gonna focus on four
primary topics today.

41
00:01:46.753 --> 00:01:50.479
And so we'll start off with components and
then we'll be looking at composables and

42
00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.853
really diving deep into that.

43
00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:54.796
Because I think this is where a lot of
the Vue ecosystem is currently kind of

44
00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:55.516
moving towards.

45
00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:58.019
So I wanna get everyone
very familiar with that.

46
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:02.062
And then we'll have a section later on on
routing, as well as some of the sort of

47
00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:06.259
upcoming movements as far as where that's
going from enterprise perspective.

48
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.071
And as well as kind of taking a deeper
dive into state management, where it's at,

49
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.678
especially in a composition kind of world.

50
00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:16.900
Where are we with that and what do we
recommend as far as working with it?

51
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.820
Okay, so the question is,
what are we building?

52
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.660
Well, we're gonna be building a todo app,
just kidding.

53
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.260
This is not an intro class.

54
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.180
We've all been bored by the todo app and
done it way too many times.

55
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.180
And so this is an intermediate course,
which means we're gonna be dropping you

56
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.580
into, well,
essentially a legacy code base.

57
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.700
So just to give you a little
bit of a tour of what you have.

58
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.141
So we have essentially,
as far as the structure goes,

59
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.380
we have our frontend app
inside of the app folder.

60
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.530
So this is your standard Vue
3 scaffolded with Vue 3 app.

61
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.205
And then there's a backend in quotes I
put, because it's really just a JSON file.

62
00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:56.366
And we're leveraging a library,
if you haven't heard of before,

63
00:02:56.366 --> 00:03:01.930
called json-server, and it basically fakes
an API rest point for a JSON file locally.

64
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.570
So that's really all it is, nothing fancy.

65
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.450
So nothing's being sent to the cloud,
everything's just being done locally.

66
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.777
So let's go ahead and

67
00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:13.210
take a look at the enterprise app that
you all are gonna be walking into.

68
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.760
And so it's called Point of Vue and it's
your own personal productivity dashboard.

69
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.360
And so overall, you can see here,
this is like, we got our homepage.

70
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.190
And then you can choose your
focus in terms of the things that

71
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.440
you're intending to do.

72
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.205
And we have, basically you see your
tasks here, you can filter it down,

73
00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:34.360
we can even look at the planner as far
as what's been planned for what week.

74
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.080
You can switch the different weeks,
look at it in detail.

75
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.179
It gives you some metrics on
things that you've planned,

76
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.290
what you've actually spent time on.

77
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.924
And there's even a reflection page to
kinda see how has your completion rate

78
00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:48.370
been along with your time efficiency.

79
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.450
And overall it looks pretty good, but
I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty buggy.

80
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.210
Some of the features are missing
that you would expect to be there.

81
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.970
And AI may or may not have been
involved in coding some of the tickets.

82
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.341
So inside you'll see some of these
coding practices don't look quite right.

83
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:08.680
And so in some ways it's kind of
your modern day enterprise app.

84
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.607
So as far as this goes, basically the key
thing I wanna emphasize here is that

85
00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:17.499
you're walking into a code base that
is already there's opportunities for

86
00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:18.920
improvement, lots of it.

87
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.425
So do not take what you see in
there as gospel as, that pattern,

88
00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:24.280
I should copy that.

89
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.400
We're not at that point.

90
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.617
So just to reiterate,

91
00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:31.170
so what you're working on is you've
inherited a legacy code base.

92
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.936
And while it does work as far
as some of the major features,

93
00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:36.930
it is far from perfect and
we're here to kind of improve it.

94
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.730
So this is a quote when I was
talking with David at his talk.

95
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.452
And I love this because it says
LLMs weren't trained on good code,

96
00:04:43.452 --> 00:04:45.490
they were trained on your code.

97
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.678
And I thought that was a great quote
because a lot of times, as we know,

98
00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:52.770
we live in a world where we have AI
generated code and it's being injected in.

99
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.512
But as we all keep playing around,

100
00:04:54.512 --> 00:04:58.370
you'll notice that sometimes it just
does things that does not make sense.

101
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.820
Like for example, I think at one point it
was trying to inject router functions so

102
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.320
that it could add a button
to navigate to another page.

103
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.018
And that is just a big no, no, right?

104
00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:09.040
It's a button element.

105
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.960
We have anchored tags for a reason.

106
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.001
But for Some reason the LLMs have learned
that, a lot of people do this, so

107
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:16.480
I'm gonna do this too.

108
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.920
And so it's an interesting
state that we're in right now.

109
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.840
But so as a result, I just thought this
was kind of a funny quote by David.

110
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.727
So as far as participation tips for
this workshop, first off,

111
00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:29.300
don't be afraid to deep dive in the code.

112
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.750
Again, this workshop is about getting
hands-on experience with the techniques

113
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.060
and the patterns that we're talking about.

114
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.071
So the best way to get experience with
that is obviously to go in there,

115
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:38.900
try stuff out.

116
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.120
And so I have dedicated exercises for

117
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.260
different things we'll be
trying to solve together.

118
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.651
But I left a lot of different things
to explore so that you can go and

119
00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:49.369
try out different things and
basically enhance the code as you see fit.
