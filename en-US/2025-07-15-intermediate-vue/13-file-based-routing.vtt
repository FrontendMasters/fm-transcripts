00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: And so
we're gonna do a little dive into routing.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.160
Who here has heard of file based routing?

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay, so looks like some people here know,
which is good.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.800
And so this technique I think is starting
to take the community by storm because as

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.360
we'll see, it helps to.

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.986
I mean I think a lot of
development framework work is

7
00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:20.040
around making our developer
experience as best as we can and

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.200
simplifying the boilerplate
that we have to do.

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.360
So for those who don't know, let's
take a look at what we have to start.

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.392
So for those, you should already be
familiar with Vue Router and the fact that

11
00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:38.460
with Vue Router we have all our pages in
the Vue's folder, typically speaking.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.226
And then we configure everything
inside of our router inside of here,

13
00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:47.506
inside of a thing called routes and
we define all these paths and

14
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:52.460
we just find the component that go to
it and it's a decent amount of work.

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.814
Now file based routing is interesting
because what it says is, all right,

16
00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:01.110
this is standard stuff, right?

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.402
When a user visits a site, we know when
they're on a website that they're,

18
00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.310
that's actually really small,
just do it here.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.884
When they're on a website they're
going to say our domain.com/ and

20
00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:19.080
then it's usually some sort of about or
product and then the ID and

21
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.800
then maybe product detail,
something like this.

22
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.335
If you look at this, this actually looks
really, really similar to how files and

23
00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:30.360
directories work.

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.680
So a pattern came out where basically they
were like if this is what we want anyways,

25
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.720
why bother with at least out of
the box with most case scenario?

26
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.532
Why are we bothering with all this
configuration when we can just do it

27
00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:44.360
via file based routing.

28
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.045
So, the way this is gonna
work is I have installed, so

29
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:49.410
I took care of some of the setup already.

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.952
And part of the reason I did this is
because I do think the configuration is

31
00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:54.770
not something I want to harp on.

32
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.629
And so what we're gonna be talking about
here though, so I will bring this up so

33
00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.330
that people do know about this,
Unplugin Vue Router.

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.605
So as to all next generation tech,

35
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:12.790
this is like the future of routing.

36
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.150
And so here you can see how to
set it up on your own project.

37
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.510
But I basically done most of this for you.

38
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.619
And so what we're gonna do here is I want
to show you I'm gonna progressively kind

39
00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.452
of start migrating some of it and then
you all can get a little bit of hands on

40
00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:26.230
experience with it as well to
kind of see what it's like.

41
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.950
So first thing first, let's see.

42
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.790
I think everything should be ready to go.

43
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.390
Let me just double check real quick.

44
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.110
There's VueRouter, excellent.

45
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.462
And then, okay, so the way this
works is I guess you can assume

46
00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:42.563
everyone's background with web here, but

47
00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:47.204
when you visit a website like
domain.com like this, just here.

48
00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:52.312
For those of us who come back from
the FTV days and we understand how this

49
00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:58.560
stuff works, what you don't know is what
you're actually hitting is index.html.

50
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.713
And so similarly if we go to
domain.com/product, right, and

51
00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:07.140
then you have a bunch of
products that are on the page,

52
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.760
you're really hitting product.index.html.

53
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.863
The reason this is useful context is
because you're gonna need to know this

54
00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:17.410
when you're doing the file based routing
because you're basically gonna be calling

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.400
these files index.vue and so forth.

56
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.464
So what we do is here is we're gonna
create a folder here called pages rather

57
00:03:23.464 --> 00:03:24.440
than Vues.

58
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120
And so to show that this works,
I'm gonna go ahead and

59
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.160
first move the homepage inside of here.

60
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.530
This is gonna break a bunch of stuff
because this no longer exists.

61
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.690
I'm gonna delete this route.

62
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.224
Then what we need to do is inside of this,

63
00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:46.210
I need to import routes and
this thing called handle hot updates.

64
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.610
I'll explain in a second from
vue-router / auto-routes.

65
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.090
So this is like a package within it.

66
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.410
Now we have a naming collision here.

67
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.250
So we're gonna use our
handy little renaming here.

68
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.210
So I'm gonna call this autoRoutes
because that's what's happening,

69
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.310
they're being auto-generated.

70
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.190
And then, oop, what we're gonna do here is
that the routes, we're gonna merge them.

71
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.794
We're gonna say first go ahead and
do all your routes or

72
00:04:08.794 --> 00:04:11.670
actually we're gonna do auto routes first.

73
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.510
Then we're gonna merge that with
the routes that we manually

74
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.630
wrote ourselves here.

75
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.790
So that's what's happening there.

76
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.418
So these two are being spread
across the same object and

77
00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:22.070
then this is just a configuration thing.

78
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.989
But basically this will allow us when
we're doing hot module reloading so

79
00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:31.370
that the router actually is
generating the right thing.

80
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.530
So, is it hot updates?

81
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.330
Hot update, there you go.

82
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.370
Okay, perfect.

83
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.130
Now if this works as intended.

84
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.272
Yep, reloaded localhost5173.

85
00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:49.010
Okay, beautiful, it's broken, that's good.

86
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.402
What we did is we said, hey,
our pages, our route, if you notice,

87
00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:58.104
it's called homepage, not index but
if we go to homepage like this now,

88
00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:00.520
all of a sudden everything shows up.

89
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.183
So just to demo this, I'm gonna
switch this now back to index.vue,

90
00:05:06.183 --> 00:05:11.240
you're gonna see it's gonna generate and
then if we now homepage can't be found.

91
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.772
If we go to the homepage now, voila.

92
00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.130
Now it's the homepage.

93
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.135
What's cool is that you
didn't see it here, but

94
00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:24.290
this file here is actually being
generated for you this whole time.

95
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.169
To be clear, do not modify this file,
big warning that I could tell or

96
00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.330
do I need to be bigger than that [LAUGH]?

97
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.671
But you can see here it's actually
generating typed routes so that when

98
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:37.090
you're actually equating stuff, it'll
actually do some records auto completes.

99
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.970
Don't ask me to explain
how the typescript works.

100
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.050
Just know that it's
supposed to be type safe.

101
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.370
That's an advantage you get with this.

102
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.117
And so then I'm gonna go ahead and
just do one more for example,

103
00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:51.880
so we mentioned like a task detail page,
right?

104
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.667
So a task detail page, this is the funny
thing about the task detail page is that I

105
00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:59.168
actually without looking at the routes,

106
00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:02.840
it's hard to intuit what
exactly you intended with that.

107
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.360
And so
I have to kind of come back in here.

108
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.135
I mean, look at this for example,
TaskDetailsPage is under task/ and

109
00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:14.880
then a dynamic parameter of id, whereas
weak, let's see, is it WeekDetailPage?

110
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.985
WeekDetailPage is actually
under planner weekid, right?

111
00:06:17.985 --> 00:06:21.880
And so this is actually kind of
an interesting byproduct of doing it.

112
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.278
The file based routing way is that your
components actually get pretty declarative

113
00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:28.800
and you understand where they're supposed
to be and what they intend to do.

114
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.640
And so the way this particular works,
I'm gonna do the task one.

115
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.685
So I'm gonna go ahead, let's see,
I'm gonna move the task panel page.

116
00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:36.960
Wait, that's the wrong one.

117
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.560
Task page in here?

118
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.400
Yes, just move.

119
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.240
And then, so task page is gone.

120
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.760
Then I'm gonna do the task
detail page in here.

121
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.760
That's gonna be gone now.

122
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.646
And then to finalize this,
we're gonna go ahead and

123
00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:56.720
we're gonna create a tasks folder
cuz that's the route we wanted.

124
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.440
And then we'll drop
a detail page in there.

125
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.820
And then the convention we're looking for

126
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.717
here to tell you all that is the square
brackets inside of your file name

127
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:09.230
basically mark the fact that
it's a dynamic parameter.

128
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.779
And so if you did something like this,
by the way.

129
00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.110
The task would be static,
like the task dash.

130
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.270
And then whatever is appended
is basically the parameter.

131
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.243
So there's that, and then task page,

132
00:07:25.243 --> 00:07:31.184
I'm just gonna put inside of here
as index, oops, not vuex, okay?

133
00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:36.314
And then I think,

134
00:07:36.314 --> 00:07:41.720
okay, great.

135
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.080
Don't save.

136
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.040
Okay, let's see.

137
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.880
Refresh routes.

138
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.080
Planners, correct.

139
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.160
Nope, that's good.

140
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.480
Planner, wait, Planner.

141
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
it somehow updated that.

142
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.560
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah, that's weird.

143
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.000
Okay, so that should be this.

144
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.480
That looks good, I think.

145
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.270
Okay, why is it unhappy?

146
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.320
Routes.ts.

147
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.480
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.

148
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.650
Yes, good, planner page,
do, do, do, do do.

149
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.510
Planner page view.

150
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.690
No, it somehow updated my directory path.

151
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.678
It should be views, views, views.

152
00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:36.087
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No, tasks.

153
00:08:36.087 --> 00:08:37.471
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Tasks.

154
00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:40.535
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [CROSSTALK] just views.

155
00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:42.904
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: You're right, thank you.

156
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.300
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Hey, beautiful.

157
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.340
Okay, so now you can see,
so if I go to tasks.

158
00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:51.588
What just happened?

159
00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:52.420
I know what just happened.

160
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.140
We go to the task index page.

161
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.380
I believe that the imports mess up.

162
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.180
No, they're good.

163
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Your task list filter.

164
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.504
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Yeah,
looks like the task list filter tasks.

165
00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:11.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did this
experiment and then I never fixed it.

166
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.030
Store.task list tasks, there you go.

167
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.110
Okay, refresh, aha, here we go.

168
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.710
Okay, and then you see here,
boom, task one is the id.

169
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.545
So everything works.

170
00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:32.534
And what's great now is that whereas
in the past, remember, I was like,

171
00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:36.350
I need to create a sandbox page and
I have to configure a bunch of stuff.

172
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.910
Now it can be like, I don't know,
someone shout out a page name for me.

173
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sandbox.

174
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.170
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: All right, Sandbox,
although, do we have one already?

175
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.010
I think we have one.

176
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.450
I'll call it playground, playground.vue.

177
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.050
Yay, playground.

178
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.690
Playground, done.

179
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.330
All that boilerplate gone.

180
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.250
I don't have to deal
with it anymore [LAUGH].

181
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.720
I love it.

182
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.000
These are the things that
make me happy [LAUGH].
