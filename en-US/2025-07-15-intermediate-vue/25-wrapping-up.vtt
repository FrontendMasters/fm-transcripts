WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.440
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: We did a lot.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.304
I know it sounded like four sections
when we first started with components

3
00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.560
Composables, Routing and State Management.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.457
But as we know,

5
00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:12.018
the meat of today was really just getting
our hands elbow deep in Composables so

6
00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:16.575
that when you go back to your code bases,
you're just going to be like, yeah,

7
00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:21.440
I'm just going to create one and
you're not going to think twice about it.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.936
I think if that's where
people are feeling and

9
00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:27.072
then you got to get your hands
on with some of those more call

10
00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:31.190
it advanced composition design patterns
where there are more edge cases.

11
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.762
But again, as software architects,

12
00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:35.030
we do need to understand how
to navigate those things.

13
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.030
Those are things that
we touched on as well.

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.494
And then a lot of you got to play
with file based routing, it seems for

15
00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:42.950
the first time, which is fun.

16
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.950
Yeah, so that's for
me it's such a big DX improvement.

17
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.010
And then finally of course we kind of
wrapped it up to show that all our work

18
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.150
with Composables really is not so
far from the state management library.

19
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.859
We already have the official
one we have for vue.

20
00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.689
So again, I have met people at
other workshops who they're

21
00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:03.470
like pinyout's great but
we decided to hand roll our own.

22
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.439
We have our type safe, you know,
we have our documented way of doing it and

23
00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.886
I can't stress enough if that works for
you.

24
00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:12.550
Good, go for it.

25
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.352
Just know that you know these pre built
options are still very suitable and

26
00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:19.270
worth your time should
you choose to use it.

27
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.499
Just a comment in the chat that this
was a very informative workshop and

28
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.350
a really great addition to
your fundamentals course.

29
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.390
Great, I really appreciate that.

30
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.272
But just kind of in terms of other
final thoughts, so just kind of,

31
00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:33.910
these are the things that we covered,
lots of different techniques within them.

32
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.510
So do not sell yourself
short of the things we did.

33
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.371
So of course the next question is now
you've just finished the intermediate

34
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.710
workshop, what is next?

35
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310
And so to you I present this comic.

36
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.390
I hate myself.

37
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.150
That's where it starts.

38
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.267
A therapist comes by and says,
[LAUGH] Look, typescript.

39
00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:54.240
And then, wow, I hate this even more.

40
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.148
I kid now the thing is that typescript,
I don't know for me personally,

41
00:01:58.148 --> 00:01:59.720
I have a love hate relationship with it.

42
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.520
There are times where I'm like,
wow, this is great.

43
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.880
It's doing exactly what I want.

44
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.925
And then there's other time where
the build tool is breaking and I'm like,

45
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:06.599
nothing works.

46
00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.120
I want to chuck all this in the bin.

47
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.768
For me it's very much
a love hate relationship.

48
00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:14.160
That said, it's more I said in Jess.

49
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.770
I mean obviously we're here as a front
end workshops, frontend masters workshop.

50
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.530
But VUE is ultimately,
I tell this to people all the time.

51
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.878
It's a framework about helping to
get the cruft out of the way so

52
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:25.260
you can do what's important to you.

53
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.179
And once we provided those
fundamentals with composition API now,

54
00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:33.715
as we talked about, a lot of the Nuxt
really is just about advancing your skills

55
00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.010
as a JavaScript software architect.

56
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.856
Because the patterns we're talking about,
singletons, factories,

57
00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:42.770
we talked about different ways to share,
state, how to keep them modular.

58
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.083
Those are all things that it
shared across the fields we do,

59
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:49.410
regardless of whatever
framework it is that you do.

60
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.523
So there are wonderful,
as you know, workshops or for

61
00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:57.127
those of you are new wonderful workshops
they have here to take your JavaScript or

62
00:02:57.127 --> 00:02:59.170
TypeScript knowledge further on.

63
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.290
So if typescript is scary,
definitely this is the place to check out.

64
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.004
Then for those who haven't had
the joy of checking this out,

65
00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:10.920
be sure to check out Nuxt.

66
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.670
Nuxt is kind of this wonderful paradise
of DX enhancements that the things you

67
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.270
love about Vue 3 they were like, cool,
we're going to just build stuff in

68
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.240
that we think has worked really well and
then you just try it out.

69
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.283
So things like the page,
the file based routing that we did,

70
00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.040
that's built into this.

71
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.125
So people who have been using Nuxt 3
have had this for quite some time.

72
00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:35.998
It's only recently come to Vue
3 as a separate place plugin.

73
00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:38.520
They have things like auto
imports on your composables.

74
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.477
They have already built-in patterns for
how API libraries can be, or

75
00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:44.040
API fetching can be done.

76
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.262
They have their own native use fetch as
well because we built like a very bare

77
00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:49.880
bones one on our own.

78
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.800
And then more importantly,
nuxt can handle all the SSR hydration.

79
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.786
You want to do some stuff static,

80
00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:00.115
you want to do some stuff like client
side rendered, it can do all that.

81
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:07.300
And so the hybrid rendering it makes
just to show you, nuxt hybrid rendering.

82
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.745
Like I don't know if any of you have
ever dove into this on your own,

83
00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:15.196
but like SSR is a rabbit hole.

84
00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:19.097
And so what's cool, da, da, da,

85
00:04:19.097 --> 00:04:24.297
check this out,
you can just set route rules and

86
00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:30.818
then tell it which strategy you
wanted to use for what page.

87
00:04:30.818 --> 00:04:35.242
Yeah, you say like cool, pre-render this,
do stable while revalidate on that.

88
00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:38.140
I mean the acronyms kind
of get all over the place.

89
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.940
But you can see here, I Don't know.

90
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.820
I don't know if it gets much
easier than that, right?

91
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.222
When it comes to mixing your
renderings strategy for your site,

92
00:04:47.222 --> 00:04:51.443
especially when a lot of things, you don't
need to be constantly re rendered or

93
00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:53.340
not everything needs to be SSR'd.

94
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.754
You know, I think in software development
we do have a tendency to like over

95
00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:58.790
index on whatever the hot thing is.

96
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.873
And so SSR was the way we always did it
and then it's almost like we forgot about

97
00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:05.111
it and then it became a thing again
that everyone's like, ssr everything.

98
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:08.230
It's like there's a world where
everything plays together.

99
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.800
And so
this kind of stuff reminds me that, yeah,

100
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.071
we can have some stuff that's
pre rendered, which is great.

101
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:15.450
You statically generate it.

102
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.050
Other stuff like blog posts, right, you
don't need that to be generated especially

103
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.750
on the client side, just generate one.

104
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.970
So deployment, cache it, things like that.

105
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.613
And so nuxt is phenomenal if you have a
chance to play around with another project

106
00:05:28.613 --> 00:05:31.410
and you're starting
a new VUE project again.

107
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.330
Can't speak highly enough of nuxt.

108
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.650
The team is phenomenal if you're
looking for someone to follow.

109
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.810
Daniel Rowe is the project lead on nuxt.

110
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.410
He is fantastic.

111
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.450
And then I'm curious,
has anyone here heard of vitepress?

112
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.970
Yay.

113
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.810
Okay, great.

114
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.381
For those who haven't,
this is the successor to vuepress,

115
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.530
if you didn't hear about that one.

116
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.385
And essentially it's just
a static site generator that

117
00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:59.600
creates a doc site that
looks just like vpress.dev.

118
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.240
it basically looks like this, except
everything is configured via markdown.

119
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.567
And so if you're getting started,
you can see here,

120
00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:11.560
da da da, the homepage is just that.

121
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.615
You add the title, the description,
some theme config stuff, and

122
00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:18.746
then you get all this navigation,
you get theming,

123
00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:23.657
you get the ability to have like next
page, like it's basically all marked down,

124
00:06:23.657 --> 00:06:27.320
but the back end of it,
it will statically generate for you.

125
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.080
And then it even uses VUE
underneath the hood for theming.

126
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.792
And so there's actually a lot of open
source projects use this these days and

127
00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:35.600
they're not even VUE related.

128
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.160
They just wanted to create a doc site.

129
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.974
And VPRESS is incredibly easy.

130
00:06:38.974 --> 00:06:41.120
You start up the starter project,
you add some markdown files.

131
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.720
Voila, it works.

132
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.340
It's pretty great.

133
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.780
So shout out to vitepress as well.

134
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.288
For those looking for like, hey,

135
00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:50.020
I want to spin up like a little
internal dock site for my team.

136
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.660
This is great.

137
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.178
This is like,
I can't this is phenomenal for

138
00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:56.691
that kind of thing and
people use it at scale like I think Pinia,

139
00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:00.160
all the docs you see in the View,
I think we all use vitepress.

140
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Pretty much
the whole like view nuxt.

141
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.340
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: I think Nuxt does have nuxt
docs though, so that's where I hesitate.

142
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.597
So it's similar, yeah, but nonetheles,

143
00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:13.300
vpress on its own impressive Nuxt docs,
I guess.

144
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.910
Honorary honorable mention to them as
well, having a chance to use them as much.

145
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.470
But they also create great stuff.

146
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.190
But yeah, you can see file based routing.

147
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.270
Yay, huzzah, congratulations.

148
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.350
You ought to be proud of yourself.

149
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.830
I really appreciate everyone
spending the time with me today.

150
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.386
I know it's been a long day, but again,
with all your feedback and questions and

151
00:07:36.386 --> 00:07:38.990
stuff, it really makes this
a pleasurable experience.

152
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.510
So thanks everyone for coming.
