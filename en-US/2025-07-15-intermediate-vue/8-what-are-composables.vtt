00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: So first thing first,
Composition API.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.372
Anytime you create a reusable
function with Composition API,

3
00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.800
we have landed on the term composables.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.880
Not my favorite, but
it's what we landed on.

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.853
So just know that going forward,
when you're looking at code bases and

6
00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:24.240
you see over here, this little Composables
folder, that is what that is referring to.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.343
Basically Composition API functions
that you will be using inside of your

8
00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:27.850
code base.

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.280
So the question is obviously,
what are composables, exactly?

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.970
And so they're basically functionality
that you want to reuse throughout your

11
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.640
components.

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.960
That's really what they are.

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.440
Let's just give a quick
demo of what that means.

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.340
All right, I'm on my begin branch and then
let me switch over to the exercise branch

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.720
so that that can get committed, great.

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.200
Okay, so we have our Composables folder.

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.869
And let's start by taking
a look at our task page, right?

18
00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:02.820
And so you notice here on the task page we
got there's a lot of stuff happening here.

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.780
In fact, I'm noticing there is,
let's see, there's a lot of weak stuff.

20
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.140
Filter tasks, so look, filter tasks, this
looks like a very task specific thing.

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.460
And as we can see here, it's actually
being used in two different places.

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.826
It's being used within the store,
which we'll talk more about later,

23
00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:22.380
as well as within this page here.

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.429
So this is something that's clearly right
for some type of refactoring because

25
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.190
basically, yep, there's no point in
them having two different places.

26
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.110
So let's go ahead and
just refactor this so we can use it.

27
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.750
So first thing first,
we're gonna go ahead and

28
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.150
we're gonna create a new file inside
of our Composables directory.

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.528
And so the standard for all composables
is that you prefix it with the word use.

30
00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:51.068
And so in this case we're just
gonna call it useTask.ts.

31
00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:53.070
And again, it's a typescript file,
but don't worry,

32
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.250
we're really not using very
much typescript at all, if any.

33
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.061
So then what I basically would
do is I would go ahead and

34
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:07.330
basically cut this out and
throw this over here and then that's gone.

35
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.050
And then I'd go ahead and
take a look at the task store.

36
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.930
And where is that filter?

37
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.173
Here you go, here's the filter.

38
00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:23.040
So this is the actual method as we can see
here, there is a lot is going on here.

39
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.098
So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna
do the controversial thing and

40
00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:28.480
we'll talk about this more
when do stores later.

41
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.600
I am actually gonna take this out of
the store and put it in a composable.

42
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.032
So here we're gonna take
the filter task method.

43
00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:41.044
And so this actually I'm just
gonna replace this one right here.

44
00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:46.182
And then, so we have the filters, and

45
00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:51.650
then that is a function that will, yep.

46
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.130
And then what we need to do then is
be able to access the task list.

47
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.796
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
actually say task list is going to

48
00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:02.010
be a task like this that
we're gonna pass in.

49
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.930
And so it'll be basically an argument
that we're passing into our composable.

50
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.740
And then I think everything
is mostly good from there.

51
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.371
All we need to do now is import
the type to say it's a type task and

52
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:21.660
that it uses task filters, and
then we're gonna export this as such.

53
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.900
And there you go,
now it's formatting correctly.

54
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.060
Okay, so now what we have here is
a reusable JavaScript function, right?

55
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.340
That's what we have.

56
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.990
And so what we can do now is
inside of our task store.

57
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.352
I actually can leave it out because the
only place is actually being called was

58
00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:42.310
here inside of the filter method.

59
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.857
But I no longer need this anymore because
what I can do then is basically say,

60
00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:54.710
okay, I'm gonna import filter
tasks from my composable use task.

61
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.470
That's really all a composable is.

62
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.377
It's allowing us to basically modularize
parts of our script setup block into

63
00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:06.710
different files that we can then import.

64
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.870
Really that's what it is at its simplest.

65
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.097
And I wanna emphasize that because I
remember when I first was introduced to

66
00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:15.461
this sort of concept, and
if you're new to JavaScript,

67
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.826
it can feel kind of intimidating
to move stuff to files and

68
00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:20.069
then especially if you don't
know how imports work.

69
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.310
We'll talk a bit more about
naming strategy in a sec.

70
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.550
But this is really at its core what it is.

71
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.728
And so the reason Composables have become
very popular is because rather than

72
00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:34.966
grouping things via how they work in VUE,
so in Vantre, we used to have stack,

73
00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:39.770
actions, getter, so we would organize them
via data computed and all those things.

74
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.602
You can now organize them via
functionality, via features as this,

75
00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:47.530
rather than calling some sort of filter.

76
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.610
We know that this is associated with our
task feature, so we can drag that in.

77
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.330
And so let's drag one more thing here.

78
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.970
Let's say format status.

79
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.440
This is very specific actually to tasks,
but it actually looks like it's generic.

80
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.760
But from what I remember,
this one is pretty specific.

81
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.680
So we can take that out.

82
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.560
And let's see,
I like to do things alphabetical if I can.

83
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.240
So there you go.

84
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.560
This is filter.

85
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.713
So we're gonna have the format status,
but label, I like to be

86
00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:24.000
very specific with these so that you
can tell kind of what is going on here.

87
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.600
So for my task status, label,
I think will be good enough.

88
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.960
And then all we gotta do to expose
anything is the export keyword.

89
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.400
That is the main thing here.

90
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.640
Once you have that, we can go ahead.

91
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.720
And now at the top,
we can import format tasks label.

92
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.292
But it was format status before, so

93
00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:47.680
we need to make sure we update
that format task status label.
