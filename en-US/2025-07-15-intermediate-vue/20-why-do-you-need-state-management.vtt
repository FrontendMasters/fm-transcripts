&gt;&gt; Ben Hong: Some of you may be thinking,
why do you need state management?

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.640
After all,
you have the power of composables.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.320
Who needs it anymore?

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.760
I can do everything.

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.000
We don't need state management stores.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.240
Yes, it is true.

7
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.000
We basically model how data stores work.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.160
You basically are doing your state,
your getters, your actions.

9
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.748
The thing I always tell people about state
management libraries is that what you're

10
00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:25.280
providing your team is a set of
standards that everyone can follow.

11
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.941
Now granted, if you're going to author
your own internal state management library

12
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:34.336
that you heavily document and that's type
safe, and if you want to do all that,

13
00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:37.340
that is awesome and
I like more power to you.

14
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.866
But one of the things that things like
Pinia does allow us to do is the fact that

15
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.981
you have these full time
open source maintainers who

16
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:49.300
are basically trying to create,
especially within the VUE community,

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.171
they're very motivated to create
the best UX they can give you.

18
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:57.519
And so, for example, you can see here in
the new dev tools, let's see this here,

19
00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.960
here's like the little pinny icon,
little pineapple.

20
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960
You see here,
you can actually see all the stuff.

21
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.800
You can inspect it and even modify it, if
you need to test anything, save it down.

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.920
It can even track like the timeline
in terms of mutations.

23
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.240
So I believe if I went in here and
changed this.

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.960
Let me hide this real quick, update task.

25
00:01:23.422 --> 00:01:26.647
I think, I think I know why,
because that one's not connected yet.

26
00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:32.349
But you can see here, basically you
get a lot of this work for free.

27
00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:35.728
And to be honest, if you look
underneath Pinia in particular,

28
00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.170
it's really not that far from composables.

29
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.381
It's just a set of standards that's kind
of been agreed upon by the community.

30
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:45.981
So if you're worried about bulk and that
kind of stuff, Pinia has already, unlike

31
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:50.512
for those of us who were in the Vuex days,
the Vue 2, that was heavier because a lot

32
00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:54.500
of times you had to do a lot to manually
optimize the performance of it.

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.015
So back then a lot of people would use
global stores, basically one big store,

34
00:01:58.015 --> 00:01:59.780
and they would chunk out small stores.

35
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.820
But what they didn't know was that all
the stores are being lumped in together.

36
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.960
So anytime someone loaded something,
they were loading.

37
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.917
It was the whole like, ask for a banana,
get the rainforest kind of thing.

38
00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:10.313
And so Pinia by default,

39
00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:14.500
every time we do something like we see
here where we just do like a tax store,

40
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.571
time entry store, those are already
tree shaken, they're separate.

41
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.294
They're basically the equivalent of these
composables we have here, where as long as

42
00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:25.670
you're importing them on specific files,
it's already doing that for you.

43
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.242
There's no giant glob that's
being built together and

44
00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:31.455
then being shipped to your users.

45
00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:35.593
And so, for that reason, I find that,
generally speaking, state management

46
00:02:35.593 --> 00:02:40.070
libraries are helpful for especially large
teams, teams that need some standards.
