00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.250
Another fun text-based protocol
to experiment with, is IRC.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.806
This is one that you can try yourself, if
you know the name of a public IRC server.

3
00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:19.710
So, if we wanna connect to freenode,
can follow this procedure,

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.810
so, I don't know how many connections
the node will let us get away with,

5
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.670
but whatever, I'll just try it and see.

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.599
So here, we're connected now to
irc.freenode.net on the pseudo

7
00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:39.015
default IRC port of 666, [SOUND],
three sixes and a seven.

8
00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:45.568
Then to kind of set yourself
a nickname on IRC which is,

9
00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:49.860
again, a sort of old chat program.

10
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.800
You can do nick.

11
00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.349
Call it, Gave myself a nickname,
timed out.

12
00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:06.781
And then you need to specify user as well.

13
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.400
And once you do that,
now you can join a channel.

14
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.808
So I'm gonna join the cyberwizard channel,
and I can see a message,

15
00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:40.606
And now, if I actually hop on, so
I'm already in that channel in

16
00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:46.210
my IRC client on my server, so
I can just make sure that it worked.

17
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.790
Indeed, that's me, right there.

18
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.190
And I just posted this message from
Netcat, onto this chat protocol,

19
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.690
just by knowing how
the chat protocol works.

20
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.830
And now, I can also talk to myself,
and I see the message over here.

21
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.720
The way that the message is reformatted,
is you get these lines that are sort of

22
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.200
the hostname, I guess that's our IP
address right now, in this building,

23
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.530
then you get this keyword PRIVMSG, the
channel, and colon, and then the message.

24
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.745
So, I told myself, hello,
and now I can say back.

25
00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.360
I say, bye.

26
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.400
As you can see on the left, it was
sent successfully and I can, great so,

27
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.910
if you wanna play around with another text
based protocol, this one's pretty fun.

28
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.390
You can hop in the cyberwizard
channel on freenode and poke around.

29
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.686
Again, there are many commands, but

30
00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:52.149
here's just a few of them that you can
use to basically just have some fun.

31
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.940
So why don't we give everyone
a little bit of time to poke around.

32
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.090
Hopefully you can all
hop on IRC with Netcat.

33
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.912
Let's see how many of you
can get on at the same time,

34
00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:09.615
[LAUGH] before we hit a limit.

35
00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:13.460
If you could say something
on the cyberwizard channel,

36
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.300
then I'll leave this up on the screen,
so we can all see it.

37
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.910
That'd be kinda fun.
