00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.260
So someone asks on the chat,
can you show how to add username?

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.570
So you add the username
by doing these two steps.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.610
So there's sort of like, there's
the nick which is kind of like the one

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.570
that's the username that you're
gonna see on IRC on substack.

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.340
And then that's another username.

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.720
And then there's this other
part which is the user part.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.018
So you can see in these join
messages this part is the username.

8
00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:34.610
So there are two senses of that.

9
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.301
If you just copy this line, it'll work and
just set your nick to whatever you want.

10
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.575
So hopefully, this kind of,
Can help you to get an idea for

11
00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:57.614
how you might write your own IRC client,
or an IRC bot,

12
00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:01.800
or something like that, because it's
just a simple text based protocol.

13
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.331
And all that you need to do is write
a program that can generate those

14
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:12.038
messages which are just strings of
text and doesn't take very much.
