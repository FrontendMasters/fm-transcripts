00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.451
The Yo-yo package that you're

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:07.859
using to include the HTML strings-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

3
00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.700
&gt;&gt; Do you know if underneath,
that's just doing an innerHTML call?

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.053
&gt;&gt; It's actually doing
something pretty sophisticated.

5
00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:17.262
So the first thing that it does, so

6
00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:20.846
when you use that little HTML
with back ticks around it,

7
00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:26.510
that's a tagged template literal, which is
part of the language now in JavaScript.

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.280
&gt;&gt; In 6.

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in ES6.

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.738
And that kicks off this parser.

11
00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:36.886
I actually wrote the parser that Yo-yo
is using but it's few steps removed now,

12
00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.026
people have built more stuff on top of it.

13
00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:41.030
And I just use their thing,

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.708
cuz I don't wanna write my own stuff if
someone else did it in a way that I like.

15
00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:50.838
So those pieces are using
this package called morphdom,

16
00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:54.462
that's like virtual DOM,
but with the real DOM.

17
00:00:54.462 --> 00:01:00.429
So it does diffing with the DOM elements
that are already in the browser.

18
00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.506
And so you don't get the flash of page
content when you blow away the DOM tree

19
00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:10.755
by setting innerHTML or anything like
that, it does it more intelligently.

20
00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:16.755
And it also sets up all the event emitters
and everything in a pretty sensible way.

21
00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:23.290
&gt;&gt; So it's not just a Band-Aid
over an innerHTML call?

22
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.620
&gt;&gt; No, it's much more sophisticated.

23
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.795
There's a framework as well, it's the only
framework that I like, it's called Choo,

24
00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:32.965
C-H-O-O.

25
00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:39.150
And it's barely any more than what
he showed you [LAUGH] already.

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.800
And for something slightly more
complicated, I like to use Choo.

27
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.972
But for things that are as simple as this,

28
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.464
I think it's fine just
to use Yo-yo directly.

29
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:51.519
But there's another one called bel,

30
00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.990
I don't really even know what
the difference is, B-E-L.

31
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.500
Use either one, I think they both
kinda work basically the same.

32
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.456
So it was fun to see that unfold, cuz I
made it a tool for something different.

33
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:09.369
I made this like HTML parser for doing
stuff with some alt-virtual DOM packages,

34
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.260
cuz I don't like how
config heavy React is.

35
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.850
It's like, I don't have to use it,

36
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.590
I'd rather use other things
that I like better instead.

37
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.830
And then people took that and

38
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.690
found out that was faster in
a lot of cases to do diffing with

39
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.310
regular the DOM instead of virtual DOM,
cuz you save on some overhead.

40
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.830
It's not faster for all cases, but
it's like comparable in all cases, and

41
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.580
it's simpler.

42
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.651
And then other people took that idea and
built other pieces on top.

43
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:47.651
Built a whole kind of Redux-style
framework with unidirectional flow and

44
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:48.635
everything.

45
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:53.850
I think it compresses minified and
gzip-ed to be three kilobytes or

46
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.470
something obscenely small like that,
all told when it gets to the browser.

47
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.919
&gt;&gt; Makes it hard to track down like
what is actually happening, with with so

48
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.529
many different packages and
modules and frameworks.

49
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.595
&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] that is true.

50
00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:16.573
[LAUGH] Yeah,

51
00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:17.860
there's a lot of layers.

52
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.790
And I think as the web gets even
more features and more of this

53
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.090
technology becomes kind of stabilized,
you're just gonna get even more.

54
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.820
Just imagine how many things you have
to know now to be a web developer.

55
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.560
There's gonna just be even
more things in the future.

56
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.565
It's gonna just, I don't know,
I think it'll be fun.

57
00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:43.125
