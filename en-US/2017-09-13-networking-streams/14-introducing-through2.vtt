00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.970
Through is not part of core, so

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.770
you'll have to install it with NPM,
see if the NPM install through2.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.070
Another nice trick to use with NPM,
is if you do dash capital S or

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.020
dash dash save, then that's going to,
if you have ever package JSON,

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.640
it will put all of these things that you
install into the package JSON for you.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.050
Which is really nice,
if you are starting a project.

7
00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:32.846
Okay, so the other thing that I wanted to
show and then I think we can break, so

8
00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:35.807
that people can play around
with these a little bit,

9
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:39.670
is to show you what this looks like
with the newer core interface.

10
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.790
So, with core,
you require stream dot transform and

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.270
you can pass in an object that
has a transform function.

12
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.226
There's also a finish function,
which corresponds

13
00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:58.179
to what should happen when
the stream is done with, so

14
00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.029
I can copy loud dot js
to core loud dot js and

15
00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:07.860
we can use the core module
now instead of through2.

16
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710
So required.

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.070
So through2 becomes required
stream that transform.

18
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.176
And then our two upper function now
has to instantiate the transform

19
00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:24.876
stream with new and pass in an object,
that has transform in it.

20
00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:30.097
Another way of doing this would be
to instead of requiring stream,

21
00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:34.000
to require the package
readable stream from NPM.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.180
And I think that's a little
bit better most of the time,

23
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.120
because of the versioning that you get,
that I mentioned, but for now,

24
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.700
we'll just do it this way.

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.851
So now if I run this program,
core loud and I will,

26
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:52.860
provided some input, yeah,
so it works just the same.

27
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.950
So I'm gonna add these to the git repo,
and take a little bit of a break,

28
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.130
so people can poke around with these,
modify them, try to write them out.

29
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.630
Okay.
