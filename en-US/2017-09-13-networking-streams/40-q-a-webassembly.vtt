00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.333
JavaScript is in kind of a weird,
I wouldn't say weird, but

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:08.910
kind of in an interesting position
right now as a langauge and a platform.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.198
Because it's been around for a while,

4
00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:14.731
but just recently,
it's only been in the past six, seven,

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.123
eight years that it started becoming
like a actual development platform.

6
00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:23.117
Because prior to that you had browser and
compatibility issues and

7
00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:28.120
all sorts of crazy stuff that kinda kept
it from, being kind of a unified platform.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.110
And then all of a sudden,
it all started kinda converging together.

9
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.987
And then Node.js came out so now you've
got server side JavaScript and so

10
00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:38.400
everything's just exploding right now.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.608
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; There's so many toolkits and

12
00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:44.186
frameworks coming out for
it right now it's kinda crazy.

13
00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.430
Java went through the same thing
20 years ago so sorta the same.

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, though, JavaScript's
trajectory is gonna get even stranger.

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.920
&gt;&gt; It's probably.

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.210
&gt;&gt; Cuz of WebAssembly.

18
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.650
I don't know if you knew this, but

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.050
WebAssembly is already
in Node behind a flag.

20
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.290
I think it's enable wazum,
something like that.

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.191
Anyways, you could figure it out,
whatever it is, but

22
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.686
it's already in browsers as well.

23
00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:13.600
So it's like how's that gonna
change how we deal with code

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.817
that runs in the browser?

25
00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:19.475
Because now you can write code in any
language and use it from JavaScript or

26
00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:21.835
use it from some other
WebAssembly language and

27
00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.765
you can put your hot code
paths in WebAssembly.

28
00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:28.195
Who even knows what language you wrote
that in, maybe rust, maybe C, maybe,

29
00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:33.450
I don't know, some new language
nobody even knows about yet.

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160
It's gonna get even more strange
