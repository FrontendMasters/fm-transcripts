00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.630
So another fun thing to try with Curl,

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.890
is there's a dash capital H
that lets you set headers.

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.240
So if you want to experiment
with setting headers, you can.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.070
I'll show you an example of
what that would look like.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.030
So I run the server like before,

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.260
I can run Curl command and
I paste buffer, right?

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.845
So.

8
00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:31.300
Okay, so if we have our Curl command,
we can do something like dash H,

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.804
cool, colon, beans, and that's gonna
set our http header called cool and

10
00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.570
it's gonna set it to the value beans.

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.910
So that's just a little example,
you can play around it if you like.

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.120
Some servers are really particular
about the headers that you send.

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.085
Some people interpret
the HTTP spec very strictly.

14
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.960
[LAUGH] I don't tend to do that myself,
but.
