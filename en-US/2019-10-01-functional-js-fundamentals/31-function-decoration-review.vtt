00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.720
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Function decoration,
easier to add features, we can pseudo,

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.110
I mean that could appear to
edit our existing functions.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.037
In our functional programming world,
we wanna save every

4
00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:16.546
single little bit of code as a function
to be able to use again and again.

5
00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:19.080
I wanna be able to reuse
them as much as possible.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.247
Sometimes that would mean
writing a brand new function, or

7
00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:25.414
decorating, and therefore,

8
00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:31.187
appearing to edit our functions in order
we can use them in different situations.

9
00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:35.515
We were able to edit our multiply
by two function to create one that

10
00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:39.226
behaved like multiple by two,
but had a bonus feature.

11
00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:43.461
That it was only allowed to be run once,
and when it's run again,

12
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.386
was limited to saying sorry.

13
00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:49.962
That is [SOUND] for the first time
ever our functions got memories.

14
00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:52.001
Meaning we can convert
existing functions or

15
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.895
at least appear to by creating
a brand new function inside of it,

16
00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:58.023
storing it in its backpack the function
we wanna have trigger to run.

17
00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:03.513
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: [SOUND] Easier to debug
[SOUND] definitely need to know how this

18
00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:05.020
works under the hood.
