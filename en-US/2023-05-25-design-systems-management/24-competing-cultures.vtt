1
00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:04.396
So another thing that's really interesting
here is that some of these cultures

2
00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:06.157
are completely incompatible.

3
00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:11.740
And this is where the work around that
these authors have done a decade or

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.493
two ago.

5
00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:16.127
Really shine some light
on our approaches here.

6
00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:19.552
So the way this works is that cultures
which are diagonal from each other

7
00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.704
are like oil and water.

8
00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:22.984
They don't work well together.

9
00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:27.809
So if your organization has a creative,
entrepreneurial,

10
00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.349
kind of do-things-first culture,
this disruptive,

11
00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.876
create-adhocracy culture, it's gonna be
really hard for you to succeed down in

12
00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:44.191
this bottom left as a design system
with a control culture, okay?

13
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:48.993
The reason is because, the creative
culture is about disruption, right?

14
00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:53.233
While the controlling culture is saying,
we know the right way and

15
00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.680
we have got it for you.

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.653
So these two ideas are just incompatible.

17
00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:00.179
It's like trying to swim upstream.

18
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.286
If you're trying to operate in the control
model and your organization is creative.

19
00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:10.487
So I actually have a fun story I was
doing an interview with a woman who led

20
00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:16.232
the design system for a really large web
based product in the job market space.

21
00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:20.924
And she told me this kind of fun story she
said that when she began there the company

22
00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.167
was in startup mode.

23
00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:25.106
So they were up in that top right.

24
00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:28.833
The company was like trying to figure
out what their product would be.

25
00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.312
They recognized though,

26
00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:34.219
that the the interfaces in their
product were really inconsistent.

27
00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.774
So they felt that the design
system was what was needed

28
00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:42.596
to get them through those inconsistencies,
to get them under control.

29
00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:45.729
So the system they built
was intentionally limiting.

30
00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.361
They built something in that bottom left.

31
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:50.450
So they did this without
any of this knowledge.

32
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.460
They just intuitively thought,
this is what we need.

33
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.006
Their hope was that they were
gonna force the product teams to

34
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.856
use the same components and
felt that those teams

35
00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:04.046
would be able to do everything they
needed with little or no extension.

36
00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:07.314
What it turns out though
that the startup mindset,

37
00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:11.798
that creative culture of the organization
meant they were constantly

38
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.684
pivoting their direction in
search of a product market fit.

39
00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:19.119
So the pivots in the product
were the reason for

40
00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.037
the inconsistency in the interfaces.

41
00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:22.662
[LAUGH].

42
00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:26.804
And that was actually valid changes
they were making to try and find a fit.

43
00:02:26.804 --> 00:02:30.642
So when they offered this design
system to the product teams that

44
00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:33.130
was wildly limiting, very inflexible,

45
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.268
basically they just couldn't get
anybody to use the thing, right?

46
00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:39.197
It was like, not gonna happen.

47
00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:43.670
They just built what they
needed outside of the system.

48
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.704
Here's what she told me at
the end of that interview.

49
00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:48.065
I showed her all of this and
she was like, my gosh,

50
00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.909
you just explained what happened to me.

51
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.993
And she said, here's what she said.

52
00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:55.150
[COUGH] I wish we would have
recognized the need for

53
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.616
flexibility in the system as a way
of supporting the necessary pivots

54
00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:03.170
the company was taking to
find our place in the market.

55
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.762
That would've built trust with our
subscribers as an enabling tool instead

56
00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.635
of a restrictive one, right?

57
00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:14.251
So what she was describing without
actually knowing it was that she should

58
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:18.422
have been more intentional in
creating this collaborative design

59
00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:20.290
system subculture, right.

60
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.306
She should have been operating in
the top left of this graph and

61
00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.684
these two colultures
are actually compatible.

62
00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:30.990
The opposite diagonal is
incompatible as well.

63
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.293
So if your company is competitive right
you're in this do things fast market

64
00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:40.068
culture it's it's gonna be really hard for
your design system program to succeed if

65
00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:44.525
you're trying to do so as a collaborative
do things together kind of culture.

66
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.703
In fact, if you remember the story that I
told you at the beginning of this culture

67
00:03:48.703 --> 00:03:52.882
section, right, about the organization
that we walked away from after working

68
00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:55.973
with them for a year because
of cultural incompatibility.

69
00:03:55.973 --> 00:03:59.543
This is kind of what I was seeking
in my research, was to try and

70
00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:01.817
understand what had happened with us.

71
00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:06.215
And our client in that situation was
definitely in that bottom right.

72
00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:08.193
And we, as a service company,

73
00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:13.062
as kind of led by me with my own sort
of collaborative values influencing us,

74
00:04:13.062 --> 00:04:17.418
we definitely try to take that top
left approach in a lot of our work.

75
00:04:17.418 --> 00:04:19.454
We come alongside teams, right?

76
00:04:19.454 --> 00:04:22.940
We sit in the trenches with them and
we do the work together.

77
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.271
And what we were trying to do was build
a collaborative culture, subculture,

78
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.104
inside of a competitive
organizational culture.

79
00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:36.457
And it felt like oil and water, I mean it
was so hard, it just was not gonna work.

80
00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:41.389
I'm not saying that completely explains
everything in my situation, but

81
00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.256
my takeaway is that we have to,
me personally, I have to recognize...

82
00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:49.290
When we're working with more
competitive cultures and

83
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.369
make adjustments to how we work to better
align with what they need from us.

84
00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:54.750
These two cultures are compatible.

85
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.365
And I wonder sometimes now if we had taken
a more control approach in our system

86
00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:03.696
work, if we would have been able to
find a way to kind of work through those

87
00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:05.058
incompatibilities.

88
00:05:05.058 --> 00:05:05.942
This, I think,

89
00:05:05.942 --> 00:05:10.315
would have felt more like we were swimming
with the current instead of against it.

90
00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:15.131
So my big takeaway from this
stuff is that we kind of

91
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.580
have to look up from the work right?

92
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.278
We've got to look around and

93
00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:24.184
understand that all of these forces
really are actually at play.

94
00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:27.041
You can try to fight against this,
but it's really hard.

95
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.386
It's really exhausting.

96
00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:31.360
And oftentimes, it just won't work.

97
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.557
So understand that the cultures and
subcultures in your organization,

98
00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:41.593
your own subculture in a way that
gives it a chance at success, right?

99
00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:44.656
I always get this question.

100
00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:49.554
I think because people [LAUGH] a lot of
times when I share about this cultural

101
00:05:49.554 --> 00:05:51.853
stuff, I get a couple responses.

102
00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:56.654
One is, my gosh, you just showed me why
everything failed, which is great but

103
00:05:56.654 --> 00:06:01.117
like I also want it to be something
people can use to succeed going forward.

104
00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:04.173
And the other thing I get is
that individuals see this and

105
00:06:04.173 --> 00:06:06.591
they immediately know where they wanna be.

106
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.376
And so a lot of times they see I
personally I'm operating here and

107
00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:15.072
my organization is here does that mean I
should quit my job [LAUGH] it's like these

108
00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:18.461
existential conversations
that this kind of brings up.

109
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.907
And a lot of times I think when we see
that we're operating the way we want to

110
00:06:22.907 --> 00:06:28.028
but it doesn't work with the org culture,
then we wanna know, can we make a change?

111
00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:30.390
Can we impact from the bottom up?

112
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.831
Can we impact the culture
of the organization?

113
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:37.036
I mean, I'm an idealist and
I really want this to be the case.

114
00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:40.314
I want to say, yeah,
you can totally do that.

115
00:06:40.314 --> 00:06:45.370
I will say I've I've heard a few folks
who were sort of high level stage fours

116
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.270
where once they had that opportunity
to kind of be seen by the organization

117
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.879
as an influential leader they get
a seat at the table around culture.

118
00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:59.765
But it's really hard for this to happen
if you're not at a more mature state.

119
00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:03.524
So you kind of have to earn the right,
is what I'm saying.

120
00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:08.149
And that kind of comes back
actually to this diagram.

121
00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:13.545
I said, you'll remember I said that we
experience culture from the top down.

122
00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:15.477
But culture is not created that way.

123
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.760
It's created from the bottom up.

124
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.569
And you probably have seen
organizations trying to

125
00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:23.255
fix their culture by
adding artifacts right?

126
00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:27.544
Man nobody here is getting along, let's
buy a ping pong table, [LAUGH] right?

127
00:07:27.544 --> 00:07:30.102
Let's all go to lunch on Friday, okay,

128
00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:34.263
that's surface level stuff right
that doesn't actually help.

129
00:07:34.263 --> 00:07:39.094
But you do this you build culture
by identifying the commonality

130
00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:43.218
in the underlying assumptions
of the people you have.

131
00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:47.389
And you hone in on those
things as common values as

132
00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.761
your shared underlying assumptions.

133
00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:55.186
And when you can find unity there
the other two layers are just a natural

134
00:07:55.186 --> 00:07:57.143
outpouring of those beliefs.

135
00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:00.961
With that kind of cultural alignment,
the things that we say and

136
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:05.495
the things that we see are simply a
reflection of the things that we believe.

137
00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:10.207
I'll close this section with one simple
idea when that is that your design system

138
00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:12.854
won't make your products more consistent.

139
00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:14.521
Think about it, right?

140
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:19.521
You and I could take any design system,
no matter how restrictive it is, and

141
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:23.524
we could build the most wildly
inconsistent things with it.

142
00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:27.461
The hard truth is that people
will make what they want to make,

143
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:29.589
whether you have a system or not.

144
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:34.213
And the critical word in this
statement is the word want.

145
00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:39.210
So if consistency or
cohesion is your goal the only sustainable

146
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.036
way to get that is to change what
your subscribers want to do.

147
00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:47.543
You do that with culture,
not with pixels, not with code or

148
00:08:47.543 --> 00:08:50.571
documentation, not with figma,
not with react.

149
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:54.391
And your design system can be
a catalyst for this kind of change, but

150
00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:56.347
it's not going to do it on its own.

151
00:08:56.347 --> 00:08:58.049
This actually is the unspoken and

152
00:08:58.049 --> 00:09:00.799
deeply challenging mandate
of a design system team.

153
00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:03.522
This actually is your job.

154
00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:06.322
I hope that some of these ideas
will help you do that job

155
00:09:06.322 --> 00:09:09.012
a little bit better when
you get back to the office.
