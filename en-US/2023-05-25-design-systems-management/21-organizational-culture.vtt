1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.033
So we have gone through a lot and

2
00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:08.399
I have one more kind of major
section to share with you,

3
00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.263
and that's on design system culture.

4
00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:17.252
So I'll actually start this
off with another kinda

5
00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:20.857
quick story, if that's all right.

6
00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:25.861
In 2021,
my company spent about a year or so

7
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:31.249
working with a large
financial services company.

8
00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.861
They had hired us to come in and
help them, one, build a design system but

9
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:42.669
in parallel with that we were building
sort of an MVP for a new product idea.

10
00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:44.878
They're an older organization.

11
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:45.693
They've been around a while.

12
00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:50.127
One of those companies that is kind
of trying to make the transition

13
00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:52.037
fully into kind of digital.

14
00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.016
They have a lot of data they've
collected over the years and

15
00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:55.294
didn't quite know what to do with it.

16
00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:59.333
And so we're working with some folks
to try and turn some of that data,

17
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:03.247
that valuable stuff into interesting
products for their clients.

18
00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:05.415
They're really competitive company.

19
00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.827
They had a ton of new ideas and stuff and

20
00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:12.899
they were just really struggling to move
quickly on executing those new ideas.

21
00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.193
Again, we came in to help them
build one of those new products and

22
00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:17.905
then also build a design system.

23
00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:22.410
So hopefully, they could kinda take
that system work and then carry out

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.855
executing on some of these new ideas
a little bit faster in the future.

25
00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:30.620
So we jumped in alongside their teams and
we really got to work.

26
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.195
And I look at the stuff we created,
and I'm actually really happy with it.

27
00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:39.722
But [LAUGH] I wish I could sit here and
tell you how amazing this engagement was,

28
00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:43.309
but I'll be very honest,
it was a real struggle.

29
00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:46.038
And it was so
difficult that at the end of that year,

30
00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.712
we made the difficult
decision to just walk away.

31
00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:50.515
And we've never actually done that.

32
00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:53.664
In 14 years, never had we done that.

33
00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:58.450
And it was a really
difficult choice to make but

34
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.605
the reason that we gave for
walking away was this,

35
00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:06.688
cultural incompatibility.

36
00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:11.485
And I sat with this at the end
of the year over the kind

37
00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:15.726
of break into the new year and
the holidays and

38
00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:20.202
all that, and
it just didn't sit well with me.

39
00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:24.726
So I spent basically all of
last year trying to understand

40
00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.903
what this actually meant.

41
00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:28.234
Why the heck did this happen to us?

42
00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:29.121
What did we miss?

43
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.783
What do I not know about this concept?

44
00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:36.832
And I basically was just talking to
anybody who would give me any time

45
00:02:36.832 --> 00:02:42.246
to talk about culture, who actually
knew what they were talking about.

46
00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:46.633
And that research kinda led me down
a lot of different rabbit holes.

47
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.929
But there's a couple of concepts in
sort of organizational culture that that

48
00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:54.759
are not mine that are like decades
old work, that have been around for

49
00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.921
a while that I think are actually really
important and kind of inform the way

50
00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:03.242
that we should be thinking about this
stuff in the systems work we're doing.

51
00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:06.861
Now, talking about culture in and
of itself can be really challenging.

52
00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:10.822
So it's a very nebulous thing,
so I thought it might be good.

53
00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:15.073
I just was looking for a really good
definition of organizational culture, and

54
00:03:15.073 --> 00:03:18.497
the one that I found,
there's many out there, but the one that I

55
00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:22.240
found that really stuck with me was
by a gentleman named Edgar Schein,

56
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.942
who's a social scientist and
a university professor here in the US.

57
00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:30.649
He offers a really simple model that
we can use just to kinda have some

58
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:34.368
language to talk about
organizational culture, and

59
00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:37.692
he said that culture is
made up of three layers.

60
00:03:37.692 --> 00:03:41.112
The first is our basic
underlying assumptions.

61
00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:47.327
The second is our espoused beliefs, and
the third is the artifacts of the culture.

62
00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:50.991
So, we can think a little bit
more about these in detail.

63
00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:55.437
When I say artifacts, what he meant
when he said artifacts is that these

64
00:03:55.437 --> 00:04:00.475
are the things you see, the really visible
aspects of your culture, the perks,

65
00:04:00.475 --> 00:04:05.662
the benefits, the ping pong table, maybe
the free lunch, those kinds of things,

66
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:09.697
the stuff that's really obvious
on the surface of the culture.

67
00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:14.861
The espoused beliefs are the things
that people say about your organization?

68
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:20.419
So the company mission, the vision, the
values, maybe the slogan that's painted

69
00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.840
in huge letters on the wall, or the email
signatures, or whatever it is, right?

70
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.125
The conversations even that
are happening in Slack or

71
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:32.267
Teams where people are talking
about the company.

72
00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:36.968
And then the basic underlying assumptions
are what people actually believe

73
00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:38.591
about the organization.

74
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:42.881
And these, of course,
are much harder to get at.

75
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.812
Usually in fact, these are kind
of revealed when things get hard.

76
00:04:46.812 --> 00:04:50.452
So you don't know what someone really
believes until they're forced to make

77
00:04:50.452 --> 00:04:51.914
a really difficult decision.

78
00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:54.501
They're forced to prioritize
one thing over another.

79
00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:59.538
Now as an employee, you experience
these things from the top down.

80
00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:02.287
So on your first day at a new company,
you come in,

81
00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:06.555
you get your laptop or whatever,
you observe what's happening around you.

82
00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:08.286
Maybe you get that free lunch or whatever.

83
00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:12.881
And eventually, you start to have some
conversations with folks once you get to

84
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.153
know them, and you hear what they say.

85
00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:17.712
And then at some point, your leaders or

86
00:05:17.712 --> 00:05:22.678
peers are gonna be faced with a difficult
situation, and you will learn what

87
00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:27.658
they truly believe based on the decisions
that they make in that tough time.

88
00:05:27.658 --> 00:05:32.373
And when these things don't align,
right, we call it a weak culture.

89
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:34.947
So that means the things that you see or

90
00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:40.588
the things that you say don't align with
the things that people actually believe.

91
00:05:40.588 --> 00:05:42.684
Nobody wants to work in that environment.

92
00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:45.508
That's a weak culture or a toxic culture.

93
00:05:45.508 --> 00:05:50.190
Often times weak cultures have
an excessive number of policies and

94
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.788
procedures, right?

95
00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:55.086
They're kind of policing
the behavior of individuals,

96
00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:59.564
and they make decisions based on
the lowest common denominator of behavior.

97
00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:03.763
Now when these three layers all align,
we call that a strong culture, and

98
00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:08.098
that means the organization doesn't
need to be as explicit in stating their

99
00:06:08.098 --> 00:06:11.980
behaviors they expect because
the people all want the same things.

100
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.125
We have common underlying assumptions.

101
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.205
We align at the base level.

102
00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:19.828
We share those values.

103
00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:24.699
That alignment helps tremendously
in building an organization where

104
00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.915
people trust each other and
feel like they actually belong.

105
00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:32.349
Now I know I haven't said a single
word about design systems yet.

106
00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.342
I promise you I'm getting there.

107
00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:36.879
But I thought it would
be really important for

108
00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.485
us to take a few minutes just to have some
common language around culture that we can

109
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:45.460
use in the conversation about how
this applies to our work on systems.
