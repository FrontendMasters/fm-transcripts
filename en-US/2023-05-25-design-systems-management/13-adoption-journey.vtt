1
00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:07.044
So, the reason this works, I think,
is because like any new thing, right?

2
00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:10.986
When you're asking folks to change,
there's gonna be sticky points up front.

3
00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:11.560
So, right?
So,

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.413
the first few folks that come on board,
it's gonna be hard.

5
00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.270
You're gonna have to do some handholding,
you're gonna have to get in the weeds or

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.812
maybe even gonna sit with them and

7
00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:22.421
help them figure out some of
those integration points.

8
00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.961
Over time, you start to recognize
the patterns and the challenges and

9
00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.906
then you start to solve those
problems more efficiently.

10
00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:30.756
Now it's much easier for them to come on.

11
00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:32.136
It takes you less time and

12
00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.638
you can focus on supporting your
current subscribers better.

13
00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:38.675
So, it just gives you the time and
space available,

14
00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:41.997
frees up your space to do
the other important tasks here.

15
00:00:41.997 --> 00:00:46.747
So, I wanna talk with you a little
bit about how that impacts

16
00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:50.838
the journey of subscriber's
adoption over time.

17
00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:56.566
So, as you can tell by now,
I'm a really visual thinker.

18
00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.490
[LAUGH] So, none of these concepts make
sense to me until I get the napkin and

19
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.592
pencil out and start sketching stuff.

20
00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:04.690
And that's just the way my brain works.

21
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.191
In this case, I was talking
with a handful of subscribers.

22
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.914
Most of my conversations to be fair have
been with people of design system teams,

23
00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:16.103
but I've taken some time
over the last year or so

24
00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:19.663
to start having more conversations with
the people who we we're asking to use

25
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:22.983
the systems we're building and
I'm learning a ton of stuff from them.

26
00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.987
[LAUGH] And so, I've just started
asking them this question about,

27
00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:29.938
what is the journey like
to become a subscriber And

28
00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:34.645
early in stage two they describe it kind
of like this, if we're plotting out say

29
00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:38.229
their excitement versus their
frustration maybe on the Y and

30
00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.690
we're thinking about the time and
effort across time over the X axis here.

31
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.738
This is kinda what they tell
me in their early stages like,

32
00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:48.990
somebody did a good job of
selling something to them, right?

33
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.453
So early on, they're excited.

34
00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:51.032
Okay, great.

35
00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:52.070
This is gonna be amazing.

36
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.631
It's gonna save me time,
my work will be better.

37
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:55.938
All of this?

38
00:01:55.938 --> 00:02:00.559
And then you'll notice this like
scary slope instantly down, right?

39
00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.894
And that's because as soon as they start
getting into this and start actually

40
00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:09.776
trying to put it into practice, there's
a lot of frustration that surfaces, right?

41
00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:14.690
Especially early in stage two, when you
probably you just released your first

42
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.269
version, so
it's probably buggy in some ways, right?

43
00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.114
You haven't actually gone through a lot
of these adoption processes yet, so

44
00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:25.796
there's a lot of kinks
to work out there and

45
00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:29.765
of course you're just asking them
to change the way they work.

46
00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.680
And of course,
it takes a good amount of time here for

47
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.542
us to climb out of that
dip of frustration, right?

48
00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:40.239
There's gotta be real value that we're
showing for them to actually get

49
00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.105
back to being excited about the potential
value this thing can offer them.

50
00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:50.767
So, throughout stage two, there's a way
to kind of think about how to change

51
00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:56.529
this that actually helps you mature
through stage two in a really healthy way.

52
00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:01.018
And what you're trying to do is
get to what I usually seeing

53
00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:05.048
like a really healthy late
stage to adoption which is

54
00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:08.913
something that looks
a little bit more like this.

55
00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:11.303
So you've done a better job you can see,

56
00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:16.028
early on you've done a really good job
of setting their expectations, right?

57
00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:18.935
[LAUGH] Like,
you're being more realistic with them,

58
00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:21.786
I think is maybe the the right
way to think about this.

59
00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:24.938
So you've, instead of kind of going in
with that big pitch of saying like,

60
00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:28.192
everything's gonna be amazing when you
use the system, you're going in and

61
00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:31.317
you're saying to them,
you're setting expectations appropriately.

62
00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:33.983
You're saying,
this is gonna take some work, but

63
00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:38.075
it's an investment that's worth the time
because it's gonna get us to a place

64
00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:40.069
where we can do better work together.

65
00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.779
So that's kind of the shift in the
language around that initial conversation.

66
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.718
And then you've done a lot of work here
to move the frustration levels up.

67
00:03:49.718 --> 00:03:53.835
This is all what I was talking about
earlier about making the system easy

68
00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:54.461
to adopt.

69
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:57.944
And we're gonna talk in a moment
about defining adoption paths,

70
00:03:57.944 --> 00:03:59.343
because that's one way.

71
00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:04.001
If they can see the end of the light
in the tunnel for their adoption,

72
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.050
that makes all of this
stuff kinda worth it.

73
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.717
So the more clarity you can give them
around what it's gonna be like and

74
00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.394
here's the steps you can take,

75
00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:15.455
that actually makes this a lot
less frustrating for them.

76
00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.709
It's not that the work is different,

77
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.646
it's just their experience compared to
the expectations you set is more aligned.

78
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:27.634
And then of course, the result of those
two changes is that, this point where

79
00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:31.856
they move from being frustrated
to being excited is a lot sooner,

80
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:33.497
which is great, right?

81
00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:36.816
They're happier, sooner.

82
00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:40.661
So really some clarity and forethought
is really gonna help this, right?

83
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:45.236
It's going to help in moving that that
starting point lower that trough up.

84
00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:49.273
And then the combination of those things
kind of brings their their excitement

85
00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:51.240
level a little sooner in the process.

86
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.847
So let's talk about ways
to kind of do these things.

87
00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:57.797
Well, we spent some time in stage
one thinking about our adoption or

88
00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.746
our subscriber groups, right?

89
00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:04.140
So now the second part of this if we're
gonna start to actually track adoption

90
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.519
in stage two is that we have to
define what parts, pieces and

91
00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.247
parts of the system
are adoptable on their own.

92
00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:14.956
Now, part of the intent with
the anatomy of a design system model is

93
00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:19.664
that it is intended to be adopt,
the way that's broken down is that

94
00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:24.566
these layers create things that
are adoptable in and of themselves.

95
00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:29.559
So, in other words it's possible for
a subscriber to just use the foundational

96
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:34.327
concepts to not use any of your assets but
just to understand your guidelines

97
00:05:34.327 --> 00:05:39.171
around color and actually create something
that aligns perfectly whether or

98
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:43.815
not they use your specific tokens or
your core systems to do that, right?

99
00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:48.085
So, I can adopt at a foundational level,
that's a valid adoption, right?

100
00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:52.177
Now, you don't necessarily have to use
my model, but what I want you to do is,

101
00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:56.145
however you've defined your system,
is think about what are the pieces and

102
00:05:56.145 --> 00:05:57.947
parts that can be adopted, okay?

103
00:05:57.947 --> 00:06:00.886
And then this one seems ridiculous, but

104
00:06:00.886 --> 00:06:04.522
you actually have to define
what adoption means.

105
00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:09.028
And like this seems like I can't tell you
how many articles I've read where like

106
00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:11.179
the first sentence of the article is,

107
00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:15.097
we launched our design system a year
ago and we have 80% adoption.

108
00:06:15.097 --> 00:06:18.685
And I stop at that point and
I just say to myself, like,

109
00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:22.512
80% adoption,
like what the heck does that even mean?

110
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:24.891
That literally means nothing to me.

111
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.748
So I don't understand how anybody
could even use that statement.

112
00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:34.016
And let me give you just a few statements
to help you understand why there's so

113
00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:35.811
much more nuance to this.

114
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:42.022
So here's just a few situations you might
find yourself in, One of your subscribers

115
00:06:42.022 --> 00:06:46.618
uses the grid and spacing core system from
your design system to handle layout in

116
00:06:46.618 --> 00:06:51.843
their product's production code, but they
don't use your color or elevation systems.

117
00:06:51.843 --> 00:06:53.222
So are they adopted?

118
00:06:53.222 --> 00:06:57.211
Is that part of the 80% adoption?

119
00:06:57.211 --> 00:07:00.876
One of your subscriber teams uses
everything that your design system offers,

120
00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:03.108
but only in the sign-up
flow of their product.

121
00:07:03.108 --> 00:07:06.267
So is that adoption?

122
00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:09.569
The UX folks on one of your product
teams use the design system

123
00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:10.872
to prototype and test.

124
00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:11.642
That's great.

125
00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:15.485
But the developers on that same product
team aren't using the engineering assets

126
00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:16.604
that you also provide.

127
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:19.234
Is that adoption?

128
00:07:19.234 --> 00:07:23.338
One of your subscriber teams uses
a version of the design system that's two

129
00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:24.194
releases old.

130
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.493
How does that count, right?

131
00:07:26.493 --> 00:07:30.887
The devs on one of your product teams
start with your design system components,

132
00:07:30.887 --> 00:07:33.520
but they modify them to
fit a specific use case.

133
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.508
Is that adoption?

134
00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:36.834
[LAUGH] So you get the point here, right?

135
00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:43.128
There are so many ways, there are so
many nuances to this conversation.

136
00:07:43.128 --> 00:07:48.988
So, what we have to do is actually give
your subscribers a path to follow.

137
00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:52.743
And you dont have to only have one path,
but you gotta have something for

138
00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:55.683
them to [INAUDIBLE] On to, and
so what we need to do is start

139
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:59.771
to think more about all this from
the perspective of your subscriber groups.

140
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.236
So what's the path that
they need to follow in

141
00:08:03.236 --> 00:08:06.893
order to become a subscriber
at various tiers?

142
00:08:06.893 --> 00:08:11.605
And the way to do that is to give them
tiers of adoption levels of adoption to

143
00:08:11.605 --> 00:08:13.507
that they can use as targets.

144
00:08:13.507 --> 00:08:17.020
And so here's an example
of just a very simple set.

145
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.489
And I'm not saying you should use this,
right?

146
00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:22.743
Though, all of this stuff has to be
customized for your specific use cases but

147
00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:27.061
here's an example where we might say
a level one adaption means you understand

148
00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:29.431
and apply the foundations layer, right?

149
00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:30.531
That simple.

150
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:34.848
And a level two means you're
using the core system assets for

151
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.551
layout type and color.

152
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:38.030
So it's another way to think about it.

153
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.431
We're saying hey, layout type and
color is gonna get us a long way there.

154
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:47.365
We've offered some really good systems for
you to put into practice in your features,

155
00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:48.320
your products.

156
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.911
So after you've started
applying the foundations,

157
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:54.892
jump right into using these assets we've
built for you in your specific context.

158
00:08:54.892 --> 00:08:56.892
Level three maybe.

159
00:08:56.892 --> 00:09:00.484
Use all the parts of the fundamental
layers, that's the first three layers

160
00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:04.030
that's just not components,
basically everything but the components.

161
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.899
Level four,

162
00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:09.328
use all parts of the components
that are relevant to your product.

163
00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:12.315
And then maybe we say level
five is more involved, right?

164
00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:15.048
This is where we're getting you
to contribute back in some way.

165
00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:18.898
So that's like a level five adoption.

166
00:09:18.898 --> 00:09:21.535
So and again, I just want to reiterate,

167
00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:26.121
I'm not telling you this should be
your roadmap for adoption, okay?

168
00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:30.316
You'll have to do the work to understand
what makes the most sense based on

169
00:09:30.316 --> 00:09:32.694
remember we discovered the right scope.

170
00:09:32.694 --> 00:09:35.554
So the early versions of a design
system are all gonna look different.

171
00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:38.323
So you need to look at that
scope that makes sense for you.

172
00:09:38.323 --> 00:09:40.782
What is it that you're
actually offering folks?

173
00:09:40.782 --> 00:09:45.731
And then you need to tell them, here's
a good path for you to come on board.

174
00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:49.614
If those subscriber groups have
product owners or project managers or

175
00:09:49.614 --> 00:09:54.088
whatever that role is, where there's
someone who's kind of leading the vision

176
00:09:54.088 --> 00:09:57.861
or the direction of a specific product,
sit down with those folks.

177
00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:02.114
They will help you understand the impact
of adoption for their product and

178
00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:05.064
you can talk through what
layers are reasonable and

179
00:10:05.064 --> 00:10:07.615
how these things can
build upon each other.
