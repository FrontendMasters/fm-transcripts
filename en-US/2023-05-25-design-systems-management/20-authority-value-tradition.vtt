1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.797
I have two main kind of
concepts to share with you.

2
00:00:02.797 --> 00:00:06.878
So one is a simple framework for
how to maintain stability, and

3
00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:09.188
one is a whole section on culture and

4
00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:13.276
how that impacts the work you're
doing on your design system.

5
00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:17.256
So we'll start with the stability.

6
00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.840
So I think originally I didn't even
think about this as something to sort of

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.645
investigate further, but I kept hearing
these stories that people were doing

8
00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:30.820
really good systems work and
everything around them was changing.

9
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.430
[LAUGH] And
almost without any fault in their work,

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.925
they were feeling the repercussions
of everything around changing.

11
00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:45.885
And I mean a lot of stuff, I think of
these now as destabilizing forces.

12
00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:49.619
So things like the industry changing,
or the market changing, or

13
00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.300
your leaders just all of a sudden
leaving and getting new ones in.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.751
The structure of the hall or the tooling
your organization decides to support,

15
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:58.767
there's thousands of these things, right?

16
00:00:58.767 --> 00:00:59.767
There's a handful, right?

17
00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:04.906
All this stuff, it's just our
organizations are just in flux nonstop.

18
00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:09.846
So, it's really hard, actually,
to create some internal tooling that can

19
00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:14.189
withstand all of these destabilizing
forces happening around it.

20
00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.048
And you combine that with the fact
that a system will not show

21
00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:23.128
you value until it's been around for
a while, and

22
00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:27.229
it's sort of ripe for
this destabilizing to win.

23
00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.631
[LAUGH] If it can't survive a lot of
this stuff, it will never show value.

24
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:37.913
So I realized pretty early on after having
some of these conversations with folks,

25
00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:39.572
there's got to be a way for

26
00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:43.884
us to be more intentional about
creating stability for the system.

27
00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:48.074
So I started asking a bunch of questions
in this and looking at organizations that

28
00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.784
have done this well or survived a lot
of these kind of things happening.

29
00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:55.924
And I identified three kind of
primary stabilizing forces.

30
00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.594
The first is authority, the second is
value, and the third is tradition.

31
00:02:00.594 --> 00:02:06.120
So as I mentioned earlier, a lot of
this stuff kind of is interrelated,

32
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.187
so you're gonna see some
concepts resurface here.

33
00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.917
But let talk about this quickly.

34
00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:17.313
So the authority stabilizing force
simply means that leadership is actively

35
00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:19.620
supporting the system and their goals.

36
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.891
The design system team has confidence,

37
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.782
right, to carry out their work
knowing the leaders have their back.

38
00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:29.319
And the key word here is active, actively.

39
00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.634
So if you can't point to very specific
things that your leadership is doing,

40
00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:39.890
that means you're not really benefiting
from that as a stabilizing force.

41
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.529
The kind of things that you can see in
design systems that have this stabilizer

42
00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:50.488
are things like real budgets,
dedicated time, dedicated staff.

43
00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:55.275
And beyond just encouragement from
leadership for the work to happen for

44
00:02:55.275 --> 00:03:00.220
people to use it, there's actually
an encouragement on the part of people

45
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.124
with authority inside the organization for

46
00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:07.064
subscriber teams to contribute
back in some capacity too.

47
00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:11.875
So they see it as everybody's
job in some ways.

48
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:16.009
Value, which we've talked about
a bit already, it just simply means

49
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:20.018
the system is offering real value to
the folks who you want to use it.

50
00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:23.743
So it actually helps them with their work,
it's something that makes them faster or

51
00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:24.589
more consistent.

52
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:28.729
It solves real problems for
them instead of introducing new ones.

53
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.904
And the kinds of things that
you see in design systems that

54
00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:34.765
have this stabilizer are rapid adoption,
right?

55
00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:38.498
I've made something to people, it's
valuable to them, so they will use it.

56
00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:40.547
There's a lot of feature requests,

57
00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:43.461
these teams get more bug
reports than anybody else.

58
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:46.603
And that's weird thinking this
is a really valuable thing, but

59
00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:48.650
it's because they're having more use.

60
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.109
And there's a sort of a default
willingness to help evolve

61
00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.935
the system in some way.

62
00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:58.255
And the third stabilizer is tradition.

63
00:03:58.255 --> 00:04:02.244
This means the system has become
the way we build interfaces

64
00:04:02.244 --> 00:04:04.008
inside an organization.

65
00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:06.716
And really,
once the system has taken root,

66
00:04:06.716 --> 00:04:10.502
there's a lot of stability
simply in its acceptance, right?

67
00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:13.159
Change is hard, so
it's hard to get people to use it.

68
00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.533
But once they use it, you can count
on the fact that if it's embedded,

69
00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:21.404
it's got some tradition,
those roots will hold it in place.

70
00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:25.613
A sign that you have this stabilizer
is when you hear folks from different

71
00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:30.177
disciplines talk about the design system
as if it's a single source of truth.

72
00:04:30.177 --> 00:04:34.622
That's a common phrase I hear when
tradition has kind of taken root.

73
00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:37.994
Now, tradition is a little bit
different than the others, right?

74
00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:42.073
It's really about having authority and
value over time.

75
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.514
It's something that you earn,
it's not a specific thing you do, right?

76
00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:53.000
It's just having these others over time is
what gives you that concept of tradition.

77
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.872
And remember we're still asking people to
change how they work, so only after that

78
00:04:57.872 --> 00:05:02.416
change has been made which is hard [LAUGH]
will you get this force of tradition.

79
00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:06.868
I like to show them in this way
because I think about them kind of as

80
00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:08.938
the legs of a tripod, right?

81
00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:13.050
Having a single one of this means you
can kind of fall over in any direction,

82
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.807
any destabilizing forces,
you're gonna fall.

83
00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:19.329
But having two means you can
only fall in two directions, so

84
00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:23.360
I can receive some destabilizing
forces from a couple directions.

85
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.555
But the goal, of course, is to get all
three, and that means you're stable on

86
00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:34.181
any surface in any situation, and that's
kind of what we're looking for, right?

87
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.717
So we've talked already,

88
00:05:35.717 --> 00:05:40.203
and you're probably seeing similarities
here about top down and grass roots.

89
00:05:40.203 --> 00:05:44.870
So the common top down origin
story is that it's likely in that

90
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.009
scenario that your first stabilizing
force is gonna be authority.

91
00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.510
So you're gonna get authority kind of
easier out of the gate if you're top down.

92
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.915
And in that case, you've got to focus
primarily on evolving the system in a way

93
00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:03.479
that makes it extremely valuable for
different subscribers.

94
00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.841
And that moves you towards the center
of this Venn diagram by way of

95
00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:09.666
the value stabilizer, and

96
00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:15.004
only after you've proven that value can
you earn the tradition, stabilizer.

97
00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:16.250
And the opposite is true.

98
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.338
If your system was initiated by
individual contributors, you're gonna

99
00:06:21.338 --> 00:06:26.436
to earn that grassroots or you're
gonna earn that value easier, right?

100
00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:28.903
That's gonna come to you a little easier,
and

101
00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:31.951
it's likely that'll be your
first stabilizing force.

102
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:35.223
In that case, you've got to make
sure you're educating leadership,

103
00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:38.179
engaging with leadership on
the value of the system regularly.

104
00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:42.541
And you have to do so using their language
as we've kinda talked a little bit about.

105
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:46.716
And that moves you towards the center
of the Venn diagram by way of

106
00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:48.584
the authority stabilizer.

107
00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:52.981
Only after you've gathered support
from your leadership can you earn that

108
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:54.454
tradition stabilizer.

109
00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:59.158
Now of course, it's not enough to earn
these things or to get these things,

110
00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:02.040
there is also the possibility
of regression.

111
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.314
So earning one of them doesn't
mean that you're done with it.

112
00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:09.266
If you, as an example,
slow the evolution of your system or

113
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:14.799
stop engaging with your subscribers, you
can lose the value stabilizer, and that

114
00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:20.193
puts you up in this risky spot, right,
the overlap of authority and tradition.

115
00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:27.552
That means that authority and tradition
are requiring individuals to use a system

116
00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:31.034
that is not helpful in their work,
it's not valuable to them.

117
00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:35.026
So this makes those individuals
feel like they're not trusted,

118
00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:37.069
it's a really risky place to be.

119
00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.779
And then here's a very specific example.

120
00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:45.362
One of the first massive
design systems that my

121
00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:51.011
organization worked on was for
a really large retailer.

122
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:56.216
Online and in-store, they had multiple
brands and you've probably shopped there.

123
00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:01.619
It's a big organization, they hired
us originally to come and to do,

124
00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:07.584
this was way back, to do a responsive
redesign of their product detail page.

125
00:08:07.584 --> 00:08:11.721
That was probably about seven or
eight years ago that we did that work, and

126
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:12.728
it took us a year.

127
00:08:12.728 --> 00:08:16.070
I've never worked for so
long on a single page, but

128
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.438
we spent an entire year working
just on their product detail page.

129
00:08:20.438 --> 00:08:25.592
Because that's the decision point for
this organization for $4 billion or

130
00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:30.600
something [LAUGH] every year, so
there's a huge risk to make changes here.

131
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.118
So we just did it slow and steady,
we did lots of iteration, lots of testing.

132
00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:39.052
And we did really good work, we showed
massive improvements and it was a,

133
00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:41.602
by all accounts,
a really fantastic project.

134
00:08:41.602 --> 00:08:45.502
At the end of that engagement, they said,
this is great, we wanna continue,

135
00:08:45.502 --> 00:08:46.972
can you take some of this work?

136
00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:50.181
Can we use it in other parts of the flow?

137
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:53.620
Let's tackle category,
listing pages next or whatever.

138
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.550
And so we were like, yes, but

139
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.269
give us just a couple of weeks
to take a look at something.

140
00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:03.369
So we spent a couple of weeks sort of
prototyping, moving some of the work

141
00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:07.807
we had done on that single page experience
into a more systematic approach, so

142
00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:11.255
it could be reused across other
parts of their e-comm site.

143
00:09:11.255 --> 00:09:13.241
And we went back and we said, look,

144
00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:15.971
we did a really rough
prototype of this in a week.

145
00:09:15.971 --> 00:09:20.691
I think if we spent a month or two here,
we could actually take what we've done on

146
00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:25.360
your product detail page, turn it into
the beginning of a nice system for you.

147
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.154
And that will enable us to do the rest
of this work a lot more quickly.

148
00:09:29.154 --> 00:09:31.194
And so they said, that sounds great.

149
00:09:31.194 --> 00:09:34.880
And at this time, I'm just interacting,
we're just working directly with

150
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.122
our contacts, right, the people
who own the product detail page.

151
00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:42.553
So we spend a month or two doing that,
then we jump into this other work.

152
00:09:42.553 --> 00:09:46.659
It works really well, we started getting
subscribers across the organization.

153
00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:50.967
At the end of that year, we had 12
different groups throughout the company

154
00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:53.543
that were using the system
in some capacity.

155
00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:58.233
And I will never forget the day that
we got the call from them saying,

156
00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:01.623
stop all work on the design
system immediately.

157
00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:03.584
And I thought to myself, what the heck?

158
00:10:03.584 --> 00:10:09.694
[LAUGH] We just did all this amazing
work for you and it's clearly working.

159
00:10:09.694 --> 00:10:12.926
And at the time,
we were a smaller organization and

160
00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:17.978
this was a large part of our revenue, it
was a scary call to get just to be honest.

161
00:10:17.978 --> 00:10:24.020
And I look at what happened now, and
I understand it so much more clearly.

162
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.013
But apparently, what happened internally
there is that the amount of money they had

163
00:10:29.013 --> 00:10:32.178
spent on this thing called
design system crossed some

164
00:10:32.178 --> 00:10:36.609
threshold that bubbled it up in a
spreadsheet or report somewhere that some

165
00:10:36.609 --> 00:10:41.499
leader saw this thing in a budget report
and said, what the heck is design system?

166
00:10:41.499 --> 00:10:43.619
I never approved money for that.

167
00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:47.489
And what happened in that very
situation is this, right?

168
00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:51.167
We had built something with
a tremendous amount of value,

169
00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:55.745
it was earning tradition, but
we had never gone up to leadership to say,

170
00:10:55.745 --> 00:11:00.569
this is worth it, it worth the investment
for you to put money towards this.

171
00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:05.208
So they just pulled the plug like that,
one phone call, done.

172
00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:08.356
Now, [LAUGH] we knew how
valuable this stuff was, and so

173
00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:12.548
did our partner inside the organization,
so we were really fortunate.

174
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:15.018
We sat down with them, and
they said, you know what?

175
00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:18.866
We have great relationships with all
12 of these subscriber groups, so

176
00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:20.428
let me go to them and just ask.

177
00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:25.068
So the ask of those groups was,
okay, do you remember that project we

178
00:11:25.068 --> 00:11:29.068
did with you where you use
the system last year, can you tell

179
00:11:29.068 --> 00:11:33.963
me roughly how long would it have taken
you to do that without the system?

180
00:11:33.963 --> 00:11:38.156
And so this is definitely finger in the
wind kind of guesstimate type stuff, but

181
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.846
we got back some numbers
from each of these groups,

182
00:11:40.846 --> 00:11:43.993
we put all that stuff into
a spreadsheet to show the impact.

183
00:11:43.993 --> 00:11:47.760
And what we learned is that for
every dollar they had invested so

184
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.167
far in the design system, they got
$3 back just in developer efficiency

185
00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:54.674
just over the course of one year, right?

186
00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:58.834
So clearly, it was like a no brainer for
them to continue to invest.

187
00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:02.668
They took that up to that executive,
got the sign off, and

188
00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:06.834
we worked with them for
another six years or something on that.

189
00:12:06.834 --> 00:12:10.663
So that's the risk, right, those things.

190
00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:14.403
That leader will cut you off in
a heartbeat if they don't understand

191
00:12:14.403 --> 00:12:18.483
what's going on, and that's why it's
really risky to be in this space.

192
00:12:18.483 --> 00:12:23.103
So, this model has helped me a lot, so
I think about it a little bit like this,

193
00:12:23.103 --> 00:12:24.607
it's not super pretty.

194
00:12:24.607 --> 00:12:27.208
But it really gives us
a way to think about and

195
00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:30.934
just to be conscious of are we
actually creating stability, or

196
00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:34.898
are we living in this sort of risky
right side of this stuff, okay?

197
00:12:34.898 --> 00:12:38.896
And it's again, hearkening back
to the origin story, concept, and

198
00:12:38.896 --> 00:12:42.897
just really making sure that we're
balancing the needs of individual

199
00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:45.968
contributors with the goals
that your leaders have.

200
00:12:45.968 --> 00:12:48.404
So one thing that you can do and

201
00:12:48.404 --> 00:12:52.901
we don't necessarily have to
take time to do this now.

202
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:57.059
But it's actually helpful to sit down and
just sketch this out and

203
00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:01.442
actually think through like,
what are the things that I can show that

204
00:13:01.442 --> 00:13:05.466
demonstrate that we actually
have authority as a stabilizer?

205
00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:09.041
So what are the things they've done for
me in the last two weeks?

206
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:12.083
What are the things they've done in
the last month that have shown support?

207
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:15.969
What are the things that I've heard from
subscribers that mean that we actually

208
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:18.463
are offering something valuable to them,
right?

209
00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:23.019
By keeping track of some of that stuff and
just pausing every once in a while,

210
00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:27.291
sketch that out and make sure that
you're not drifting into these risky

211
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:29.876
areas is actually really helpful for you.
