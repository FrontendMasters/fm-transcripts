1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.504
So, I actually wanna take just
a moment for us here and for

2
00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.261
those of you who are online.

3
00:00:05.261 --> 00:00:08.154
To just for you to sketch out,
you can do this on a piece of paper,

4
00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.846
in a spreadsheet or
however you feel comfortable doing it.

5
00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:14.964
But identify for
me where is your maturity level, so

6
00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:21.531
far based on what I've shared with you,
and what origin story path have you taken?

7
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.042
So you can sketch out something like this,

8
00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:28.383
just these little eight boxes will be
enough for you to kinda sketch that.

9
00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:32.327
We can take just a moment, but if anybody
here wants to share and they can see it

10
00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:35.984
and they know pretty well, if you can
just call it out I'd love to hear.

11
00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.457
&gt;&gt; Story that you told where you
are grassroots until stage 2 and

12
00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.876
then you have all of this budget.

13
00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.962
I feel we're just on the cusp of
executive leaders understanding

14
00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:48.531
the importance of this.

15
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:49.936
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where they're gonna

16
00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:52.028
start throw a whole bunch of money at it.

17
00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:54.577
Maybe it's a good thing,
maybe it's a bad thing.

18
00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:55.457
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

19
00:00:55.457 --> 00:00:59.080
that was a scary reality to see that, cuz
that's exactly where we stand right now

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.055
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually really exciting.

21
00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:05.055
I mean,
that's a huge potential in that situation.

22
00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:08.093
So, that means you probably
have built something so

23
00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.932
far that's actually really valuable,
right?

24
00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:12.857
&gt;&gt; And then it all comes down
to the accessibility part.

25
00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:17.075
I think there's a very large push to
make sure that we're ADA compliant.

26
00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:17.591
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So

27
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:22.677
seeing some of the very core elements
that we're putting together and

28
00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:26.742
actually walking through
with the executive leaders.

29
00:01:26.742 --> 00:01:30.240
How a screen reader would interact
with this particular input,

30
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.489
has made them realize
the importance of what we're doing.

31
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:38.404
&gt;&gt; I love that because I feel a lot of the
work that I do in consulting is helping

32
00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:41.836
my clients, so
that might be a design system lead.

33
00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:43.224
In a coaching scenario,

34
00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:46.799
identify what are the things that
specific leaders care about.

35
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.605
And we try to understand then how we can
sorta formulate a version of a story of

36
00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:55.748
the system that tells it in a way
that shows that benefit, right?

37
00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.015
So in that case,
if you've got leaders who,

38
00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:02.015
they know they're afraid of that lawsuit
coming in because of accessibility,

39
00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:05.072
it's very simple to tell that
story with the design system.

40
00:02:05.072 --> 00:02:08.636
I have others where, I'm actually doing
some work right now around sustainability.

41
00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:13.236
So how do we create products that
do a better job managing carbon and

42
00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:15.469
our impact on the environment?

43
00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.579
Well, there's lots of ways to do that, and

44
00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.621
if you are willing to kinda do
the work at the systematic level.

45
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.771
You can spread all of that really
good sustainable design and

46
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:27.603
development practice across the
organization much faster than trying to

47
00:02:27.603 --> 00:02:29.779
educate all those teams independently.

48
00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:35.990
So lots of stories that can be told to
help create that interest from leadership.

49
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.716
Anyone else wanna share sorta where
they were and their journey a little?

50
00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:47.574
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd say we're a company of 18, so
everything feels grassroots and top down.

51
00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:51.841
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I'd put us in the stage 1, halfway.

52
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:53.271
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

53
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.132
Yeah, totally cool.

54
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.532
And I think especially in
smaller organizations,

55
00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:59.781
the lines between those things
are definitely compressed, right?

56
00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.218
For sure, so yeah, you guys?

57
00:03:02.218 --> 00:03:07.079
&gt;&gt; We're definitely top down and I think
this is a common probably pattern for

58
00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.096
a lot of lager organizations.

59
00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:11.775
It comes down either through
engineering or through design.

60
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.880
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Typically through design,

61
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.738
although not exclusively.

62
00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:18.668
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that raises really interesting

63
00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:22.686
challenges, cuz the bias
then becomes on design and

64
00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:28.090
often operates a little bit too
independent of engineering insight.

65
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.644
And yeah, we're kinda I think
somewhere between stage 2 and stage 3.

66
00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:38.654
I think we have all [LAUGH] the challenges
of stage 3, and we're still in stage 2.

67
00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:39.926
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

68
00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:41.637
&gt;&gt; It's, very much feels
like teenage years [LAUGH].

69
00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:43.074
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get that.

70
00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:46.277
And we're gonna talk a little
bit later about what

71
00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:48.570
I call the teeter totter maturity.

72
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.569
Which is where we move between 2 and
3, back and forth and back and forth.

73
00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.551
And I'll try to kinda give you some
ideas on ways to prevent that.

74
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:57.637
It's really common,

75
00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:01.644
I have worked with teams who have spent
years struggling between those two stages.

76
00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:05.817
And there's a few things you have to get
right in order to move to stage 3 really

77
00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:08.615
solidly, so,
maybe some of that would be helpful.

78
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.470
Okay, so the next thing I actually
wanna have you to do, is also just for

79
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.290
you in your heads at this moment.

80
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.069
But I want you to think about,
one or two things that you think

81
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.957
you have to do in order to move
into the next stage of maturity.

82
00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:26.547
So just take a moment and
jot those ideas down.

83
00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:31.177
So while you're doing that, I'll also
just say, if there's questions about so,

84
00:04:31.177 --> 00:04:34.717
I've given you a very,
very high level of the maturity stages.

85
00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:38.713
We're gonna deep dive into each
of those in a few moments, but,

86
00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:44.055
are there questions about those stages or
questions about the origin story concept?

87
00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:48.054
Anything that we can address here
before we move into the framework for

88
00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:48.950
how to mature?

89
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.239
&gt;&gt; Could you give some examples,

90
00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:55.288
you talked about how it happens
from the grassroots and

91
00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:58.046
then getting some support-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

92
00:04:58.046 --> 00:05:01.040
&gt;&gt; From the top, and then that,
what about the opposite of that?

93
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.941
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What would you recommend or

94
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:06.043
things you've seen around
maybe the inverse of that?

95
00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:10.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
getting buy-in from subscribers, right?

96
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.756
So, I love just the idea that
the goal of your system should be,

97
00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:15.889
if you want to move through Stage 2.

98
00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.799
One of the things you gotta do is build
something people can't imagine doing their

99
00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.236
jobs without, right?

100
00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:23.885
That's the value side of it.

101
00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:29.553
So, the way you get to that is you,
gonna depend on culture again.

102
00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:32.601
So we'll touch on some of this later,
all these things kinda intersect.

103
00:05:32.601 --> 00:05:36.376
But in general, what you have to do
is engage with those subscribers.

104
00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:38.909
You need to be building
relationships with those folks,

105
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.558
you need to understand the real
problems they're facing.

106
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:44.797
I actually love the idea of just,
if you're in the Ux space,

107
00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:47.985
you've probably done some
observation of users, right?

108
00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:51.886
I think that's incredibly powerful and
really underrated and design system work.

109
00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:56.126
If you're on a systems team and
you wanna understand what

110
00:05:56.126 --> 00:06:00.554
problems you can help a user or
subscriber consumer solve.

111
00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:04.647
Get some time to just observe them doing
their job for a couple of days, right?

112
00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:09.102
You're gonna learn so much about the way
that they work, what problems they're

113
00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:13.834
facing, even just in their workflows that
you can probably address with the system.

114
00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:17.244
And that's how you're doing
the work to understand,

115
00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:20.146
what are the real
problems they're solving?

116
00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:24.290
Instead of the system being something
that actually takes more work for

117
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.543
them to use, right?

118
00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:28.895
We're also gonna spend some time
talking about adoption journeys for

119
00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:31.572
your subscribers, so
there's a couple models there.

120
00:06:31.572 --> 00:06:36.239
And so that will definitely, we're gonna
touch on three specific things about

121
00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:40.419
setting expectations a little better,
about making it easy for them,

122
00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:41.551
that kinda stuff.

123
00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:43.333
So, we're gonna get to that for

124
00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:47.832
sure, if I don't cover more specifically
what you need, just re-ask, okay?

125
00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:49.269
Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Just a comment from chat.

126
00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:51.558
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; My team has top down stage 1,

127
00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:52.774
big reads design.

128
00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:54.467
Started by an agency and

129
00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:58.790
now being pushed at the same time
as a new corporate site Leo.

130
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.846
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, it's interesting having
a third party involved too, right?

131
00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:08.251
Having somebody from the outside
coming in to do the work.

132
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:09.838
I mean, that's the work that I do,
[LAUGH] all right?

133
00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:12.976
But I'm also wary of it a little bit,

134
00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:17.348
because Design System is
something that has to be.

135
00:07:17.348 --> 00:07:21.892
It almost is like it's part of
the fabric of the organization,

136
00:07:21.892 --> 00:07:24.046
more than a product, right?

137
00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:27.871
And this is why I don't like the idea of
thinking about a system only as a product.

138
00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:32.322
I think it has to be bigger than that, it
has to sorta have roots in other parts of

139
00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:35.502
the organization,
has to be that full program inside.

140
00:07:35.502 --> 00:07:40.077
Having a third party come in to help,
I think can be good, but they have to

141
00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:44.877
take the approach of understanding
that they're collaborating with you,

142
00:07:44.877 --> 00:07:47.056
not delivering something to you.

143
00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:51.288
So if they can truly partner with you,
if they can kinda get into the weeds, and

144
00:07:51.288 --> 00:07:52.905
you can do the work together.

145
00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:56.719
It's actually a really good way
to get some outside perspective,

146
00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:59.525
maybe some experience
from other engagements.

147
00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:04.082
But to also move you faster
toward a healthy maturity, but

148
00:08:04.082 --> 00:08:09.301
they've got to understand that
they can't just walk away [LAUGH].

149
00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:12.936
Cuz that, and we're gonna talk
about one of the risks for

150
00:08:12.936 --> 00:08:17.862
really mature systems that are wholly
dependent on individual expertise and

151
00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:21.135
not taking away to systematize
that maturity too.

152
00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.649
So that's a common risk I could
say with a third party, but

153
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:29.262
hopefully that went well and you feel
good about the material they gave you.

154
00:08:29.262 --> 00:08:29.886
Okay.

155
00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:30.908
&gt;&gt; Another comment.

156
00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:31.752
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, go.

157
00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:34.569
&gt;&gt; A design system feels very personal,
like clothing.

158
00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:37.429
Someone else can't wear it and
tell you it fits, you need to wear it and

159
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.022
work with it.

160
00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:41.206
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

161
00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:44.484
I think that I love that analogy, I've
never thought quite about it in that way,

162
00:08:44.484 --> 00:08:45.266
but that's cool.

163
00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:48.955
But also there's ways to get,
custom tailor-made suits, and

164
00:08:48.955 --> 00:08:51.630
you can't really do that on your own,
right?

165
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.423
So I think that analogy may be
stretches into a way where it's,

166
00:08:55.423 --> 00:08:57.509
do I want this thing to really fit?

167
00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:02.497
I need to either do the work to have that
expertise in house to understand how to

168
00:09:02.497 --> 00:09:04.585
make it really fit what we need.

169
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:08.983
Or I need to figure out, attending events
like this or finding the communities out

170
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:13.078
there of folks who are doing this work and
willing to share their processes.

171
00:09:13.078 --> 00:09:15.390
That will help you kinda level up too, so

172
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.487
you can really lead your team in this
example into a really good fit [LAUGH]
