1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.908
So I can definitely encourage you this
concept of like starting how you want to

2
00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:08.169
end, I think is really
important in systems work.

3
00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:13.110
So what I'm suggesting here is that if
you don't model early on how you expect

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.467
to interact with your subscribers,

5
00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:19.207
it's gonna be really difficult
to change that over time.

6
00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:23.027
We kind of hinted at this a little
bit earlier, but by default,

7
00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:27.660
contributing to the system is kind of
them collaborating with you, right?

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.945
So if we take that as an example, if you
start your stage one work with just,

9
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:34.938
we're just gonna build
the thing we think you need,

10
00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:38.158
that's not a really
collaborative approach, right?

11
00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:42.067
So if you take that tack at the beginning,
when you come back to them later on and

12
00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:45.338
ask them to start contributing,
that's now you're shifting.

13
00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:47.493
You're changing the mindset from,

14
00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:51.600
you just did the work in stage one now
you want us to help, [LAUGH] right?

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.738
So we got to think a little bit about the
patterns we're establishing in terms of

16
00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:57.239
behaviors with each other.

17
00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.507
And think about what it is
that you want at the end and

18
00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:03.167
behave that way at
the beginning is one way

19
00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:07.196
to kind of make sure you're
setting yourself up well for that.

20
00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:12.180
I definitely mentioned this earlier,
but this stuff takes a lot of time.

21
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.336
I'm writing a piece now called,

22
00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:19.116
the most critical component in your
design system is time, [LAUGH] right?

23
00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:22.403
It's not the hard navigation or
the whatever footer or

24
00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:24.413
header thing, it's just time.

25
00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:27.408
You have to survive long
enough to show value.

26
00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:29.796
That's the hard part about systems work.

27
00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:34.955
So I think it's really important that
you communicate that to leadership.

28
00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:38.789
I think when they recognize that
you can make the case and say look,

29
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.924
we got to move through these stages.

30
00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:43.943
It's gonna take us time to show value,
but we'll get there.

31
00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:47.853
If they understand that going in,
they're gonna be a lot more

32
00:01:47.853 --> 00:01:51.549
receptive to the need for
more time as you grow and mature.

33
00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.379
Regarding adoption we talked
a little bit about this but,

34
00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.943
really without trustworthy adoption
metrics, you can't measure anything else.

35
00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:02.810
It's just really hard to do.

36
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.661
So I would say you've got to spend
the time to kind of break it down, and

37
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.578
I tried to cover that in each of those
deep dive sections the ways that you

38
00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.044
can go about during that.

39
00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:16.774
But once you have that, the closer you
can get to the money the safer you are.

40
00:02:16.774 --> 00:02:21.664
And I just mean like,
show how much money you're saving, right?

41
00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:23.168
You gotta get to that.

42
00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:29.036
And usually that's efficiency,
that kind of thing.

43
00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:32.691
So gotta connect it to
the dollar bills at some point.

44
00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:37.096
This is another thing I
think is really important.

45
00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:42.434
Let's just say you're hoping that your
system will get you 20% efficiency,

46
00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:44.333
just pick a number, right?

47
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:49.116
Well, that's great except that if
you're able to do the work 20%

48
00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:53.743
when you have 20% left,
you're doing it at 80% of the time.

49
00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:57.807
That 20% of gain that you're
getting is just, I guarantee you,

50
00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:00.174
gonna get piled in more stuff, right?

51
00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:02.132
Your leaders are gonna be like,
okay sweet,

52
00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:04.199
you can get more done in
the same amount of time.

53
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.219
So what I would recommend is that you
go in at the beginning with a plan for

54
00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.498
those gains, right?

55
00:03:09.498 --> 00:03:12.769
Go in saying, hey,
we're gonna be faster eventually.

56
00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.971
As we show that efficiency, we're
gonna spend more time in innovation or

57
00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:21.054
quality or whatever it is that
the organization really needs, right?

58
00:03:21.054 --> 00:03:23.390
This is another way for you to add value.

59
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.246
So you might say, let's focus in on,
we're gonna add different

60
00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:32.762
levels of quality metrics to
our work as we gain efficiency.

61
00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:36.026
And so that might mean we're adding in
kind of what you were describing earlier,

62
00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:38.286
a check for accessibility and
a check for inclusivity.

63
00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:44.359
And now we have time to do that stuff
that we just didn't make time for before.

64
00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.322
So, if you don't go in with this plan,

65
00:03:46.322 --> 00:03:49.787
I guarantee you it will get sucked
up into something else real quick.

66
00:03:49.787 --> 00:03:51.877
So, you've gotta be proactive about that.

67
00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:56.880
[LAUGH] We didn't talk a lot
about documentation sites, but

68
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.384
I'll say one of the things I've
learned is that discoverability

69
00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:07.304
is really important for
you in your dockside especially.

70
00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:10.935
Basically that's just because
if people can't find the stuff,

71
00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:12.330
they just won't use it.

72
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.551
So you gotta make space.

73
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:19.756
You've gotta make it so
that it's really easily searchable.

74
00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:24.277
It's worth it to kinda put in lots of
different information using different

75
00:04:24.277 --> 00:04:27.397
language, the stuff that
people might search for.

76
00:04:27.397 --> 00:04:28.885
So just because you call it an alert,

77
00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:30.718
somebody else might
call it something else.

78
00:04:30.718 --> 00:04:32.628
So think about all those options, right?

79
00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:35.851
And think about how you can use
that language to kind of say, hey,

80
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.676
you might also know this as X, Y, Z.

81
00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:40.680
So when people are searching for
these other things,

82
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.761
they're discovering the pieces and
parts that they need to be finding.

83
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:49.377
And this gets especially important if
you decide to shift the model of your

84
00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:54.004
system away from sort of just that one
system to rule them all, all right?

85
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:58.280
As soon as you kind of constrained
down on having a more limited core,

86
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.084
like main system and
then allowing product or

87
00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:06.270
feature groups to own their own little bit
of domain as an extension of that system.

88
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.232
Now all of a sudden,

89
00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:10.472
they may be building stuff that
could be helpful to other folks too.

90
00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:13.339
So, there needs to be a place
where that stuff lives so

91
00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:17.239
other teams can be exposed to the work
of other product or feature teams.

92
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:22.275
So discoverability becomes really
important in all of those situations.

93
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:26.078
We did talk very quickly
about this concept, but

94
00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:29.525
your system is never
gonna be in sync fully.

95
00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.671
It's just almost impossible to do it.

96
00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:35.283
So really just being really transparent
about the state of things and

97
00:05:35.283 --> 00:05:39.393
having a nice clear way to indicate the
state of everything is actually a really

98
00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:40.717
good way to handle that.

99
00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.957
Again, it's about sort of aligning their

100
00:05:43.957 --> 00:05:48.372
expectations with what they're
getting to the reality.

101
00:05:48.372 --> 00:05:53.231
And that will go a long way toward helping
build trust and that kind of thing.

102
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.041
Just a handful of resources for you.

103
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:59.962
Every year Sparkbox does a big
industry-wide Design System Survey.

104
00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:04.436
So you can see all of the past
five years at this URL, and

105
00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:10.094
if you just search Design System Survey,
you'll find that as well.

106
00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:11.513
There's some really interesting data.

107
00:06:11.513 --> 00:06:14.085
It's kind of fun to look at how
things have changed over the years.

108
00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:16.970
So I would encourage you to take
a quick look through those sites and

109
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.576
just see if there's anything that might
be helpful for you, especially if you're

110
00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:23.995
talking to leadership and you just need
some data points, that kind of thing.

111
00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:26.275
We've run some of our own
little studies as well.

112
00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:30.639
So we did one just to show to kind
of like test a theory, right?

113
00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.853
Do Design Systems actually have
an impact on our efficiency?

114
00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:38.492
So we did a quick test you can kind of
see the results of that study here again

115
00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:42.368
this is the kind of stuff that sometimes
certain leaders will value this kind of

116
00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.914
thing, certain ones won't.

117
00:06:43.914 --> 00:06:48.603
But if you have somebody you're
having a hard time convincing

118
00:06:48.603 --> 00:06:51.135
something like this might help.

119
00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:53.759
I worked with one of my
colleagues to develop,

120
00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.128
we just call it a design system calendar.

121
00:06:56.128 --> 00:06:58.933
I think as I got more into this stuff,
I started realizing, boy,

122
00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:01.391
there's just a lot of stuff
here to kind of keep track of.

123
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:04.098
There's a lot of things,
a lot of activities I should be doing.

124
00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:07.181
So what this does, it's just a really
simple calendar subscription.

125
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.290
It just adds a little thing at
the top like a day-long event.

126
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.778
So it's kind of out of the way.

127
00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:15.893
But if you are interested on a Monday, you
might get a little note that says, hey,

128
00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.771
why don't you do an interview
with a stakeholder today.

129
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:23.170
It's encouraging you to think maybe a
little bit outside of that kind of myopic

130
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.504
sort of let's just make the system better
all day long kind of focus we can find

131
00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:28.387
ourselves in.

132
00:07:28.387 --> 00:07:31.809
So you can subscribe to it here and just
have it show up wherever you calendar.

133
00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:32.399
[LAUGH] And

134
00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.976
we try to keep a pulse on what's
happening in the space around events too.

135
00:07:36.976 --> 00:07:40.126
So we'll add things like
that to the calendar too so

136
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.892
you can see those coming up.

137
00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:45.516
I did talk a little bit about
selling design systems here but

138
00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.776
I've written a lot more about that.

139
00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:50.958
You can see that on this
solace depart article here.

140
00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.879
It's just a big part
of what we have to do.

141
00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.560
We are the only sales people for
this stuff, and if you don't sell it,

142
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.661
it's not gonna get bought.

143
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:01.406
[LAUGH] So
you got to spend time doing that.

144
00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:03.390
So that might be something that's helpful.

145
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.799
There's some conversation in this
article around metrics as well.

146
00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:12.063
I've given you some ideas on things to
track for certain types of leaders.

147
00:08:12.063 --> 00:08:16.856
We also spent a bunch of time developing
a design system maturity model assessment.

148
00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:20.237
So this doesn't cost you anything,
you can just get on this thing and

149
00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:21.358
fill it out yourself.

150
00:08:21.358 --> 00:08:22.407
It's very simple.

151
00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:27.071
You answer a handful of questions and
it's sort of points you in a direction of

152
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.957
where it seems like your
maturity probably is.

153
00:08:29.957 --> 00:08:34.156
And it gives you some really good advice
based on the origin story and the maturity

154
00:08:34.156 --> 00:08:38.243
level that you kind of indicate by
answering the questions in the assessment.

155
00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:41.608
And of course we do much deeper
dives on this stuff if you want,

156
00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:43.434
a third party perspective on it.

157
00:08:43.434 --> 00:08:47.169
I just wanna say thank you so much for
spending all this time with me.

158
00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:50.379
It's wonderful to hear how some
of this stuff has impacted you or

159
00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:53.896
could possibly help you be a little
bit more successful in the future.

160
00:08:53.896 --> 00:08:57.469
I love talking about this stuff so
I would love for you to send me an email.

161
00:08:57.469 --> 00:08:59.146
This is my contact information.

162
00:08:59.146 --> 00:09:02.552
I'm on Twitter and Mastodon and
other socials as Ben Callahan.

163
00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:06.111
And I made a little forum for you if
you have feedback on this presentation,

164
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:09.671
if you have ideas, if you have stories
that don't line up with this stuff,

165
00:09:09.671 --> 00:09:10.995
I would love to hear those.

166
00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:15.382
I'm collecting lots and lots of data
still, and will continue to do so.

167
00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:16.697
But if you just wanna say hello or

168
00:09:16.697 --> 00:09:19.391
if you have something to share,
please take some time to do that.

169
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:23.508
And I just wanna lastly thank
my team at Sparkbox for

170
00:09:23.508 --> 00:09:27.739
really surrounding me in this effort for
years now.

171
00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:33.090
I'm really fortunate that I get to spend
a lot of my time doing this research and

172
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.291
just really digging in on this.

173
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:37.358
I am so
very proud to work with these folks.

174
00:09:37.358 --> 00:09:39.009
They're all delightful.

175
00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:41.530
You can see their smiling
faces on sparkbox.com.

176
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.900
[LAUGH] Thank you all so much.

177
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.991
