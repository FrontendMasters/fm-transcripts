00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.676
So thoughts on this, discussion around
culture, how it's impacting your work.

2
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.272
Do you see why I kept saying
just give me a minute?

3
00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:11.780
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's very enlightening.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.093
And the more I thought about those
quadrants, the more I realized how when I

5
00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:23.090
first started I think we were in the lower
right trying to get things done quickly.

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.970
But also at the same time wanting all of
the teams, or all of the subscribers to

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.220
have a sense of ownership which is
the collaborate, that's why it failed.

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.679
And now kind of again facing a little
bit of frustrations and, as you said,

9
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.980
swimming upstream where we're trying
to expand into other verticals.

10
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.341
So we're trying to get things done fast,
but a lot of our product owners want

11
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.904
things to be done right, so
again, conflicting quadrants.

12
00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:54.374
Yeah, certain light bulbs over here
were popping off minute by minute.

13
00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:57.866
&gt;&gt; Yeah, any other thoughts on this?

14
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.175
You got one online there?

15
00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:07.304
&gt;&gt; So if we understand, so if we
identify cultural mismatches, we don't

16
00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:13.115
necessarily need to quit our jobs, but
perhaps instead change our approach.

17
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.980
&gt;&gt; Yes, that is one way.

18
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.284
That's a great question,
that's one way to consider it.

19
00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:25.474
I mean I'm not a career coach, but
if you're in an organization that,

20
00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:30.320
I don't want you to change who you are,
I want you to be yourself.

21
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.752
So ideally, you would find an organization
where your personal values

22
00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:42.950
align with the underlying assumptions that
that organization has and sort of shares.

23
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.184
And if you can do that, that's a place
where you can probably stay for

24
00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:47.990
a long time.

25
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.838
If you can't find that,
then it's possible for you to kinda

26
00:01:51.838 --> 00:01:56.819
change your approach a little and maybe
operate on the edge of what you really,

27
00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.858
truly want personally
to find more alignment.

28
00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:03.583
But I think if I was talking
with someone as an individual,

29
00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:07.469
I might actually encourage them
to look around a little bit.

30
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.184
I actually really believe that it's
hard to work in a place where you

31
00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:16.831
don't have that alignment, so
I would probably encourage that.

32
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:18.836
But if it's a design system scenario,

33
00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.519
that's where I think there
is a lot of flexibility.

34
00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.496
And kinda the whole point with the
spectrum is to show that all the processes

35
00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:31.949
we have around design systems, they're
way more nuanced than we think they are.

36
00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:36.540
This is a simplified version of
what you're actually dealing with.

37
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.050
You have not just one organizational
culture you're interacting with, you have

38
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.821
the subculture of every single subscriber
group that you're also interacting with,

39
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:47.520
this is not simple.

40
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.463
So that means what you might need to
do is there are some tools you can use,

41
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:54.953
I can share some of that stuff,
to do some of those assessments so

42
00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:59.443
you can understand how each of these parts
of your organization want to interact.

43
00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.898
And if you do that, that gives you
the ability to say you know what,

44
00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:06.829
when we're working with this part of the
organization we know they need us to be

45
00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.484
a little bit more hierarchical,
they want us to just lay it out for them.

46
00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:15.482
And so if we take contribution as an
example, you might have a couple different

47
00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:20.422
ways that parts of your organization
can contribute, not just a single way.

48
00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:25.480
You might say for those folks who really
want that step by step process laid out,

49
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.060
you can follow this.

50
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.393
If you wanna be a little bit more
collaborative about it, that's great,

51
00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:34.071
here's another model you can follow,
reach out we'll set up some time to talk.

52
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:38.116
So I think what I'm trying to encourage
is us to get away from a black and

53
00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:42.243
white approach to this, to recognize
there's a lot more nuance to it.

54
00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:45.476
And that we have to do the work to
understand each other in order to put

55
00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:48.850
processes in place that will actually
help us mature in a healthy way.
