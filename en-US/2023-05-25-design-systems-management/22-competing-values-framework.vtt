1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.091
So the other bit of kind of rabbit hole
research landed me on another quick

2
00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.248
framework that I wanna share with you
that was developed by Kim Cameron and

3
00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:09.807
Robert Quinn in 1999.

4
00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:12.512
It's called the competing
values framework.

5
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:18.577
And in this framework, there are four
primary types of organizational culture.

6
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:21.110
And they call it competing
values because the x and

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.472
y axis are two spectrums
of competing values.

8
00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:27.269
Let's just take a look and
maybe that'll make it clear.

9
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.782
So the y axis spans from
flexible to focused,

10
00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:36.150
flexible meaning a really dynamic
culture or an adaptive cultures.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.103
These are cultures that have a willingness
to change as things shift around them,

12
00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:44.421
and focused meaning more stable or
ordered cultures.

13
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:49.005
These maybe have confidence to
stay true to their founding

14
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.003
ideals in the midst of a lot of change.

15
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.235
And then on the x-axis,

16
00:00:54.235 --> 00:01:00.198
we span from an internal orientation
to an external orientation.

17
00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:03.169
Internal means that they
make decisions based on

18
00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:05.929
factors that originate inside the company.

19
00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.682
So maybe the concerns of their employees.

20
00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:13.389
External means they make decisions
based on factors that originate outside

21
00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:14.277
the company.

22
00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:18.431
In that scenario, we're thinking about
things like the economy or the market or

23
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:20.029
technology changes, right?

24
00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:25.161
So it's about their orientation for
change.

25
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.706
Now, I'll tell you this, that most
organizations are gonna have some

26
00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:31.204
characteristics of each of these things,
okay?

27
00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:34.062
So when you take the assessment
to figure this out,

28
00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:36.984
the way you do it is you
answer all these questions and

29
00:01:36.984 --> 00:01:40.918
you give weight to different priorities
in a series of six questions.

30
00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:45.779
And each of the options in those
six scenarios correlates to one

31
00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:47.712
of these four concepts.

32
00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:51.724
And what that ends up giving you is
a diagram that kind of is like an oddly

33
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:55.192
shaped thing that kind of maps
out how much flexible internal

34
00:01:55.192 --> 00:01:59.885
orientation flexibility do you have, and
how much of this, and how much of that.

35
00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:04.338
So what we can do though, is just by
me explaining these four quadrants,

36
00:02:04.338 --> 00:02:07.339
you will probably be able
to kind of look at this.

37
00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:10.477
And say, yeah,
I think my organization lives mostly here.

38
00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:13.518
I have some suspicions already just
based on some of the questions that you

39
00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:14.213
all have asked.

40
00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:17.587
So let's talk through
these really quick and

41
00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:20.886
then you can tell me
where you think you fit.

42
00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:26.600
So the top left we're joining flexibility
with an internal orientation.

43
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.916
This is called collaborative or
a clan culture.

44
00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:35.082
This is where you've got an eye toward
long-term development, cohesion morale,

45
00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:39.085
mutual support, and the phrase here is
kind of like just doing things together.

46
00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:41.421
That's the focus, right?

47
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:47.289
That bottom left we are joining
focus with an internal orientation,

48
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.040
and this is a control or
hierarchy culture.

49
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.760
So this is where progress
is really incremental.

50
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.510
This is respect.

51
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.546
There's a respect for hierarchy and
values placed on stability and

52
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.174
predictability, and doing things right.

53
00:03:02.174 --> 00:03:05.697
And that top left, that's where
a lot of times a service company is.

54
00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.423
In fact, that's where my organization,
Sparkbox, operates.

55
00:03:08.423 --> 00:03:11.589
That's personally,
that's kind of where I live.

56
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:15.993
The bottom left is oftentimes things
like banking or healthcare or

57
00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:20.787
even like the military, organizations
where there's more risk tend to

58
00:03:20.787 --> 00:03:25.369
gravitate towards a more controlling
measured approach to things.

59
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.289
Now, this is a good point for
me to stop and

60
00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.300
say, none of these are good or bad, okay?

61
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.483
So there are healthy versions
of a hierarchy culture,

62
00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:37.885
there are unhealthy versions
of collaborative culture.

63
00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:41.212
So they're healthy versions and
unhealthy of all four of these.

64
00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:46.773
So I don't want you to associate your own
sort of, maybe baggage around the word

65
00:03:46.773 --> 00:03:51.759
control or baggage around the word
collaborate with these quadrants.

66
00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.624
Just think of them as neutral.

67
00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:55.134
They're just different.

68
00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:58.811
And then we'll talk through at some
point here in a moment the health and

69
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.214
unhealth scenarios that
can exist with each.

70
00:04:01.214 --> 00:04:02.986
That make sense?

71
00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:08.220
Okay, so in that top right, we're
looking at a flexible organization and

72
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.054
we're balancing that with
an external orientation.

73
00:04:12.054 --> 00:04:14.335
So the authors call this a creative or

74
00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:18.174
adhocracy culture where new
ideas can really break through.

75
00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:23.238
There's flexibility, creativity,
disruption, entrepreneurship

76
00:04:23.238 --> 00:04:27.812
is rewarded here and great value
is placed in doing things first.

77
00:04:27.812 --> 00:04:31.541
A lot of times this is where your startup
or scale up organization exists, okay?

78
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:35.362
They're trying to figure out,
where does my product fit?

79
00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:38.923
So, they need a lot of flexibility,
a lot of creativity, and

80
00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:42.222
they're making decisions
based on the market, right?

81
00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:45.312
Now, I had to look up the word adhocracy.

82
00:04:45.312 --> 00:04:47.190
It just means the opposite of bureaucracy.

83
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.229
So, basically, anything goes [LAUGH].

84
00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.078
So in the bottom right, we're left
with this one remaining cultural type,

85
00:04:56.078 --> 00:05:00.854
and that's where we're joining focus
with an external orientation, and

86
00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:03.528
this is a competitive or market culture.

87
00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:07.233
So they've got an eye here
towards short term performance.

88
00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:10.195
Acquisition tends to be a strategy for
growth here.

89
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:14.765
They're just buying up competitors
instead of trying to kind of beat

90
00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:16.982
them in other ways in the market.

91
00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:20.458
Individuals here are rewarded for
doing things fast, right?

92
00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:24.194
Speed is just all about this, do it fast.

93
00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:29.814
These are the companies that are again are
buying their competitors a lot of times.

94
00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:34.518
And I'll also say it's normal for
your organization as it ages and

95
00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:36.792
matures to move between these.

96
00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:42.266
So one common scenario I've seen is I talk
with folks that are in some startup and

97
00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.320
they're building a system.

98
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.520
They're up in that top right creative
scenario and then before they know it,

99
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.305
they're being pulled into competitive.

100
00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:51.736
Cuz they found their niche and
now they're trying to go out and

101
00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:53.343
just destroy the competition, right?

102
00:05:53.343 --> 00:05:58.014
So that mindset shift happens a lot
in organizations and over time they

103
00:05:58.014 --> 00:06:02.933
morph to sort of have more or less of
the characteristics of each of these.

104
00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:06.407
And my conversations with folks and
in some additional surveys and

105
00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:08.648
stuff that we've done with the industry.

106
00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:12.979
We've done a bunch of work to try and
understand kind of what's

107
00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.815
the perspective of the individuals
that are in these organizations.

108
00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:20.305
And so I've added this sort
of layer of sentiments.

109
00:06:20.305 --> 00:06:23.243
This is me kind of quoting
to you the things that I

110
00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:28.029
hear these folks say just to kind of
give you another layer of understanding.

111
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.280
So what I'd love for you to do is just,
I'll read those and I just want you to

112
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.954
think about the CEO or the president of
your company, the sort of topmost leader.

113
00:06:36.954 --> 00:06:40.932
And I want you to tell me which of these
do you think you could hear that person

114
00:06:40.932 --> 00:06:41.450
saying?

115
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.091
So could you hear them say,
we're all about our people.

116
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.563
It's all about unity and collaboration.

117
00:06:47.563 --> 00:06:52.620
Could you hear them say, we're going
to avoid risk at all costs here, right?

118
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.228
Could you hear them say, we wanna
disrupt the market, disrupt everything.

119
00:06:57.228 --> 00:07:02.761
Or could you hear them say, look,
our job is just to beat the competition.

120
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:06.992
So I would love for you to to share
with me, if you're willing to share,

121
00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:11.169
sort of where you feel your organization
as a whole fits in this model.

122
00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.150
Anybody see it obviously or?

123
00:07:16.753 --> 00:07:21.066
&gt;&gt; I feel like I'd get mixed results
depending upon which leader I'm

124
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:21.921
talking to.

125
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:22.934
&gt;&gt; Sure.

126
00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:26.426
&gt;&gt; Our CEO would definitely
say disrupt everything.

127
00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:33.076
Which I feel like has at times pushed us
into a corner that's hard to get out of.

128
00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:37.920
Those that I work with on a regular
basis are more of the people first

129
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.874
which I think we've discussed as well.

130
00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:44.532
Also kind of puts us in a little bit of a
circumstance where we're just designing in

131
00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:46.927
circles because we're trying
to cater to everyone.

132
00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:48.262
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All the time, all at once.

133
00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:48.791
&gt;&gt; Totally.

134
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:49.750
Yep.

135
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.132
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So kind of in those top two.

136
00:07:52.132 --> 00:07:54.231
&gt;&gt; Cool.

137
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:56.895
Anyone else have an easy decision here?

138
00:07:56.895 --> 00:07:58.630
Is it clear to you?

139
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.862
No.

140
00:08:00.862 --> 00:08:02.615
&gt;&gt; I think it depends on who you talk to.

141
00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:06.839
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but to answer for me from the, if
I sat down and showed this to the CEO or

142
00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:11.211
the president or the leader, the highest
level leader, what would they say?

143
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:13.060
What do they want the company to be?

144
00:08:14.237 --> 00:08:15.042
&gt;&gt; People first.

145
00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:15.791
&gt;&gt; People first.

146
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:16.913
&gt;&gt; Or avoid risk.

147
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.254
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those things,
it's on the left side.

148
00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:20.091
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

149
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.363
&gt;&gt; Probably more people first,
but some avoid risk.

150
00:08:23.363 --> 00:08:23.890
&gt;&gt; Got it.

151
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.227
Okay, that's clear.

152
00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:25.781
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

153
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:29.718
&gt;&gt; I suspect we're heavily
in the beat the competition,

154
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:33.838
sort of disrupt everything,
but more of just move fast.

155
00:08:33.838 --> 00:08:35.259
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

156
00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:38.537
That's right, I can see that.

157
00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:39.832
&gt;&gt; Probably people first.

158
00:08:39.832 --> 00:08:40.973
&gt;&gt; People first, okay.

159
00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:45.693
Yeah, with smaller teams a lot of
times that's the case, because they're

160
00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:50.354
just hey we know each other,
we're like a family, it's that kinda feel.

161
00:08:50.354 --> 00:08:55.308
Yeah, I mean, our company,
my company is definitely in that top left.

162
00:08:55.308 --> 00:09:00.138
But what's interesting, some of what you
said, I think is really interesting,

163
00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:04.198
and actually what you all said about,
it depends on who I talk to, and

164
00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:05.958
that's actually very true.

165
00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.749
And that's because culture is formed any
place where people are getting together

166
00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:11.732
consistently.

167
00:09:11.732 --> 00:09:15.204
So that means you have a culture
as an organization but

168
00:09:15.204 --> 00:09:19.215
you also have a culture as a team,
or the group of folks who read

169
00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:23.706
a book together over lunch every week,
they have a culture, right?

170
00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:28.404
The whatever cross section of all the
people who care about, I don't even know,

171
00:09:28.404 --> 00:09:32.067
how we're writing our documentation,
that group of people,

172
00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:33.740
they got their own culture.

173
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.723
Those are all subcultures of
the bigger organizational culture.

174
00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:41.058
And this is where things
get really interesting.

175
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:44.153
So that means if you've
got a design system,

176
00:09:44.153 --> 00:09:47.173
your design system has its own subculture.
