00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.336
Hello, my name is Ben Callahan.

2
00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.270
I am the founder of Sparkbox.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.909
I have been helping organizations create
a more systematic design program for

4
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.499
over a decade alongside the awesome
team I have at Sparkbox.

5
00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.440
And these days, almost every engagement
that we do at Sparkbox involves a design

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.049
system in some capacity.

7
00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:23.126
And I've spent the last five years
in particular doing a deep dive on

8
00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:26.072
research about how designs
items are maturing.

9
00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:30.200
I have organized some industry wide
surveys for the last five years.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.088
I've conducted hundreds
of formal interviews, and

11
00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:36.756
I've had thousands of conversations
with folks like yourselves.

12
00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:39.992
Today, we are not going to
write a single line of code.

13
00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:42.230
[LAUGH] We're not gonna do any design.

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.860
We're not gonna do any wireframing.

15
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.840
You will not be doing anything in Git.

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.708
Honestly, if you wanna learn how to code
a component, or how to use a token in

17
00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:54.714
Figma or something, you can find a
thousand tutorials for that stuff online.

18
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:59.051
Design system work is a little bit
different than anything else that we do.

19
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:03.151
And in the end, what we're doing is
asking everyone to change the way that

20
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:05.286
they think and the way that they work.

21
00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:09.557
So that makes it uniquely
difficult in my understanding, and

22
00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:14.825
that means there's a lot more to do
than just designing and coding a system.

23
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:19.007
That also means that the approach
that super smart folks that you

24
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.812
have probably read about, companies
like Salesforce or IBM or Shopify,

25
00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:25.918
these folks are great, right?

26
00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.353
They've done amazing work.

27
00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:32.138
But what made their systems work
are probably not going to make your

28
00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:33.169
system work.

29
00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:39.063
And so that's why I believe there
is no one way to do this stuff.

30
00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:42.480
So what I wanna do today is
share with you a way of thinking

31
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.868
about digital design that will help
you build a healthy design system.

32
00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:49.198
I wanna show you how to find your way.

33
00:01:49.198 --> 00:01:52.003
So for those of you who love an agenda,
any type A folks,

34
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.193
[LAUGH] here are the big concepts
that we're gonna cover today.

35
00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:59.116
We're gonna start with just high
level anatomy of a design system.

36
00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:00.498
What the heck is this, right?

37
00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:03.828
And what are the pieces and
parts that make up a system?

38
00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:08.163
Then I'll share with you a bunch of
interesting concepts and models for

39
00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:09.470
how systems mature.

40
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.173
This is just from the research,
from the interviews,

41
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.306
from the surveys over the last five years.

42
00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:16.428
And we'll do an overview
of that maturity model.

43
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.428
There's four stages,
we'll talk through those.

44
00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:22.248
And then I'll share with you
a concept called origin stories,

45
00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.070
which really impacts
the way systems mature.

46
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.500
After that,
I'll walk you through a framework for

47
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.583
how to mature your own system.

48
00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:34.694
And we'll kinda do a deep dive into
each of the stages of maturity, and

49
00:02:34.694 --> 00:02:39.646
I'll show you some key concepts that the
healthiest designed system teams are using

50
00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:42.524
to keep their system moving
in a good direction.

51
00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:45.782
Then I'll show you a framework for
how to maintain stability,

52
00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:49.851
because things around your system
are always gonna be changing and shifting.

53
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:50.819
And finally,

54
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.982
I'm gonna talk with you a little bit
about how the culture of an organization

55
00:02:55.982 --> 00:03:00.917
has a dramatic impact on the way that
you approach a systematic program.

56
00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:03.486
So there's a lot of
material here to cover.

57
00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:05.992
It's all very conceptual and
theoretical, and

58
00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:08.569
that's because there is
no single way to do this.

59
00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.807
So what I'm trying to do is empower
you to take these models and

60
00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:14.568
put them into practice
wherever it is that you work.

61
00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:18.367
Before we jump into all of that, I just
wanna give you my contact information.

62
00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:19.303
I love this stuff.

63
00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:23.697
I will literally talk about it with you
all day, if you're willing to hear it.

64
00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:25.132
In fact, you are going to hear it today.

65
00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.132
[LAUGH] So that's what we're doing.

66
00:03:27.132 --> 00:03:28.693
But my email is here.

67
00:03:28.693 --> 00:03:29.391
I'm on Twitter.

68
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:33.055
I'm on Mastodon, most of the social
channels, just Ben Callahan.

69
00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:35.605
And I even made this handy little form for

70
00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:38.605
you if you have feedback
on this presentation.

71
00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:43.001
If you have questions that we don't get to
during the day, or if you have ideas, or

72
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:47.203
if you have a story, or if you just wanna
say hello, or set some time up to chat,

73
00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:49.405
you can do all of that stuff at this link.

74
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:51.002
Get to connect with Ben link there.

75
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:54.477
So take some time to do that, even just
to let me know that you were here, and

76
00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:56.092
we can stay connected after this.

77
00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.420
That would be wonderful.

78
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.927
So it would be really helpful to have a
moment where I'll share a little bit of my

79
00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:05.865
context, a challenge that
I'm facing today, and

80
00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:07.940
a success that I've had recently.

81
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.173
And I'm gonna ask each of you who
are willing and able to do so

82
00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:15.375
to share something similar with the group,
just so we can kinda get a sense for

83
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.271
who's here and why you're here.

84
00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:18.214
I'll start.

85
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:23.100
I studied computer science and
graduated with that degree.

86
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.229
I actually worked as an enterprise
software engineer for

87
00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.073
about six years right out of school,
and then I decided that [LAUGH] that

88
00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:33.804
soul-crushing work was not for me,
and I started my own business.

89
00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:36.051
And I've kinda been doing
my own thing ever since.

90
00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:39.828
So that's been about about 20 years
that I've had something going.

91
00:04:39.828 --> 00:04:43.169
Now the types of businesses I've
organized are very different.

92
00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.916
I used to make short films.

93
00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:47.642
I ran audio on films.

94
00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.233
I had a recording studio for a while.

95
00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:51.514
I'm a musician, I'm a poet, I'm a writer.

96
00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:56.599
And all of those parts of my life,
the sort of love and passion of art,

97
00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.965
kinda pulled me away from enterprise
software towards digital design.

98
00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:06.077
I was trying to find a way to use that
passion that I had in the work that I was

99
00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:06.826
also doing.

100
00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:09.424
So I kind of finally found
my place as a frontend

101
00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:13.503
developer where I got to marry
the technical side, cuz I do love to code.

102
00:05:13.503 --> 00:05:15.348
I do love that part of the work.

103
00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.785
But I got to marry that
with the interface,

104
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:21.520
the work of building something
that a user would actually touch.

105
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.800
And so
that's where I really found my home.

106
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.710
One challenge that I am under, or

107
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.024
that I'm facing right now is I'm
actually under contract to write a book.

108
00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:34.561
Actually, a lot of the material that
I'll share with you today is from that.

109
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:38.911
I don't know if y'all have ever done this,
but writing something so

110
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:40.189
long is difficult.

111
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.048
It's exhausting in weird
ways I never imagined.

112
00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:46.222
There have been days when I just was done.

113
00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:51.781
[LAUGH] There have also been days where I
couldn't get any words out onto the page.

114
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:53.936
It's not simple.

115
00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:54.914
It's really hard.

116
00:05:54.914 --> 00:05:58.785
And there were days where I really
didn't think that I would finish it.

117
00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:03.453
The success, though, is the other side
of that, which is that literally Sunday

118
00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:08.276
evening, I submitted the first draft
of this thing, so over 45,000 words.

119
00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:11.473
I somehow managed to get out onto a page,
about all of this.

120
00:06:11.473 --> 00:06:13.266
And so I'm really excited about that.

121
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:17.011
It's a big stake in the ground for me.

122
00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:20.389
Of course, there's tons of editing and
all of that to do still, but

123
00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.649
it feels like momentum.
