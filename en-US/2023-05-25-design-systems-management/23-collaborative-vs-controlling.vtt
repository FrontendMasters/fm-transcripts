00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:04.405
For the past year, a lot of the interviews
that I've done have been focused on that.

2
00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:09.282
And what I've learned is that almost every
single design system subculture that

3
00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.814
I've been able to talk with, has
identified one of the left side, right?

4
00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:17.610
One of the left side,
they're internally oriented.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.747
And that's that makes sense
when you think about it, right,

6
00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:23.659
because the design system is
an internal thing, right?

7
00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.533
It's most of the time,
not always, but most of the time,

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.710
it's something we use internally, so
we make decisions here internally, right?

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.123
We're thinking about the impact that has
on our organization, not the market.

10
00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:39.834
So that means most design
systems subcultures

11
00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:43.825
are either collaborative or control.

12
00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:48.723
That first type, the designs of
the design system subcultures falls

13
00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:52.362
into that top left which
we called collaborative.

14
00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:56.898
They're also focused on the long-term
success of the system and the company.

15
00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:59.549
I hear them say things kind of like this.

16
00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.937
I believe the scope of my work cannot be
accomplished in any way other than to

17
00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:06.804
partner with teams who
have caught this vision.

18
00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:12.162
Okay, so that's kind of one mentality
that I hear from a design system lead.

19
00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:17.112
And that cross-team collaborative
perspective means the systems they build

20
00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:19.964
tend to be enabling
instead of restrictive.

21
00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:24.849
And the other type, the other primary
type of design system culture is found

22
00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:26.768
in that lower left quadrant.

23
00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:28.712
And we know they value doing things right,

24
00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:31.419
they're focused on incremental
improvements over time.

25
00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.636
And these cultures are driven by
inconsistency in their products many

26
00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:36.141
times.

27
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.991
So, here's the kind of things
that I might hear them say.

28
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:42.509
My product team's having
created consistency, so

29
00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.918
I'm here to make sure that they do,
[LAUGH] right?

30
00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:47.993
So, it's a very different perspective,
right?

31
00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:52.613
And neither of these is actually right,
neither of these is wrong,

32
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:58.220
they're just different, but there are
healthy and unhealthy versions of each.

33
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.237
So the spectrum from collaborative
to controlling along that left side,

34
00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:04.063
I've turned it on its side here.

35
00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:08.764
But that helps us understand how
these two cultural types can

36
00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:13.098
sort of identify what's
really healthy behavior, and

37
00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:18.189
at the extreme ends of this is
where we find unhealthy behaviors.

38
00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.440
So let's take a look at just a few
characteristics of design system teams,

39
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.974
and I'll show you how they fall either
into the healthy or unhealthy spectrum.

40
00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:31.498
And you can follow along with this and
imagine how is it that your system

41
00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:34.882
team is operating and
see sort of where you fit here.

42
00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:38.904
So let's start with
the idea of prioritization.

43
00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:43.768
So in other words, just like how does
your design system team make decisions

44
00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:46.815
about what to prioritize
in the system itself?

45
00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:54.717
Well, on the healthy collaborative
quadrant, what we find is that they

46
00:02:54.717 --> 00:03:00.001
are primarily basing their prioritization
on the needs of their subscribers, right?

47
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:01.780
So this is what we've
talked about with engaging.

48
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.994
They're getting to know those folks,
they're learning from them,

49
00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:08.316
and they're making decisions about
what should go into the system based

50
00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:09.958
on the needs of those subscribers.

51
00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.764
Primarily, on the controlling side,
it's more about leadership, right?

52
00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:16.443
So this is based on
the organizational needs.

53
00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:21.623
So maybe they're being told like, hey,
look, we gotta address these problems,

54
00:03:21.623 --> 00:03:24.955
so now that is filtering
into their decision making.

55
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.367
They're saying
the organization needs this,

56
00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:31.104
I'm gonna mostly make my priority
decisions based on that bigger picture

57
00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:34.737
need rather than on the needs of
individual independent subscribers.

58
00:03:34.737 --> 00:03:37.642
Now you can take either
of these things too far.

59
00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:41.406
So on the collaborative side if we go
too far, that's where you're trying

60
00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:45.725
to prioritize everybody's needs, right,
that means you're gonna serve nobody.

61
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.829
Well, it's impossible to do that.

62
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.762
And the opposite is true on
the unhealthy side of control.

63
00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:54.793
This is where you're ignoring
input from your subscribers, and

64
00:03:54.793 --> 00:03:56.612
you're also gonna serve nobody well,

65
00:03:56.612 --> 00:04:00.100
because you're essentially guessing
at what you're building, right?

66
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.755
So those two extreme ends represent
the unhealthy versions of

67
00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:08.435
a collaborative and
a controlling subculture.

68
00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.643
So let's look at another characteristic.

69
00:04:11.643 --> 00:04:12.952
Let's talk about adoption.

70
00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:17.209
We spent a lot of time talking about
how we can define adoption groups,

71
00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.270
established the adoption path,
the metrics, all of that stuff.

72
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.326
But let's think a little bit about how
do we drive adoption of a design system?

73
00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:33.147
So on the healthy collaborative side, we
see this primarily driven by relationship.

74
00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:36.270
In other words, you're getting to know the
people, the people that you want to use

75
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.303
the system, and you sit down with them,
and you may be having a cup of coffee, and

76
00:04:39.303 --> 00:04:41.603
you're just talking them through
what it's gonna be like.

77
00:04:41.603 --> 00:04:44.146
It's really like we do this together.

78
00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:47.416
On the controlling side,
it's primarily driven by incentive.

79
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:51.175
And what I mean by that is the design
system team is often talking to the bosses

80
00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:53.289
of the people that want
to use the system and

81
00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.141
they say, let's make this
part of their goals, right?

82
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:59.384
So now we say, hey,
if you want to do well as your job,

83
00:04:59.384 --> 00:05:03.732
as a product designer, you need to
be using the design system, right?

84
00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:07.283
That's top-down saying
this is incentive driven.

85
00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:10.210
Now we can take either
of these too far again.

86
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.234
So on the adoption side,
an unhealthy characteristic for

87
00:05:14.234 --> 00:05:18.998
adoption on the collaborative side
is that it's unsustainable over

88
00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:21.807
support through the adoption process.

89
00:05:21.807 --> 00:05:26.620
This is interesting,
it's like what I think I'm getting

90
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.970
at here is that you can't do it for them.

91
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.224
This is kind of the whole teach somebody
to fish versus giving them a fish or

92
00:05:35.224 --> 00:05:36.084
whatever.

93
00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:40.418
All we're trying to do here is establish
how we will interact with each other from

94
00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:41.575
this point forward.

95
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:42.871
So if you come in right away,

96
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:46.436
and you just do it for them, you're
setting their expectations for what it's

97
00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:49.853
gonna be like to work with your design
system team from that point forward.

98
00:05:49.853 --> 00:05:51.322
And that's not sustainable.

99
00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:53.893
[LAUGH] So what you need to
do is balance that, right?

100
00:05:53.893 --> 00:05:55.915
You can be driven by relationship, but

101
00:05:55.915 --> 00:05:58.555
they still have to do some
of that work themselves.

102
00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:03.142
And the opposite side, we can have
an unhealthy version of adaption

103
00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:06.208
control where it's non-support, right?

104
00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.777
So essentially, we're saying, look,
all the information you need is in the doc

105
00:06:09.777 --> 00:06:12.070
site, go figure it out,
right, also not healthy.

106
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.476
[LAUGH] So
we need to balance these things, right?

107
00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:19.443
We got to come in from those extremes to
find the healthy part of the spectrum.

108
00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:22.544
So another characteristic we could
consider is the idea of extension.

109
00:06:22.544 --> 00:06:23.583
And when I say that,

110
00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:26.898
what I mean is the system's not
gonna do everything perfectly.

111
00:06:26.898 --> 00:06:30.544
So when a subscriber gets, maybe
they're pulling in a new component and

112
00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:34.632
they recognize it actually needs to do
something a little bit beyond what you do.

113
00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:37.903
So they're gonna extend it in some way,
they're gonna make a change to the system.

114
00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:40.076
So how are they supposed to proceed?

115
00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:44.971
So on the healthy collaborative side,
there's an intentional flexibility

116
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:49.952
kinda built into the system, right,
extension of the system is encouraged.

117
00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:53.925
In fact, we've documented
how that should happen, and

118
00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:58.166
we have processes for
bringing that work back in, perhaps.

119
00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:02.733
On the healthy control side,
it's necessarily restrictive.

120
00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:05.722
In other words, extension of
the system is discouraged, right?

121
00:07:05.722 --> 00:07:09.850
So we're saying what we need
from you is to use the system.

122
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.128
If there's something you really needed to
do that it doesn't, come talk to us and

123
00:07:14.128 --> 00:07:15.190
we'll make a plan.

124
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.411
We'll create an exception for you, but
the hope is that you can use what's there.

125
00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:23.306
The very different perspectives,
both of those can be healthy, right?

126
00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:27.359
If we take the collaborative too far,
we get this extreme flexibility, right,

127
00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:31.472
where extension of the system is overused,
and teams are just pulling stuff in and

128
00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:34.648
changing it without thinking
about the implications of that.

129
00:07:34.648 --> 00:07:38.904
And on the opposite side, an extreme
restriction where it's literally just

130
00:07:38.904 --> 00:07:41.138
forbidden, you cannot do it, period.

131
00:07:41.138 --> 00:07:43.848
Figure out how to do this.

132
00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:47.361
So again,
those extreme ends are unhealthy, but

133
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:50.633
there is a healthy balance
in the center here.

134
00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:55.157
And we'll just discuss one more
characteristic which is just change

135
00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:56.097
management.

136
00:07:56.097 --> 00:08:01.497
So it's like we're asking folks to
make a lot of changes over time,

137
00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:07.576
and so how do you navigate that change
is kind of what we're getting at here.

138
00:08:07.576 --> 00:08:11.411
So on the healthy collaborative side,
if the system is primarily is adapting

139
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.659
to the workflows of your subscribers,
that can be okay, right?

140
00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:17.103
You're driving a lot of
your decisions here,

141
00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:20.551
you're primarily thinking about
the workflows that they need,

142
00:08:20.551 --> 00:08:23.697
making it simple for
them to make that shift, that change.

143
00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:24.911
On the control side,

144
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:29.032
your subscribers are being asked to
adapt to the approach of the system.

145
00:08:29.032 --> 00:08:30.609
So it's a little bit more restrictive and

146
00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.285
it's saying this is
the way we want to work.

147
00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:35.415
We're looking for
less autonomy in our product teams,

148
00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:39.887
and instead, we want to encourage more
consistency in our behaviors, right?

149
00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.494
Both of those can be healthy.

150
00:08:41.494 --> 00:08:45.409
On the extreme ends, of course,
you can have, too much accommodation for

151
00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:49.095
subscriber workflows, which leads
you to this decision paralysis.

152
00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:53.545
We can't get anything launched because
we're trying to plan for everybody here.

153
00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:59.104
I don't wanna make it hard for anyone,
it's just a really tricky situation.

154
00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:01.923
The unhealthy control is
where we just have, again,

155
00:09:01.923 --> 00:09:05.067
zero lack of accommodation for
the subscriber workflows.

156
00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:07.543
Which honestly means they
just don't wanna use it and

157
00:09:07.543 --> 00:09:10.085
it requires you to end up
reworking a lot of what you do.

158
00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:15.624
[LAUGH] So again, what we're looking for
is the balance, right?

159
00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:20.077
So the competing values framework is
nice because it gives us an overview

160
00:09:20.077 --> 00:09:24.170
of the kinds of organizational
cultures that we can expect to see.

161
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:30.137
