00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
Quick pause for
conversation around the three Es and

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.516
how you see those kind of
filtering into your work.

3
00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:09.350
Are you doing all three of those things?

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.190
If not, what are you missing?

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.161
Anybody have thoughts or ideas here?

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.495
&gt;&gt; I guess more broadly, this is probably
something we should have discussed

7
00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.777
at the very beginning, but how would
you define a design system, right?

8
00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:26.212
Because for
us it's the component library, and

9
00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:31.070
then the actual UI assets within Figma,
but then also the style guide

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.789
that's associated with how they
should be used in the real world.

11
00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.011
And those kind of three things combined
identify as our design system.

12
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.971
And for us,
especially with the educate and

13
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:48.451
the style guide associated with
an input field, for example, and

14
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:53.173
how you should be using an input field,
is where we struggle the most.

15
00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:58.155
Because there are so
many different nuanced instances of where

16
00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:02.761
it kind of abides by the rule set,
but there's this unique

17
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:07.477
circumstance where it needs to
be its own special use case.

18
00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:08.681
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

19
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:12.748
&gt;&gt; Which, I think,
once our engineering staff sees that once,

20
00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:17.129
it's just kind of a slippery slope
where it becomes much easier for

21
00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:21.685
them to shy away from the guidelines
that we've tried to establish.

22
00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:22.637
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

23
00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:29.701
&gt;&gt; So, I guess, for me, how do you take
the expertise of your product designers,

24
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:35.818
your UX designers, and try to
gracefully tell your engineers like,

25
00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:41.952
these are things that are set for
a reason and we need to abide by them?

26
00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:45.468
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's sort of
a complicated answer to this, and

27
00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:48.481
it comes into the sort of
cultural side of things,

28
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:53.182
which is how individuals interact with
each other inside the organization.

29
00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:57.435
So if you are a designer,
you've designed and

30
00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:01.913
built this input for
all these engineers to use.

31
00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.305
And you're going to them and

32
00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:07.544
saying, we finally have the tools now as
designers to work more systematically.

33
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.962
So Figma gives us the ability to do this,
a more systematic approach.

34
00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:14.228
Well, I guarantee you those developers
are gonna say we've been working

35
00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:15.872
systematically since we were born.

36
00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:20.983
[LAUGH] That's just the way
development works, right?

37
00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:23.413
If you do CSS, we come up with classes.

38
00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:25.372
That's a way to abstract a set of styles.

39
00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:28.799
That's a systems thinking approach, right?

40
00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.389
So we now have the ability
to do that in design.

41
00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.217
And so, I think the approach to somebody
like in that scenario where a designer is

42
00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:39.051
saying, here's the input you
need to use this engineers.

43
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.160
We have to go to them with
the understanding that,

44
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.044
hey, this is actually new for us, but
we know you've been doing this a while,

45
00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:50.757
and let's talk about why these
things are the way they are.

46
00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:52.967
This is also a combination of leadership.

47
00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:57.001
So if you're in a more of a top down
scenario or you've got more of a control

48
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.424
type culture, that's where it's okay for
one part of the organization to say,

49
00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:05.543
this is the process you follow,
these are the rules, follow the process.

50
00:03:05.543 --> 00:03:08.154
In a more collaborative culture,
that's not okay.

51
00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:12.238
That means we have to work together
to come up with a solution, and

52
00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:15.745
that's the right way in this culture for
us to operate.

53
00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:20.989
So I can't answer that without
knowing more about your organization.

54
00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.149
But when we get to the culture section,
like I'll ask you, where do you fit here?

55
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:29.017
And then that'll maybe help us inform
the way that we would go about addressing

56
00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:30.139
that specific issue.

57
00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.239
Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

58
00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.235
Thank you.

59
00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:34.078
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.
The last thing I asked you to

60
00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:36.786
do before was to come up with one or
two ideas for

61
00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:41.448
things that you needed to do to move your
system into the next stage of maturity.

62
00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:46.150
So what I want you to do now, this is an
exercise we go through with our clients,

63
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.569
is we go look at their backlog and
we take every single item, every story,

64
00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.167
every ticket, however they do it, and
we break it into these three things.

65
00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:58.177
And that's because everything that
you're gonna do in your system,

66
00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:00.332
there's always an educational
component to it.

67
00:04:00.332 --> 00:04:03.634
There's always an engagement component and
there's always an evolution.

68
00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:06.502
A lot of times we're only
thinking about that third column.

69
00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:08.770
So I would encourage you
just to spend a minute,

70
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.336
you don't have to necessarily
get all this done now.

71
00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:15.434
But this is an approach you can take with
your backlog to go through it and say,

72
00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:19.786
okay, we actually haven't accounted for
all the educational side of what we have

73
00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.878
to do here, so let's think
through each of these tasks and

74
00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:25.178
try to figure out who
do we need to educate.

75
00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:28.417
Who do we have to engage with to actually
make sure that what we're doing is

76
00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:29.579
the right thing, right?

77
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:32.892
So this is a helpful little
exercise you can do.

78
00:04:32.892 --> 00:04:36.958
&gt;&gt; Should we use the same colors for
all the products of the company?

79
00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.821
Or maybe it ties in with this, but-
&gt;&gt; Man,

80
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:45.877
that's like,
[LAUGH] that's a huge question.

81
00:04:45.877 --> 00:04:50.450
Actually, that's a brand question probably
more than it is a design system question.

82
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.220
I mean, there's so
many ways to tackle that.

83
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.430
I don't know that I can give
an actual answer to that.

84
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.254
Because without knowing
the intent of the products and

85
00:05:01.254 --> 00:05:05.507
the different set of audiences,
it's really hard to know.

86
00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:08.302
We've definitely built
systems that are multi-brand,

87
00:05:08.302 --> 00:05:10.648
a single organization
owning multiple brands.

88
00:05:10.648 --> 00:05:15.692
So they have this idea of kind of
brand themes associated with them,

89
00:05:15.692 --> 00:05:19.860
we usually use tokens and
a token system to enable that.

90
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.098
We've also worked with organizations
that have dozens of products all under

91
00:05:24.098 --> 00:05:25.016
the same brand.

92
00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:28.769
And so those have a very consistent or
cohesive look and feel.

93
00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:33.353
So I think it sort of depends
on the specific use case.

94
00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:37.364
That's a great question, and I would
probably encourage you to take that to

95
00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:41.375
folks at brand inside the organization and
start a relationship with them,

96
00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.340
cuz that's really the way you
get to the answer to that.
