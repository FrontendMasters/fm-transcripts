00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.358
So just to wrap up this little section,
you'll remember that my first big

2
00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:08.581
takeaway from those two consulting
engagements I described earlier,

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.965
is that there's still a lot of confusion
about design systems out there.

4
00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:16.540
One of the reasons that I tried
to develop this is because I

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.380
want this model taken all together to
offer some clarity around the pieces and

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.182
parts that make up a system.

7
00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:27.611
Most importantly, I hope it gives you
all an opportunity to think about and

8
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:31.706
talk about how you define design
systems inside your organization.

9
00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:35.524
Frankly, I don't really care much if
you choose to use my model or not,

10
00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.596
what's important is that you
define it in your context.

11
00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:42.735
If you have got people all over
the organization that have different ideas

12
00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:47.275
about this thing, you're gonna have
a really hard time wrangling them together

13
00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:48.694
to make something good.

14
00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.244
So, I would encourage you to spend
some time to actually develop your

15
00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:57.097
own definition,
develop your own language around this.

16
00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:59.754
I know at least in my consulting
practice at Sparkbox,

17
00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:03.295
we're doubling down on the education
that we're doing as part of that.

18
00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:03.988
It's just,

19
00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:08.530
we cannot make assumptions that everybody
understands these things in the same way.

20
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.722
So that's takeaway one.

21
00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.735
Takeaway number two,
you'll remember was that,

22
00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:18.298
teams aren't realizing the full benefits
of a systematic design practice.

23
00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:21.472
So, when you think about
benefits of design systems,

24
00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:24.857
there's always two concepts
that kind of rise to the top.

25
00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:28.171
The first is this idea of consistency or
cohesion.

26
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.912
And, so
let's just talk really quickly about this.

27
00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:35.336
I think the layers, the foundations,
the tokens, the core systems,

28
00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:39.186
the components, they can give
us some level of consistency.

29
00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:44.514
So simply having components for folks to
use, allows those individuals to say that,

30
00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:47.775
The buttons in my product
all look the same, right?

31
00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:51.857
So there's a level of consistency or
cohesion at that individual level.

32
00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:56.374
And having foundations, tokens in core
systems, those fundamental layers will

33
00:01:56.374 --> 00:02:00.498
allow your departments, like a larger
part of the organization, to say,

34
00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:03.650
All the digital products we offer look and
feel the same.

35
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.000
So this is like another level of cohesion
or consistency that you can achieve.

36
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.665
And these are admirable kinds of
consistency, these are the things that I

37
00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.690
think most people are trying
to achieve with their systems.

38
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.963
But I think there's actually
a deeper level of consistency

39
00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:22.361
that we can reach that only happens when
we are rooted in the established brand.

40
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.540
And in that case,
the culture of the organization is that,

41
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.063
every interaction a customer has
with us aligns with our brand.

42
00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:35.906
This connects the work that you're doing
on a digital interface with the bigger

43
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:38.158
mission and vision of your company.

44
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:42.276
It's different than consistency at
the individual and department level,

45
00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:46.650
because it speaks to interactions with
your company's audience way beyond just

46
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.272
the digital work that you do.

47
00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:52.764
And that's why I think it's cultural, it's
a recognition that you're all on the same

48
00:02:52.764 --> 00:02:57.073
team, the product folks, the marketing
people, the IT, your customer service,

49
00:02:57.073 --> 00:03:00.858
logistics, even your salespeople,
[LAUGH] all on the same team, right?

50
00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:05.157
And this is a really healthy perspective
I think for us to get back to.

51
00:03:05.157 --> 00:03:09.982
I'm not saying that having a design system
is gonna give you this automatically, but

52
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:14.270
design systems that start rooted in
the brand and build out are gonna at least

53
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.702
have a shot at achieving this
kind of cultural consistency.

54
00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.659
So, the other main benefit that folks
always talk about is efficiency, right?

55
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.334
How many of you would say design system,

56
00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:29.547
you're doing it cuz you need that
efficiency, you wanna be faster, right?

57
00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.709
This is a common thing.

58
00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.629
And, I think it's the parts of each of
these layers that really give that to us.

59
00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.306
The assets will enable an individual to
design or build a feature faster, right?

60
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:47.817
I have the things I need to be
able to do the work I wanna do.

61
00:03:47.817 --> 00:03:52.825
And I think the processes allow us to work
more efficiently with each other, right?

62
00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.275
That's gonna help us get to market faster.

63
00:03:55.275 --> 00:03:59.128
We're defining how we work as individuals,
so we don't have to guess, right?

64
00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:02.512
We know the process,
we understand how that works.

65
00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:03.882
And these, I think,

66
00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:09.148
are the primary kinds of efficiency that
most organizations are thinking about.

67
00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:14.031
But I think the documentation is actually
where we define the language that we use,

68
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:16.626
to talk about the problems we're solving.

69
00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:20.350
And when you have all three of
these parts for each layer,

70
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.550
you're giving your organization a shot
at this cultural level of efficiency,

71
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.362
which is that, we understand each other.

72
00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:31.415
I know saying that,
We understand each other, seems so simple.

73
00:04:31.415 --> 00:04:34.883
[LAUGH] On the surface, it definitely
feels that way, but it's not.

74
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:38.486
I can tell you from my own experience,
I've been in meetings where we're just

75
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:42.090
talking about some future work,
everybody thinks they're on the same page,

76
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.709
we all go off to do our own things,
and we come back a week or

77
00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:48.016
a month later to review, and
we have all gone in different directions.

78
00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.687
[LAUGH] And that is a massive source of
inefficiency inside every organization.

79
00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:56.273
And it's one that,
I don't think we track that,

80
00:04:56.273 --> 00:05:00.008
we don't pay attention to that.

81
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:04.349
But that's simply miscommunication, that
happens because we haven't established

82
00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.459
a language for communicating with each
other about the problems we're solving.

83
00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.171
That kind of miscommunication
is widespread, and

84
00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:15.634
it creates the most
damaging inefficiencies.

85
00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:20.430
I've talked with folks who've experienced
this, it's frustrating for the employees,

86
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.808
it creates animosity between departments.

87
00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:23.654
And at the root,

88
00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:27.772
it's simply because we haven't taken
the time to document the language we use.

89
00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:32.084
Now, again, designed systems are not gonna
guarantee that you reach this level of

90
00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:36.517
efficiency, but, when they're built right,
they at least give you a shot at better

91
00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:40.482
understanding each other, and
that's where real efficiency comes from.

92
00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:45.782
So, in addition to providing some
clarity about what systems are,

93
00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:50.137
[LAUGH] I hope this model makes it clear
why it's important that we do this work.

94
00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:53.798
And I hope these ideas will help you
realize a little bit more meaningful

95
00:05:53.798 --> 00:05:57.225
efficiency and more authentic
consistency in your systems work.
