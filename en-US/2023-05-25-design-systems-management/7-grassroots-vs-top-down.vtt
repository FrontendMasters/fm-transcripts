00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.974
Now, every organization has
really different experiences

2
00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:07.419
in each of these four stages.

3
00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.258
In fact, when I was first doing this
specific research is probably three years

4
00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:17.335
ago or maybe four years ago, I really did
not think I was gonna find a common model.

5
00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.855
I mean, I was I did hundreds of
interviews, I had all my notes.

6
00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:25.549
I remember vividly sitting in my dining
room with all this paper all over,

7
00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:27.756
it's kind of like pandemic days.

8
00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.682
So I was home and I had just
notes from all these meetings and

9
00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:32.546
I was just trying to make sense of it.

10
00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:37.264
And then I kind of found this one concept
which is not that huge but it just made me

11
00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:42.288
realize, there's actually a way to kind
of make these things work together.

12
00:00:42.288 --> 00:00:46.371
And that, so
I wanna shift into the next section

13
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.467
here which is a concept
called origin stories.

14
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.581
So there's two primary origin stories.

15
00:00:54.581 --> 00:01:00.232
The first is top down, that means simply
that executive leadership was involved,

16
00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:04.036
aware, and
actively supportive of the first release.

17
00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:05.961
And then the other origin story,

18
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.411
the other primary origin story
we just called grassroots.

19
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.747
And I also think about that from
the perspective of leadership,

20
00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:16.779
because individual contributors
are always involved in this work, right?

21
00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.884
So it's really about
the involvement of leadership.

22
00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:24.337
So at the grassroots origin story, that
means executive leadership was uninvolved,

23
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:26.962
unaware, or
unsupportive of that first release.

24
00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:31.438
So let's talk a little bit about
the difference between these two.

25
00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:36.860
In the top down origin story, there's
a tremendous amount of visibility, right?

26
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.396
Some leader or maybe a group of leaders
has looked at this and said, okay,

27
00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:43.826
we want this to be something that we do.

28
00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:47.941
So they are investing,
their putting money, they're putting time,

29
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.723
they're oftentimes dedicating
open positions to these roles.

30
00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:55.427
There's a formal budget, it's set
aside and there's a sanctioned team.

31
00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:59.062
They're saying, you people have this
amount of time to work on this thing.

32
00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:02.836
And a lot of times the scope
is much more broad, right?

33
00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:07.703
A leader's looking at this and saying,
the impact that I need from this system in

34
00:02:07.703 --> 00:02:10.508
order to make this
investment has to be broad.

35
00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.163
Cuz it's gonna cost a lot,
it's gonna take a lot, so

36
00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:15.172
I'm expecting a broad impact, right?

37
00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:18.611
The scope tends to be really,
really broad and not as deep and

38
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:21.116
there's a lot of pressure here to deliver.

39
00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:25.716
Oftentimes, especially in early stages, an
organization either hasn't done a design

40
00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:28.844
system before or they're on their fifth or
sixth attempt and

41
00:02:28.844 --> 00:02:31.686
they've got a bunch of
failures behind them, right?

42
00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.543
So that is normal.

43
00:02:33.543 --> 00:02:37.498
And so there's pressure here, right,
when the leadership comes in and they say,

44
00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:40.889
all right, we're gonna do it, but
we're gonna do it right this time,

45
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.206
that's a lot of pressure.

46
00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:46.331
We can contrast that with the grassroots
origin story, which of course means

47
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:50.461
there's a lot less visibility, right,
leadership's not involved here.

48
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:56.104
So this is oftentimes one or two folks who
work on a design team or on a product team

49
00:02:56.104 --> 00:03:01.937
somewhere or UX or developer and they just
are frustrated with their own process.

50
00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:06.396
And so they're trying to build something
that will help them do their job better.

51
00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:09.462
And that's actually like
a very kind of innocent,

52
00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:13.184
authentic approach to this work
that I actually really love.

53
00:03:13.184 --> 00:03:17.405
There's oftentimes an informal budget,
maybe their director or their direct

54
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:21.815
supervisor has said, yeah, it's okay you
can have a little bit of time to do this,

55
00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:23.835
but they're not thinking much of it.

56
00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.229
Sometimes these folks are doing
this in the evenings,

57
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.557
they are doing it over their lunch break,
they are coming in early, I mean,

58
00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:31.759
that's literally what
happens in a lot of cases.

59
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.500
And if there's a team at all,
it's unsanctioned,

60
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.320
maybe it's just friends of the person
who's idea was at the beginning.

61
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.013
The scope tends to be really narrow here.

62
00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:46.501
This is where I am solving problems for
my specific role, my discipline.

63
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:50.672
So if I'm a designer, that means, I'm
gonna build something that works well for

64
00:03:50.672 --> 00:03:51.886
people who do what I do.

65
00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:54.369
And then of course there's
low pressure here,

66
00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.553
it's just on their own time oftentimes.

67
00:03:56.553 --> 00:03:59.395
So there isn't somebody asking for
feedback or asking for

68
00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.766
an update, asking for scope or
budget reports, that kind of thing.

69
00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:09.264
Now, if you're working on a design system
and you're looking at these lists.

70
00:04:09.264 --> 00:04:12.560
You're probably feeling like I actually
have some of that and some of that and

71
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.648
a little bit of this and
maybe a little over here.

72
00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:17.168
Well, that's actually
quite normal as well.

73
00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:21.466
And that's because the top down and
grassroots origin stories

74
00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:25.855
are two extreme ends of a spectrum for
how a system can come to be.

75
00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:29.689
So most design systems
are gonna mature with some

76
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.502
characteristics of both of these.

77
00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:36.762
I like to think about designs
system origin stories in this way.

78
00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:41.396
So the origin stories about how the
initial version of the system came to be.

79
00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:44.700
So the differences between
a top down stage 1 and

80
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.820
a grassroots stage 1 are gonna
be very noticeable, right?

81
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.341
In the early stages you can clearly tell,
right?

82
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:56.874
But as the system matures,
the differences become more subtle.

83
00:04:56.874 --> 00:05:00.826
So that by stage 4,
the differences between a top down and

84
00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:04.870
a grassroots design system
are often indistinguishable.

85
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.427
That's the goal, right?

86
00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:10.347
What we need is a balance of
authority leadership saying,

87
00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:11.949
this is the way we work.

88
00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.710
I'm gonna fund this, I'm gonna support
the work and value at the grassroots level

89
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.803
individuals feeling, I can't do my
job without this system, right?

90
00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.700
That's the balance we need and so
that's what we're going for in stage four.

91
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.089
Now, a top down system is
gonna become more like

92
00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:32.391
a grassroots system as it matures.

93
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:39.069
And a grassroots system is going to become
more like a top down system as it matures.

94
00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:40.914
But remember these are the extreme pads.

95
00:05:40.914 --> 00:05:44.846
But there's lots of other ways through
this and I've seen quite a few.

96
00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:47.078
This is one that I hear a lot,

97
00:05:47.078 --> 00:05:52.193
where a design system starts out
with a grassroots origin story.

98
00:05:52.193 --> 00:05:56.158
And they do some really cool stuff early
on and the boss of the person doing

99
00:05:56.158 --> 00:06:00.519
the work gets wind of this and says,
my gosh, that's actually really cool.

100
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.456
I think the other maybe designers or
the other Front-Enders or

101
00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:06.513
whatever could benefit from this,
let me take that up to my boss.

102
00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:09.054
So they take it to their boss,
their boss takes it up.

103
00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:13.945
All the sudden there's like this, they
get it, right, they start to see it and

104
00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:18.036
before these teams know it they're
in stage 2 with budgets time.

105
00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:22.016
And they were just working on a side
project and all of a sudden they're being

106
00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:25.448
asked to do all this work and
take this thing to a different level.

107
00:06:25.448 --> 00:06:31.699
And so you kind of see this bump up of
support from leadership and buy in.

108
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.733
And that's totally normal.

109
00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:33.970
And there's lots of other paths, right?

110
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.579
There's no perfect way through this.

111
00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:38.634
What's important is that
point in stage 4 or stage 3,

112
00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:42.543
stage 4 area where you are more mature and
you are offering real value.

113
00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:45.397
Now, there's risky situations as well.

114
00:06:45.397 --> 00:06:49.752
So the risky situation is that
you mature without moving toward

115
00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:51.489
the other origin story.

116
00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:57.249
It's unhealthy for a system to exist
without support from both leadership and

117
00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.349
individual contributors.

118
00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:03.710
So the straight line top down
path just along the top here.

119
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.640
That means you're too focused on the
opinions and the direction of leadership,

120
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.509
don't tell your boss I told you this.

121
00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.210
[LAUGH] But this is a real thing, right?

122
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.907
In this scenario, you're gonna feel like
you're making progress on the surface.

123
00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:21.769
But the lack of engagement with individual
contributors means, it's gonna be really

124
00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:25.510
difficult for you to build something
teams want to adopt, right?

125
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.447
So, these systems struggle to get out
of stage 2, I would say most commonly.

126
00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:33.518
Because the value of the system
isn't really defined by

127
00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:35.291
the people who are gonna use it.

128
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.177
So this is trying to build a product
without talking to your users.

129
00:07:38.177 --> 00:07:42.409
You can't do that well,
right, you're guessing.

130
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:47.596
And then the straight line grassroots
path, so along the bottom here, that means

131
00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:52.799
that your system is gonna struggle to find
a valid place inside the organization.

132
00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:55.687
And that's because you
haven't done the work to

133
00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:58.794
demonstrate the value of
the system to leadership.

134
00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:02.671
Without that validation from executives,
the funding and

135
00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:07.802
team sizes needed to reach stages 3 and
4, it's gonna be difficult to find.

136
00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:12.662
And I'll tell you this, if things get
difficult financially for the business and

137
00:08:12.662 --> 00:08:17.596
you're in this straight line grassroots
maturing method, your system's gone,

138
00:08:17.596 --> 00:08:18.595
I guarantee it.

139
00:08:18.595 --> 00:08:21.830
Because it's not connected to money and
so when things get tight,

140
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.973
those people if they are kept will
get moved on to product teams.

141
00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:28.036
Can't tell you how many times I've
had conversations with folks where

142
00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:29.118
that's what happened.

143
00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:33.151
And it's sad because a lot of
times they're doing good work.
