00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:05.117
I know we covered a lot here,
so, jump in with questions or

2
00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:09.649
ideas or if you disagree or-
&gt;&gt; One thing that I did write down,

3
00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:14.629
I'm curious how long, in your opinion,
if there is any kind of correct

4
00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.946
answer to this, should you be in stage
one before you maybe change tactics?

5
00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:25.066
If you have been lagging in stage one for,
let's say a year, is that a sign of

6
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:30.428
something internally just not clicking and
you should rethink your approach?

7
00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:35.262
&gt;&gt; So sticking in stage one would
mean you've never actually released

8
00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:38.343
anything is that-
&gt;&gt; That's unfortunately kind of where

9
00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:39.178
we're sitting.

10
00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:40.660
&gt;&gt; That's okay, yeah.

11
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.641
I would say, so
usually I'm trying to think,

12
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:48.457
I remember one specific conversation
where it was a top-down scenario and

13
00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:53.443
the executives kept changing their mind
on what they wanted the system to do.

14
00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:54.521
That's what you're dealing with?

15
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:59.661
Yeah, so I think that can happen,
I think with that individual,

16
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:04.627
what I recommended they do was
actually go the opposite route.

17
00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:08.851
Which was to go talk to the subscriber
groups, and get a feel for

18
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:13.569
what the organization at the subscriber
level felt that they needed.

19
00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:18.329
And I recommended he take that stuff to
the executives and say, look, I know you

20
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.967
have ideas about this, but this is from
folks in the trenches doing the work.

21
00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:25.836
I've asked them what they need and
this is what they're telling me.

22
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:31.950
And that was a way to kind of help
them sort of hone in on something.

23
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.880
The other thing you can do is say,
let's scale back,

24
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.198
let's do less to start, let's make this
a very, very simple first version.

25
00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:42.321
And then trust that as people use it,
you're gonna learn and

26
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:46.423
just start the conversation by saying,
look, we got to iterate on this thing,

27
00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:50.340
we're never gonna get it right if we try
to do everything at once right away,

28
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.684
that's just not how software works
[LAUGH] so we have to iterate.

29
00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:57.278
So, let's get something very simple
live first, and maybe that's a way,

30
00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:00.161
I don't know if you had those
conversations already, but-

31
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:03.218
&gt;&gt; I think we're finally getting to that

32
00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:07.133
point where, for us,
I think there was a lot of,

33
00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:11.048
we've talked about this
kind of off camera, but

34
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:16.130
sense of ownership that was needed
from a lot of various teams.

35
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.364
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

36
00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:22.321
&gt;&gt; And up until this point,
very recently, we've tried to abide and

37
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:27.466
allow for that to happen, but
it's just kind of taken us in circles.

38
00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:33.370
So now we're at the point where we just
say we're going to do what we feel is best

39
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.827
and iterate as necessary, because exactly
to your point, they had the assumption.

40
00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:43.572
Myself, coming into this position,
that in a year's time,

41
00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:48.399
we could just completely overhaul the
entire application from the ground up and

42
00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.213
it would be just that simple.

43
00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:53.350
And they have since realized that that is,
of course, not the case.

44
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.311
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely not the case,
[LAUGH] yeah, okay.

45
00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.245
You got one online there?

46
00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.952
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe a little related.

47
00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:05.394
How would you unite multiple component
libraries and multiple teams for

48
00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:06.638
one design system?

49
00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:11.602
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is so good, and it's funny,
in larger organizations especially,

50
00:03:11.602 --> 00:03:16.425
I've had so many interviews where somebody
is tasked with building a system.

51
00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:20.228
And they start doing the work,
they start engaging with product teams and

52
00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:24.028
subscribers and they find out there's,
I talked to one guy who was like,

53
00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:27.483
I found 22 different design
systems inside this organization.

54
00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:31.870
And that's a lot, I'm hoping you
don't have that many [LAUGH].

55
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.225
But having more than one, having two,
three, four, five of these things,

56
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:39.256
at least the beginnings of
something is very normal.

57
00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:42.915
I mean, my default approach to this,
I'm a really collaborative person,

58
00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:46.302
I like to work with other people,
I don't see people as competitive.

59
00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:50.249
I just, let's all sit, so my approach
is get everybody in the same room or

60
00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.944
on the same call or whatever and
just lay out what are the strengths and

61
00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:55.296
weaknesses of each one.

62
00:03:55.296 --> 00:04:01.249
And see if there's a way to at least bring
the sort of conceptual approaches of

63
00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:06.391
these various systems under one
sort of common unified approach.

64
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:10.497
Now, it's also possible that having
multiple systems is the right choice,

65
00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:13.288
that could be the best thing for
that organization.

66
00:04:13.288 --> 00:04:17.287
This is where sitting here, having only
that information, there's no way for

67
00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:18.845
me to accurately answer that.

68
00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:22.624
So I think you would need to understand
what are the goals of each of

69
00:04:22.624 --> 00:04:26.835
these systems first and try to
understand are they meeting those goals?

70
00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:30.692
I think it's very reasonable to
have more than one system, so

71
00:04:30.692 --> 00:04:32.404
that could be okay, also.
